816	4933447	10.0	10.0	28344430	"My experience was excellent with Markus and Melissa, everything and more than what they advertised. It was great to be close to SPU, and to be in a safe, cozy place that felt very safe. This is a well-remodeled space with the best bathroom ever (for an Airbnb) with heated floors 24/7, plush towels, and every assessory you could want in the cabinet (Q-tips, Advil, toothpaste). The shower had good shampoo and conditioner, which is really nice for those like me who fly to Seattle with no checked bags, and therefore we can't bring but a few ounces of our own liquids. When I first arrived, Markus was very friendly and came right down when I phoned to say that I could not figure out the way to open the lock. I accidentally left my charger, and Melissa contacted me immediately to say she would mail it back. I highly recommend!

817	4933447	10.0	10.0	28654487	Amazing place! I would definitely stay there again. Beautiful Queen Anne location, $6 lyft ride to downtown. Markus and Melissa are very thoughtful and had spare toiletries for if you accidentally forget something (which was great because I forgot my tooth brush). They even included a free dinner card for their restaurant down the street, The Sitting Room, the food is amazing. Area is quiet and night and you can beat the view of the bay. Better quality than many hotels I've stayed at. Highly recommend it! 
818	4933447	10.0	10.0	29222647	The suite was a wonderful place to call home while we were visiting the Seattle area. It was clean, cozy, artsy and private. Great view, luxurious touches and thoughtful hosting provided by Markus and Melissa. Our experience was everything we could have hoped for in an airbnb - they have it down! We highly recommend this listing. 
819	4933447	10.0	10.0	29780611	Markus and Melissa were such a great host! They provided such a lovely place for a friend and I to stay. Super kind and hospitable. It was in such a nice neighborhood and they provided us with suggestions on where to go in the city.  I would highly recommend reserving their place for your next stay in the area.  I cannot wait to head back to Seattle and I give thanks to them both. 
820	4933447	10.0	10.0	30333728	The fragrance of the blooming lilacs greeted me in this neighbourhood with beautiful rock gardens. A quiet oasis, close to many attractions, a perfect location. The room was warm and tastefully decorated (loved the artwork and books). Markus and Melissa were easy to communicate with, helpful with directions, and provided many thoughtful touches to make me feel welcome (variety of teas, toiletries in the bathroom, a helpful guidebook).  This was my first air b and b experience and I don't think I will ever stay in an hotel again. Best. value. ever.
821	4933447	10.0	10.0	31240090	What a delightful space Markus and Melissa have! We stayed two nights after our lease ended and before we left for farflung adventures. Their beautiful home and kind attentions will make us smile and recall our last nights in Seattle so fondly. Especially loved watching the ferries and hummingbirds from the picture window!
822	4933447	10.0	10.0	31646302	I felt very welcomed by Markus and Melissa! The space was very large, comfortable, and such a beautiful view. They provided us with anything we needed and made sure we were taken care of as soon as we arrived! Also, the heated floors in the bathroom were awesome. 
823	4933447	10.0	10.0	31970199	Both Marcus and Melissa were wonderful hosts, we were  very comfortable in their garden and loved being so close to everything. We didn't need our car at all and could walk or get the bus to wherever we needed to go.
824	4933447	10.0	10.0	33253149	Markus & Melissa made us feel welcome by letting us arrive early to drop off our things.  They checked in with us by text to make sure we had everything we needed.  
825	4933447	10.0	10.0	33995340	So wonderful! We had an easy trip into Seattle and the location was not difficult to find. The space is very cozy and welcoming and we felt very at home. The location is IDEAL for getting anywhere in the city you would ever want to go. Very walkable, but also good by bus and we used Lyft on occasion. Great little touches, like the fridge and hot water kettle, tea and cups. The bathroom is spectacular! Very clean and I loved the extra toiletries and the fabulous shower. We did not meet Melissa but we did speak with Markus and he was very pleasant and helpful. We would certainly consider a stay at their place again! Thank you!
826	4933447	10.0	10.0	34422022	"Melissa & Markus's apartment is extremely tasteful and comfortable, it has been stylishly furnished, the bathroom is especially well designed with a walk in shower.
Melissa met us on arrival and kindly gave us all the necessary information, Markus bade us farewell, both were excellent hosts.
The Upper Queen Ann area is a safe neighbourhood with some wonderful views to the ocean. It is a 30 minute walk to the Space Needle, there are buses in the area to downtown.
We enjoyed our stay in this wonderful apartment in this beautiful city."
827	4933447	10.0	10.0	34673247	"Melissa welcomed us when we arrived since she was home and encouraged us to share their yard if we chose.  A little later, we sat for a short visit with easy conversation which made us feel comfortable in our choice of Airbnb.
We easily found the home as it was close to downtown and Bainbridge ferry.  The listing description was accurate and location of space related to main house allowed us to be as private as we wanted and included a covered parking space near its entrance.  We felt going to and fro did not disturb the hosts or neighbors."
828	4933447	10.0	10.0	35086488	"The host made me feel very welcome by keeping in touch via text during my travels and waiting up until I arrived and explained the door entry code and made sure that I had everything I needed.
The listing description was very accurate.  The garden suite is great, well furnished, clean, comfortable, quiet and has everything that you would need: tea/coffee/kettle/fridge/hairdryer/iron  - even books and games.
This listing is in a beautiful residential neighborhood that is walking distance from the Queen Anne district.
"
829	4933447	10.0	10.0	35417132	The place was absolutely fantastic. Marcus was a great host and the room was perfect for what we needed. Taking the D-Line bus into Downtown Seattle was quick and easy and even a Cab ride was only $10 if you needed to get back late at night and didn't want to track down a bus.  The room was clean and very large relative to a hotel room. I'd highly recommend it. The parking situation was also perfect. 
830	4933447	10.0	10.0	36210909	Fantastic experience! Markus was friendly and on time to greet me when I arrived, and shared great recommendations for nearby places to eat. The space is so cozy, quiet, peaceful, and immaculately clean. The bed is comfortable, and the shower is beautiful. The view of the bay in the morning is a stunning way to wake up! A perfect airbnb experience.  Markus and Melissa have my highest recommendations!
831	4933447	10.0	10.0	36705015	"This was my first booking with airbnb. What a great experience. Everything worked out perfectly; from reservation to check-out. 
I had a wonderful stay. The room was very nice and clean, and I had everything I needed - and more. 
I could not have had better hosts, either. Melissa and Markus are super friendly, and were always available to give advice and to answer the questions I had. 
This was appreciated very much as it had been my first visit to Seattle. 
I highly recommend staying with Melissa and Markus. Thank you so much for making my stay such a wonderful one. "
832	4933447	10.0	10.0	37207795	Our host came to introduce himself, which was nice, and check in to make sure all was going well for us. I felt rude that we didn't get more time to speak with Markus and Melissa, but our agenda was jam packed! Very comfortable and cozy room with great guide books, maps, and information about Seattle. Great for us since we didn't do much planning before. Great shower, clean, quiet. Nice extras to make sure the stay was smooth. (fridge, iron, fan, toiletries, etc.)
833	4933447	10.0	10.0	37875657	We can't say enough about how wonderful our experience was staying with Markus and Melissa. From the first time we booked the room they were available to answer questions and so helpful in assisting us in planning our trip. All if their tips and suggestions worked out so well. The room is the perfect size for 2 people. The bathroom is gorgeous. Art work on the walls was a great plus. It was quiet. It had a small refrigerator to put a few things in and they provided a tea pot and tea which was so nice. They were both very kind and accommodating. They were located close to a bus stop that took us to downtown easily. It was wonderful. We would return.
834	4933447	10.0	10.0	38858966	Markus and Melissa were wonderful hosts and provide the ideal airbnb experience. From the neighborhood, to the room itself, we couldn't have found a better place to stay for our first time in Seattle. 
835	4933447	10.0	10.0	39294329	Melissa greeted us personally, and made sure everything was in place for a lovely stay: we also visited their terrific cafe (tasty antipasti, good cider on tap), and they even gave us a ride home with them!  Cozy, green and private.
836	4933447	10.0	10.0	39562348	Markus and Melissa have a great space! It was all I could need or want in a rental. Based myself here for a business trip in Seattle. It was a good central location on a quiet street. The room was very private and convenient. My only regret was not having the time to meet the hosts! I will be attempting to stay here in the future.
837	4933447	10.0	10.0	41925400	Markus was very welcoming and greeted us right when we got to the gate of the house. He made sure to answer any questions we had, and he was very easy to get in touch to by text. The neighborhood was lovely and is close to many bus stops. The place itself exceeded our expectations. It is a cozy place with an amazing bathroom, and it has a separate entrance from the rest of the house for extra privacy. The wifi was also fast so another plus there! Overall, I had an amazing time staying at the Private Garden Suite, and would love to stay there the next time I'm visiting Seattle. 
838	4933447	10.0	10.0	42333935	"We enjoyed spending 2 nights in this very clean and well appointed room (with bath). Everything was as described, and there were even products provided if we had forgotten toothbrushes, etc. It was evident that the place had been recently renovated, all was in perfect condition. It was also nice to get to know the Queen Anne neighborhood, as we have not spent time there before. Good area to walk in and plenty of places to eat in the vicinity. Be sure to stop in at The Sitting Room, owned by Markus and Melissa, a good place to eat but not that close to the house.
The directions as to how to get into the room with the lock pad were accurate, and we met Markus several times later."
839	4933447	10.0	10.0	42536684	My wife and I absolutely loved our stay with Markus and Melissa! The location is amazing and the view from the large window is very nice. Their hospitality was refreshing, especially after a frustrating flight in. We truly can't say enough good things to truly do them justice, we will definitely be using Markus and Melissa again :)
840	4933447	10.0	10.0	43655870	Markus and Melissa were very accommodating. It was easy to get into the room, and it was a perfect place to stay for a few nights. 
841	4933447	10.0	10.0	44439715	Markus and Melissa's space is amazing. You'll have a tough time finding a more private space that isn't an entire home -- separate entrance, combo lock so no need for keys, beautiful bed and bathroom. We met Markus briefly as we arrived. We were late but he was still there to greet us. He gave some great tips for the area and left us to explore. One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had.
842	4933447	10.0	10.0	45087711	I enjoyed my stay very much. The host was very helpful and the accommodations were great. I do think Pike Place Chowder is over-rated, however.
843	4933447	10.0	10.0	45486071	Thank you Markus and Melissa for sharing your wonderful Queen Anne area apartment with us. We loved it. This is a private space in a convenient, comfortable area of Seattle. For one or two people this space is perfect. Markus met us in the beginning and even invited us to his restaurant/bar that he owns. We went there and tried it out. He is a gracious host. The apartment is as pictured, actually better. There is a covered car port and lovely yard. Do not hesitate to work with Markus and Melissa. Thanks again.
844	4933447	10.0	10.0	45941707	Markus and Melissa are one of the friendliest people you could meet, they were simply lovely. The place was nice, neat, cosy and overall a very comfortable experience. They were very thoughtful providing the basics, and gave us a quick tour of Seattle on the first day. Its a great location, close to bus stops and Seattle Centre. The only points would be that the bed is a little high (but still very comfortable) and also the view is a little obstructed by trees - but nonetheless still beautiful. A special note to Melissa - the garden is gorgeous,  very well kept!
845	4933447	10.0	10.0	46418801	"This was our first experience with airbnb and it exceeded our expectations.  Markus met us at the door to help with parking which was great. The room was spotless and the bathroom was beautiful!
They even had a chilled bottle of champagne waiting for us as it was our anniversary trip.  Above and beyond and so sweet!!!

My only suggestion would be to trim the hedge as to see the pretty view from the room.
It was a pleasure meeting you both!!!"
846	4933447	10.0	10.0	46574213	"My wife and I stayed 2 nights at the Neshat's Airbnb and found it to be a very nice experience. Very clean, huge shower, nice bathroom, comfortable bed. View of bay is a bit obscured by the bushes, but otherwise a nice location for us, as we waited to board a cruise ship. 
Friendly, helpful folk. This was our first Airbnb experience, and we recommend this Suite for anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, accessible place to stay at an economical price with excellent hosts. "
847	4933447	10.0	10.0	47046014	Such a pleasant experience! This space had the MOST WONDERFUL shower, and a very comfortable bed. It was decorated very nicely, had gorgeous view, and very nice hosts. I highly recommended. It was also really clean.
848	4933447	10.0	10.0	47354118	Hosts made us feel welcome immediately. The private garden was by far the best AIRBNB that we have stayed in to date. The neighbourhood was also just as described. Every possible tiny amenity was provided, indicating a great deal of thought was put into what travellers need.
849	4933447	10.0	10.0	47629139	"This was our first Air B & B experience and my first choice from the options I looked at for many reasons; the neighborhood was very quiet and safe, everything was accurately described, actually even more beautiful in person, though the pics. were quite impressive.
 Markus was waiting for us outside their home even though we were running late and was so very kind in making us feel at home in our beautiful quarters. He made sure we were able to unlock and lock the keyed mechanism to our entrance, which was important, as I'm not a technical savvy person. 
Markus availed himself to all questions we had about our stay throughout, even helping with clear shortcut directions to destinations. They provided lots of great information in a binder as you would find in any fine hotel. 
They really care for their guests and it shows, you see it in all the details, I'd call it a five star place. Perhaps that comes from running their own bistro. I'm sorry we didn't have time to use their voucher left for guests but were visiting a lot of family for a wedding and we weren't calling the shots.  
When traveling I don't usually sleep very well, but that didn't happen this time. I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort of the bed, not too firm or too soft, really great as well as the pillows. I loved that it was situated in a nook, both my husband and I had plenty of room. We couldn't have been more comfortable!
 Having a refrigator to keep a few things to eat when back at our base was definitely a plus for me as were the heated bathroom floors and spa like shower; a great selling point when looking at the pics. The lighting was excellent.
There were so many other amenities  provided which made for a first class experience, lots of thoughtful details that reflect the hosts' intentions.  
Thanks Markus & Melissa for putting all your efforts into making this a fantastic experience for us!! If we are in the Seattle area again we won't have to think twice.

850	4933447	10.0	10.0	48173481	"This place is wonderful! Upon arriving, Markus checked me in very efficiently and gave me important information on how to get around. They have basic info packet in the room. All I needed to know was there so I was all set!

Getting around is easy. The bus stop is close and the bus comes often. I got to downtown very quickly. Queen Anne is also a beautiful neighborhood! The view is awesome!

I appreciate the keypad code to enter the room, I don't have to keep a key! The shower is amazing! The bed is very comfortable. This is a very good space.

I had my own entrance to the room so I did not see Markus and Melissa much. They left me their number so if had a question, I just texted. They were in touch. On my last night, I had tea in their kitchen just to chat. I really enjoyed them! What a lovely couple!"
851	4933447	10.0	10.0	49129744	What a lovely place to stay! We loved the room. It was super clean, full of useful info about Seattle, books, and all the other amenities we needed. We only ran into Markus when checking in, but he was friendly and would've been happy to help us if we needed anything else. We'd be happy to stay here again. 
852	4933447	10.0	10.0	49466562	The place is really a luxurious hotel suite, it has everything you need and is tastefully decorated. A great location in a remarkable city with kind hosts: a great place to stay!
853	4933447	10.0	10.0	49900269	My stay with Markus and Melissa was delightful. The room was immaculate. They provided all the necessary and luxurious appointments to make a visit both comfortable and nurturing. The heated floor in the bathroom was fabulous! The view of the water from the sitting chair was beautiful. Communication was easy and prompt. Markus greeted me upon arrival and gave great recommendations/suggestions. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!
854	4933447	10.0	10.0	50096152	We loved our stay with Markus and Melissa! Markus went out of his way to make sure we had all of our questions answered and couldn't have been a better host in general. Thanks to you we had an absolutely wonderful time in Seattle. Thank you so much for a fantastic stay!
855	4933447	10.0	10.0	50495839	Very friendly hosts, lovely quiet neighbourhood with a prett view. Everything we hoped for. 
856	4933447	10.0	10.0	51061644	Markus and Melissa were lovely hosts. Markus was there to meet us when we arrived even though it was late at night. The space was perfect – lots of natural light and a gorgeous view, comfortable bed, beautiful art, a great bathroom/shower and all the amenities we needed! Markus and Melissa invited us to their cute restaurant/bar for a party where we stopped by for a drink and they gave us the most delicious chocolate mousse we've ever tasted! On our last day, they let us store our bags in their home while we were out and about. Queen Anne is not quite in the center of everything touristy which is nice. Their home is in an adorable, hilly neighborhood with a nice view of the bay. We took a ~45 minute scenic walk along the water to get to Pike Place market. This was a perfect place to stay for our first trip to Seattle and we will definitely be back.
857	4933447	10.0	10.0	51441609	The neighborhood was beautiful! Our host was very friendly and pleasant. The bed and room were super comfy.
858	4933447	10.0	10.0	51817005	Very nice people and a very nice room. A very nice stay. Very pleasant and quiet. Very comfortable. Would love to return.
859	4933447	10.0	10.0	53216408	The pictures don't do that shower justice! So big and spa-like, a real treat! We loved the spot- especially the private entrance and big window with a view of the city. A great book collection if you didn't bring anything to read! And so much cool artwork on the walls! Comfiest pillows ever! Thank you thank you!
1756	7077910	9.0	10.0	41978601	"The place was very large, neighborhood was quiet and convenient. Clean and wonderful place. Dina was extremely helpful when we needed help. 

Awesome place. Went for TI5. Would definitely stay there again. She gave us directions and was communications in answering us was too notch."
1757	7077910	9.0	10.0	42911648	"Dina was an incredible host! She goes above and beyond for her guests and has a wickedly quick response rate for questions. 

The house was so charming and spread out with more than enough room for 6 people. There is a really nice energy in the house as well! The neighborhood is great and very easy to get around. I definitely recommend it. "
1758	7077910	9.0	10.0	43707599	It was simple to get in and settle down in this cute townhouse. Dina was communicative and accommodating!
1759	7077910	9.0	10.0	46994971	Dina was great. After a last minute cancelation of another airbnb, she was able to accommodate us in her home on short notice. The place is great, along with the location. Coffee shops, the locks, restaurants all within walking distance. She was also very easy to talk to and quick to respond to my questions.
1760	7077910	9.0	10.0	48745073	Dina was a wonderful host. We were in Seattle for a golf trip and she gave us excellent recommendations for golf, places to eat in Ballard, etc. The location is fantastic near the locks (a must-see) and restaurants. 
1761	7077910	9.0	10.0	49899675	The house was in perfect condition when we arrived, and the host provided the information about the home in an e-mail and in person.  There were many goodies in the fridge.  We loved the location because it was convenient to my son, and we could walk to the Locks and the downtown area of Ballard.  The neighborhood was wonderful.
1762	7077910	9.0	10.0	52096802	"Dina was very helpful to us even prior to our arrival. She was cooperative and willing to permit an earlier arrival time. Although we didn't end up needing the early check-in, she was very flexible and responsive to our request. Dina checked in with us a few times during our two week stay and was responsive to our questions throughout our visit.

Overall, we were happy staying at the Ballard townhouse. The location is fabulous. We were a short walk to the library and a variety of restaurants and shops. The locks and botanical garden are also a short walk away. The year-round farmer's market is fabulous. Be sure to get the doughnuts! They are the best. The location couldn't be better to access all of the fun of Ballard. 

While we were generally content with our stay, we were intially taken aback by the state of the townhouse. While it was obviously cleaned for us (baths and kitchen tidy, floors swept and vaccuumed, beds freshly made, fresh towels placed in all baths) , it looked a little ""worn"". The walls were banged up (many marks, patched but not painted in a variety of spots) and the carpet had many stains. There was only one picture hanging in the whole house with a number of empty picture hooks throughout. The house generally has the feeling that someone lived there but moved out and left a bunch of stuff behind.

There were several issues with the master bedroom. While there is an overhead ceiling fan and light, the light was not functional. There was a post-it with instructions for the overhead light but at the bottom of the note it said the light may not work so just use the lamps instead. There were two small lamps for lighting but only one lamp worked. Fortunately, the closet light worked. Another issue with the master bedroom is that one of the closet doors had fallen off and was standing in the closet. As this was a safety concern for our two-year old, we had to move the closet door to another safer location. The dressers in both bedrooms were generally not usable. The drawers were either stuck or without bottoms all together. The master closet had nice shelving that we could use and there were some hangers in the closet.

The kitchen generally had all that we needed with some searching. The kitchen cabinets were full which made it challenging for us since we were staying for two weeks and had brought a few things for our temporary home. We were able to rearrange the cupboards a bit to make space for our items. There was a vareity of items for cooking such as oil and salt and pepper which was very helpful. We were very pleased to have a washer and dryer to use.

While the Ballard townhome is in a great location, has a lovely host,  and easily accomodates a large group/family, aesthetically it could use some TLC.

1763	7077910	9.0	10.0	52971722	Dina's house was a great find for our trip! It truly felt like staying with family. The location was wonderful - being able to walk to restaurants and bars around the house was such a treat! Dina was incredibly responsive to any question that came up. We truly appreciate all the accommodations for our stay!
1764	7077910	9.0	10.0	55193951	Had a lovely time staying with my family at the townhouse. It was very nice and clean and was fully furnished with everything we needed to for the week we were there. We were even able to cook thanksgiving dinner without any issue! The location and just overall functionality of the townhouse was great, and I would definitely look forward to another opportunity to stay here. Thanks so much for letting us use your home!

4622	6823781	10.0	10.0	35988053	Great space in a great part of the city. Only stayed two nights, but would have been comfortable here for a long stay. The space has everything you need, gets lots of great light and is very quiet. 
4623	6823781	10.0	10.0	36609653	Apartment was great and just as described.  Host was very welcoming upon our check-in and then left us to explore.  The extra touches left in the apartment were a plus (pillows, blankets and chocolates). The neighborhood eateries are wonderful and the trip to downtown Seattle a quick ride away.  
4624	6823781	10.0	10.0	37598478	This apartment was wonderful. It's in a quiet, nice neighborhood and is well-equipped with everything we needed. Thanks for the hospitality, Lisa!
4625	6823781	10.0	10.0	38168622	Lisa was a wonderful host. Check in was easy, check out was smooth.  We had a wonderful stay her private apartment.  Perfectly located for easy access to Fremont and Ballard, we really enjoyed our trip to Seattle.

4627	6823781	10.0	10.0	38631977	Nice,  clean, safe neighborhood,  and affordable for a short visit.  Basement apartment below Lisa's house with its own entrance and spacious. Very short commute to center city.
4628	6823781	10.0	10.0	39192154	Cute, clean apartment! It looked exactly like the photos.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends.
4629	6823781	10.0	10.0	39682821	Lisa was a lovely host. Traffic delayed our arrival, and she was more than accommodating.  We were house-hunting in Seattle, and her place was a perfect basecamp for running around the city. 
4630	6823781	10.0	10.0	40116755	This private apartment was perfect for my small family.  We were on a family vacation and needed something close to the city but quite enough to relax after our long days of exploring.  Lisa was welcoming and then left us to our privacy.

4631	6823781	10.0	10.0	40625868	The apartment is on a quiet street near a couple of very interesting neighbourhoods, and is also near bus lines going into downtown Seattle.  My friends and I found it to be a good home base for a short trip.

It was bright and pleasant and very comfortable. Sleeping was very comfortable. Fresh nice towels and linen were (website hidden) area was nicely appointed if you wanted to prepare meals. 

The host was responsive to questions by email and text. 

We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if we are in the area. "
4633	6823781	10.0	10.0	41437223	The apartment was fantastic, exactly as described. A much larger space than I was expecting. With a comfy r table bed and nice living room. Lisa was extremely nice and helpful. Loved the neighborhood. Can't uldnt recommend this highly enough.
4634	6823781	10.0	10.0	41967093	Very well represented by photos and descriptions. Quiet neighborhood & convenient location. Clean & well kept despite basement feeling entrance.
4635	6823781	10.0	10.0	42593566	"Lisa's apartment worked out perfectly for me on a trip to Seattle for work. I was attending a conference at the Convention Center downtown and, while Lisa's apartment is not within easy walking distance, there are several buses that can get to within a few blocks of the Convention Center or the apartment easily and efficiently. The apartment and neighborhood are quiet and homey after a busy day downtown.

There are a number of good places to eat near the apartment as well. The apartment has a full kitchen, but I only used the coffeemaker to brew up some excellent coffee from Seattle Coffee Works near Pike Place market. Just a note, the one thing fairly standard thing I did not see in the kitchen was a microwave oven.

Wifi worked well and my cell phone reception was good, so it is easy to communicate while staying at the apartment. Lisa and I communicated mostly by text, but she did show me around the apartment when I arrived. She seems to be pretty available upstairs in the main house, if needed.

All in all, I thought this apartment was a very good value and I would definitely stay here again on another trip to Seattle."
4636	6823781	10.0	10.0	42935139	A great location from which to explore greater Seattle. This basement unit provided us with everything that we needed, with notable privacy and cleanliness.
4637	6823781	10.0	10.0	43628735	Lisa was very accommodating and very responsive throughout the process. Her place is fantastic and the pictures are very accurate. The place has everything anyone would need!
4638	6823781	10.0	10.0	44141828	"The neighborhood is extremely quiet and just minutes from downtown. The ADU was warm, inviting and accessed pretty easily by going through Lisa's yard.

Lisa is responsive and was kind enough to text me a few hours before our arrival notifying us that she's running a bit late. It's the little things that count.

The unit was spotless and if you're going through Seattle, I'd recommend the apartment again."
4639	6823781	10.0	10.0	44434581	Lisa was a great host and responded quickly to any questions I had. The space is in a great location, easy to walk to both Ballard and Fremont. The apartment is very well decorated, has lots of light and comfortable to relax in. Great place to stay.

4641	6823781	10.0	10.0	45267512	Stayed a weekend in Seattle for my boyfriend's birthday and felt right at home here after spending all day exploring the city. Extremely clean and comfortable. She even had coffee in our kitchen for us! So convenient from downtown as well. Couldn't have asked for a better stay for our first time in Seattle.
4642	6823781	10.0	10.0	47982084	Our experience staying at Lisa's house was great.  Our train to Seattle was delayed by 4 hours which put us in town at 1AM.  Lisa gave clear instructions how to access the unit and get settled in.  There was an issue with accessing Wi-Fi which Lisa addressed promptly.  
4643	6823781	10.0	10.0	49788104	"Lisa was very helpful, and went above and beyond to help us have a good stay. (Including picking up flowers for our stay!) The location was great, with bus stops and shops within walking distance. 

The room itself was very clean and attractively furnished. However, the main bed sagged a bit in the middle, and the sofa made a great place to sit, but it was a bit too hard and small when converted to a second bed. Overall we had a great experience, and it's a good place to explore Fremont."
4644	6823781	10.0	10.0	49997632	Loved the funky neighborhood and Lisa made checking in and out easy. 
4645	6823781	10.0	10.0	50664987	Lisa's place was very spacious, and in a perfect quiet neighborhood that was only a mile from the best of Ballard AND Freemont. Easily the best location possible, and super convenient if you rent a car to see some wilderness outside the city and need a place that's friendly to park it. She was even great at quickly sending us some items we forgetfully left behind!
4646	6823781	10.0	10.0	52084814	A nice, clean and comfortable apartment in a good location. It's on a quiet street with easy parking available. Also,  it is very easy to bike to locations in Fremont or Ballard from the apartment.

The place itself was quiet, secluded, and neat. I couldn't have asked for a simpler stay, and Lisa was perfect in communicating everything I needed to know! Would definitely stay at again, and wished my time in Seattle was longer!"
4648	6823781	10.0	10.0	54286645	Lisa's place was awesome and the perfect place to crash after a day of exploring Seattle. Very chill neighborhood and parking was a breeze.

Parking on the street was always available (which is important in Seattle).  We were close to major streets without having to be stuck in traffic.  It was just right for what we needed.  We even managed to prepare a Thanksgiving meal for our daughter in the kitchen.  

We didn't meet our host in person, but she was always available via text and responded to us right away.  Very nice!"
9441	3971137	10.0	10.0	23081064	Marni provided a quiet cozy place for my girlfriend and I.  We had fun listening to the record player and the chance to make a full breakfast! Highly recommended!

We didn't get to meet her in person, but the place was prepped and ready for our arrival, and check-in was smooth. It was so nice to have a parking spot right out front when we came back from our city explorations during the day. The studio itself is well laid-out, cozy, and the decor is made up of stylish vintage curios, books, and flourishing plant life. We loved it!

Thanks for everything, Marni. :)"
9445	3971137	10.0	10.0	24601012	Marni was an outstanding host! She was extremely friendly and communicated effectively before and during my trip regarding logistics. Studio was cozier and more charming than described, very well-situated near Wallingford stores, and also very clean and super cozy. I'd highly recommend staying at Marni's studio. 
9619	8418650	10.0	10.0	51167696	"We rented this duplex for my parents visiting from out of town:

My wife and I came to Seattle to visit our kids and the unique character of Washington along with the extended beauty of Canada. At the end of our little trip our kids arranged our last couple of nights at Susan Matthews newly renovated condo. upon arriving you couldn't really see from the front the amount of effort and cost of the many features and amenities that filled this custom duplex. Susan has just about thought of everything, even right down to the phone charger on the back of the alarm clock in the master bedroom. We were the first renters so it was nice to be in a freshly put together place. The large living room windows enjoyed a very spacious, private patio with conformable seating, nicely manicured landscape with a few squirrels going about their business. There was every comfortable feature incorporated into the bathroom with an outstanding shower that had a custom ventilation system that totally kept this room from fogging and misting the walls and mirror. The bathroom and all other rooms had it's own thermostat and heater which allowed for a very comfortable stay. We would come back if it was available and highly recommend it to anyone considering a visit to Seattle.

Very comfortable with a nice backyard and well equipped kitchen (really appreciated there was coffee the first morning).  We were in town for a show and the location has easy, near-by, bus access to downtown Seattle.  Not having to drive into Seattle was a real plus for us.  We will be back.
9622	8418650	10.0	10.0	52981614	"Susan provided a lovely 2-bedroom apartment/duplex -- very light and sunny living/kitchen area looking out on a private backyard.  Newly remodeled kitchen and bathroom.  She provided plenty of dishes and lines, as well as enough coffee and basics to keep you going until you can get to a store.  Also, for those with active inclinations, is a bike stand and weight bench.

The location is near Wallingford Ave -- which is close to UW, I-5, Gasworks Park, and just a lovely neighborhood all around.

A very comfortable, welcoming home.  I would return again, should the chance present itself!"
9623	8418650	10.0	10.0	54110379	Susan's duplex was a wonderful place to stay for a weekend exploring in Seatte!

Would definitely stay again. Thanks Susan!
9624	8418650	10.0	10.0	54799380	Susan was amazing!  We stayed in Fremont due to family in the area and you will quickly not that there really Aren't any hotels in Fremont AND they charge 50 bucks a day for parking!  Considering this was our very first Airbnb experience; Susan went out of her way to ensure a good experience.  The home is exactly as advertised and very comfortable.  Dedicated parking is nice and you are so close to many amazing Seattle landmarks (Fremont Troll).
9625	8418650	10.0	10.0	55114047	"Firstly, the description was as advertised.  We were here to celebrate Thanksgiving with our daughter and attend the Apple Cup.

The unit was very nice with everything in the kitchen to cook a TG feast, which we did.  
Susan was very responsive and accommodating.  In short, we would definitely recommend to friends and family."

9627	8418650	10.0	10.0	56205533	My wife and I stayed at Susan's duplex during one of the heaviest rainstorms this Northwesterner has ever seen but the place was so comfortable and light that it was a pleasure being there. The furnishings were very comfortable especially the bed which made it even more relaxing to stay. We had our three adult children over every night to visit and it never felt crowded. We will definitely be back!
9628	8418650	10.0	10.0	56374936	Great neighborhood, and well maintained unit.  Susan always responded promptly.  Would definitely stay here again.
9629	8418650	10.0	10.0	57150516	Susan is very helpful and welcoming.  This is best stocked apartment we've ever rented, and we've rented many apartments in the US and Europe. The location is excellent. The neighborhood has many restaurants and shops, but the apartment is on a quiet street. Next time we're in Seattle we'll check this apartment first. 
9630	8418650	10.0	10.0	57759536	The place was a pleasant surprise because it was even more open and comfortable than the photos depicted! The place was so cozy and welcoming! I rented this place for my family over the holidays, and we used it as the family holiday hub to gather. In other words, we spent a lot of time living in the space, using the kitchen, and hanging out. The place was PERFECT for our family holiday! Susan was also very quick to respond to our questions.

Especially enjoyed talking about tech stuff with people who have different background. The house weekly party is also very very fun! I also gave a talk during my stay, which is really interesting. It's really a nice experience and I actually invite one of my friends to stay at the same place. Finally, I want to thank the house manager, Paul, who is a great and smart guy! Really enjoyed talking with you and your insightful opinion really impressed me! See you later, Paul! I highly recommend this place, especially people who like technology and willing to share you mind with others! This is definitely the best choice!

The area is so easy - close to i5 and just a short drive to downtown Seattle. Nick was amazing to coordinate with throughout the whole trip, he even left a little care package for us.

12283	261912	10.0	10.0	1341074	We loved this charming house in a great neighborhood. The master bedroom was very comfortable and quiet with dark curtains, plenty of storage and a comfy bed, and the whole house was clean and modern, including a spotless renovated bathroom. Yet it still had the old touches of a classic, classy house that we love. Parking was not a problem - there was always a spot directly in front of the house. Natalie was communicative and helpful, and put us at ease, even though we had along a toddler. We would definitely stay here again. Handy hint: Zeeks has great pizza and they delivered to us in under 30 minutes, after ordering online.

12287	261912	10.0	10.0	1663793	We had a great time in the Greenlake area and very much enjoyed the Storybook Tudor house.  Our son and his family were just a few blocks away so we were able to spend most of our time with them.  We went to the Market and had lunch at Lowells, just a 20 minute bus ride away.  We went to the zoo which is not all that far from the house where we stayed.  We especailly enjoyed having the lake so close!  It was a treat to walk early in the morning and just people watch.  We would recommend this house for anyone going to Seattle and wanting to enjoy a bit of the city in a semi-residental area.

12293	261912	10.0	10.0	2154147	"The setting for Storybook Tudor couldn't be better with the house just around the corner from the lake.  During our stay, the weather was perfect and we were able to walk around the lake one day - no problem.
It should be noted that the house is on a busy street (though at night with the bedrooms at the back I hardly noticed) so if someone were sensitive to street traffic they need to be aware of this fact.
The kitchen was fully equipped and we found everything we needed.
We also found a wonderful alternative market just up the street.
The master bed was comfy and the bathroom nicely renovated. 
Check-in was easy and when I had a question late at night, Natalie got back to me right away.  Thanks for hosting us.

Loved being able to walk around the lake and watching the activity on the lake.  The house was perfect for the two of us.  Washer and dryer were a great help.  We certainly would consider staying at Natalie and Beau's house on our next visit to Washington to visit our son.  The restaurants, grocery store and coffee shops were within walking distance.

12296	261912	10.0	10.0	5577472	This is a wonderful place in a fantastic location just steps from Green Lake. I absolutely loved the location, layout and decoration. For groups of six that need a little privacy it may be a little tight but for families of six with children or two couples with two children it would be absolutely perfect. I did not meet Natalie myself as she was out of the country but all of my interactions with her where very positive, and the check-in and check-out were a breeze. 
12297	261912	10.0	10.0	5860909	"We stayed at the Storybook Tudor for two weeks with our three children.  We absolutely loved the location.  The home feels like it is practically across the street from Green Lake.  We spent many afternoons at the wading pool in the park (really couldn't be closer), and enjoyed the pizza, ice cream, and chocolate shops greatly.

The home itself was charming, clean, and comfortable, and the check-in process was easy.  We had no need to contact Natalie during our stay, as the notes she left answered all our questions.  All in all, this was a great home base for us, and we'd love to come back someday.  It is worth mentioning that it is an older home with an apartment below, so it was important to keep the kids quiet, especially their little feet!  While I would recommend this home to any family, it might be easiest for families with older children.   "

16261	565703	9.0	10.0	3941883	My mother and I had a wonderful stay at Ron's apartment. The space is roomy enough for 3 yet has a cozy feel and is light and airy and beautifully decorated--loved all the citrus colors! The kitchen is well-stocked, the heat is easily adjustable in all rooms, and parking is easy. If the weather had been warmer, we would have used the little deck right off our living room! We were able to access Ron's wifi and watch a movie on our computer during our stay. The location is easily accessible to many sightseeing places in Seattle. We hope to come back again!
16262	565703	9.0	10.0	3956405	"My wife, my friend and I had a lovely stay at Ron's place.  It was cozy, nicely decorated, and well furnished.  The kitchen was well equipped, and there was an abundance of spare towels, etc.  Suffice it to say, the price was more than fair.
Although we were late for our check-in, Ron was a gracious and accommodating host.  If I should ever need a place to stay in Seattle again, I would love to come back."
16263	565703	9.0	10.0	4013560	"Staying at the Garden Apartment was awesome. Ron is an excellent host who was very accommodating and helpful about local information. The apartment was beautiful and well-maintained with a great outdoor deck. Location was very close to Seattle, public transit to downtown was easy, but my girlfriend and I chose to walk to the city and surrounding areas everyday. Couldn't beat the experience, I would recommend it to anyone.

16264	565703	9.0	10.0	4392007	A comfortable little apartment in a nice neighborhood. We stayed for a whole month, and could have stayed for another if we had planned ahead a little better. The hosts are great people, too.
16265	565703	9.0	10.0	4496561	Ron was a wonderful host!! The apartment was exactly as shown. The neighborhood is quiet and only about 10 minutes from all of the downtown Seattle attractions. My husband & I will definitely try to stay there again the next time we go to Seattle. 
16266	565703	9.0	10.0	4668299	Ron was communicative and very nice. He came to introduce himself and give us instructions on how to use his radio. The garden apartment is very cute, well maintained, and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!
16267	565703	9.0	10.0	4808333	I had a great week long stay with Ron. He and his partner were so welcoming. One of the more magical things occurred when I first walked into the apartment, Ron had orchestral music playing. While it may sound cheesy, it certainly set the mood for a pleasant stay. Ron had everything I needed for my stay in Seattle. A fully supplied kitchen made it easy for me to make meals at home, saving me some money. In addition, Ron checked in on occasion via text to make sure I had everything I needed and was able to navigate the city okay. Ron's place (and service) was great, I would definitely stay again if I needed to.
16268	565703	9.0	10.0	4866822	Ron is an excellent and accommodating host. Location is superb and the apartment was nicely furnished. This will be the first place I look for the next time I am in Seattle.
16269	565703	9.0	10.0	4875788	"This apartment is charming, clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location for exploring downtown Seattle, the university, and the botanical gardens. Adjacent to the living area is a quaint patio with garden beyond, a perfect spot for taking an early breakfast. 

Ron is a gracious and attentive host. We were traveling with a small child and he went out of his way to make the home as safe as possible before our arrival. 

We hope to find our way back to Seattle, and would be happy to stay here once again. Thank you, Ron."
16270	565703	9.0	10.0	5011306	"We found Ron's garden apartment, though small, quite comfortable, with all the necessary amenities, especially as regards the kitchen pluses.  Ron has many spices and herbs which can be used by guests to make meals more appetizing and also provides staples (such as olive oil) for the cook.    Besides that, washer and dryer as well as iron and ironing board are provided, and a dishwasher makes cleanup simple. 

Ron is a very amiable host,  and responds to guests' requests, even when they have little to do with the hospitality he provides.  I was looking for a thistle (in the wild) but had not found one, and I mentioned it to Ron; the next day he presented us with a plant (an artichoke) which is a member of the thistle family!   There is a private little deck reached by sliding door in the living room; when     
it is not raining, this is a delightful spot to retire to for a cup of coffee or a meal served on the picnic table.  It overlooks one of Ron's gardens and is charming. 

This is a very pleasant place for a couple to stay, with an extra room with twin bed for a third person.   We would recommend it to anyone who can do without television for a while.

16271	565703	9.0	10.0	5059245	Ron's place was perfect or us.  The first thing we noticed upon arrival was the sizable deck and garden - per the title of the place. It is very private and solely for our use. We took advantage of the long days and the garden furniture with a leisurely sunset dinner outside.The other thing I noticed was the original artwork throughout the place. The paintings were paired with the rooms and colors creating a lively atmosphere. I also appreciated the 2nd BR which allowed me to sleep in a little longer while the kids played. Check in, parking, and loading were easy. Ron gave us tips on the neighborhood and we discovered the Japanese Garden in the nearby Arboretum and Madison Beach park down the road. Plenty of good restaurants, cafes, an bars in walking distance. The locale is near Capital Hill with easy access to fun urban options, but the house is also just far enough from the action to be a respite in the city. 
16272	565703	9.0	10.0	5131366	Ron was very nice and considerate. And the neighborhood was with great environment and very convenient to facilities.
16273	565703	9.0	10.0	5169789	Ron was very kind and welcoming. The apartment is spacious and comforting. Good location with public transportation nearby.
16274	565703	9.0	10.0	6776884	We spent a lovely summer in this apartment. Great, quiet location and easy access to public transit.
16275	565703	9.0	10.0	6881550	Amazing, above the call of duty hospitality! The location is great and was able to accommodate our family of 4 comfortably. Would stay again anytime. 
16276	565703	9.0	10.0	6942925	Nice quiet neighbourhood, easy street parking and spacious accommodations. Kitchen was well stocked with all you would need to cook. Groceries stores including Trader Joes a quick drive away. Hosts were very accommodating. Beds were a bit soft for my liking but all in all a great spot to crash for the price.
16277	565703	9.0	10.0	7013040	"This was the perfect place for my daughter and I over Labor day weekend to explore Seattle.  Everything was great.  Mike was always available by phone and met us when we arrived.  He was a gracious host and even carried our bags in for us! The apartment is nicely decorated, the bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was well equipped.  We had our evening cocktail out on the sunny deck. The place is very clean and inviting.  We loved the neighborhood.  Ron gave us several ideas for dinner.  We walked to Harvest Vine and had a wonderful evening.  Street parking is safe and convenient.
My daughter and I can't wait for another stay here when we visit Seattle."
16278	565703	9.0	10.0	7072555	"Mike(? sorry!) greeted us kindly and was very thorough in showing us the apt. The garden apt had everything we needed at a very reasonable price... bed, bathroom, kitchen and it was clean & tidy. No television, but that was fine because there was WiFi.Though there was only the two of us staying for the night, it was enough room & convenient location for my family to meet up and relax before their flight out of the city that afternoon. (We were all in Seattle for a wedding and my partner I were staying extra days to explore the city.) Having a little private garden patio made it easy to enjoy the lovely weather (when it was lovely :). Also having a washer/dryer was convenient for drying our travel towels before packing to leave.

We ate a several of the very close local businesses during our stay. A satisfying yogurt/granola breakfasts at the Essential Baking company (around the corner), happy hour early dinner at Jae's Asian Bistro (around the corner), desserts at Belle Epicurean(15 minute stroll), beers at The Attic and a lovely but tad bit pricey dinner at Harvest Vine (around the corner). "
16279	565703	9.0	10.0	7140281	It's a nice apartment in a desirable neighborhood. Would definitely stay there again.
16280	565703	9.0	10.0	7254489	The Garden Apartment is well equipped for cooking and in a central location as well as a fun neighborhood. Ron is a nice host.
16281	565703	9.0	10.0	7319474	"Ron was really great and accommodating during our two day stay.  The space was accurate to his description and very comfortable.  Great value considering its location and generous space.  Great bakeries/restaurants/shops just around the corner.  Private garden courtyard was a massive bonus!  The queen bed is quite soft, but we slept very comfortably.

Would look forward to staying again in the future!"
16282	565703	9.0	10.0	7410381	"Ron was a very hospitable and gentle host. This apartment is located beneath his own, so if any problem occurred, we knew we could easily reach him. This proved to be convenient when we interrupted the internet connection due to our own fault. Ron was downstairs only minutes later to fix the problem.

The apartment is large enough to accommodate four people. Everything was clean when we arrived there. The place is in a quiet neighborhood, but is easily reached by bus, as there are 2 high-frequency bus lines just around the corner on Madison that only take 15 minutes to take you downtown, and even less to get you to Capitol Hill. Washington Park is also really close by, providing a good opportunity for jogging - something that seemed pretty scarce throughout the city.

Having a washer and dryer in the apartment was a big plus to us, as we were on a long road trip.

If we missed anything in this apartment during our stay, it would have been some extra kitchen utensils and a table and chairs to accommodate four people. I would have made it a bit easier to enjoy the use of the otherwise very inviting and practical kitchen."
16283	565703	9.0	10.0	7551322	Thanks Ron for your wonderful hospitality! The location was close to public transportation and nearby the arboretum. 
16284	565703	9.0	10.0	7616237	Ron was a kind host. Me and my brothers only stayed for 2 nights, but found it to be a perfect location to get into downtown Seattle (a little less than half an hour). Clean and spacious enough for 4.
16285	565703	9.0	10.0	7656209	"We had a good time in a beautiful, full equipped garden appartment. Ron is a very friendly and helpful host. It is a good place to stay to visit Seattle. 
"
16286	565703	9.0	10.0	7799088	"Our stay at Ron's Garden Apartment was just plain wonderful! Everything was as described, clean, comfortable and with a garden - very nice for the summer. 
The location is awesome, just a 1min walk to a bus station, 20min to downtown and a Safeway just 5min away. 

I can highly recommend Ron's apt!"
16287	565703	9.0	10.0	7837922	Ron was a fantastic communicator. The place was clean and comfortable, no disturbances, everything worked, and it was a pretty cool little pad to stay at. Internet access was awesome, so we were very productive both in and out of the apartment, plus there were some good places to walk around and see. Overall it was a great experience.
16288	565703	9.0	10.0	8091068	Ron's place has everything you need. Would recommend to anyone looking for accommodations in Seattle.
16289	565703	9.0	10.0	8726960	Everything was fine.
16290	565703	9.0	10.0	8783065	Comfortable & clean. Full kitchen so breakfasts were easy. Nice location, too; near Whole Foods, coop and Safeway.  Ron was available if we needed anything, but he'd thought of everything, so we little.  Would stay there again.  Candy
16291	565703	9.0	10.0	8846456	Great location, clean and Ron was helpful. We enjoyed our stay. Thank you!
16292	565703	9.0	10.0	8991498	This was a perfect location for us in a private and quiet neighborhood. Ron was available, helpful, and open to suggestions. It was clean and as described. We will hopefully stay here again.
16293	565703	9.0	10.0	9274315	Wow, such a stunning home! this place is a SERIOUS STEAL. It was so much nicer than ever the beautiful pictures portrayed. the hosts were awesome, they showed us around in the beginning and gave us some tips. no AirBnB host has ever done that for me before. they were really flexible, did not nitpick about noise at all. overall, this was the best airbnb experience i've had!
16294	565703	9.0	10.0	9321262	Rons place has a very well decorated apartment filled with everything you need, including the basic spices for cooking! We stayed there 2 nights. As a family of 3 we used both bedrooms and installed a bed in the living room area. If you are sleeping in the living room or in the main bedroom, I would suggest to wear earplugs if you like to sleep-in in the morning as life noises from upstairs can be disturbing in the early morning. Ron was a great communicator during the whole process. The surrounding area was also very pleasant. 
16295	565703	9.0	10.0	9372447	"Ron's place was a home away from home. We had the whole mini apartment to ourselves. The place was clean and comfortable, the neighborhood was safe. As it is not near the city centre, it does take a while for you to go anywhere. 

Ron is extremely friendly. He specially dropped by to check if everything was going well and if we were facing any issue.

The only issue we faced was the fact that the fire alarm is extremely sensitive as it kept ringing even though we were only boiling pasta. 

Tip: Bear with the cold and leave the door open if you want to cook.  "
16296	565703	9.0	10.0	9584489	We had a delightful time in Seattle and were very comfortable coming back each day to our Garden Apartment.  Ron went to extra lengths to help make our stay enjoyable.  From coffee filters, shampoo, comfortable beds and soft sheets it felt more like home and not a sterile motel room.  Thanks so much Ron!  
16297	565703	9.0	10.0	9688710	"Ron's Garden Apt was a perfect place to stay for our brief visit to Seattle. Situated in a lovely neighbourhood with great restaurants, cafe's / bakeries and so close to the Arboretum. 
The apartment was well appointed, clean and cozy. Beds were super comfortable. We were sorry not to be able to use the deck, but have no doubt it is a wonderful feature when the weather is better.
Ron was very helpful and made sure that we were familiar with the place, was always quick to respond to emails and was a great host. Highly recommend!"
16298	565703	9.0	10.0	9837554	I thought this apartment was awesome. It was in the Perfect location in relation to getting to South Lake Union and SeaTac. We took the bus going to both. The apartment had a great little kitchen and two bedrooms. The owners where very accommodating and it was such a steal for the price. I really enjoyed staying there and can't wait to stay there again. Thank you Ron and Mike.   
16299	565703	9.0	10.0	10032427	Ron has a fantastic place in the Maddison Park area of Seattle.  We loved this, what a great area. Try the fresh baked bread from the bakery cafe on the corner of MLK and Maddison, or Cafe Flora just up the road.
16300	565703	9.0	10.0	10092493	Very nice and quiet apartment. We were up in Seattle for work so we did not spend a whole lot of time, but the beds were very comfortable, and the neighborhood was quite. Exactly what we were looking for.
16301	565703	9.0	10.0	10184418	Beautiful apartment; very open and in a very quiet neighborhood, which makes it ideal for either coming back to after a night out or spending a relaxing day at home.  Conveniently located to bus lines that take you directly downtown, and lots of food options within walking distance.  The hosts were stellar -- they stopped in to provide some basic info about the apartment, gave us advice and help when we asked, but didn't bother us at all.
16302	565703	9.0	10.0	10425701	We had a great stay! Everything we needed was near the apartment and it was great to stay in a place outside of downtown. The apartment had everything our family of 3 needed.
16303	565703	9.0	10.0	10786690	"Nestled on the eastern portion of Capitol Hill this apartment is both very comfortable and conveniently located. For myself I found it very easy to get to and from downtown Seattle using the bus stops close to the unit. However, it was just far enough away that I never heard the bus or nearby traffic. The surrounding neighborhood was also very quiet and relaxing.

Ron was an excellent host who communicated promptly and with excellent advise on directions. Besides a quick chat to get to know each other he was very respectful of my privacy. In fact I never heard him upstairs besides a little shuffling of feet and some movement of furniture. The only negative part of the unit was that the garden wasn't green, but what else do you expect during late winter?

The utilities and furnishings were in excellent condition. Further, the queen bed was wonderful. 

It was a relaxing haven in the city to return to after busy days of exploring all Seattle had to offer."
16304	565703	9.0	10.0	11012690	We had a lovely time in Seattle. Ron is a wonderful host and we enjoyed staying in his apartment. The fact that we had a place where we could relax with our daughter as well as other family members was a great blessing to us. Thanks, Ron!
16305	565703	9.0	10.0	11150718	The apartment was splendid; comfortable and attractive, in a peaceful neighborhood, ideal for 2 singles or 2 couples. And Ron, our host, was simply wonderful, as warm and welcoming a host as you'd wish. This was our first experience of airbnb, and staying at Ron's place has left us delighted with our time in Seattle. (As a long-time Angeleno, however, I must mention that it's almost always worth carrying a jacket in Seattle!)
16306	565703	9.0	10.0	11244972	"Hi 
My wife and my daughter as well as myself enjoyed our stay in Ron and Michael's garden apartment very much. The apartment is well equipped and when we missed something the landlords were quick to supply it. The garden apartment is in a very quite and  nice neighborhood not too far from the center of Seattle. 
Thanks so much for your kind hospitality

16310	565703	9.0	10.0	11736864	Ron was a fantastic, attentive host and his apartment was a clean, cozy and beautifully decorated haven for our week long stay. Highly recommended and definitely our first choice for future trips to Seattle.

16313	565703	9.0	10.0	12453005	Our stay in the Garden Apartment was very pleasant. The location was ideal, within a short walk of Madison with shops and restaurants. The apartment was quiet with a well equipped kitchen which allowed us to cook some of our meals. Ron, the owner was onsite and checked in almost every day. We highly recommend this apartment.  
16314	565703	9.0	10.0	12813816	Perfect location.  I used to live nearby, so I know!   Quiet, lots of parking, easy to talk to the village in Madison Valley, or catch a bus to downtown or local Broadway/Capitol Hill bars/restaurants/parks.  The apt was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.  The kitchen was outfitted with a full sized stove, fridge, and microwave so it was easy to cook and save $$ (as well as calories!) from eating out all the time.  Another treat was having a washer/dryer in the unit, especially when staying for several days it comes in handy.
16315	565703	9.0	10.0	12963202	"This apartment was really cozy and well equipped. Backyard patio was lovely place to enjoy breakfast. Area is near downtown and all services, yet very safe and quiet. Just few hundred meters you can find nice restaurants and grocery stores. Access to Lake Washington is also good especially during the hot spring and summer months. Our host Ron was super friendly and communicating with him was easy and fast.

This BnB is actually just the 1st B - host DOSE NOT PROVIDE BREAKFAST.  There is a very complete kitchen provided.  Also, please note that this really is only for THREE people.  The host provides an air mattress for the 4th but there really is no space to put the mattress that gives that person any privacy - putting it in the living room turned out to be inconvenient for all since we had to walk past it on the way to the only bathroom."

16325	565703	9.0	10.0	15035889	Ron was great and his apartment truly felt like a home away from home. The location is so perfect, it is a quick bus ride into the downtown area and an even quicker drive. Ron greeted my friend and I kindly and gave us some great tips on how to get around using the public transit system. I will definitely be on the lookout for his apartment during my next visit to Seattle!

We would, and have, highly recommended the Garden Apartment to others."
16329	565703	9.0	10.0	16078853	A nice little apartment in a quiet area, but still very close to downtown by car or bus.

Cuando entramos en la casa, todo estaba preparado para recibirnos: había flores del jardín en los jarrones, música de fondo y una vela encendida.

16333	565703	9.0	10.0	18647233	Late arriving at our accommodation so the 'key in the locked box' system was useful.  The local area was nice and it was easy enough to get into central Seattle on the 8 or 11 buses (we also used the 43, which was another block away but seemed more frequent).  The apartment had soft beds and everything that we needed.  Noise from above was an issue one morning but overall we had a good experience and Ron was very helpful.
16334	565703	9.0	10.0	18875483	Host was extremely accommodating. We went in the wrong direction from the bus stop and instead of merely correcting our course when we called him, Ron came and picked us up.

16335	565703	9.0	10.0	19023172	It was a great experience staying at Ron's Garden Apartment. The site was clean and welcoming. I really appreciated the coffee and coffee maker! The rose was beautiful and made us feel welcomed.
16336	565703	9.0	10.0	19526184	Ron was a very nice host. The apartment is very cute and well located, just 3mi from downtown. Wished we would have had more time to explore Seattle. Bring earplugs against the noise from neighbors. Nothing too bad though.
16337	565703	9.0	10.0	20005153	I loved this apartment. It was clean, comfortable, and fit the description. There were no surprises! I loved being able to walk to numerous restaurants and was sorry I didn't get to try them all. I did not need to rent a car- it was a quick walk to the bus line. I also had to work remotely a few days while I was there and the apartment, and the neighborhood were quiet. The Wi-Fi was easy to use and the speed was perfect for logging in to the office. I have passed on Ron's info to a number of family members planning to visit Seattle in the near future and told them this would be the perfect place to stay.
16338	565703	9.0	10.0	20548782	Ron greeted us shortly after we arrived.  We did not talk with him afterward which was okay since we were familiar with the area.  Neighborhood is very nice.  Easy access to buses and several area restaurants.
16339	565703	9.0	10.0	20720936	"Good place to stay in Seattle. It's sort of like a duplex/triplex in that you get an entire house level to yourself so its very relaxing. Everything was comfortable and clean. There are also some interesting books to read in the  place :) (History of Weapons). 

Location wise, it's close by to a lot of cool bars and pubs and I'm pretty sure it must be in central Seattle or something because every place we went to during our stay was no more than 2-3 miles away (at least all the tourist-y things)."
16340	565703	9.0	10.0	21048276	Just outside of Capitol Hill this apartment is within 5 min. walking of multiple bus stops. Ron met us as we arrived and was very accommodating. Full kitchen, comfortable beds, and a quiet neighborhood -- recommended for 2-3 travelers. 
16341	565703	9.0	10.0	21233011	Ron was responsive and helpful in getting us set up in his place. The space is like a home (not hotel), which helped us feel comfortable while staying. We brought our bikes and the location is surrounded by hills, which provided many opportunities for strengthening our legs. Otherwise, a clean and well-functioning space. 
16342	565703	9.0	10.0	21656683	"My visit checklist:
Apartment: Perfect (check)
Location: Better than perfect (check)
Host: Pefect and available (check)
Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in a conveinent and cool neighborhood. Don't miss out on the Essential Bakery and Vegan Thai Restaurant around the corner. The bus was a block away and took me wherever I needed to go. Thanks Ron!"
16343	565703	9.0	10.0	21800549	Accommodations were wonderful and Ron is an excellent host.  He went way out of his way to make me del welcome.  One night I lost my key and he got up, met me there and let me in.  He was even super friendly about it.  I highly recommend this place!
16344	565703	9.0	10.0	21896244	This apartment is cozy yet spacious. So close to downtown, yet it is in a quiet residential neighborhood. Some great shops, restaurants, and more right around the corner. We wish we could have spent more time there, but were in town for a conference so we were busy early and all day both days.
16345	565703	9.0	10.0	22145167	Loved our stay at Rons! Great location and more than enough space for us. Cafes and bus stops about 100m away. Would stay here again! 
16346	565703	9.0	10.0	22297872	My mother and grandmother stayed here while visiting me and they loved the apartment. Beautiful unit and easy walk to shopping/restaurants. And although we didn't get to meet Ron in person, he was a great communicator. Overall, I'd love to have family/friends stay here again!
16347	565703	9.0	10.0	23240001	Great location and wonderful host.  We would stay here again because it was so convenient to get around the city and nice to always have a safe place to park night and day.
16348	565703	9.0	10.0	23538240	The garden apartment in Madison Park is comfortable, artistic and in a GREAT location. Madison park and beach as well as the arboretum are in the neighborhood. The apartment is actually better than the pictures! There was good communication around check in with a simple lockbox - and classical music was playing when we arrived - very welcoming! Ron stayed in touch throughout the visit and made sure we had everything we needed. Great Seattle experience!
16349	565703	9.0	10.0	23765680	Had a wonderful stay at Ron's Garden Apartment. Wonderful location and Ron greeted me and showed me around. Classical music was playing, so welcoming! The kitchen is fully stocked if you need to cook anything. Ron has a great CD collection and also free Wifi and Netflix. The added touch of candles around the apartment make it very cosey and homey. Ample parking and busses close in addition to restaurants  and cafe's. Ron even let me know day of check out not to rush and take my time as no one else was booked in. I would definitely  stay here again!!! I did hear some footsteps and muffled voices overhead one night but it didn't bother me in the slightest. 
16350	565703	9.0	10.0	24012080	Ron was super attentive and a great host. The apartment was very nice and in a great neighborhood. I would stay there any time! Highly recomended.
16351	565703	9.0	10.0	24342264	Staying at the Garden Apartment was great. Check in / check out was super easy, Ron was very attentive (came over within minutes when the Wi-Fi wasn't working), and the apartment had all of the amenities. Would definitely recommend staying here!
16352	565703	9.0	10.0	25127140	We really enjoyed staying at the garden apartment. It was very cosy and well equipped. Ron was a good host, very quick to respond if we had questions or needed anything. We really enjoyed the location, walking distance to great restaurants, cafés and shops and also close to downtown. We especially enjoyed the arboretum which was also within walking distance and Lake Washington. We will definitely try to book this place again on our next visit to Seattle.  It was a great home away from home. Highly recommend.
16353	565703	9.0	10.0	25288080	Ron's apartment was perfect for our weekend getaway in Seattle. The location was a quick Uber ride to Capitol Hill and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The apartment was cozy and comfortable for 3 people. Also super clean! 
16354	565703	9.0	10.0	25506166	Ron was great to work with -- prompt in his communication, helpful and friendly. The apartment was great, had everything we needed and comfortable. There's no dining table so we ate in the living room. The location is perfect, tucked away on a quiet street but a 5 minute walk to all the stores and restaurants in Madison Valley and bus lines.
16355	565703	9.0	10.0	25800224	We had a great stay at Ron's place.  Perfect for small families with two bedrooms and easy parking.  Less than 15 minutes to downtown.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  Ron made it very easy to check in and out.  I would definitely stay here again and I would also recommend to friends.  
16356	565703	9.0	10.0	26118049	Great place in a great neighborhood with wonderful privacy.  Ron's place was clean and spacious, the heaters worked great, and the decor was very welcoming.  I'd definitely stay there again... great deal!
16357	565703	9.0	10.0	26575861	Ron was an amazing host. He was very responsive and helpful! The apartment was located really close to the arboretum which was great for us since we wanted to go on a couple of runs there. There are also some amazing restaurants close to the apartment which can be reached within a 5 minute walk. We would absolutely stay there again!
16358	565703	9.0	10.0	26830562	"The Garden Apartment was both a convenient and comfortable staging point for our exploration of Seattle. Highlights include the nearby downtown bus, bakery/cafe, ample street parking, and proximity to Seattle's amazing Arboretum. 

The apartment itself had everything we needed, and was a cozy place to recharge between outings. Check-in/out was very smooth, and Ron was responsive when we contacted him.

The only problem we encountered was a guest upstairs with a particularly noisy morning routine. Ron contacted me later to apologize and let me know he would be more careful in the future, as well as informing upstairs tenants about minimizing morning noise.

Overall, we had a successful trip, and the place was a good fit for our needs."
16359	565703	9.0	10.0	27363173	"This space was perfect for our group of three. Good location, responsive and accessible host, just as advertised, no surprises. It had everything that mattered: good location (with easy parking), a warm and clean space with good beds, good linen (including enough towels and good pillows), hot water (a warm bathroom), and a well-equipped kitchen. We were happy here, and we’ll be back.f
"
16360	565703	9.0	10.0	27619673	Great please with lots of character. Although I didn't get to meet Ron, he was always available for any questions and promptly responded. Perfect for multiple guest!

16363	565703	9.0	10.0	28282293	"The suite was spacious and cozy. It was centrally located which was perfect as a starting point. We always had plenty of parking space just beside the house.  The kitchen had some basics such as salt and pepper, olive oil which was appreciated for making breakfast.  Rob responded to texts within 24 hours.  He was kind enough to deliver a package that arrived after we left to a family member's place.  Thanks  Ron!
"
16364	565703	9.0	10.0	29280207	I booked Ron's apartment for two employees (brother's) who were visiting from out of town. Everything was as described and Ron provided great information for easy check in from SeaTac to the apartment. The location of the apartment was perfect to downtown and also capitol hill. Apartment was roomy and well stocked and very welcoming. Never had the chance to meet Ron, he was out of town but that was no problem.
16365	565703	9.0	10.0	29920131	"Location of the apartment was very good for what I needed, very close to Convention centre which was my main venue for the whole stay. The apartment is located in very quiet and lovely neighbourhood too. The apartment had everything what was needed, iron, ironing board, kettle, pots etc. 
Ron was great host, unfortunatelly didn't get chance to meet him in person but he was really helpful through messages etc and he got his friend to look after things in case I need anything which was very kind of him.
Overall, great apartment, I will come back if I'm in Seattle again.
"
16366	565703	9.0	10.0	30125202	We had a great stay at Ron's home.  It looked just like shown - attractive, neat, & clean.  Nice and bright during the day with windows all around and sliding glass doors to a private yard.  Ron certainly made us feel welcome. He was always available to answer questions and he came by for a nice conversation. The area is fabulous.  We took a long walk on gentle hills through a beautiful residential neighborhood to Lake Washington viewpoint.  A couple of blocks to stores including great coffee place.  It's also a great central place for beginning car drives in all directions.
16367	565703	9.0	10.0	30285998	This was a perfectly cute place for us to stay and suited our needs.  The amenities are all there. Nice location. Would stay here again. There isn't much of an indoor dining area, but that wasn't an issue for us. Thanks
16368	565703	9.0	10.0	30473546	Ron's place is a nice little apartment in what is a new part of Seattle for us. We really enjoyed the residential feel of the neighbourhood and the great walk to the Arboretum which is very close. Ron himself was the very essence of graciousness and responded to our needs extremely well. As my wife said - he seems to be what people think of when they say a truly sincere and nice person - and very hospitable. it was clear our experience was very important to him.
16369	565703	9.0	10.0	30797200	Ron was great at communicating about the booking and making sure we had everything we needed, very warm and friendly.

16371	565703	9.0	10.0	31475920	Ron did a great job in preparation for my visit. What's not to like about low lights, fresh garden breezes and soft music on the radio?! I had a great stay in a wonderful location!
16372	565703	9.0	10.0	31885200	great neighborhood, great host!
16373	565703	9.0	10.0	32087532	"The Garden Apartment was pretty much as described, and provided a cozy place to rest during a challenging workshop.  The art and books were nice touches to add to the cozy feel.  I rented the space with a colleague and we each stayed in our own bedrooms which provided a good separation of noise.  The kitchen space was nicely appointed with a few basics still available from the last renters.  

The neighborhood was within walking distance of grocery, dining, and various attractions, and a great place to be located in the city.

We were met by Ron's Partner Mike as we arrived, serendipitously, as he was attending to the last few preparation tasks.  He showed us around the place, and went out of his way to find an ironing board for my roommate.  Ron was very communicative and friendly and I would definitely recommend it to others!   "
16374	565703	9.0	10.0	32180858	Ron made us feel so very welcome. We arrived to fresh flowers in every room. The apartment was so just lovely,  within easy walking distance to the Arboretum and restaurants. Highly recommend.
16375	565703	9.0	10.0	32302702	Quick and easy! Ron's place was welcoming, cozy, and conveniently located. Great garden patio, my only regret is we didn't have longer to enjoy the place!
16376	565703	9.0	10.0	32525168	Ron's apartment was perfect for us. It was spotless and very well appointed. The bed was comfortable. Ron introduced himself and was very helpful. We'll be back!
16377	565703	9.0	10.0	32674322	We were very happy during our stay at Ron's garden apartment. The pictures and descriptions matched what was provided, and we had ample comfortable space for 3 people.

16379	565703	9.0	10.0	33564987	We are three ladies from Texas. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ron 's garden apartment. The shower was amazing and it wasn't too far from downtown.  Cab ride was very reasonable to and from downtown. $7.00 or so. Thanks Ron#
16380	565703	9.0	10.0	33712016	Ron's place is quirky and neat with a cute little garden. It's well located in a typical Seattle style neighborhood with easy driving access to the downtown. Ron was very friendly and helpful and offered great suggestions.

16382	565703	9.0	10.0	34524596	"Description of apartment was accurate.  Came well equipped with anything one might have needed.  Fresh roses were in the living room and bedroom.  There was a lovely coffee/lunch cafe only a block away.  An added bonus for us was that it was only a few blocks away from our daughter.  Seems to be a pretty nice and quiet neighborhood.
There is some interesting art on the walls that I would have liked to have known more about. 
We would definitely return to the garden apartment."
16383	565703	9.0	10.0	34753675	Ron's Garden Apartment was excellent: Great location, clean, inviting. Instructions were easy to follow. Free parking, bus connections to Seattle downtown; just a fabulous experience at a reasonable cost. Highly recommended!
16384	565703	9.0	10.0	35999240	The garden apartment was perfectly situated and so comfortable. Ron's attention to service and prompt help was so appreciated. A window shade needed a fix and Ron truly was on it. We really appreciated his high level of customer service. 
16385	565703	9.0	10.0	36538628	This apartment worked out great for us. Scrupulously clean. In the hot weather it was cool and comfortable. Good bed. Ron was helpful and responded quickly to all messages. We had no trouble finding the place. It is one easy bus ride from downtown.

Location was wonderful, 10-15 minutes by car to anywhere.
16387	565703	9.0	10.0	37486457	This apartment was the perfect stay while visiting Seattle. It was close to a few good restaurants and cafes, close to the bridge for going to them mountains, down the street from a beautiful trail, and not far from downtown.

16388	565703	9.0	10.0	38261776	"Great place in quiet neighborhood. This two bedroom place worked perfectly for our family of four on our trip to visit friends and family in capitol Hill. 

The place was small but charming. Getting in and out was very easy, Ruth easy parking. Having a full kitchen and dedicated bedrooms was way better than a hotel for us. 

"
16389	565703	9.0	10.0	38559590	Highly recommend Ron's apartment! It's comfortable, clean, in a great location and has everything we needed, including a hair dryer. 
16390	565703	9.0	10.0	39588104	Loved it. 
16391	565703	9.0	10.0	39882948	Just a perfect stay, thanks Ron
16392	565703	9.0	10.0	40252562	Ron's apartment was just as described.  He made myself and my co-worker feel at home between our long days of meetings.  The bed was AMAZING.  And the location is prime for getting to various locations both in the city and the suburbs.  The amenities were as described and I would absolutely stay again.  
16393	565703	9.0	10.0	40481671	"It was nice and comfortable to live in the apartment. It was good feeling when entering the room with playing CD music ( Ron played it before my arrival). 

You could feel the artist style from details, such as the painting, the picture and other knick-knacks. All of this made the room comfortable and relaxed. We used the air mattress for the fourth people, it was comfortable.

Overall, it's good place to live in during travel. Thanks Ron!"
16394	565703	9.0	10.0	40807512	Ron made us feel very welcomed and was very prompt in responding to questions/emails/text. Apt is in a GREAT location and he added nice touches like fresh flowers and light music playing upon arrival. The people upstairs were pretty noisy stomping around early mornings (before 7) and late at night (up until about midnight), but the house was very, very quiet besides that. All in all it was a great stay and we would absolutely use Ron again!
16395	565703	9.0	10.0	41208837	"Ron was awesome! He had everything ready when I arrived, the apartment was clean and well taken care of. Music was playing as I entered the building and I felt right at home.

Nice neighborhood with plenty of parking. Close to downtown and almost everything in the Seattle area."
16396	565703	9.0	10.0	41925115	I felt very welcomed to the apartment.  The soft music upon entrance was a wonderful touch.  The kitchen was well equipped and the temperature was perfect.  Fans kept fresh air moving through the apartment.  The location was also good for exploring Seattle. It was near bus lines that can take you downtown and to the Seattle Center.  Breathe hot yoga was about a 15min walk away and was a perfect activity for my stay in Seattle.  
16397	565703	9.0	10.0	42660537	Ron was very welcoming and easy to communicate with both electronically and in person.  The Garden Apartment was just as described and in a very nice part of Seattle for walking and public transportation.

16402	565703	9.0	10.0	44677724	Everything is awesome ! We have a really great time in Seattle
16403	565703	9.0	10.0	45274265	"Ron provided us all the information that we needed to let ourselves in upon arrival.  The apartment is entered from a simple yard abutting the curbside, and we found the apartment to be exactly as described on the inside.  In fact, we found that his Garden Apartment has a lot to offer, and we wish we had stayed longer to appreciate and enjoy all of it.  The Apartment comes with a full kitchen, a patio, a cozy living room, comfortable beds in 2 bedrooms and a good shower.  We found the decorations appealing as well.  Since the apartment is the ground floor of their home, you do hear sounds of people moving about but this did not bother us too much.

While we had a full kitchen at our disposal, we opted to eat dinner at the Harvest Vine and breakfast at the Essential Baking Co. (both superb, and just about 2 blocks away).  

Ron was prompt in answering our questions (such as how to lock up upon departure).  I would recommend this to anyone needing a place for 3 people to stay in the Capitol Hill area.  "
16404	565703	9.0	10.0	47151481	Ron came by to welcome me to the apartment and to make sure I was happy with the workings of the place.  The apt. was clean, well-stocked, and bright and cheery.  The neighborhood is urban residential and very pleasant.  The buses into Seattle are only a few blocks away, so it's very easy to go sight seeing; a car is not necessary.  This was a very good location for me, and the apt. felt very homey.
16405	565703	9.0	10.0	49205175	"My family is very satisfied with this stay! Ron is super helpful and the apartment is clean and well-located. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The downtown bus is 5 minute walk away which is very convenient.
Definitely will recommend! "
16406	565703	9.0	10.0	50721735	Such a cozy little place! This was my first time using AirBnB and I felt very comfortable staying at Ron's apartment! It was in a cute neighborhood just walking distance from restaurants and the bus stop. It was very clean... he even had music playing for us when we first walked in! Although we never had the pleasure of meeting him he still made sure we were having a pleasant trip one of the 3 days we were there. I definitely recommend staying here :)
16407	565703	9.0	10.0	51325936	Great host; great space.
16408	565703	9.0	10.0	51790965	Ron's place was great. Reality matched the photos. Parking was a breeze. Two of my favorite restaurants are just around the corner.  And, the key lock box makes checking in and out super easy.
16409	565703	9.0	10.0	54036111	"The apartment is lovely and quiet, just as pictured. I especially enjoyed the living room and was pleased to find a stereo and CDs, as well as an interesting selection of books. The colors and the art are very restful; just what I needed after a months-long period of intense work.

The kitchen was very clean and fully stocked with all of the dishes, utensils and pans I needed. I'd opted not to rent a car during my eight-day stay, and not feeling well my first day there, I had groceries delivered from Central Co-op. It was wonderful to have the option to cook and stay in, snuggled up in one of Ron's colorful handmade afghans.

The apartment is within walking distance of the Arboretum and Japanese Garden; this was one of the reasons I initially selected it. I should note that I was very surprised at the hilliness of the area: If you're a walker, as I am, you'll enjoy the challenge. If not, the bus stop is right there and transit looks easy. I chose to walk or use Uber, which was convenient. Pick-ups were quick: never waited more than 3 minutes at the apartment.

Ron could not have been more accommodating. I arrived a few minutes early and was happy to find the key in the lock box. I'd barely set my bags down when he knocked on the door and welcomed me. 

Hearing that I'd shattered my phone when I stepped off the plane, Ron immediately offered suggestions on where to have it repaired economically. He checked in by message a couple of times during the week to see if I'd been able to get it fixed and to make sure all was well.

My flight out was not until 8 p.m. on Saturday, and Ron graciously offered to let me use his locked shed to store my luggage so that I could enjoy my last day in Seattle without having to worry about lugging anything around in the rain.

I truly hated packing up and leaving my peaceful little oasis. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a restful, beautiful, comfortable space."
16410	565703	9.0	10.0	55077635	"The location is easy to access, super quiet, just few mins away from the city center!
Plenty of spaces for parking too!

Ron is a very nice host, he provides us very helpful information and suggestions!"
16411	565703	9.0	10.0	55257201	The garden apartment was wonderful for our Thanksgiving stay. Perfectly cozy, warm, and perfectly located just off the bus line into downtown! We loved how well stocked the kitchen was for cooking breakfast. Definitely recommending Ron's place to friends who are visiting Seattle!
16412	565703	9.0	10.0	56108626	The Garden Apartment is in a good location. The neighborhood is very quiet, the small shops and restaurants nearby are within easy walking distance. On street parking is also easy to find, usually right next to or across the street from the apartment. The apartment itself has electric wall or free standing space heaters which did a good job of keeping things warm. There is also excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water. Ron was easy to communicate with and we had talked by text message during and after the rental process. He very graciously brought us tissues, shampoo, conditioner and soap when we messaged him that these items were not in the apartment. 
16413	565703	9.0	10.0	56656612	Lovely spot - thanks so much for having us, Ron. We felt very comfortable :)
16414	565703	9.0	10.0	57054507	Ron's house is fascinating and enjoyable that I want to sleep late every morning！HAHA！It is so clean and quiet and we feel just like we are at home！It really contributes a lot to our memorable trip in Seattle！Nice city！Very nice host and his beautiful house！Thank you so much, Ron！We'll choose your house again if we ever come back to Seattle. 
16415	565703	9.0	10.0	57378681	Great house and great host Ron！Nice trip in Seattle！
16416	565703	9.0	10.0	57585032	We had a wonderful vocation here. Ron's apartment is so comfortable . Neighbors are very quiet. And you can visit most famous places by driving within 15 minutes. I definitely will choose Ron's apartment again  next time.
16417	565703	9.0	10.0	58019785	My friends and I had a great time staying at Roses garden apartment - it was super close to a bunch of tasty restaurants and quick to get downtown via bus or uber. The place was wonderfully decorated and we felt very relaxed and welcome. 
19466	7953211	10.0	10.0	44383195	It's a nice house with perfect location. If you drive to Seattle, this is the only place I will recommend.  Adam is a nice guy and thank you for coming at the mid-night to help us. 
19467	7953211	10.0	10.0	45182017	"The description ""central area home"" couldn't be more apt. 10 minutes to Pike Market (in traffic), 15 out to Fremont... could not complain about location at all.

Decor is slightly spartan and quite clean, perfect as I hate feeling like I'm rearranging other people's lives while I'm staying in their house.

Convenient to where I wanted to go, impeccably clean... I'd stay there again."
19468	7953211	10.0	10.0	54782477	"My husband and I stayed here for about a week while we waited for our permanent housing to pan out. The house is 1) clean, 2) as pictured and, 3) the location is great (for me this means easy access to grocery stores ( 5 min), highways, and restaurants, and that it is relatively quiet). The linens were nice and there were more than enough towels for us. Also, the kitchen has the essentials. I would stay here again. 

Adam was a wonderful and attentive host, anytime we had questions he responded immediately. I met face-to-face on a few occasions and he was very pleasant."
19469	7953211	10.0	10.0	56737745	Perfect place for me. The office and high speed internet was exactly what I needed 
23328	4660460	10.0	10.0	26631838	We enjoyed the flexible check-in and check-out time. Our hosts were able to meet with us and give us tips for dining nearby. On street parking was a bit crowded but we were lucky to find a spot every time. We were also given a parking pass, which was nice. We loved the small and cozy feel of the studio apartment!
23329	4660460	10.0	10.0	26937189	Very nice stay. Mona was really welcoming and made sure that we had a good stay. The place provided almost everything u need for our stay. Will definitely come back in the future.
23330	4660460	10.0	10.0	28166284	This place is in a great location, easy to get around by public transportation and the apartment was very comfortable.
23331	4660460	10.0	10.0	28416338	"The listing description is very accurate.  This is a great little space!  The bed is very comfortable and the space is very cozy.  There's a full oven and some pots and pans and dishes, and even some cooking oil which came in handy.  

I only met Mona for a few minutes when I was leaving, but she was very friendly and easy to reach through messages and her partner was also easy to reach through text when I had a couple questions after check in.  She was extremely flexible with check in and check out times.   

The space was also very clean, which was a welcome change from a couple other recent airbnb experiences! 

There are several bus routes a couple blocks away, and some restaurants and pubs nearby.  The only thing that wasn't convenient in terms of location was that there's no grocery store close by, but there are some convenience stores and delis.   "
23332	4660460	10.0	10.0	28543611	"Excellent location in an amazing private residence. The pictures are very accurate. It's a super cute basement residence very close to some awesome, local coffee and restaurants. 

Mona is an excellent host. She even drew us a map of the area. Trust me, you will be glad you stayed at such an awesome location. 

Thanks, Mona!
"
23333	4660460	10.0	10.0	28710413	The studio was very comfortable and much closer to downtown than it looked on the map. It was so nice to be able to have our dogs with us on vacation too.
23334	4660460	10.0	10.0	29291867	"Mona made the apartment a brilliant place to have to come back after a day out exploring. It's bright and very tidy, nicely decorated. The description is very accurate, it's a cozy little suite! The neighbourhood was lovely, made incredible by this time of spring, it's a very friendly spot. The surrounding area up just one block is full of restaurants and cafes that were top-notch. We knew about these things thanks to a helpful map that Mona left us. In addition to her attention to tidiness and decoration, this map, combined with a bunch of cute little surprises like books on Seattle, playing cards, and lovely beverages made this experience over the top for us. Basically, you're completely setup to have everything you could want. Mona is there if you need her upstairs, but she gives you complete privacy as if it's your own place. Oh, and the bed is delightfully comfortable!

Simply put, I highly recommend this spot, made our stay awesome and easy."
23335	4660460	10.0	10.0	29746883	Mona and Weston were great hosts. The studio has ample space for two people and is appointed nicely with everything needed for a short stay in Seattle. Located in a quiet part of town with easy access to most of the city. Highly recommended.
23336	4660460	10.0	10.0	29957915	Great quiet place to stay. Close to the city and nice neighbourhood. 
23337	4660460	10.0	10.0	30382988	The apartment was a great size for 2 people. It was close to restaurants and the water which made for scenic walks. Also, only a few minute drive to downtown/market area. Parking was difficult at times but we always found a spot relatively close. We had a great time.
23338	4660460	10.0	10.0	31106424	"We had a great time at Mona's place. Both she and her fiancé are very friendly and helpful and I will highly recommend their apartment for anyone visiting Seattle and looking for a nice, not over-priced accommodation. 

Eeastlake is a very peaceful district, easily accessible from any direction and very well connected with the city center or northern parts of Seattle (public transport in Seattle works really well).

Do not hesitate and book Cozy Eastlake Studio Apartment!"
23339	4660460	10.0	10.0	31531194	Mona's basement flat was perfect for my two day stay with my boyfriend. We were on a bike tour and she was super accommodating, she actually let us change the dates we were staying and put our bikes inside. The flat was a very cool yet simple space and the neighborhood where she lives feels very safe and has several good restaurants, etc. What a great intro to Seattle!
23340	4660460	10.0	10.0	31940671	We absolutely LOVED staying at this studio. Eastlake is a great area with lots of restaurants within walking distance. Mona was very kind and a great host who was always accessable. The apartment was clean, spacious, and had an amazing bed. There was even a cute little sitting area set up outside just for renters with a great view of the bridge, very pretty at night! We would stay here again without a doubt!
23341	4660460	10.0	10.0	32404313	"Cute apartment in great neighborhood. It was my first time to Seattle and Mona made the stay very easy. The apartment is a good sized studio - very comfortable for two, with a full kitchen to boot! Mona even left cute soaps and coffee for guests.

The apartment is 1.5 blocks to the 71 and 66 (and other) buses, which made getting to many places very easy. It's also only two blocks from Lake Union (which you can see from the apartment!) which is a nice walk. There are some good restaurants and bars in Eastlake. I definitely recommend as a good place to stay."
23342	4660460	10.0	10.0	32747705	This is a super cute little apartment in a great neighborhood. Even though we had a rental car, we walked/biked everywhere. We had an easy time parking on the street with the parking permit. The place is small, but more than enough space for two people. Very quiet and clean with nice views from the private patio. We didn't have much interaction with Mona, but she was very kind and accommodating. She also left us chocolate and drinks, which was so nice! We had a great two nights and I would highly recommend this place. 
23343	4660460	10.0	10.0	33088702	"Mona's place was absolutely perfect for our long weekend in Seattle! My husband and I were visiting the city for the first time, and we very much appreciated the apartment's central location and proximity to downtown. If you're just interested in hanging around the neighborhood, Mona's place is just around the corner from several bars and restaurants. 

The apartment itself was exactly as pictured, and very cozy, clean, and stylish. It's outfitted with kitchen essentials and some extra toiletries, and we were provided with a guest parking pass for the rental car, which made parking very easy. There was also a lovely private patio for us to watch the sunset from. 

Overall, Mona's was such a great, cozy, and efficient place to stay, and I highly recommend it! "
23344	4660460	10.0	10.0	33428526	Wonderfully adorable neighborhood. Simple and stylish furnishings. Very clean and comfortable. Loved the private alley entrance and the sunny patio. 
23345	4660460	10.0	10.0	34073690	Mona's place was quaint and accommodating, and just right for me and my boyfriend's three night stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is ideal for getting to hot spot places in the city -- nothing more than a 10-15 min drive. Mona gave us our space and the Apple TV in the apartment was on par. 
23346	4660460	10.0	10.0	34312738	Me and my boyfriend enjoyed our 3-night stay in Mona's apartment! It's definitely a cozy and clean place for 2 people with an Apple TV for us to use. Mona provided a parking pass, so parking was a breeze. Staying in Eastlake is a convenient 10-15 minute to every else that we visited. She was very helpful and responded quick to any questions I had. I recommend this place to any one who's visiting Seattle. Thanks again Mona!
23347	4660460	10.0	10.0	34964169	We loved the location of Mona's place. We walked everywhere from there: Fremont, South Lake, North Lake, DT, Capitol Hill... etc. The place is perfect for two people, nice, clean, and colorful. Mona's book selection is great too... you get to learn about Seattle's history and see how the City looked before and the way it looks now. Mona provided us with a parking pass so we had no issues with parking. Eastlake is a nice area with plenty of choices to eat and drink. We went to Pazzo's, the Zoo Tavern, and Eastlake Bar & Grill - all very close. Before I forget, there is a nice outdoor seating area with nice Lake Union views... we enjoyed breakfast a couple of times taking in the breeze and gorgeous views... Thanks Mona for the hospitality. I would certainly reach out to you next time I visit Seattle.
23348	4660460	10.0	10.0	35322072	We loved this space! Very private efficiency style room with everything we needed. Great location and a great host. Would definitely stay here again. 
23349	4660460	10.0	10.0	35662130	Very nice location, accurate description of apartment. Mona was very accommodating when we had to change the dates of our stay, and made the place available when we arrived quite late the first night. Cute apartment, tasteful decoration - perfect for our needs. We never actually met Mona in person but she was always available via sms. Parking was fine and it's great that she makes the parking pass available.
23350	4660460	10.0	10.0	36192949	Mona was the perfect host for our visit to Seattle. Located just about two blocks from Lake Union and the famous houseboats of Seattle, the space was also in the ideal location. One exit from all the Downtown touristy stuff but still get the authentic Seattle experience. The patio overlooking the lake was amazing and the room was perfect for our family. Mona left us some really nice homemade soap and some local craft beers. The Apple TV and the internet were super fast. Couldn't have asked for a better host while in Seattle! 
23351	4660460	10.0	10.0	36361363	The apartment was perfect! Great location and easy to find. It was stocked with everything you would need to cook (which we did to save money) and make your coffee with a French press. Total bonus points for that! Mona was very gracious and provided us with everything we needed. She is very sweet and spunky. I will definitely rent from her again! Wonderful place and experience. Thank you. 
23352	4660460	10.0	10.0	37291926	"We had the best time! The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and it had everything we needed (plus more). The neighborhood was lovely - very close to the lake (absolutely beautiful views), a small market, and yummy restaurants. It's a great location wherever you're headed in Seattle. We used Uber to get around mostly - $8-10 one way to downtown, picked up within a few minutes. We also used the shared public bikes one day. There's a pick-up/drop-off site for the bikes just a few blocks away from this apartment, and it was only $10 (bike+helmet) for 24 hours of use. 

We arrived early and left late - everyone's favorite type of guests. : / BUT Mona was very accessible and accomodating before and during our stay. We highly recommend staying here!"
23353	4660460	10.0	10.0	37694759	Mona was great, the setup was fantastic, and the location was perfect for exploring the rest of the beautiful city. The porch was a nice place for us to sit and hang out as well. Would recommend. 
23354	4660460	10.0	10.0	37832694	Mona was a great host. Very communicative and flexible about our check-in time. The apartment had just what we needed and wanted for our short stay.
23355	4660460	10.0	10.0	39485585	The perfect space for our seattle getaway. Extremely clean and provided the necessities to feel welcome and at home. Easily accessible to everywhere we wanted to go, great for tourists. Hosts were open to anything we had questions about. I would stay again in a heartbeat. Thank you Mona!
23356	4660460	10.0	10.0	40733097	Mona was super chill and her place had everything you needed, plus it was in a great location! 
23357	4660460	10.0	10.0	42820421	This cozy Eastlake studio was great!  Super cozy and close in to everything.  Loved having a kitchen and bathroom to ourselves.  It was a great place for a weekend away.
23358	4660460	10.0	10.0	43218626	Our cozy stay in Eastlake was perfect. We easily got around the city visiting all the fun neighborhoods. Our host was sweet and informative recommending the perfect day trip on our last day. The apartment was clean and comfy and exactly what we expected. A bonus was the little deck outside with the lake view! Thank you Mona and Luis 
23359	4660460	10.0	10.0	49633476	Great location. Easy to communicate with Mona. Simple, clean space that is perfect for two people. The location is close to downtown, and very walkable to dinner, coffee shops, markets, and the water. It was a great spot!
23360	4660460	10.0	10.0	50291152	"We spent a long weekend visiting Seattle. Overall, we had a pleasant time staying here. 

Space: Bed is soft and comfy, room has a large TV. We didn’t have any issues with getting hot/cold, but the hosts left us a space heater just in case. There is also a small desk area if you needed to sit and work on anything. Small kitchen with a stove, small fridge and a few pots and pans. Good water pressure in the shower. 

Hosts: We actually never saw our hosts while we were there- the entrance is separate from the main residence so there isn’t much overlap. Overall, the room felt very private and we didn’t hear too much noise from upstairs.  
 
Location: Eastlake seems really nice. Quiet, centrally located, near public transit, close to Lake Union. There are a couple of cute restaurants and coffee shops within a 2 block radius, and the area seems pretty safe without being overly snooty. We mostly rode the bus (which picks up about a block away) or took Uber while we were there, but we also walked to the Seattle Center from the house and it only took about 40 minutes on foot. 

Overall impressions: Good value, nice location. We would stay there again. 
"
23361	4660460	10.0	10.0	51288614	"Mona accommodated an early check in and when asked about public transportation recommended Uber which worked very well
This property is not for older people. Pavers to entrance are dangerous, bed can only be accessed from one side, cooking is problamatic due to smoke detector going off with minimal use. 
Street parking at a premium. Once parked we took Uber rides.

"
23362	4660460	10.0	10.0	51931815	My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights. We never got a chance to meet Mona but she made checking in very simple. We loved the coziness of the studio and the location is great! Being able to walk to the local restaurants was a huge plus since we didn't have a car. And the food was great! Would definitely stay here again if we ever found ourselves back in Seattle! 
23363	4660460	10.0	10.0	53267336	I really enjoyed my stay.  Although I didn't get a chance to meet Mona, she made it very easy to get into the unit.  It had all the amenities I needed for the week; comfy bed, hot water, kitchen, TV, and a parking pass.  The neighborhood is quiet with many nice restaurants within a short walk from the apartment.
23364	4660460	10.0	10.0	53994690	We loved staying at Mona's place because it was private, quiet, attractive, and super easy to check in/out and to get around Seattle (Eastlake is very centrally located and the bus stop is a couple blocks away). We never met Mona because she and her husband were in Germany, but they were easy to get in touch with via text message when we couldn't figure out how to operate the Apple TV at first, and they made it very clear that they didn't mind being contacted. Very nice, easy going, and responsive people. The bed was super comfortable, the space heater kept us warm, and overall, the apartment is cozy and perfect for a Seattle home base for a long weekend. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Mona! 
23365	4660460	10.0	10.0	54985579	"Mona made it very easy for us to check in and check out. She was very responsive throughout our stay. The apartment was exactly as I imagined from the listing. The location is great, very central making it easy to travel around the city. Parking is on the street and we never had a problem finding a spot. Shower water pressure was great and there was always enough hot water for the two of us. We did not end up using the kitchen, but it seemed to have the basics. 
It was a very cold week in November which caused the apartment to be unbearably cold. My guess is the space is lacking adequate insulation. Mona did everything she could to make us more comfortable by buying a new space heater and providing extra blankets. It still did not make it comfortable enough to hang out in without being in bed under two down comforters. I would definitely recommend Mona's apartment for any other time of the year. I will consider it myself!"
23366	4660460	10.0	10.0	55432087	Great location and Mona was really cool about letting us have our dog there! Mona was also understanding about our late check-in and check-out - thanks, Mona! The one caveat is, as someone else said, it's not a good place for anyone who is elderly or injured in any way; the walkway down to the apartment can be tricky especially in the dark. 
23367	4660460	10.0	10.0	56051778	Despite the December rain, I had a wonderful time in this lovely apartment. Mona gave me a warm welcome, complete with very handy map of the immediate area, and I was able to settle in very quickly. The place is cosy and absolutely spotless, with everything I needed to hand. I cooked some nice meals in the kitchen and made many, many cups of tea. Capitol Hill is within easy walking distance, and on the one sunny day I was able to take beautiful pictures there and in Eastlake itself. I heartily recommend the apartment!
23368	4660460	10.0	10.0	56499954	"Mona was such a generous host, and thank you for being so responsive and accommodating with our car troubles!

Very comfortable and inviting to stay in this room, even on the greyest and wettest days of Seattle winters. Morning tea while overlooking Lake Union from the comfort of the room was such a treat! An excellent home base for further adventure in the city, with some great options for breakfast and evening drinks just around the corner. "
24132	9151865	10.0	10.0	56329934	"I stayed at Vivian's place since it was located in SLU, the area where I had to work for a few days. The place was clean, located in a very nice neighborhood. I didn't get the chance to meet Vivian personally, but her boyfriend and their friend welcomed me. The room was very clean and the place has a full kitchen that you could use. 

At first, I was disappointed that this place doesn't have a private bathroom which was different from the listing description. I knew this after I requested to book. One night, at around midnight, it was extremely loud that I couldn't sleep since Oscar and his friend were playing xbox until like 1am with a loud shouting. I felt like I am staying at college dorm :-(  Since I had to work, I wished it was more quiet at night and they were more considerate to guests. Another thing was that I had to call someone (their friend) to enter the house each time. Hope these are things that future guests might want to know before booking, and I hope Vivian and her friends who stay there can improve!  "
26113	6316917	9.0	10.0	32659324	I needed a place for my last night in Seattle and Sid came through! His place was a home away from home and convenient to everything in Belltown! He made me feel very welcomed and his response time to my questions was amazing! I will definitely staying here again when I come back! Thanks again man!
26114	6316917	9.0	10.0	32722677	Sid, in one word.....FANTASTIC.  Everything was simple and to the letter.  Very clean and convenient.  Check in and checkout process seamless.  Unit was spot on and as described.  Great location and a super great host.  Will book again in the very near future.  
26115	6316917	9.0	10.0	32923908	Spectacular location! Check-in went very smoothly and the apartment is new, clean, and minimalist. Sid was always quick to respond to call or text as well. Conveniently between Seattle Center and Pike's place, either is less than a 15 min walk away. Would definitely stay again!
26116	6316917	9.0	10.0	33461983	Sid was so accommodating and helpful and the place was beautiful. Great location too. Within walking distance of so much that we wanted to do. Take advantage of the rooftop if you can. It was a nice ending to our stay to grab some local brews and go up there to watch the sun set over the mountains.
26117	6316917	9.0	10.0	33848422	Excellent apartment in the heart of Seattle!  Sid was a great host and accommodating to any issues that arose.  We would highly recommend this place to any future travelers.
26118	6316917	9.0	10.0	35138354	Great spot! The place was spotless and perfect for my extended weekend trip. The location couldn't be beat and the apartment had anything I could ask for. Would definitely stay again. Thank you Sid!
26119	6316917	9.0	10.0	35405891	Sid was great. Very fast responses to my questions. Place was clean, great location, and good extra amenities like apple TV with Netflix.

26120	6316917	9.0	10.0	35564892	This apartment was in a wonderful location. Just as advertised it was extremely close to many of the iconic Seattle landmarks.

26121	6316917	9.0	10.0	36423013	Welcoming us and being flexible. The listing was accurate. 
26122	6316917	9.0	10.0	37579035	The apartment is exactly as described. It's a clean, comfortable apartment in a cool newer looking building. The location is great if you want to stay in Belltown. Everything in the area is walkable. There is convenient parking available inside the building. Note: there isn't any A/C, which is common for Seattle, but Sid provides a couple of nice fans which kept the place cool. Only hiccup involved someone else parking on my assigned space - no prob though as Sid immediately responded and got me taken care of within minutes. All in all, we had a fantastic time in a great apartment. Sid was a wonderful host and we will certainly keep him in mind the next time we visit Seattle. 
26123	6316917	9.0	10.0	37757063	Sid was a great host! He responded quickly via e-mail and even text if needed. Instructions were clear and simple. The apartment was exactly as it was described and was very clean, which is a big thing for me. The roof top facility was a great amenity that we wished we took more advantage of. It had a great view, a fire pit, and grill. The neighborhood was hip with plenty of shops and restaurants on the same street as the apartment complex. If you don't mind walking, it's about a 15-20 min walk to Pike's place or a 3 minute drive. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Sid!
26124	6316917	9.0	10.0	38125557	"Pros:  Location can't be beat.  Walking distance to the Public Market, Space Needle, and all the shopping and restaurants you could ask for. It was a totally adequate living space with all the necessities, and the lobby of the building was very cool (ping pong, arcade games).  It was nice to have a washer and dryer available.  The best part was definitely the beautiful rooftop terrace with gorgeous views of the city and sound.  Good wifi.

Cons:  I'm being slightly harsher in my critique as it was as expensive as the Westin and being run as a business (I'd feel differently if it was someone's home or a steal of a deal), but there were some issues.  The linens smelled very bad and we had to rewash the sheets and towels.  The location is super central, but its also very loud at night, and as there's only one tiny window at the far end of the apartment for cooling, it was either listen to partying all night or endure the stuffy heat (we were there in July during a bit of a heat wave). Sid made fans available though which mercifully helped drown out some noise.  Again, my bar was high as it was being advertised as luxury, but the sheets were as cheap as they come and my back was sore in the morning from the mattress.  "
26125	6316917	9.0	10.0	38362263	Sid was very enthusiastic toward our anticipated arrival.  Superb location in the heart of Belltown and downtown Seattle energy, walking distance to trendy restaurants and night spots.  Condo complex is newer, with a contemporary feel.  Our 4th floor unit was very clean and nicely appointed.  I was pleased that there was not alot of clutter of owner's personal property around as I've seen in other rentals.  I would definitely recommend this condo and would gladly stay here again!    
26126	6316917	9.0	10.0	39287000	This place is in the perfect location! It was exactly as described, clean and convenient. I enjoyed my stay so much in Seattle, I am already looking into planning a second visit. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle, especially couples.
26127	6316917	9.0	10.0	40910897	Location Location (email hidden)e apartment had a great location - central to all of the sights including museums, Space Needle, Pikes Market and downtown shopping. It is surprisingly quiet given the fact that it is in the center of the action. The washer and dryer option was great for our weekly stay!
26128	6316917	9.0	10.0	41346748	Awesome location and everything we needed to explore Seattle for a few days. Sid was friendly and helpful and accommodating of out schedule when it changed at the last minute.
26129	6316917	9.0	10.0	42838693	Great stay here. It was super easy to get into the apartment with Sids instructions. He was available via text to answer any questions I had. The location was awesome- just steps away from bars and restaurants. The apartment was clean and the bed was super comfy. One con was that it didn't have AC but it was only warm one night we were there and we slept comfortably with the fans that were provided. I would definitely recommend this place!
26130	6316917	9.0	10.0	43243072	"He was available by phone
Great neighborhood but some aggressive panhandling "
26131	6316917	9.0	10.0	43596832	Place was fine. I wouldn't call it luxurious. No decoration. Poor ventilation. Kinda Spartan.  Good communications and great location. Lot of homeless on streets in area at night. 
26132	6316917	9.0	10.0	44108789	Perfect location, wonderful places to eat. Sid let us drop our luggage off early until our room, he was very easy to communicate  with. The rooftop patio is very relaxing and great view. Would stay again with Sid.
26133	6316917	9.0	10.0	44497996	"Sid's apartment is in a great location.  Easy to get to from mass transit.  Centrally located.  Plenty of restaurants & bars nearby.

The apartment was simple, comfortable, & clean.  It had everything I needed. I'd highly recommended it."
26134	6316917	9.0	10.0	45937798	"Sid was accommodating and always responded to us quickly.  He let us drop our luggage off a little early which was helpful. Check-in went smoothly.
The apartment is centrally located and within walking distance to many areas of interest in the city such as Pikes Place Market, Seattle Center and Pioneer Square. There are lots of restaurants close by as well, including Macrina's Bakery, a great spot for breakfast. However there are lots of homeless people walking around the area.
The apartment is modern, spacious and clean. But we didn't find it especially user friendly. The bedroom is tiny and windowless with the bed and a floor lamp being the only furniture. There are no tables or any other surfaces to put anything on in the room. The closet is large but if you are the type of traveler who likes to unpack there is only room for hanging clothes. And if you want to live out of your suitcase, there is not enough room to lay it down and open it in the bedroom so it has to go in the kitchen/living area--not convenient at all. The addition of shelves in the closet or putting a dresser in the closet as well as a bedside table would be a big improvement. The kitchen is nice with dishes, silverware and some glasses, pots/pans and even a fully stocked spice rack if you want to cook. But there is no microwave, which was the one appliance that we wanted and would seem to be the most useful appliance for travelers. There is one in the lobby lounge but again, not convenient going back and forth. The addition of a small microwave in the kitchen is another suggestion.
One of the nicest features of this place is the rooftop area which has a wonderful view of the water and mountains in the distance as well as plenty of tables/chairs, a fire pit and a grill. If the weather is nice when you are here, I would recommend taking advantage of that area."
26135	6316917	9.0	10.0	46869303	SID was a great host.  He was friendly, professional and very helpful in answering any questions I had throughout our stay. The apartment was exactly as described and was in an excellent location.  I would definitely recommend staying here and i would certainly book again if I were in the area.  
26136	6316917	9.0	10.0	47468508	Sid's apartment was in a great location, tidy, modern and light. Highly recommend for a place stay in the city. 
26137	6316917	9.0	10.0	47673434	Perfect location for a walking experience in downtown Seattle. Apartment was very clean, and looked great!  Sid was great to work with and made our stay easy.  Overall, it was a great respite in a very active city.  I would absolutely book this apartment again!
26138	6316917	9.0	10.0	49198674	"This is a great 4th floor apartment in a nice lively part of town with a grocery store close by as well as a bunch of restaurants. 

I had one small issue with the apartment - the lack of a microwave oven. (The apartment building does have a microwave on the ground floor that is used by all the building residents.) "
26139	6316917	9.0	10.0	49425789	Sid is an awesome host with a great condo in Belltown! He was incredibly easy to communicate with and VERY flexible interns of early luggage drop off and holding. I greatly appreciate him being so accommodating and making our stay in Seattle perfect! I will definitely stay with him again and recommend his great home to others who visit. 
26140	6316917	9.0	10.0	49847554	Had a very smooth and relaxing stay at Sid's place! He was very helpful and informative with an earlier check-in so that we could drop our luggage off. The entire process was easy and quick. The apartment was clean and comfortable in a very convenient location in Belltown (but on a nicer street, Belltown can be a bit sketchy in some parts). My boyfriend and I were in town for the Seahawks game (Go Hawks!!) so it was the perfect spot for us to crash for the night. Building was very modern and nice, bed was comfortable, I will probably try and stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle!
26141	6316917	9.0	10.0	50172038	"The apartment was really nice. Everything seemed new. Great location. All bedding, towels and kitchen supplies are available. 

Sid was easy to work with. The apartment was just what we were looking for as a place to land while we explored Seattle."
26142	6316917	9.0	10.0	52147303	Very good stay. Sid was super responsive on the phone or via messaging. 
26143	6316917	9.0	10.0	52748792	Check in was seamless and the apartment was fantastic.  The location was perfect.  We had  breakfast at the Buiscuit Bitch.  High Tea at the Edgewater and dinner show at Tula's.  Lots to do.  Lots to enjoy.  Thanks.

26145	6316917	9.0	10.0	53403403	Sid's home was as advertised - clean, beautiful and the location was spot on. On top of that, Sid was responsive, accommodating and made us feel at home.  I can't stress enough how spectacular the home was!  The rooftop offered amazing views and there was endless above average food options. We were able to walk to the aquarium as well as Pike Place market. Highly recommended!  
26146	6316917	9.0	10.0	53848714	Had a great time staying at Sid's place, it was an amazing location with a restaurant/brewery on the ground floor and coffee shop around the corner. Sid's place was warm, clean, and welcoming. Thanks!
26147	6316917	9.0	10.0	54030787	We had a great experience.  Sid made the process of checking in and out and using the parking space very easy.  Apartment was spotless and modern. The high speed internet was easy to connect to.    Bed was comfortable.  Location in Belltown was easy walking distance to many attractions. Modern exercise room had plenty of equipment.
26345	4053644	9.0	10.0	20048375	"Great location centrally located in all of what Seattle has to offer! It was a short walk to Pike Place Market, the Seattle Center, and pretty much all small shops or restaurants in Downtown. Zipcars, the Link Light Rail, and buses are all close as well if you want to go further. 

Meg's place is amazing, and it's filled with lots of natural light and is incredibly spacious. Her service and hospitality during our stay is definitely one of the highlights of our trip. Book her place for your next trip to Seattle!"
26346	4053644	9.0	10.0	20518322	Meg's apartment is right in the middle of everything, so it's great walking distance. It's a little noisy at night outside, but it's right on the transportation lines so you also have easy access to that. We had a great stay!
26347	4053644	9.0	10.0	21256505	Meg's apartment is great! It is very centrally located and you could walk to Pike's Place Market and the Space Needle. Lots of restaurants and things to see in the area. The apartment was very clean and the building was nice. 
26348	4053644	9.0	10.0	33269846	The location of Meg's apartment is great; walking distance to many of the great things Seattle has to offer.  Apartment was just what we needed and then some.  We went out to eat each night, but if we had wanted, we would have been able to pick up fresh fish at Pike Place Market and cook in the kitchen!
26349	4053644	9.0	10.0	36020459	Place was fantastic and completely as advertised. Host uses (website hidden) but the listing doesn't say that at this time.
26724	1084084	9.0	10.0	7835753	"The condo was centrally located, clean and had plenty of space for two co-workers traveling together. 

I'd stay here again while traveling to Seattle. "
26725	1084084	9.0	10.0	13016892	Jordan's unit was great!  Access to it was well instructed and easy, and it was in a great location!  I would highly recommend this unit to others.
26726	1084084	9.0	10.0	18709578	We checked in very late, but we were still able to get to our apartment. The apartment was much better than staying in a local hotel.
26727	1084084	9.0	10.0	20347596	"PROS:

Unit has great views, was close to great venues for visitors and restaurants and very conveniently located in the city. Unit was clean and the building was very luxurious (lobby, amenities, pool, library, gym, were all fantastic). I loved the fountain lobby on the 8th floor. 

Stay Alfred was pretty great to work with, they were very responsive by phone. I told them about the issues below and they stayed in touch and were able to refund part of our stay. They have an app with all the apartment details and check in / check out were seamless. 

CONS:

2 major issues affected our stay. The unit smelled of smoke when we first arrived, enough so that I quickly became congested. It turns out the building has many smoking units and has central air so whenever neighbors smoked we would get to enjoy it. We left the doors/windows open the entire stay which minimized the smell but was inconvenient, glad it wasn't winter (note that it wasn't as bad as an actual smoking unit, leaving windows open clears it out, but still kind of nasty). The hallways reeked of smoke so imminent neighbors must be chain smokers. If you are allergic or sensitive to smoke I would steer clear. 

Blinds were inadequate to block much light, lots of ambient city light lit up rooms at night. If you prefer a dark room at night it will be hard to sleep here. "
26728	1084084	9.0	10.0	21904886	"We LOVED this apartment. Conveniently located in downtown Seattle with free parking! I'd recommend this apartment to others and will stay again when we are in Seattle. 
"
26729	1084084	9.0	10.0	31358634	We had a fantastic stay at the Metropolitan Tower during our trip to Seattle.  The apartment was very clean, modern, and well furnished, with private washer and dryer, very convenient!  Jordan even has detergent provided!  The view was great!  Being in a corner of the building, the room provides a 180 degree view of the lovely Seattle streets below.  The location is close to everything, less than 3 minutes driving to Pike Place market and 5-10 minutes to get to the Space Needle.   Jordan was very accommodating and adjusted his schedule in order to fit ours in.  His instructions and guidelines are very concise and straight forward.  I especially enjoy the app (Alfreds) made specifically for our place.  It made navigation and finding places such a breeze!  I know exactly where to stay for my next trip to Seattle.  Thank you Jordan!
26730	1084084	9.0	10.0	32562396	Great experience, would stay again
26731	1084084	9.0	10.0	41215351	Amazing apartment! Really large space. The two bedrooms were a good size and the master bedroom had a spacious walk in closest type area and a great ensuite. The living room area was big enough that we could put out the two trundle beds and still have the couches as a living area. The location was ideal, walking distance to the market (10mins max). There were also toiletries for us which was good. The only slight issues were that the trundle beds were not that comfortable and there were only four chairs for the dining table. Since it is meant to sleep 6 more chairs would be better. But it was a great apartment and the building had a swimming pool, gym and outside area. Everyone there was so friendly. 
26732	1084084	9.0	10.0	41600275	"The metro apartments were absolutely amazing! We got amazing feedback from the group staying there. People were very comfortable.

31774	3489083	10.0	10.0	22354368	"The apartment at The Post was absolutely perfect. Brand new apartment, with unparalleled views, in a great location. I was able to walk to everything I wanted to see. It's walking distance to Century Link Field, to Pike's Place Market, and to the Space Needle (if you like walking).

It was fully equipped with bathroom essentials, cooking tools, and plenty of blankets and pillows. 

I'll definitely be back here. "
31775	3489083	10.0	10.0	23186636	The room was as described and the view was wonderful.  The amenities were very comfortable and the kitchen was well appointed for four.  The balcony on the roof is fantastic.  You can see all of Elliot Bay and into the Puget Sound, and everything from Safeco Field to well past the Ferris Wheel.  We were staying for a Seahawks game, and it was the perfect location, as we were able to walk to Century Link with no problem.  The night before the game, we walked to Pike's Place Market and back.  The shared room on the top floor are awesome with pool tables, large screen TVs, etc.  I highly recommend this location.  I would also recommend parking in the garage across from the Post bldg, toward Pioneer Square.  It was easy and inexpensive.  The only problem we had was trying to cook.  The smoke detector is almost directly over the oven, so it went off twice while we were cooking. This caused the batteries to degrade and the alarm chirped every 30 seconds throughout the night.  There was no phone line in the apartment, so we couldn't report it to the concierge.  I guess sleeping was more important than putting on clothes and going down 8 floors to report is in the lobby.  However, since it is an apartment, I don't think the concierge would have been able to do much more than give me a ladder to take the batteries out.  I would go back and recommend this place to anyone wanting the perfect location in downtown Seattle.
31776	3489083	10.0	10.0	28475482	I enjoyed my time at Anna's apartment in Seattle.  Great location and amenities and I would highly recommend it!

We never felt any reason to feel unsafe in a part of the city where most other common  hotels are located. It was a perfect location for walking anywhere, being within a mile of many key sites and restaurants that we had prior reservations and tickets for. 

I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Seattle."

Wife had spent the previous two weeks in Hong Kong so having a w/d in the unit was more than appreciated.

All-in-all, it was a terrific experience.  Would, and probably will, stay here again on our next trip."

It was so easy to walk to Pike Place Market, Restaurants, groceries, etc.  I can see how some might find the initial access through the garage a bit confusing, but that's just it, it was only for the initial access with luggage and all.  After that, you can easily come and go through the front door.  Honestly, we found it all a bit ""James Bond-ish"".  You'll understand if you rent this great place.  Thanks again to our great hosts who were easily reachable for questions."
32477	6344566	10.0	10.0	47328557	Great space! Walking distance to everything we wanted. House was clean and quiet. Loved it. 
32478	6344566	10.0	10.0	47543688	Great location! Clean place! Just what we wanted. 
32479	6344566	10.0	10.0	47876631	Thorough, specific communication re: keys, location, procedures. Great location. Clean place with nice view. Place was exactly as described.
32480	6344566	10.0	10.0	48053262	I did not get to meet Charlotte but she responded to my request within an hour and was very courteous and helpful throughout the duration of my visit, directing me where I could park and was super understanding regarding being late for checkout as I was worried I would not be able to make it in time for check out as I was in the city for some job interviews with some local companies. She was very kind and wished me luck! The apartment itself was very clean, had all the amenities I needed. I actually enjoyed the view, sure you may hear some sirens at night but when you're downtown in a busy city such as Seattle you have to expect that. IT IS FASTER THAN CHECK IN AT A HOTEL.  Getting in to the building was not hard, Charlotte's instructions are pretty straightforward. However the only struggle I had was finding  the key, but only because Google Maps had me go behind the street where I needed to... so keep that in mind if you're using google maps to find the location. The location of the apartment itself is great and is within walking distance of shopping, bars and groceries (if you want to have a romantic meal inside). The bathroom Clairols Herbal Essence Shampoo & Conditioner (the blue bottle coconut scent one) and soap, Q-tips, and sanitary items. In summary, this truly is a luxury apartment and I would definitely have this be my first choice for a trip to Seattle.
32481	6344566	10.0	10.0	48233356	Great neighborhood.  I liked the space and the instructions were impeccable.  I had no problem accessing the space at all.  
32482	6344566	10.0	10.0	48557048	Great, easy, safe, comfortable stay. Location was perfect for seeing the sights. My wife and I visited for our 10yr wedding anniversary and had an amazing time. When we make it back to the nw, this will def be where we stay again. 
32483	6344566	10.0	10.0	49017003	Great apartment in a very nice building. Centrally located with easy access to everything. The apartment was as described and you're able to arrive at any time.
32484	6344566	10.0	10.0	49257396	This studio was ideal for me: easy check in/out for a quick trip, convenient downtown location, central to Link and my conference, and some extra space and kitchen that indeed make it more luxurious than any hotel room.  Charlotte was a great virtual host too. Responsive and informative.  If I'm in Seattle for a similar situation, I would definitely stay here again.
32485	6344566	10.0	10.0	49881366	This place is fantastic. Extremely clean and well decorated. It is small and quaint and in the middle of everything. We walked everywhere. The check-in and check-out process was perfectly smooth. And communications with Charlotte were prompt and detailed and friendly. She is very accommodating.  I highly recommend this very nice place!!
32486	6344566	10.0	10.0	50277327	The apartment was just as shown! Great location and an easy walk up to Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square or to Pike Place Market! The apartment itself was very clean and she provided clean towels as well..which really helped us in lightening our load while packing! It was also nice to have access to a full-sized kitchen for cooking things fresh from the market.  
32487	6344566	10.0	10.0	50607714	"The studio is centrally located, very well-kept and clean.  The check-in/out process is very streamlined with detailed instructions.

The building interior is very new, but I think because the exterior is preserving a historic look, the windows are of an older style so street noise does come in.  It did not bother us, but just note that it's not like a typical new high-rise where the interior is near-silent.

Parking is $35/day at the building; street parking is extremely limited in this part of downtown.

If you want a hotel-like, hassle-free experience, then this is it."
32488	6344566	10.0	10.0	51528555	Amazing apartment in downtown Seattle.  Description/pictures were accurate.  Great communication with host prior to arrival.  Easy check-in and check-out.  No need for a car, as public transportation is close by and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this property and host.  
32489	6344566	10.0	10.0	51800306	Nice place ! comfy bed. 
32490	6344566	10.0	10.0	52481581	Well, upon arrival the place was a total mess - dirty sheets and towels, stuff tossed around the room, dirty dishes, etc.  The host was gracious, though, and it appears that their cleaning schedule was messed up that day.  But the host did make good and the rest of the stay was very nice.  The location can't be beat if you want to walk around the retail part of the city and the waterfront markets.  It is a very secure building too, with mostly professionals living there.  I would stay again - but only if the place is clean when I arrive.
32491	6344566	10.0	10.0	52801325	Our stay at Charlottes downtown Seattle apartment was excellent. From start to finish Charlotte was super attentive making sure my boyfriend and I had everything we needed for a satisfying stay. Once we got there the stay was just as great. A very comfortable, and beautiful spot in a fantastic location in downtown Seattle. We had the perfect staycation! I would 100% recommend this spot to anyone of my friends and family. 
32492	6344566	10.0	10.0	53073963	We really enjoyed staying in this studio apartment in the heart of downtown- it's located within steps of the University link rail stop, and is walking distance to Pike Place, Pioneer Square and Seattle Center. Charlotte was very helpful and gave precise instructions for accessing the apartment. The unit was clean and had useful amenities including a refrigerator, microwave, stove, washing machine and dryer. Highly recommended for a short stay in downtown Seattle.
32493	6344566	10.0	10.0	53166475	The check-in/out experience was seamless. The location was perfect one block from the train from the airport. I had a wonderful stay, and everything was to my liking.
32494	6344566	10.0	10.0	53324332	Charlotte was a wonderful host and the luxury apartment in the heart of downtown Seattle was perfect for our weekend stay. It was very clean and spacious and in short walking distance to many of Seattle's top destinations. There were great options for food and drinks in the area and I would highly recommend staying here to get the full Seattle experience! 
32495	6344566	10.0	10.0	53830533	Exactly as advertised. Charlotte was very responsive, the location was great and the apartment was very well maintained. If you are looking for a hotel experience in your Airbnb this is the place. 
32496	6344566	10.0	10.0	54000836	This place was very nice and clean. It was spotless and well-kept. It is located in a nice area, a very centralized location. It is about a 10 minute walk from Pike's Place. Additionally, it is right above the light rail station, which is a huge added bonus! Only things I didn't like were: 1. noise level- windows are paper-thin; they let in all the noise and is especially noticeable during the night and 2. you have to be discreet about the place, which made me feel a little uncomfortable.
32497	6344566	10.0	10.0	54362192	The location is near everything downtown. Great area and cool view. It was a clean and chic apartment and it was in a lovely historical building. If you have a car, be ready to spend a lot of money on parking, $35 a day. 
32498	6344566	10.0	10.0	54845270	Great spot - it was very clean and was within walking distance to many of the places I wanted to visit. Free wifi and netflix was a nice bonus too. Located on the same block as the light rail stop which got me from the airport in 30 mins for $3.
32499	6344566	10.0	10.0	55043632	Charlotte's apt is awesome, all the stuff in home is good and even prepare some tableware. So kind. If next time I go to Seattle again, I will definitely choose this apt again. 
32500	6344566	10.0	10.0	55351776	"Excellent communication by the host. Explicit directions of how to get there and get in. 

Immaculate unit. Clean, well appointed and in an amazing location."
32501	6344566	10.0	10.0	55666220	Charlotte is an excellent host who provides clear instructions and impeccable lodging. Thanks again. 
32502	6344566	10.0	10.0	56217090	Charlotte's place was perfect for a quick Seattle stay, and it was exactly as described in the info and comments. Initially, I was a bit concerned about the arrival instructions - they did seem complicated, but they are spot on, and I the building was easily accessible and very clean. I would definitely stay here again!
32503	6344566	10.0	10.0	56647982	Great place to stay in downtown Seattle. If you have the chance book this place. Super clean large bed, laundry, full kitchen and great view of downtown Seattle. Easy walking distance to downtown, Pike Market & Capital Hill.
32504	6344566	10.0	10.0	56750797	The host was extremely easy to get ahold of. They left an umbrella, coffee, toiletries and made the apartment feel extremely comfortable. 
32505	6344566	10.0	10.0	57101074	The apartment was just as described, very clean and centrally located. She provides clear and concise instructions which were of great help. No negative feedback!
34324	7828222	9.0	10.0	44220978	"The room is simple and the neighborhood is quiet, it's 10 mins walk to downtown, very convenient!
Lubna was amazing, never get to meet her since she's out of the country, but she checks on me to make sure everything are well, great communications!  "
34325	7828222	9.0	10.0	44366506	Nice and friendly hosts. The place was very spacious and cozy too. Great location. Recommend!
34326	7828222	9.0	10.0	48543086	Lubna's place was great! Very centrally located, enough room to sleep and relax, and very clean and tidy. We were able to get around very easily, walking to Capitol Hill and Downtown and using Uber and Lyft to get up to UW for a football game. She met us at the apartment and even drove us to dinner on the first night! Thank you so much!
34647	3906076	10.0	10.0	18967808	This is the perfect little apartment. Very comfortable, tidy and clean. The location is incredibly central and easily within walking distance to the waterfront and to numerous restaurants and bars. The convention center is literally next door so very convenient for any conventions. Ezana was very hospital and went out of his way to ensure we had a comfortable stay. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Seattle.
34648	3906076	10.0	10.0	19291849	Ezana was such a great hosts. Everything was very streamline and easy. Our schedule was accommodated. Ezana checked in with us the very next day after our first night just to make sure we were ok and to let us know if we needed anything we could contact with any questions. Condo is exactly how described and pictures shown. The entire condo was stocked with anything you could ever need. It was a great location. We walked everywhere. We didn't even get a car because all we needed to see was right up the street. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this place!  
34649	3906076	10.0	10.0	19430259	Thank you Ezana for providing a wonderful clean cozy place for me to stay on my recent trip to Seattle.  You made it quite easy by meeting when I arrive, and thank you for giving me tips on places to eat, drink etc..Your place is centrally located and within a short walk to downtown Seattle. The proximity to convention centre is unbelievably close, so this is a great place if you're attending a conference.  I will definitely recommend your place to any friends of mine who may be visiting Seattle in the future. Thanks again!
34650	3906076	10.0	10.0	19697933	This was my first visit to Seattle and Enzana (owner) was very helpful with recommendations, and very accommodating in regards to our arrival and departure.  He even had a bottle of wine and a welcome message which pleasant and inviting touch. My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay at this property. It is right in the heart of Seattle, and only a few blocks away from shopping, bars, and food. The apartment is quiet and extremely comfortable. I would stay at this property again in a heartbeat. I can't think of a single negative comment to make. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle. Amazing host, amazing property, and an amazing city. 
34651	3906076	10.0	10.0	19973524	It was great. Easy, good communication, place was clean, and everything was ready to go.
34652	3906076	10.0	10.0	20152600	"We recently stayed at Ezana's place for a long weekend.  Ezana went above and beyond to make us feel at home.  He was incredibly responsive to text messages and emails, and checking in at the apartment was a breeze.

The apartment is just as represented in the pictures.  It is clean and relatively spacious for a 1-br.  Ezana was kind enough to give us a bottle of Washington wine for our stay, which was such a treat.  He even thinks of little things that make traveling easier, like mini-toothpastes, mouthwashes, soaps, etc.  He also stocked the fridge with a ton of bottled water.  Again, way above and beyond our expectations, and made our trip so much easier and more fun.

Ezana knows Seattle very well and is happy to provide his insights about restaurants, parks, etc.  We were in Seattle with a toddler, and Ezana responded very quickly to a text asking about a good outdoor area for our little one to run around.

Overall, this is a great place and nice value.  We would happily stay here again if our travels bring us back to Seattle.  Book with confidence!"
34653	3906076	10.0	10.0	20458059	Ezana was an amazing host, and my boyfriend and I couldn't have asked for a better apartment for our vacation stay. The location was perfect; Pike Place Market, the light rail station (goes to the airport), monorail to Seattle Center, and many bus lines were all accessible within a few blocks.  The apartment itself was clean and Ezana even left out mini toiletries for us.  There is a laundry room down the hallway which was great for us since we were almost running out of clothes after having spent a few days in SF prior to arriving in Seattle.
34654	3906076	10.0	10.0	20628167	I had a great stay! The unit is right next to the convention center. I rented a car, but really wish I hadn't (minimum $20 a day parking at nearby lots). The place was clean, had all the amenities needed, and Ezana was very helpful!
34655	3906076	10.0	10.0	21960359	Stayed at Ezana's place last weekend while in town for a conference. The place is nice, clean, and perfectly located close to Pike street and the convention center. Would not hesitate to stay there again in the future.

34659	3906076	10.0	10.0	24765789	"Ezana's condo was perfect for our visit to Seattle. It was walking distance to all of our destinations, public transportation, and grocery stores. It was clean and had all of the basics. The bed was really comfortable, wifi was strong, the water pressure was (email hidden)l in all, a great place to stay.
Ezana was very pleasant, accommodating, and responsive to my questions both before and during our stay. I definitely recommend this listing!"

The location is so convenient (right near the convention center) when arriving from the airport, and it's just a short walk down to Downtown and Pike Market or up the hill into Capitol Hill.  Ezana had a lovely bottle of wine and two glasses waiting for us upon our arrival, and she was even able to accommodate our later departure and let us keep our bags at her place while we explored the city. Thank you Ezana!!  
34662	3906076	10.0	10.0	26548694	"Ezana was very nice! He showed me the building and the apartment. He was always available for me in case I need anything related to the apartment or the city itself. 
The listing was completely accurate. Even though the building has many years, the apartment is in very good conditions. You can tell that Ezana takes care of every detail.
The apartment location is the best, near everything and on a quite quiet street. 
"
34663	3906076	10.0	10.0	28394163	The condo was wonderful. Within walking distance of almost everything and the condo, impeccably clean.  This was our first Airbnb experience and our host was accommodating above and beyond my expectations. Could not recommend more highly.
34664	3906076	10.0	10.0	28701423	Ezana is a lovely host! There was a bottle of wine on the counter for us when we arrived (though we didn't drink it) and he was prompt in helping when something went wrong.

34666	3906076	10.0	10.0	29914163	The condo was wonderful!  Great location and clean and homey.  It was a breeze to get to the convention center every day and it's a great jumping off point for other destinations in Seattle.  Thank you!
34667	3906076	10.0	10.0	30499212	"I was visiting Seattle for a conference being held at the Washington State Convention Center in downtown (4 minute walk). I couldn't have found a better and more convenient place to stay. Ezana's condo has easy and walkable access to many of Seattle's amenities including downtown, Pikes Place Market, and the Capital Hill neighborhood. 

I got into town late on a Friday night and Ezana ensured that I knew my way to the condo and had immediate access. Ezana was great about checking in with me and making sure my stay was a comfortable one. While I didn't spend much time at the condo, I always looked forward to a good nights rest that I knew I could rely on. The bed is great, and the condo is located in a very quiet edge of downtown.

Overall Ezana and his place provided everything I needed: close proximity to downtown, a great place to crash, a great price, and an accommodating host. Perfect."
34668	3906076	10.0	10.0	31572962	Ezena is a great and responsive host. We stayed here while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center and it was perfect, only 4 minutes walking to the conference center. I really enjoyed the stay. Thank you so much for your help and valuable information.
34669	3906076	10.0	10.0	31769170	Ezana was great and made us feel very welcome! We stayed here while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center and it was perfect.  It was very close to the venue and only a 2 min walk down some stairs to get there.  The apartment was just like described and was close to many things within walking distance, we really enjoyed our stay!
34670	3906076	10.0	10.0	32565161	Me and a friend came to Seattle on pleasure and had an awesome time. Ezana's place was perfect! It was so close to both downtown and Captial Hill, walking distance to everything. We could walk down to Pikes Place for breakfast every morning. The pictures do not do the place justice, it was very clean and had everything that we needed! The bed was extremely comfortable especially after a long day or exploring the city. Ezana was a great host, he made sure we had everything we needed and was always there if we had any questions. Very knowledgable and a hospitable host. We would most definitely stay here again if we ever make the trip back out to Seattle! I highly recommend staying here if you want to be close to everything in the city! Fantastic location! 
34671	3906076	10.0	10.0	33780676	"Ezana is a very sympathetic, friendly and totally uncomplicated guy. He showed us everything in detail, gave us recommendations for stuff to do in town - and he even took us with his car to the airport. 

There is probably everything you need right around the corner, like a grocery store, Starbucks, restaurants, cafes, ect. 

The nice apartment is located right in the center of Seattle. It has Wifi/internet, cable and all that tech stuff. In the kitchen there is everything you need - there was also battled water in the fridge and ice cubes in the freezer. And there was just everything else you can imagine: batteries, pens, a complete toilet tree (even shaving foam) and much more stuff I just cannot remember. So if you forgot to put something in your bag - a substitution is probably there anyways. 

The apartment is clean and comfy, however it can get a bit noisy because of the highway that is kind of close (however, for us this was not a big deal).

I would totally book this place again and would recommend it."
34672	3906076	10.0	10.0	34141954	The location was excellent - very close to everything downtown, the shopping district and Pike Place Market.  I was staying in Seattle for a conference at the Sheraton and was very easy to walk there and took less than 5 minutes! Ezana was great in making me and my friend feel welcome - even had a bottle of wine for us! 
34673	3906076	10.0	10.0	34701696	Ezana was an excellent host. His place was fantastic and in an awesome location. He was extremely accommodating, even allowing us to sign out a bit later.
34674	3906076	10.0	10.0	35371131	"Excellent location, less than a 10 min walk up the hill from Pikes Market, probably one of the most convenient locations I have ever stayed at in a major city. Also right down the street from Capital Hill. My wife and I rented a car and there is free parking less than 250ft from the front door. The apartment felt very homie and was just the right fit for us two (even had umbrellas ready for us!)

To cap off this spectacular apartment, Ezana is that much better of a host. He was available day and night and answered any question we threw at him. He also gave us suggestions on where to go and gave a dead honest local's opinion on Trip Advisor spots, which was much appreciated. When we go back to Seattle, we are definitely staying here!"
34675	3906076	10.0	10.0	35776037	Nice apartment, fabulous location, and a truly wonderful host. 5 stars all the way!!

34677	3906076	10.0	10.0	36513787	Great place, great location, great host! This was the perfect place for us as I attended a conference at the convention center. The center is just up some stairs and across a park-very convenient. Ezana gave us a nice welcome and was available if needed. I'd stay here again if I had a reason to visit downtown Seattle. 
34678	3906076	10.0	10.0	37645009	"Awesome place nearby everything! If you never been to Seattle like me you'll really love the location! I had been there in July with my fiancée and we loved it!
There are a lot of places to go nearby and also it's pretty easy to get public transportation (Link, Monorail, Streetcar and buses). If you decide to use the public transportation I would strongly recommend to buy an ORCA card and add a Day Pass every day you need ($8 to get any bus and Link all day long).
Ezana was waiting for us when we arrived and talked about all the things we needed to know of the apartment and the building. He had been very helpful even prior to our stay when we asked him some questions. Sadly we'd been there for just a few days and we hadn't had much time to interact with him as we had been really busy.
Anyway, Ezana is a great host which even left us a bottle o wine upon our arrival! Deeply recommended!"

34682	3906076	10.0	10.0	39615648	Ezana met us at the door after an eight hour train ride.  He showed us the apartment and even left us  a bottle of red wine to enjoy.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and close to all the places we wanted to visit.  His list on the refrigerator was very helpful.  We would highly recommend this as a place to stay in Seattle. 
34683	3906076	10.0	10.0	40086485	Ezana was a great host. He was there to meet us and give us helpful information about Seattle's sights. The place was spacious and very comfortable. The location was also great as it is within walking distance of downtown and many buses. 
34684	3906076	10.0	10.0	40902208	This place was great and Ezana was a great host. He greeted us when we first got there and made sure that our questions were answered. He gave good advice on where to go in downtown Seattle for what we were looking to do. The condo is exactly as described. It looks exactly like the pics. It close enough to downtown that a can ride is super inexpensive and walking was no problem. In fact we walked everywhere! It was great though. I would definitely stay here again if I came to Seattle if Ezana would have me.
34685	3906076	10.0	10.0	41926004	Had a great experience. He was there to greet me first thing, and made sure to explain everything I needed to know. Left us every single thing we needed to live like we where at home. Couldn't ask for anything more, highest recommendation 
34686	3906076	10.0	10.0	43615704	The condo was really fantastic. Everything was centrally located and it was so easy to get everywhere in the city. The condo looks exactly like the pictures and is very clean. Ezana was a great host and the listing had everything that we needed. He was also extremely accommodating when a flight delay meant that he had to meet us really late upon arrival. When we did come in, he took the time to show us a map of the city and pointed out key sights. Definitely whole-heartedly recommend this listing! 
34687	3906076	10.0	10.0	44124052	I would definitely stay here again if I ever come to Seattle again. The place is conveniently located next to all the downtown main attractions. The apt. is well maintained and look just like the pictures.  Ezana is  a great host and took the time to explain everything including showing us attractions around the area. 
34688	3906076	10.0	10.0	45361616	"The host could not have been better if he tried :) He was an absolutely awesome host with tons of recommendations for the area and was more than readily available for us. 

The location was exactly as described, we totally loved the apartment and the building it was in. I totally didn't realize the air conditioning units were not the norm in Seattle lol so the first night was a little warm, but the rest of the nights were actually cool so it was perfect. The apartment comes with a free standing fan that certainly helped too :)

This rental is centrally located allowing extremely easy access to the convention center, shops, restaurants, and even Pike Place Market!

Would absolutely stay here again :D"
34689	3906076	10.0	10.0	45944974	Very well located in central Seattle.  Clean and comfortable.  Ezana provided a great bottle of wine to welcome our (4) day visit.  We were within walking distance to shopping and great restaurants (you really don't need to rent a car, if central Seattle is where your activities are).   Uber was very useful, when were late for dinner.  Cost from the Needle, about $4-5, back to the apartment.  Thank you scheduling a little rain for our visit...  We (from CA) almost forgot what rain looked like.   We would come back again,  Ben & Debbie
34690	3906076	10.0	10.0	46697344	"Ezana was a great and kind host, and his condo was really great. His condo was well equipped and clean, and the location was perfect for me!!
The Washington Convention Center was very close from his condo, so it was very convenient for me to attend the meeting at WCC. And the grocery and good cafe were within 3-minute walk distance. 
I recommend his condo to my friends!"
34691	3906076	10.0	10.0	47168592	"I was very pleased overall with my stay at Ezana's condo. Communication with him before and during my trip was always responsive and efficient. We unfortunately did not get to meet upon my arrival, so Ezana left the condo keys in a lock box which was very easy to find with his thorough instructions during check in.

The condo is conveniently located in a central area. My bf and I were able to walk to Pikes Place in 15-20 mins literally every day! I also liked that it was a few blocks away from Capitol Hill, which offered many restaurant choices and some few boutique shops.

The condo itself was very tidy and exactly as described in the posting and pictures. It was the perfect size for two people and equipped with all the basic necessities. He even left a bottle of wine which we appreciated a lot! He had many brochures, maps and magazines with all things Seattle if you needed more info or any tips for your stay.

I would recommend Ezana's place if you are looking for a place to stay and enjoy Seattle.
"
34692	3906076	10.0	10.0	47964963	Ezana was great, the places was just ask described and pictured, not problems, very helpful and knowledgable about the area. 
34693	3906076	10.0	10.0	49100484	The condo met my needs well.  Ezana met me at the front door and oriented me to the condo.  The condo, while older is very well maintained and clean.  The location was convenient to the Convention Center and more affordable than the local hotels.
34694	3906076	10.0	10.0	49800340	This is where you want to stay in Seattle. It is in the perfect location. Steps (seriously about 100 feet) from downtown, Pikes Place Market, a wonderful restaurant corridor, across the street from amazing coffee, and about 4 blocks to the bustling fun nightlife. With all of this Seattle still manages to be quaint, quiet, and family friendly. Our host should teach other hosts how to act. He was attentive ( texting back right away and meeting us at the apartment at our convenience!) he then took 5 minutes to tell us how to get around Seattle with a map. The apartment is actually more beautiful than the pictures. And the cleanest one I've ever been in. He provided wine! Toothpaste and mouthwash, yogurt and water. Wow! Oh and the apartment is on a quiet street with lush trees and on a side street so nice privacy. Best airbnb I've been in. Thanks!!
34695	3906076	10.0	10.0	50745323	I had a great stay at Ezana's condo in Seattle. The location is perfect, just between downtown and Capitol Hill, meaning that I could get everywhere on foot very easily. The condo is very well appointed, and is very accurately described in the text and photos. The immediate surroundings can be a bit eerie at night (particularly with the seemingly large population of homeless people in Seattle), but I did not feel unsafe at any moment. There are lots of great eateries nearby, and I would strongly recommend Café Victrola on Pike and Li'l Woody's Burger on Pine. Ezana is a very accommodating host, and made me feel super welcome. I would not hesitate to recommend or stay again.
34696	3906076	10.0	10.0	52080524	Ezana was communicative, helpful, and friendly. The place was spotless and comfortable. Highly recommended!
34697	3906076	10.0	10.0	52637946	Ezana was very communicative and easy to deal with. the condo is just as described. Had a very pleasant time there, it is located a few hundred feet from the WA convention center which was my destination so that was very convenient. The place was clean and fully equipped. I will be renting from Ezana again next year for my annual conference.
34698	3906076	10.0	10.0	53518660	"Ezana’s apartment was exactly as described and made for a perfect extended weekend stay in Seattle! I was attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center, and I had the freedom to come back between sessions because the apartment was just a couple minute walk right around the corner.  Capitol Hill, Pike’s Place Market, and downtown are all short walks as well. 

The apartment itself is nice and spacious, with ample room for the two of us.  The pictures and description give a great idea of what to expect, and the kitchen is fully stocked if you want to do some cooking.  Communication with Ezana was easy and efficient.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
34699	3906076	10.0	10.0	54856937	Ezana's made the entire process wonderful, from email communications to meeting me onsite.  I loved this roomy one bedroom condo.  Nice amenities include a bit kitchen, dishwasher, roomy bathroom and a large bedroom.  The location is perfect to all downtown activities on a quite peaceful street.
35071	9236961	10.0	10.0	55292032	the room was completely clean. I liked the apt a lot. The owner will not present at any time. 
35072	8065531	10.0	10.0	45352342	"Aaron is an extremely warm, helpful and accommodating guy. On the first night, despite us arriving so late, he walked us out to ensure we got a proper parking space and even accompanied us to the pizza spot nearby (which is amazing btw, it's called Hot Mama's at 700 E Pine St). The location of Aaron's crib is excellent!! We loved being at Cap Hill. It felt safe too. When we arrived, he told us that we wouldn't need to drive much and that turned out to be entirely true! We walked almost everywhere; it's perhaps an easy 5-minute walk to the Starbucks Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room, Victrola Coffee Roasters and about 15/20-minute walk to Pike Place Market which we loved for its variety of food and other products. The kitchen is pretty well-equipped and very clean. There were also fresh towels in the bathroom. The room itself wasn't particularly fancy but had everything we needed- clean sheets, comfy bed, a big mirror, hangars. We'd stay at Aaron's again in a heartbeat if we come back to visit! 

Thanks so much!"
35073	8065531	10.0	10.0	45879796	Host was very welcoming, came out to the nearest intersection to greet and lead me to his place since I had to street park a couple blocks down. Place was very clean, hotel-like, and had all the basic amenities I could need plus washer & dryer which is a definite plus had I stayed a couple days longer. Would definitely consider staying here again if I'm in the area in the future. Location is great too, walking distance from Honey Hole and Starbucks Reserved, even Pike Place Market is a doable 30 min walk. I only wish I had parking access in the underground garage.
35074	8065531	10.0	10.0	46338757	Aaron war hilfsbereit, freundlich und hat uns mit Rat und Tat zur Seite gestanden. Die Wohnung und das Gästeschlafzimmer waren hell und schön. Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen und man kann alle wichtigen Dinge sehr gut zu Fuß erreichen. 
35075	8065531	10.0	10.0	47895283	Aaron was very accommodating with beverage and toiletries. The apartment is walking distance to downtown and close to many bars. I would stay here again.  
35076	8065531	10.0	10.0	48250526	I had a great time in Seattle and Aaron's place was perfect for the few days I stayed there. Aaron was a great host and was very helpful in terms of local knowledge. The apartment was close to downtown and public transport. So it was great staying there. My only issue was the parking which was advertised as free and one of my main reason why I choose the place.  
35077	8065531	10.0	10.0	48909114	Had a great time in Seattle and Aaron did an excellent job hosting. The room was clean, the location was perfect, and he gave great recommendations on restaurants and coffee shops to visit. Highly recommend.

I arrived on a late train - which also was delayed, Aaron stayed up to welcome me, even though he had a very early morning the next day. "
35080	8065531	10.0	10.0	51344034	Aaron lives in great location and was an awesome host. Everything is so close by. I used uber and everything was very reasonable and cost from 5 to 7 dollars for a ride. I had arrived to Seattle a little earlier than what i had expected and he was able to take care of everything for me. He really went out of the way to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. As well the bed was super comfortable and I was able to fall asleep in minutes. Thanks for everything brother.
35081	8065531	10.0	10.0	52542859	Pleasant space.  Good location. Aaron was easy to contact at all times
35082	8065531	10.0	10.0	54264122	친절하고 부엌도 좋아서 음식해먹기가 아주 자유로웠다. 주차는 안되지만 Aaron이 주차비용을 40불 주어서 그 금액으로 주변 Parking lot에 주차할 수 있었다.
35083	8065531	10.0	10.0	56408617	Aaron's apartment was exactly as described and what I was looking for. The apartment was very clean and in an accessible spot of town, and I was able to walk everywhere (specifically the convention center, Pike Market & Seattle Center). Since Aaron was away, he had a friend check me in who was very friendly and helpful and gave lots of recommendations for places to check out in the area. Also the apartment is in a gated community which gave me extra comfort (not that it would be unnecessary since the neighborhood felt very safe). I would definitely recommend Aaron's place!
35108	4410544	10.0	10.0	22553246	Great location, great building, and great apt! Well decorated. I would highly recommend staying there.
35109	4410544	10.0	10.0	23920873	When my mother was moved into Swedish Hospital from where we live in Alaska, I was in a bind and needed a place near the hospital to stay with a couple of my family members while my mother was admitted.  When I found Miranda's apartment on AIRB&B, it looked amazing and I booked it as soon as I could. Miranda and the beautiful apartment  were simply AMAZING! She was very responsive to all of my questions, met me at the door of the apartment, showed me around and made sure my family and I were 100% comfortable.  She was exactly what my family needed during this tough time. She has gone above and beyond to help us in any way possible. If you are going to stay in Seattle, Miranda is the best possible person to work with and I cannot recommend her highly enough! Thank you for everything Miranda, we can't thank you enough!
35110	4410544	10.0	10.0	24275608	Very nice experience! And a great place to live!

35114	4410544	10.0	10.0	25238667	Miranda was a great host and the apartment was amazing. It was very spacious and clean, and we were even welcomed with a complimentary bottle of wine.

35115	4410544	10.0	10.0	26069677	A great place to stay. Clean, comfortable and convenient. Walking distance to the fish market and convention center. I really enjoyed my stay here. Much more spacious than a hotel room plus a kitchen and comfortable beds!
35116	4410544	10.0	10.0	26285320	Miranda and Mike's place is a great location in First Hill above the downtown area and easy walking distance to Capitol Hill and other hotspots in the area.  The apartment is well appointed with all you need for a short or long term stay.  Miranda is a fantastic host; easy to communicate with and very accommodating, the bottle of wine was much appreciated after a long day of travel.  I definitely recommend this place and would consider staying again if back in this part of Seattle.
35117	4410544	10.0	10.0	27757370	My friends and I had a wonderful time staying here. It was clean, fully furnished, and great location.

35120	4410544	10.0	10.0	28705219	We are a group of 3 in Seattle for an international conference. The apt. is at a really good location and nicely furnished. Only 10-15 minutes walk to the downtown area. Our host was very helpful in checking us in and providing extra supplies. We particularly love the coffee shop at the the corner of the same building.  Highly recommended!   
35121	4410544	10.0	10.0	29269798	This unit was amazing! We attended a convention at the nearby WSCC and the walking distance was just perfect.

We dealt with Eva through airbnb messaging and she was great. Eva made sure that our stay was to our liking. At one point we needed a few more towels and the next day we had towels just like that. Beds were comfy.

The location was great. Everything was in walking distance from down town. The walk back to the condo was a little hilly, but with the amount of food we ate walking felt great "
35127	4410544	10.0	10.0	34525500	We had a great time. The apt was even better than the picture. Eve met us and let us in to the unit and was very accommodating. The wine gift was greatly appreciated. I will stay here again if I can.

The location was perfect for our purposes, only a 10-minute walk to the convention center.
We would definitely book again!"
35129	4410544	10.0	10.0	35780730	Our trip to Seattle was way too short! Eve provided us with a lovely apartment, close to everything and within easy access to the freeway, which was great being a tourist. The apartment was exactly as it looked in all photos and we had everything we needed there
35130	4410544	10.0	10.0	36775571	Great location. Had a great trip to Seattle with my family. Apartment was clean and we saved some time and money making breakfast there. WiFi was good, parking wasn't an expense because we used Uber for the first three days spent in town and street parking was free in the evenings for the last half of our trip when we would take our rental car for whole day visits to Rainier, St. Helens, the San Juan Islands and Boeing. Only a couple of minor cosmetic things that Eve earnestly sought to get fixed. 
35131	4410544	10.0	10.0	37079380	Unit was as advertised. We had a great stay! Eve was super responsive throughout (from pre-booking to checkout).

35135	4410544	10.0	10.0	39938461	The apartment and Eve were both wonderful. The place was very clean, fresh and comfortable, and there was even a stylishness and modernity about the place that was quite pleasing.  Items like higher-end towels and bedding made the experience feel luxurious without its seeming pretentious or stuffy.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat-- it was the perfect amount of space for our family, with a separate bedroom for my son, so my husband and I could hangout and relax in the living room and other bedroom after he'd gone to bed. Location was within a close Uber ride to everything, though totally walkable to good stuff, too, if you don't mind a twenty minute walk (which we didn't, given the lovely weather). 
35136	4410544	10.0	10.0	40587527	This was our second trip to Seattle and the second time that we stayed at one of Eve's property's. She does not disappoint.

35139	4410544	10.0	10.0	44709344	The place itself is nice and modern. But there are a lot of problem my family encounter stayed at the apartment. First, when we first came, the door is locked. So we have to wait for her to come and open the door. Second, the table in the living room is shaky and unstable. After we tell her about it, she said that she will send someone to fix it, but even after that, the table is still unfit for use. Third, the next night the internet is out, so we have to wait for her to come by and fix it the next day. Lastly, after we left, she request  $60 saying that my family broke the lamp in the apartment. When i replied the message asking which lamp is broken, she never replied. Now i have to involve airbnb to resolve this case. Really disappointed at this listing.
35140	4410544	10.0	10.0	45065380	This was a great apartment!  Great location, walkable to tons of places. Morgan was wonderful, responded immediately, and super attentive.  10/10 would book again!

35217	3394936	9.0	10.0	20208924	"We had a wonderful stay at Rebecca's place. The best thing about it is the location. It is located just North of the hustle and bustle of Pike's market.  It is a 5-15 minute walk from all fun things - shopping, restaurants, nightlife, Pike's market, the monorail (5 mins away) to take to Chihuly/Space Needle, the largest public library in the world (10 minutes), the Duck Tour, and the Underground Tour (20 minutes).

As far as the place goes - it is a cozy place that has everything you need to enjoy a comfortable stay - lots of blankets and pillows. Has all the kitchen basics that you could think of. The furniture and the flooring are a bit dated and could use an update but everything is fully functional and in clean condition.

We had a great stay - thank you Rebecca and Doug!"
35218	3394936	9.0	10.0	25202454	"We had a wonderful time in Seattle Suites. We were greeted promptly by Doug, even though our flight was late. He showed us everything we needed to know about the apartment and even let us know some good places to explore in the neighborhood. The apartment was clean and comfortable, with a wonderful view. If it hadn't been cloudy everyday I bet it would have been even better, but hey, that is Seattle.

We were in town for a meeting at the convention center and you couldn't be any closer. We walked through the park into the back of the convention center and were in the main exhibit hall in 5 minutes."
35219	3394936	9.0	10.0	26520101	Awesome! Rebecca and Doug were both super helpful and responsive. The apartment is clean, nicely located at the heart of downtown. Walking distance to lots of shops, restaurants and bars. Also very close to the freeway so downtown traffic is not a big deal at all to get out of there. The view from the apartment is really cool. One of the best airbnb we ever tried. Thank you for the pleasant stay :-)
35220	3394936	9.0	10.0	33655674	Everything was OK! We felt like home, and the location is excellent! 5 stars!
35221	3394936	9.0	10.0	35772698	Great location to explore all that Seattle has to offer!  Very quiet building for being quite close to the highway.  Doug greeted us at the door, helped us with our bags and gave great local insights.  A great guy!
35222	3394936	9.0	10.0	36278453	"Rebecca and Doug were very nice and easily accessible for any needs. I arrived early and Doug was able to come right over and meet us. Fantastic. The appt is small and nice. Everything you need is there. I searched for accommodations for 4 people (2 parents, 1 adult daughter, 1 mostly adult son). This property is a bit too cozy for that many people. For one couple, fantastic. One couple and one other person who can sleep on a sleeper-sofa, awesome. But by the time the sleeper sofa was open, we had one of the kids sleeping practically on the kitchen floor.  If you meet the ideal group size, this is a perfect little appt to stay. 

Location location location. It does not get better than this. We did not get in our car once after we parked it the fist day. Convention?  You are literally right across the street from the center.  Here to see downtown attractions?  You are downtown. Restaurants?  Go up the hill on pike street and take your pick.  

Tips: 
1. Small. Don't go thinking you can cram extra people in here. 
2. Parking is an extra cost above what you paid through airbnb. It is reasonable and safe. 
3. If you do drive it is super easy to find and get to.  "
35223	3394936	9.0	10.0	55345058	This place is amazing and central. What you see is what you get. Doug looked after me during my two month stay. He gave me tips on where to shop for food and to get local services. And anytime I needed him to sort something out in the apartment he was there in minutes. It is the best place to be in Seattle if you are visiting for a short time.
37061	3505739	9.0	10.0	16049477	 The neighborhood was nice, beautiful houses. You can see why residents of West Seattle love living there.  The house sits on a busy street, but the living space is quite far away from the street so it's very quite and peaceful.  It feels much more remote than it actually is. The view is amazing!  The house is nicely decorated. The living area is very spacious. There are big windows looking out over Alki Beach and the sound to the Olympic Mountains and beautiful sunsets.  It's a very short walk (5-10 minutes) to the beach and restaurants.  You do have to take several steps down from the street to the front door. The host was very helpful and accomodating.
37062	3505739	9.0	10.0	16786789	Shauna has a wonderful Alki Beach view home that provides quick access to Alki Beach, a beautiful water and mountain view, as well as all the comforts that make for a relaxing vacation.  We loved that the house was quiet, comfortable, and relaxing while just a quick walk away from one of Seattle's best beaches.  Shauna was a great host, providing everything we needed and just a text message away if we had a question.  We would love to stay with her again when we're in the area and recommend her without reservation!
37063	3505739	9.0	10.0	16932241	Had a great time. The view from the condo huge windows was awsome. Nice quite neighborhood with its own pathway. The place was clean and inviting.
37064	3505739	9.0	10.0	17455483	About 4 blocks to the beach and all the restaurants in Alki Beach. The weather was great, we walked to Alki Beach for the gorgeous vistas, ice cream cones, and people watching. Shauna's place was spacious and had nice views of the water and mountains. Lincoln Park is a short drive away- the  best park ever, with so many different areas..including a nice paved trailed next to the water with no cars in site..just trees, water, mountains.
37065	3505739	9.0	10.0	17646160	The view from the deck is spectacular and it was great to hang out there and BBQ and just watch the boats go by. I like how quick it is to get downtown from there. The place is really spacious and comfortable and I would definitely stay there again.
37066	3505739	9.0	10.0	18179768	Great place with view even better than shown in picture.  Everything worked, convenient cozy place to stay...We didn't want to leave!!
37067	3505739	9.0	10.0	18254454	Shauna's house was great! The listing description was spot on - It's a 5-10 minute walk to Alki Beach, with a deck with gorgeous views. The house itself is spacious, comfortable, and surprisingly quiet at night. Shauna was a very responsive host, and made us feel completely at home.
37068	3505739	9.0	10.0	18811464	Great communication, great place, great location. We were happy. Thank you Shauna for lettin us stay ! 
37069	3505739	9.0	10.0	20339023	I had a fantastic time! Shauna was a awesome host! Just minutes from the beach, restaurants, bicycle rentals, and the bus stop. There is even a free bus that will take you to the water taxi! It was so easy to get all the way to downtown Seattle for just $4.75. Of course best of all is that amazing view and BBQ!! I absolutely loved it and I recommend it to anyone. 
37070	3505739	9.0	10.0	20579147	Shauna's place was very spacious and peaceful in a nice neighborhood. She responded quickly whenever I have requested information. Kithcen and bathroom was equiped perfectly. Bed was really comfortable.  It had a wonderful deck which I spent lots of time. It is only 5-10 min. walk to the beach where you can find nice restaurants. Cactus&Alki Cafe had good food and fine atmosphere. I have extended my stay for 3 more days. Shauna, thanks again for being such a nice host and I promise to remember you whenever we play eith your frisbee which I have accidentally taken with me. 
37071	3505739	9.0	10.0	20971459	"Shauna was super responsive to our needs. Her place was immaculate and the view ..just jaw dropping. The place was super cozy and clean. It was just picture perfect. I really love the fact that the area where the house was located was perfect for my dog. She enjoyed her walks on the park that was right down the street. She also loved the beach. The location was perfect too. Didn't have to drive too long to get to downtown at all. Will definitely be back again.

Thank you!"
37072	3505739	9.0	10.0	21170627	The place was exactly as advertised. Great water view from the living room and the deck out back. Close to coffee shops and Alki Beach. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone going to Seattle. 
37073	3505739	9.0	10.0	21593780	Shauna's place is well-equipped and in a great location in West Seattle. There is a nice deck with a grill and view of the water- a perfect place to relax after a hike or exploring Seattle. It had everything we were looking for, including comfortable bed and furniture and nice kitchen and bath. Overall an easy place to call home for a week. :)
37074	3505739	9.0	10.0	22238555	Shauna made us feel very welcome! Her home was very nice, and she took the extra time to put up decorations for my fiance's Birthday!! Talk about unexpected, and awesome :) I highly recommend this listing.
37075	3505739	9.0	10.0	22676059	"This rental was fabulous!  We thoroughly enjoyed our 10 day stay.  The home has all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay - cozy furniture, large screen TV, kitchen with everything needed to prepare meals, and a bedroom with an increibly comfortable bed. To top it off, there is a nice view of Puget Sound with the Olympic mountains in the background.  The home is also in a very nice location - within walking distance to the beach, restaurants and a beautiful park.
Shauna was very responsive and accommodating - wonderful host! 
"
37076	3505739	9.0	10.0	23527982	"Shauna went out of her way to accommodate us in our stay. When booking the reservation, she responded immediately and made very thoughtful suggestions. 

The property is very comfortable, spacious, and the view is better than advertised. Location is perfect for getting around West Seattle. We loved walks down then path behind the home to the beach and the coffee shops and restaurants nearby the water."
37077	3505739	9.0	10.0	24368165	The view was phenomenal!  Location was great. Easy access to get downtown, close to Alki Beach, Lincoln Park and ferry to Vashon. The apartment was bigger than it appears in photos, was clean, comfortable and inviting. Shauna was a perfect hostess. Responsive, helpful and thoughtful. 
37078	3505739	9.0	10.0	25100241	This place was perfect for us and Shauna provided just what we needed for a most enjoyable visit. I had expressed our interest in a quiet place to rest that still had access to the best of Seattle. It was indeed quiet and comfortable and travel to Seattle was convenient. It was so helpful to have the eating and activity tips that Shauna left. Nice to have the insight of a Seattle native. And she provided just the right level of support. We never met personally . . . but I always felt she was accessible if we needed help. . . . Thanks for a most relaxing time!
37079	3505739	9.0	10.0	27052830	Shauna and her awesome rental just blocks from Alki were a lifesaver. My partner, myself and our two kitties were homeless for 26 days while we waited for our new home to close but we had to be out of our apartment. We found Shauna's listing and were very much at home while waiting for our forever home. The place was clean, spacious and convenient. She was an excellent host and let us do our own thing. And those views!!!!!  So amazing. Highly recommend. 
37080	3505739	9.0	10.0	28100436	Wow - gorgeous view, quiet home and an amazing host in Shauna. If anything, it was even MORE beautiful than the pictures portray. We were welcomed with a nice note and information on restaurants, walking trails, etc. Peaceful and relaxing - can't wait to return.
37081	3505739	9.0	10.0	28430800	This was our first AirBnB experience and it was excellent all around.  Shauna was great to work with and was very responsive.  We were greeted with a nice welcome letter with a lovely bottle of wine.  The house was very clean.  The bedroom was nice and the bed very comfortable.  The view was fantastic! The house is a short walk to Alki beach.  We also took a hike at Schmitz Park just a block up the road.  Thank you Shauna for opening up your space. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
37082	3505739	9.0	10.0	28826505	"This space was perfect for a girls weekend with my daughters.   Shauna was very helpful and provided great recommendations.  Home has plenty of room, wonderful views, neat & well designed and best of all was very close to the beach and restaurants.  Surprisingly easily to get to other places in Seattle too.  I would love to stay here again.

"
37083	3505739	9.0	10.0	29607321	Am Tag vor unserem Eintreffen schrieb uns Shauna schon nette Worte und teilte uns alles Nötige mit. Als wir das Haus betreten haben, haben wir uns sofort zuhause gefühlt. Auf dem Tisch stand zur Begrüßung eine Flasche Rotwein und daneben lag eine supernette Willkommenskarte. Auch in der Küche gab es alles, was wir brauchten. Die Unterkunft entsprach genau den veröffentlichten Fotos , auch der Ausblick war mindestens genauso schön.
37084	3505739	9.0	10.0	29858123	The location of this home is beyond surreal! An extremely cozy, warm, welcoming home with one of the best views and a short few blocks to the beach! Also, a short drive to downtown. By far exceeded our expectations. We felt comfortable and at home for the three days we were there and definitely plan on going back and staying there in the future! I would highly recommend this to anyone. Great vibes made for an amazing vacation!   
37085	3505739	9.0	10.0	30311561	"We couldn't have been happier with our experience here.  Shauna's place is perfect!  Just a short walk to the amazing beaches and good food plus a spectacular view!  This was our first time using Air BnB and we will definitely be using it again!  Thank you to Shauna for being a gracious host and opening your home to us.  It made the weekend of our 14th anniversary the best one we've had yet!  Maybe we'll be back for #15!!

37086	3505739	9.0	10.0	32441134	"We had such a fun ""staycation"" at Shauna's house! We live in Seattle and her beautiful home was perfect for an easy night away. We walked down to the beach and park which were only a couple of blocks away. Shauna's home has an amazing view and a great deck to enjoy it from! 

Thank you Shauna for being a great host. Check-in/checkout was so simple and we felt very welcome with the sweet note from you. I can't say enough great things!"
37087	3505739	9.0	10.0	32955131	"Shauna thanks for sharing your beautiful and comfortable home with us. The wine waiting for us when we arrived was very nice. Your description was spot on and the views of puget sound were spectacular. We grilled on the deck twice which made us feel ri Michael Jght at home. On our next trip to seattle we will definately be staying with you. You know what they say...West Seattle is better known as Best Seattle.

Thanks again
All the best

37088	3505739	9.0	10.0	33406866	Shauna is a great host! Everything was as described. The house is i a great location. Plenty of restaurants and bars in walking distance. I highly recommend. 
37089	3505739	9.0	10.0	33936879	We really enjoyed staying at Shauna's sunny oasis in West Seattle. The neighborhood was perfect; quiet and a short walk to the beach. The bus stop and water taxi stop right out the door made visits into downtown Seattle easy. The view was incredible from the wall of windows and the deck. We slept well in the quiet bedroom. The perfect retreat!
37090	3505739	9.0	10.0	34352131	My family and I loved staying in Shauna's beautiful West Seattle home. It is in a great location. It was a short walk to Alki beach. We had beautiful weather the whole weekend, so we enjoyed barbecuing on the patio and watching the sun set over the Pudget Sound. The view from the front room is stunning. The house was modern and clean. Shauna's communication was great, she even had recommendations for nearby places to dine or visit. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle.
37091	3505739	9.0	10.0	34585370	Shauna was an amazing host. Very friendly and helpful.  Her place was perfect.  I loved the views of the sound in Seattle.  Walking to coffee and restaurants as well as the beach was just what I needed.  
37092	3505739	9.0	10.0	35661499	This home is great for a relaxing visit to Seattle. We were within 10 - 15 drive from downtown. The DART shuttle to the water taxi was easy to use and fun for our kiddo. The view is great and the weather this weekend spectacular.  Shauna made check-in super easy. We liked being able to come and go as we pleased and not feel like we were staying with anyone.  The home was very private and super clean. 
37093	3505739	9.0	10.0	36197683	"We loved our two days at Alki Beach. The apartment was peaceful and quiet and the view, especially at sunset, delightful.
We would love to return sometime - and can recommend this host and the accommodation. 
Thank you Shauna and Ben"
37094	3505739	9.0	10.0	36590017	Ben & Shauna are an excellent host, very welcoming and helpful! Her place is well kept, spacious and comfortable. A great place to stay with a nice , quiet neighborhood and few blocks from the beach.
37095	3505739	9.0	10.0	37595136	Such a lovely house with great view and warm ambience! The minute I stepped into the house I felt the great care the owners have put into the place. This is different from some of my other Airbnb experiences where the apartments/houses are just set up and maintained for rental business. This one feels like someone open up their well cared home to you with open arms. What they have they share with you. Thank you so much Shauna and Ben!
37096	3505739	9.0	10.0	38492338	"
This was our first Airbnb experience and we are very pleased to have stayed at ""Alki Beach, Seattle -- Water View"". The West Seattle location was easy to find, is close to/from the airport, downtown and Mt Rainier. The apartment is within walking distance to Alki beach, and the deck is perfect for relaxing and enjoying the view. 

The home was spotless, and also stocked with items needed for cooking, preparing meals, doing laundry. 

The hosts left us clear instructions on how to get to the house, parking, recommended restaurants, transportation. There was a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us. While we never met in person, Shauna was highly responsive to our emails. 

We would highly recommend this property for those headed to the Seattle area."
37097	3505739	9.0	10.0	38860937	Good! Great place for me and my daughters to have a girls weekend! Alki beach is fun and the place has a great view.  We used Uber to get back and forth to downtown.  We would have appreciated a table on the deck, but Shauna's place is well supplied otherwise and we'll plan to return.
37098	3505739	9.0	10.0	39370180	Our first time with airbnb and it was a succes. Very nice place, close to the beach in a quiet area. We didn' t get the chance to meet Shauna but when we had a problem she was very responsive and helpfull. Thanks again for having us at your place.
37099	3505739	9.0	10.0	40314131	"The place was fantastic! Lovely views, minutes-walk from the beach, close to downtown (15 min-drive). We didn't meet Shauna face to face, but talked on the phone at arrival.  We found everything in place according to photos and description. Shauna's tips for getting around were very helpful. 

Nos encanto el sitio. La casa, las vistas, el entorno...Estando muy cerca del centro de Seattle, tienes además toda la tranquilidad de un área residencial y de la playa. Sin embargo, no me lo podría imaginar una estancia sin coche. Shauna nos envió toda la información necesaria antes de la llegada por lo que todo resulto muy sencillo."
37100	3505739	9.0	10.0	40926767	Shauna was very responsive and catering for our stay. The apartment is slightly dated however it is still very clean and cozy.  The view from the whole living and dining area is amazing and def worth the outdated decor! Location is great, walking distance from the beach!
37101	3505739	9.0	10.0	41380832	Shauna & Ben's place was clean, comfy & convenient. We only stayed here one night and particularly loved how convenient it was to the airport. It was very easy to get out of town in the morning and didn't encounter any traffic. The house itself had a beautiful patio & communication was super clear and easy. Thank you for opening your home and providing us a nice place to stay our last night on Seattle :)
37102	3505739	9.0	10.0	41929300	We came to West Seattle to celebrate a birthday and were very happy to find Shauna's place. The home is very spacious, open and comfortable with plenty of amenities. The views are lovely, and we enjoyed sitting on the deck watching the ferries and other marine traffic pass by.  The beach and restaurants are within easy walking distance, and other shopping, movies and restaurants are within an easy drive. We enjoyed our stay very much.
37103	3505739	9.0	10.0	42556257	Shauna was very responsive and proactive about sending information and providing useful details for our stay, which was the 4th leg of a 10 day vacation in the pacific northwest. I must say, however, that for the price we paid, the accomodations were not terribly clean (everything was very dusty) and didn't feel nearly as glamorous as the pictures made it seem. It felt unfinished, from a decor standpoint, with piles of stuff sitting around on the floor, and crappy old couches in the living room. While we certainly enjoyed the neighborhood and proximity to the beach the house itself was something of a let-down. There was also major work being done on the unit above ours so there was considerable noise during the day, so if you plan to use the space during daytime hours, this might be a concern. 
37104	3505739	9.0	10.0	43491994	This was our first airbnb experience and it was not exactly what we were expecting. The view from the living room/dining room was the best part. Construction was being done everyday of our stay in the upstairs of the house that we were not made aware of at time of booking or at any other time. The construction began around 7:00 am daily and ended around 6:30 pm. which made it very difficult to enjoy anytime there or take a quick rest after sightseeing. The last day of our stay shauna offered us a discount but we did not see one. We were hoping for a better airbnb experience. We did have a great visit with our daughter which helped offset this experience. The place is not worth the value when construction is going on. 
37105	3505739	9.0	10.0	45796787	We loved our stay! Great location with a stunning view. The metro market place is right down the street so we were able to quickly grab groceries for our stay. Wish we had been able to explore the surrounding area and beach more. Thank you for a great stay. We will be back.
37106	3505739	9.0	10.0	45932291	We enjoyed our time in Alki Beach!  The location could not have been better & I thought the pictures accurately represented what the house actually looked like.   It felt very home-y and we appreciated the restaurant suggestions Shauna made!  
37107	3505739	9.0	10.0	46693450	Nice space and view. Easy parking...I would say getting around would be difficult w/o a car. Clean and comfortable.
37108	3505739	9.0	10.0	47129894	"Shaun and Ben have a lovely home and everything appeared as it did on the website.  The home is very inviting, clean, and the amenities were exactly what we needed.  The view from the back deck is very nice and was the perfect place to relax as the sun went down.  They were very accommodating and provided valuable ""local"" info before our arrival."

37110	3505739	9.0	10.0	48700481	We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle at Shauna & Ben's home. Is was everything as listed on the rental listing and so much more. It was super clean,we had everything we needed at our fingertips. The bed was very comfortable ,very nice kitchen and dining area. The views from the balcony were breath taking. Blazing fast internet connections which we now need at home:) we were able to walk to the beach and several restaurants Shauna recommended. It was easy to get over to Pikes Plac and the Space Needle. We ran out of time to explore the area and would love to stay here again in the future. Thanks for sharing your beautiful home with us.
37111	3505739	9.0	10.0	49827719	Shauna and Ben's Alki suite was amazing!  The water view and the big open windows made for some peaceful relaxing for my wife and I.  The suite is in a nice area of West Seattle with access to shops and restaurants on California ave a short drive away.  The fridge was stocked with a selection of drinks and I particularly liked the collection of books.
37112	3505739	9.0	10.0	51101453	"We arrived very late in the evening and left the next day, so we did not have time to try out any of the many suggestions our hosts provided for us for restaurants and entertainment. 
Their home was beautiful, even better than the pictures, with a glorious porch and view of the sound. Would definitely go back!"
37113	3505739	9.0	10.0	51792287	This place is just as advertised. The house was roomy and very clean and the view from the living room and deck is incredible. The neighborhood is perfect. It's 3 blocks from the beach where there are restaurants and bars all around and a mile up Admiral Way around California St. has restaurants and bars everywhere as well. Downtown and Pike Place Market is a 15 minute drive. Shauna and Ben left a very nice note and bottle of wine for us on the dining room table and were very accommodating. We couldn't have had a better experience. We will definitely be back!
37114	3505739	9.0	10.0	53071478	Shauna and Ben were very welcoming, we really appreciated the local tips they provided including some great restaurants, all of which we tried (Cactus Mexican and La Rustica Italian were definite favourites). The home had everything we needed including a fully stocked bar and a really nice bottle of wine which was much appreciated after a long, rainy, journey in! We had spent lots of time in Seattle before but never been to Alki Beach and really fell in love with the neighborhood. House was clean, comfy, excellent location and we could have sat in the lounge chair and stared out the window for hours! We will be back!
37115	3505739	9.0	10.0	54299189	Description was accurate. Nice place.  Beautiful view.  East to access. 
37116	3505739	9.0	10.0	55488100	The place was great, beautiful with a great view. A nice bottle of wine was waiting on the table. Shauna and Ben were very nice and welcoming. They even e-mailed us to make sure everything was okay. Would definitely return and recommend staying here.
37117	3505739	9.0	10.0	56440739	"Thanks, Shauna and Ben, for a great stay in your cozy apartment over a wet and cold Seattle weekend.  The location and the set up were perfect for us, and we appreciated the flannel sheets!  Thank you for being considerate hosts and we look forward to returning.

37298	7455068	10.0	10.0	41705902	Francesco was very warm and welcoming.  He checked in with us every day to make sure we were at ease.  I would highly recommend this location for a summer get-a-way in the NorthWest.  Feels like newport beach on the sound.  Very close to restaurants, bars and Alki Strand.
37299	7455068	10.0	10.0	44034834	Everything was exactly as described. Very clean and accommodating, and Francesco made himself available if there were any issues. I had no issues, and enjoyed my stay. Very convenient location to the beach in Seattle, and a good experience! 
37300	7455068	10.0	10.0	44954143	had a great time awesome location.
37301	7455068	10.0	10.0	45638093	The place was exactly as listed and is in an incredible location in Alki Beach.  It is not difficult to find, and the area is fairly quiet for beinh near bars and restaurants.  There are quite a few nearby, as well as shops and little cafes.  My favorite was Ampersand Cafe between 58th & Marine.  Pay close attention to this listing, there is no WiFi at the location but plenty of the places nearby offer it up for free.  If you're going to cook at this listing, be sure to bring all the essentials you'll need.  They have coffee filters, salt, pepper, dishes, pots & pans.  Parking - no free parking at the location (as listed) but parking is allowed on the street.  They were doing road work while I was there though, so there were restrictions with towing notices.  So, just be careful!  I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone I know and even those I don't :P  The owner was very communicative and quite helpful with my last minute reservation.  Thanks for the great listing Francesco!
37302	7455068	10.0	10.0	45975597	From the first correpondence, Francesco was attentive and answered all questions quickly. The bungalow is in a great location on Alki, less than a block from the beach and restaurants. The house and furnishings were just perfect for our stay (kitchen, living room, 1 bed/1 bath). Definitely recommend this place as your base camp while staying in Seattle.

It is exactly as described. Right off the beach, walking to lots of fun places. Francesco was very easy to get in touch with, although we never met. The apartment has basic amenities, including a coffee pot and some basic cookware. The bed was soft but comfortable.
I would definitely stay again, when heading to West Seattle.
(I recommend having perfect weather too, like we happened to have during our stay!)"
37305	7455068	10.0	10.0	47392545	I absolutely loved staying here! It was just the right size for me! Perfect! Francesco was extremely nice and I really liked that he was around if I needed him, which I didn't but still, I thought it was really nice that he checked up on me. This place is very close to the beach - a short walk and also a short walk to the shops and cafes around the corner as well. Will definitely stay here again when I come back to Seattle. 
37306	7455068	10.0	10.0	48603979	"Although I didn't meet Francesco, It was a pleasure to stay at his place, the place is described and very clean, it was close to a lot of nice places to eat and the beach. 

Francesco checked in to make sure everything is going well. 

To me, the only down sides are not having wifi  or the usual Airbnb personal touch which might be a good thing for some people. 

Overall a very good experience and is very recommended. "
37307	7455068	10.0	10.0	49042072	The host was very helpful and receptive. The neighborhood was peaceful and pleasant, and the accommodations were all to our liking.  Everything we needed was adequately supplied.
37308	7455068	10.0	10.0	50450124	Great experience. The apartment was very clean and less than a block from the beach. There are multiple restaurants and coffee shops also within walking distance. Would highly recommend.
37309	7455068	10.0	10.0	53254464	I rented this condo for a coworker who was staying for an extended work trip. He said that the owner was very nice and shared the wifi password. He was very happy to stay there for 3 weeks.
37310	7455068	10.0	10.0	53901305	"Francesco was a wonderful host. Although we did not meet in person, he was very patient, professional and available when I had trouble booking my stay. He also checked in several times to make sure I had everything I needed. The space was exactly as described and very comfortable and close to the water and restaurants. Note that there is no internet service and street parking wasn't always available directly outside the space, but could be found less than a block away.
I would definitely stay again in the future! Thanks Francesco!"
37311	7455068	10.0	10.0	55317415	Yes, my host was friendly over text. I never checked in for other reasons (the complexities of travel during the holidays), but he was kind throughout the process.
37312	7455068	10.0	10.0	58697946	"This small apartment presents in person as it does in pictures and is less than a block from good places to eat and a great view.  The private entry to the rental is nice.  The kitchen has the basics for a pleasant stay.  It was good to have a separate bedroom with a closet to hang cloths.  I could see coming here for a longer stay easily.

It was a quiet and cozy place and I would be happy to stay there again some time.

37313	8102349	10.0	10.0	48045444	Staying at Jay's West Seattle Crash Pad was fabulous! Jay and his family were wonderful hosts. The room is like a mini apartment. They even had coffee and little snacks for breakfast laid out for us when we got there! The location is amazing. There's plenty of little shops to visit on California. We enjoyed beers at Prost! and treats at Bakery Nouvelle. We will certainly be back again! 
37314	8102349	10.0	10.0	48260782	Hosts were away when I arrived, didn't catch up with them after dinner. Helpful via email, phone calls. Smooth check in / out.

37316	8102349	10.0	10.0	52507032	Jenny and Jay are incredible hosts. So friendly and easy to work with. The house is gorgeous and the basement apartment is super cozy and way more spacious then we had expected. When we arrived we got in easily and they had yummy snacks and coffee waiting for us. Awesome people and awesome home away from home. Can't say enough good things about our experience at the West Seattle Crash Pad. You guys made our move a breeze! I would highly recommend staying here and spending some time in this fantastic neighborhood.

37349	7561333	10.0	10.0	42960339	We had a great time staying at your place. The location is great because your not that far from downtown and everything is near. Thanks again for letting us stay. We wished we would have met you. 
37350	7561333	10.0	10.0	44030858	Had a wonderful time! Jon and Dayna are both lovely hosts, although ours was a short visit during the week and we didn't cross paths with them much,  they made us feel very welcome and relaxed.  Great location, comfortable bedroom and awesome bathroom on our side of the apartment.  Thanks so much for having us!

37355	7561333	10.0	10.0	46154303	A perfect stay. The neighborhood is really nice, with lots of restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops, and walking distance to the water taxi to downtown. The space is fairly small but lovely, with a large bathroom and very comfy bed. Jon and Mr. O'Malley (the dog) were both very friendly and welcoming. Thank you!
37356	7561333	10.0	10.0	46657407	Had a great experience staying at this condo. Jon and Dana were very nice and made us feel welcome. I loved having coffee houses and a really good market within walking distance. The bedroom we stayed in was small but cozy - the only thing was that street noise was loud at night since we had the window open as it was pretty warm in the room when we were trying to sleep. So I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Also loved the West Seattle area with Alki Beach just a few minutes drive away. 
37357	7561333	10.0	10.0	46923851	We absolutely loved our stay at Johnathan's place. He was very hospitable and the bedroom was clean and private. The rooftop view is amazing! We would definitely stay here again.

37359	7561333	10.0	10.0	47595443	Jonathan and his fiancé were perfect. The apartment was beautifully clean and the bed was very comfortable. They were extremely helpful and very knowledgeable about Seattle. The apartment was very close to the city in a really beautiful area. They also have an extremely cute dog. Thank you for having us keep in contact.  
37360	7561333	10.0	10.0	49142968	Cozy bedroom with private bath. Clean, quiet with all linens waiting for me upon arrival. Jonathan gave me a lot tips about what to see, the public transit and good places to dine. The rooftop is very serene with a fantastic view. The market is just steps away is open 24/7. 
37361	7561333	10.0	10.0	49859037	Jonathan made my experience comfortable, private, and easy.  I was able to come and go at my convenience.  Having my own bath was a plus.  I loved being able to go up to the roof garden to enjoy the beautiful view of the Seattle skyline.  The apartment is located in a charming older neighborhood with shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.  It was just right for my needs.  They also have the cutest, sweetest dog on the planet! 
37362	7561333	10.0	10.0	50476517	Great room in a great location! Jon was very accommodating and responsive and it was great to have my own room and bathroom.
37363	7561333	10.0	10.0	50710856	Thank you so much for this night in Seattle! It was the most cosy bed in our last 3 weeks and we were very happy to stay with you both! Your are fantastic hosts!! Your rooftop terrace is great and the skyline of seattle was a amazing picture to say goodbye and to leave back home! Come over to Berlin whenever you plan to do a Europe Trip! Conny & Harro
37364	7561333	10.0	10.0	53445351	Jonathan was very warm and considerate as a host. The room was neat and organized and had all the necessary amenities required for a comfortable stay including a private bathroom. The bed was one of the most comfortable one's that I have experienced till date. Overall it was a great experience. 
37365	7561333	10.0	10.0	53559674	Jonathan is clearly an airbnb veteran. I arrived to a cozy room with magazines, books and bath towels laid out for me to make use of. The apartment is quiet, clean and comfortable. Their dog O'Malley is the most relaxed pup I have ever met. Jonathan provided a list of recommendations including a cafe for breakfast called Admiral Bird, just around the corner. I cannot speak highly enough of this establishment. Karina, the owner, is quite possibly the friendliest person I have met. West Seattle seems like a great little neighborhood. 
37366	7561333	10.0	10.0	54001438	It was a short stay, but Jonathan's place is exactly as described. Thanks for the hospitality!
37367	7561333	10.0	10.0	54212764	Great time at Jonathan's during 24 hour layover in Seattle. Really easy to get landed even though we got in late. Jonathan set out awesome towels so we didn't need ours. Place was clean and cozy. Dog was nice and polite. Cool neighborhood too! Seattle touring was awesome! Worked out way better than an airport hotel (and I had just stayed at the Seattle Airport Hilton a few nights prior for work) Thanks!
37368	7561333	10.0	10.0	54816154	Jonathan was communicative and available, gave perfect directions and entry instructions, and offered local places to eat, get coffee, and explore. We felt we had the place to ourselves and everything we needed, including towels and bath needs. We didn't end up using the kitchen but it was big and clean, would have been perfect if we needed it. The dog was super chill and didn't make a peep, even when we first came in. The location is great, just a couple minutes from the beach and the bridge, easy parking. Great place to stay...thanks, Jonathan!
37369	7561333	10.0	10.0	55245103	Jonathon was a very responsive and friendly host. My husband and I found our four day stay to be just what we wanted and expected. We were perfectly comfortable in our bedroom and adjoining bath with access to the kitchen, living room with cozy gas fireplace and deck. We could not ask for a better location in the fun West Seattle neighborhood near our family. We especially appreciated the access across the street to the fabulous Metropolitan Market for amazing hot food, wonderful breakfast croissants and pecan rolls and great wine for the family get togethers. We would stay again.
37370	7561333	10.0	10.0	55996133	Their place was great.  Had fresh towels, fresh linens and laid out information about their location and west seattle in general.  Very accommodating given my fiance's flight got in around 11 pm during the weekday.  Jonathan was very responsive.  Nice to have private room with bathroom.  Thank you both for having us! 
37371	7561333	10.0	10.0	56268636	Amazing host with an awesome view.  Made me feel really welcome and took the time out to explain the city to me.  I had arrived with no one home and there were clear instructions on how to get settled in.  Awesome stay!
37372	7561333	10.0	10.0	57720781	The apartment is excellent! The environment is very clean and quiet. They provided me towels, shampoo and body wash, hand wash, and hair dryer. It's so convenient living in the apartment, and I felt very comfortable staying with them. 
37373	7561333	10.0	10.0	58460720	Great communicators.... place very nice and upscale.... area was convenient & agreeable too!
39444	9615941	10.0	10.0	57811727	Matt was very professional with his quick responses and good information.  The description of his listing is accurate and completely met all my needs.  He is friendly and accommodating.  I would stay there again and definitely would recommend it.
41908	58503	9.0	10.0	20400886	Visala and Dave were lovely hosts!  I had the honor of being their first AirBnB guest.  The space was large, clean, and quiet.  The Greenwood Ave neighborhood fantastic for easy access to shops, bars, restaurants, highways, and transit.  
41909	58503	9.0	10.0	20483106	Great place in a great neighborhood.  Visala was warm and welcoming  when we arrived, making sure we knew where everything was and we had everything we needed.  Only stayed overnight, but will be sure to give them a shout next time we head to Seattle.
41910	58503	9.0	10.0	22653828	This was actually an airbnb rental that I did for my son, while he healed from a broken neck.  He needed somewhere safe and quiet for a few weeks, and he certainly got it!  The hosts were gracious and friendly, not intrusive, and good people.  My son says it was a fine place, lots of room,  with a nice whirlpool bathtub.
41911	58503	9.0	10.0	22748753	Great place to stay!  Conveniently located by the best gyro place in greenwood!  Host was friendly and thorough. Very clean and tidy. 
41912	58503	9.0	10.0	22781246	Great house with lots of space! Convenient parking and easy to drive around the city. Very welcoming and easy going. 
41913	58503	9.0	10.0	23280753	We had such a nice stay. The space was clean and provided everything we needed. 
41914	58503	9.0	10.0	23374442	We were greeted warmly by Dave and Visala and invited to simply knock on the kitchen door if we needed anything.   We were given verbal tips on any quirks of gate opening, etc. that were not clearly written otherwise.   Maria, the dog, was sweet and welcoming too, and not intrusive. 
41915	58503	9.0	10.0	23845740	"Visala and Dave were both extremely welcoming, and gracious hosts. They were flexible about my arrival time, and made sure that they were available if I had any questions or concerns. I stayed here for 11 nights, and each night was great! Space is clean and comfortable, and with your own door the place feels very much like your own. I am someone who prefers the quiet space, with few noises and that's what this place was. Only thing I will say is that the ceilings are low for someone my height (6'1""), and there were some places where I had to duck my head. But that is a minor thing. If I need a place to stay, I would absolutely look up Visala and Dave again!"
41916	58503	9.0	10.0	24464989	"Vi träffade Visala i hennes hus och fick en ""tour""av lägenheten samt en förklaring av hur gör man med Tv´n, tvättmaskin osv. Visala lämnade  kaffe & te för oss, och förstås vi fick handdukar, tvål, shampoo osv; och även en choklad på kudden! 
Man känner sig väldigt välkommen i hennes hus. Hon och hennes man är väldigt lugna, öppna och välkomnande, från första dagen man känner sig hemma, speciellt när man träffar ""Maria"" deras hund. 

Beskrivning av boendet är korrekt, det ser ut precis som på bilderna. Det är lugn och enkelt att sova och lägenheten har egen entré, så det känns ganska privat.

Visala´s hus står mitt i Greenwood, med fantastiska möjligheter för olika restauranger, ""beer gardens"", kaféer, osv. Till centrala Seattle tar det 20 minuter i bussen, och man ta den 50 meter från hennes hus.
För oss det var precis vad vi förväntade.

41917	58503	9.0	10.0	25520519	We had a wonderful stay.  This is a very fun spot.  The decor was funky and artsy.  It was a clean spot with everything furnished that was needed.  Our kids loved the space.  Dave and Vishala's are approachable but not intrusive.  Loved it.
41918	58503	9.0	10.0	25612312	Thank you for having us! The place was cozy and comfortable! We truly appreciate you accommodating us and hope to come back soon. :) 
41919	58503	9.0	10.0	25846160	Extremely welcoming and helpful. Cute little spot in greenwood.
41920	58503	9.0	10.0	26245116	I had a great stay! The space was very comfortable and exactly as advertised. Lots of extra blankets and pillows also, which is always a plus. I'd definitely stay there again!
41921	58503	9.0	10.0	27075042	Very welcoming, great location, cute dog. Very spacious. Would return again in a heartbeat.
41922	58503	9.0	10.0	27677687	"Visala's a very sweet lady (with a very sweet dog) who made our first Airbnb experience an enjoyable one. Her room is as pictured: spacious, well-furnished, and with full amenities. 

Definitely consider this place if you're staying in the Seattle area -- especially if you're into Eastern philosophy, meditation, yoga, or just looking for the type of host who would put Hershey's Kisses on your pillows."
41923	58503	9.0	10.0	27766462	"Visala gave us a warm greeting and showed us the space.  She went over a  detailed document that describes how to use the WiFi, TV remotes etc. and answered all of our questions.  Over all the space is very much as depicted on AirBnB.  The bedrooms are cozy.  The living room area was quite spacious.  The couch next to the TV was comfy and made for an enjoyable evening watching some movies.  We really enjoyed our stay.  We especially enjoyed the jacuzzi bath which is plenty big enough for two to enjoy.

The one thing you should know is that the ceiling is a bit low.  I am 5’ 7” and didn’t have any problem, but someone who was closer to 6 foot might find it a bit tight.   
"
41924	58503	9.0	10.0	27972235	We felt very welcome at Visalas and her husbands place, it was great that we could use the upper kitchen. The place is very spacy and very compfortable. They prepared maps and usuals for us, so we could easier help our selfs with verything. The neighborhood is cosy and fast to get there with public transport from citycentre, verything you could use is near. 
41925	58503	9.0	10.0	28030532	The space was just as described in the posting- spacious with a lot of room for a toddler to run around (which for us, was key).  We were greeted by David who gave us an efficient overview of everything.  The provided maps and information about the neighborhood was key in the morning for figuring out where to walk to get a cup of coffee.  Should we return to Seattle, I would definitely try to stay here again.
41926	58503	9.0	10.0	28231740	Very nice home. Calm, peaceful, and the dog Maria is a sweetheart.
41927	58503	9.0	10.0	28472011	"Nice warm, roomy flat. Comfy beds.
Visala and Dave were two of the friendliest of people. Very attentive without being intrusive. Helpful to a fault.
Just a couple of minutes to bus route 5 right into downtown Seattle. About a 30 minute run (Quicker on the express). Some pleasant walks around Green Lake and surrounding area.
I would recommend a stay in Visala and Dave's flat if ever you are visiting Seattle."
41928	58503	9.0	10.0	28712224	This location was awesome. Very quiet and private. Everything you need is in a very short walking distance. The host is very accommodating. She left us coupons which I thought was very sweet.Highly recommended!
41929	58503	9.0	10.0	29128741	My experience with Visala, Dave and Maria was fantastic! Didn't get the chance to meet either of them, but the basement was perfect for myself and my two friends. Awesome decor and books. I especially dug the bathtub art, really cool. The neighborhood was beautiful! Very short distance to downtown, Capitol Hill, etc. Would love to stay here again!!
41930	58503	9.0	10.0	29572063	Very friendly host. Very flexible space that was perfect for our larger group (5). Great location also. Would recommend!
41931	58503	9.0	10.0	29840429	This was a comfortable stay. Visala was very responsive through email and always instantly returned communication. Beautiful home with lots of quirks that made it fun. Filtered water, detailed instructions of the area, a yummy chocolate bar and the lights left on for us at night made us feel welcome. Thankfully we are staying there on our way back home. It feels like staying at a friend's house without even meeting the hosts in person. Also super sweet puppy :) 
41932	58503	9.0	10.0	30034701	Communication was good and prompt!  Description was accurate, clean, comfortable, roomy, and homey: perfect for our needs.  We were familiar with the area and  enjoyed being in that neighborhood as a launching point.  The garden is a whimsical retreat and offered a lovely transition between outings.  Thanks for allowing us our privacy and quiet times were perfect.  It was spacious, and we were glad that neither of us was over 6 feet tall :)  The Buddhist temple tucked into the neighborhood was lovely.  Thanks for the Theo's chocolate... that joined us on our hike to PooPoo Point!
41933	58503	9.0	10.0	30206881	We had a great time. Visala was very pleasant. We will stay again. 
41934	58503	9.0	10.0	30352888	Nice quiet neighborhood. Good communication, quick responses. Excellent accommodations, as described. Neat and clean. Organized and thoughtfully arranged. We had a great experience!
41935	58503	9.0	10.0	30484303	"Visala and Dave were superb hosts, warm, gentle and caring. Incredible people; so wonderful to meet them and get to know them a little. Very considerate. 

The spacious private daylight basement was as described. The jetted tub was more than I had hoped for.  In all the space is delightful,whimsical, peaceful and akin to a retreat.

The neighbourhood is great. Tons of restaurants and grocery stores.  Parking was easy and right outside the house. Thank you."
41936	58503	9.0	10.0	30698841	What a find! This is a really special place, with such a warmth and convenience. The hosts were so welcoming, and Maria the laborador was the best part! I'd highly recommend this spot.
41937	58503	9.0	10.0	30987736	Host was very welcoming and provided lots of nice touches (labelled remote controls, a welcome chocolate, etc), listing actually kind of understated just how huge the space was.
41938	58503	9.0	10.0	31321611	"Visala's place is located in a very nice neighbourhood of Seattle. Her house is surrounded by a nice garden and there are many fantastic eateries in the vicinity.The apartment itself is very cosy and even though it is in the basement, it is well lit. The coffee and the chocolate bar were delicious.
Visala is very kind and generous and gave us some useful tips on places to eat at. 

Maria (their labrador) is a gentle soul.If you are a dog person, you could take her for a walk around the block, she likes that and we loved playing with her. Thanks for a great stay, Visala! I would highly recommend this place to everyone looking for a comfortable 'home away from home'."
41939	58503	9.0	10.0	31560103	"The location is super nice. Lots of places to eat in the immediate vicinity, nice neighborhood, and easy access to downtown and northern Seattle locations.

This is a basement, so it's probably not for everyone, but we enjoyed the comfy home feeling. It was kind of stressful trip for us to Seattle, so it was really nice to come 'home' at the end of the day and feel comfortable just lounging about.

Your hosts here are extremely pleasant folks. The space provides many amenities we did not take advantage of: laundry, big tv, coffee, etc. We brought games to play, so we mostly took advantage of the round table that is perfect for game play.

Thanks,
Brad

41940	58503	9.0	10.0	31696334	Great place! We had a great time in Seattle. Maria was such a cute dog to play with. Hosts were very nice. Overall very pleasant stay. Thanks Visala!
41941	58503	9.0	10.0	31991694	Directions to the house were clear.  It was nice to know we could park on the street.  It was easy to get in, the note on the door assured us we were in the right place.  The daylight basement is spacious, inviting, and has good energy.  We all felt very comfortable there, wifi connected easily.  This was a reunion with my three adult kids and one boyfriend.  We loved the neighborhood, walked down to the Ale House and had dinner out on the sidewalk.  The weather was warm and lots of people were out.  It was a great night.  
41942	58503	9.0	10.0	32681297	"I rented Visala's place for a music festival, and I needed a spot for the artists to stay. I did not stay there myself, so I really appreciated that Visala and her family helped make the artists feel comfortable and at home. 
Her place worked so well for the artists - spacious, yet having enough private space, close to fun shops, and Visala and her family were so warm and accommodating that the artists felt very welcome and comfortable. 
So very grateful!!"
41943	58503	9.0	10.0	33434217	It was wonderful staying in Visala's house, charming and relaxed atmosphere- really felt at home and was made to feel so welcome! The basement rooms were comfortable and spacious with the facilities I needed, especially laundry, wifi and microwave.  The location in the heart of the Greenwood high street with interesting shops and cafes was perfect.  I would definitely stay there again when visiting Seattle.
41944	58503	9.0	10.0	33780266	"We hebben Visala zelf niet gezien, maar er lag lekkere chocola voor ons klaar.  Haar zoon hebben we gezien toen we uitcheckten en hij was gastvrij. Je zit zo op de snelweg,  maar in de buurt merk je dat helemaal niet! we hebben een leuke wandeling gemaakt naar het meer in de buurt.
De kelder is een heerlijk grote ruimte. Erg fijn is dat de slaapkamer en de woonkamer twee aparte ruimtes zijn. Onze dochter kon zo lekker slapen terwijl wij nog in de woonkamer konden zitten. Onze eenjarige dochter vond de versieringen van het bad helemaal geweldig! Ze bleef maar aanwijzen en zeggen wat er op geplakt was! Erg leuk!

41945	58503	9.0	10.0	34242784	It was exactly like the pictures.  It was great, and the hosts were very welcoming.  If I had an occasion to be in Seattle in the future, I would love to stay there again.  There is a lot of space to spread out, and it's kind of like having an apartment.  Thank you Visala!
41946	58503	9.0	10.0	34852570	Visala is an amazing host and her home is located in a really fun part of Seattle. She did everything in her power to make our stay a comfortable one and her home is even nicer in person than in the pictures. My partner and I had an amazing time and will definitely stay there again when we return.
41947	58503	9.0	10.0	35456246	Visala's place was perfectly comfortable and spacious for our family of four. Greenwood is such a cool neighborhood, and what a sweet dog Maria is! We would happily hang out here again when we're in Seattle.
41948	58503	9.0	10.0	35655709	This two-bedroom basement apartment was perfect for the three of us during our two-night stay in Seattle. It is very close to the bus line and we were downtown within 30 minutes. Close to everything you need! And dog Maria was very sweet. Host Visala was kind and showed us everything we needed to know. Be sure to check out the garden - a wonderful quiet morning spot.
41949	58503	9.0	10.0	35790008	Linda and Jim were great hosts and very nice to chat with. They also gave us a lot of tips about the area. The rooms were clean and tidy. :-)
41950	58503	9.0	10.0	36371053	Visala and Dave were great hosts.  Very welcoming. Place is in a very nice part of town, with great access to shops and restaurants. We happened to stay on the weekend of the Grenwood car show...super cool.  Great stay.
41951	58503	9.0	10.0	36537061	We really enjoyed our visit! The perfect affordable place for a family to stay close to Seattle.
41952	58503	9.0	10.0	37289362	"This was a great place to stay in Seattle! The apartment is just as it appears on the profile--very spacious, with a clear flavor of the hosts' personalities. The dog is friendly, and the backyard is beautiful. The neighborhood is also really great--beautiful views overlooking Puget Sound, and lots of appealing restaurants, bookstores, and coffeeshops.

We did not get to meet Visala or Dave, but their sons helped make us feel welcome. They also left a nice welcome gift! 

Because this is a basement apartment, it was quite cool even though Seattle was experiencing a heatwave. One downside of the basement location, though, is the low ceilings. People taller than six feet should think twice about it--at exactly six feet, I hit my head hard twice before I learned to duck. But there are several beams that I only just cleared, which means that a taller person would really need to be stooping almost all the time. 

Apart from that, a great place to stay."
41953	58503	9.0	10.0	38316827	The place was nice and clean. I could not have a single complaint about it or the location. The place is only a 15 minute drive from downtown. Visala was a great host. Any and every question we had was answered. Every amenity we needed was provided. And of course Maria was the nicest dog I have ever seen. I would definitely stay here again.
41954	58503	9.0	10.0	38509066	Visala and Dave made us feel very welcome. The basement apartment was spacious, comcortable and perfect for our group of 5 adults. We had car grouble on the last day and tbey were both really helpful. Our grateful thanks to both of you.
41955	58503	9.0	10.0	38584679	Visala was very nice. The place is very informal  and homey. Just watch your head due to low beams!
41956	58503	9.0	10.0	38745731	We enjoyed our visit. Great neighborhood! Cool house. Very eclectic. Loved all the books. Walked down the street to eat breakfast and enjoyed seeing the Buddhist temple. 
41957	58503	9.0	10.0	38980389	Me and my two friends had a wonderful time at the lovely basement. It's very spacious and while it was super hot outside, the basement was really cool. Visala and Dave (and their son) were really nice people and their dog Maria is amazing. Neighbourhood has some nice breakfast places like Pete's Eggnest! Would definitely come back here if we would ever visit Seattle again. 
41958	58503	9.0	10.0	39372489	We really enjoyed Visala's basement. Parking was easy on the street and the house is located in a really groovy neighborhood. The basement is very spacious and has all you need. For me the bath tub was a luxury I had been yearning for in a string of stall showers at other airbnb's. We were a small family of three but I bet 7 people could fit comfortably in this space. Visala was a doll. I wouldn't hesitate to boom again. 
41959	58503	9.0	10.0	39613443	Very welcoming cool house just outside of the city. Plenty of space! Thank you!
41960	58503	9.0	10.0	40203782	Nice suite in a beautiful neighbourhood. The suite was clean, just as advertised and we enjoyed our stay there. Close to bus routes. 
41961	58503	9.0	10.0	45235005	"Visala and Dave were excellent hosts!!! We stayed there for a month too:) The space is large, comfortable, and private. And the neighborhood is delightful with bus stops (30 minutes to downtown), shops, restaurants, and supermarkets are all within walking distance. Visala and Dave left directions for the neighborhood, well stocked supplies, and Seattle information as well and were so incredibly easy to communicate with. 

We would stay there again if we needed a Seattle rental. If you are considering some time in Seattle, push this listing to the top of your list. "
41962	58503	9.0	10.0	46581546	"Felt very much at home, lots of space. Had everything we needed. Comfy. Thanks for everything. Very friendly helpful people. 
Was so wonderful that we could have our so join us there. "
41963	58503	9.0	10.0	47505230	This basement made me feel like I was in a cabin in the mountains, and with the smell of rain it felt like a true Seattle visit. So much personality throughout the unit while still having every amenity we could imagine and more! Their clear instructions made the unit and the neighborhood feel like home in no time. 
41964	58503	9.0	10.0	47734615	Great relaxing location! Hosts are friendly and outgoing. Spoke briefly when I was leaving.
41965	58503	9.0	10.0	47974930	Everything looks just as pictured. Hosts left detailed instructions for us and the place was very comfy and cozy. We had a ton of room to spread out and the place came well-stocked with the essentials. Check-in was smooth and easy.
41966	58503	9.0	10.0	48070094	Great location and great space with everything we needed. Dog was super sweet but didn't really get to meet our hosts. 
41967	58503	9.0	10.0	48354889	The thing I liked most about this place was that, everywhere I turned, I was finding some neat/charming memento or souvenir from Visala and her family. It made it seem very homey and un-basement-like. It was a lot of fun to just walk around and look at everything. The only qualm I had was that, at 6-feet-tall, I often had to dip down to avoid bumping my head on the beams and door frames. (I failed a couple of times.) Otherwise, great place. It's located just two blocks from the 5 bus, which travels to and from downtown every 15 minutes roughly 20 hours a day. The neighborhood is fun. The streets are very cramped with cars parked on both sides, but we didn't have any trouble finding a spot right outside the house.
41968	58503	9.0	10.0	48556842	This was a great space in a fantastic location! The basement was as advertised- very spacious! Visala was a lovely person and I only wished I could have spent more time talking with her. The house is in a great part of the city and within walking distance of a lot of great eating places and fun neighborhoods. It's a great deal and I would love to stay here again! 
41969	58503	9.0	10.0	48777766	Visala and Dave have a very pleasant place. There were clear instructions on what was expected and they made it very convenient and easy. It was also very peaceful and comfortable. Even though it was just a one night stay, my husband and i were pleased with our experience.
41970	58503	9.0	10.0	49037826	"This is a nice place. Really love it with convenient parking & everything. 
Dave is so nice welcoming us at the main gate although we are 30 min.earlier than expected. Greenwood area is so big & with good environment. I like greenwood and ran in the morning breathing fresh air is cool."
41971	58503	9.0	10.0	49600653	"Dave met us at the door and was a great help with the questions we bombarded him with after our very long and exhausting drive, turns out all the info we needed was located inside on the table !!  :-) 
The space is nice and cozy but anyone over 6'4"" may have some issues with the ceiling and beam heights.  The beds are very comfortable and the lounge area is very nice with a great range of channels to watch after a long day of exploring.  
The room is semi personalised with some family and friend photos in and around the space, there was also a funny smell close to the stairwell/basement entrance door, we got used to it but it was quite strong and hard to work out if what may have caused it.
The bnb is very conveniently located to a huge supermarket and many great take out and restaurant places.  Public transport to the city was a bit of an effort and after a pile of walking (and some running) to catch busses on our first day we found it very easy to drive into the city via Aurora Ave on the second day and thus avoiding the craziness of the Interstate."
41972	58503	9.0	10.0	49961321	We had an excellent stay here. Even though we didn't get a chance to meet Visala, everything was well organizex enough to make the stay easy and comfortable. 
41973	58503	9.0	10.0	50652616	"We had an amazing stay in Seattle and much of that was due to having such a great place to stay while we were there. Dave and Visala's place was so comfortable and easy to make ourselves home out. Easy access to the bus lines so we could accomplish our goal of exploring the city. But when we wanted to rest our feet and just relax, Visala's basement was the perfect place to do it. She wasn't around for the weekend, but her husband Dave was always responsive to our texts when we were looking for info. Also want to give mention to her son Gus and the awesome high-end, second hand men's clothing store he runs out of the upstairs. Great guy and and great clothes. I bought a couple jackets at an awesome price that I'm stoked on. Neighborhood of Greenwood is awesome too! We come from Utah, which is a beautiful state, but admittedly overrun with national chains and shopping/food establishments that lack true character a quality. We spent a day and a night exploring the neighborhood and loved every shop we stopped (website hidden) scene was fun, food was great. Lastly, can't finish this without mentioning the best food I've experienced in while, and it's just down the road from Visala's. The ""In-Season Fresh Take-Away & Cafe"" was astounding. The chef there is truly a master of his craft and artfully considers every component of his menu items. If you don't stop in to experience his food and staff, you will be missing out.
Thanks Visala and Dave! When we head up your direction again, we'd definitely love to stay at your place again. You made our first experience with Air B&B a great and memorable one! We are converted "
41974	58503	9.0	10.0	51440550	"A nice place to stay in, Spacious and clean.
A very pleasant suburban area, not too far from the city center.
I've only met Visala and Dave briefly, but they were very nice and welcoming. Overall, it was good value for the money."
41975	58503	9.0	10.0	51682961	"We never met Visala, but the entry into this basement space was easy, and location was very convenient. It was definitely spacious, and we loved the color scheme. 
It is not a completely finished basement however, mostly in that the ceiling/upstairs floor lacks any sound proofing. We did come on a week day, and understandably, Visala and her husband got up early to get to work... but it was very noisy.  We appreciated the dishes and whatnot, but there is no kitchen or sink, so this would not be a place to stay long term.
All in all tho, this was a cute space in a great part of Seattle, and Visala was a very accommodating host."
41976	58503	9.0	10.0	51855737	Terrific location and spacious place to stay.  The hosts were great - had all kinds of amenities like filtered drinking water, small refrigerator, dishes, etc.  And thanks so much to Dave and his son for helping me figure out how to get the Seahawks game up and running!
41977	58503	9.0	10.0	52194430	What a great, funky space! It's bright and fun, and totally private. Well outfitted with conveniences like a mini-fridge, coffee maker, washer and dryer, etc. It's huge, and could easily accommodate a small family or some friends traveling together, too. Visala has a great energy about her, and made me feel comfortable at once. Bonus: their dog is adorable. Enjoy!
41978	58503	9.0	10.0	52303205	It was a wonderful little basement with a nice tub. And a very comfy bed!
41979	58503	9.0	10.0	52684324	Beds were very comfortable and it was very roomy.  Had some issues getting to the entry at night so bring a flashlight.
41980	58503	9.0	10.0	53544456	Comfy and cozy stay. The weather was awful but there are plenty of places to eat nearby and when we got to Visala's basement apt, there was extra blankets and our favorite game of thrones to catch up on. The jacuzzi tub was awesome. If we come back to Seattle and need a place, we'll surly look up this spot again. Thank you visala!!
41981	58503	9.0	10.0	53664377	"Great AirBnB.
It was easy to find with great instructions. We were able to get into the place easily and had everything we needed.  Thanks Visala.
We walked down to the local pub to watch the Sounders.. Loved the neighborhood and the experience. I definitely recommend this stay."
41982	58503	9.0	10.0	53859244	Everything was great! Highly recommended.
41983	58503	9.0	10.0	54703064	We had a wonderful 1st Airbnb experience. The location was great for us. A very short drive to my daughters. The place was clean comfy and cozy with great coffee;) They had great hot water and with it being a little chilly out that was awesome to come back too.  They really had everything you need. I was so happy they had a hairdryer available since I had left mine at home.  The spacer heater in the bed room is a great idea just to get the room a little warmer before you sleep. We never had to have it on for long. Just a great plus. Dave and Visala were very nice. We would definitely go back. Thank so much! 
48421	9075656	10.0	10.0	52792999	Keith was a great host, had everything ready for my arrival, he's very mellow and helpful, has a book in the room on things to do and see in the city, made sure I had everything I needed and knew where things were in the house, checked in with me every day, great communication to get things set up even though I came last minute. The house is old and rustic and being renovated, it's not pristine and beautiful, but the room was clean, bed was super comfortable, shower is hot with lots of pressure, cats are nice, neighborhood is very quiet, heater in the room, space in the frig, big grocery store 1 block away, restaurants and shops within walking distance on the main street, bus line is close. Had a great stay and would do it again if I'm in the city and need a place to stay. 
48422	9075656	10.0	10.0	53639651	We had a great stay at Keith's place. The house and our room were great and we really liked the neighbourhood. Keith was a friendly and welcoming host- first offering to pick us up from the airport to help with our bags, and generally making our stay very comfortable. Keith provided tea, coffee and baked goods which was really nice. We loved the house and the neighbourhood. There were plenty of amenities in walking distance, and the neighbourhood was pleasant and felt safe. Our room was great with a nice comfortable bed. And it was a joy to meet Keith's two cats. Thanks Keith!
48423	9075656	10.0	10.0	55030487	"Keith was extremely welcoming and accomodating, and dedicated to guest's feedback — during my stay he added a reading lamp over the bed that a previous guest had suggested (much appreciated!).

I'm an avid cyclist and was borrowing a bike during my stay; Keith helped with me storing my bike, and use of the washer/dryer was extremely helpful to dry out after bike commuting through the rainy season!"
48424	9075656	10.0	10.0	55457944	Keith was an excellent host and is is very accommodating and friendly. His house is in a quiet neighbourhood with all the amenities included. It is a convenient location, with many shops and restaurants within walking distance in the Rainier area.  Definitely recommend!
48425	9075656	10.0	10.0	56542550	Keith was very friendly and approachable and had a lot of good recommendations. Very easy to be around and I still miss the cats Lucy and Walter.
48426	9075656	10.0	10.0	56945944	Keith is a very great host. He asked us what else we need when we arrived and got it for us. Kitties are quite cute. He was really nice to take us to the rail station next morning which is really helpful. Very Recommend. 
48427	9075656	10.0	10.0	57603557	Keith was incredibly accommodating.  He was flexible with arrival times. The room was clean and ready when I arrived. Cats were sweet but not clingy. His shower and bathroom were nice. Keith always offered to give me rides when he could, and was a very sweet host with a friendly disposition and great sense of humor. House is a cool old house in a good location, close to bus lines downtown. :) I highly recommend staying with Keith, and his cats, Lucy and Walter!
48428	9075656	10.0	10.0	58110722	We didn't get to meet Keith, unfortunately--we arrived late and left early--but Lucy the cat was an excellent ambassador and host-by-proxy! The home and neighborhood were very nice, the bedroom heater kept the room warm efficiently, and Keith thoughtfully left out some fruit that we were able to enjoy before we left in the morning. We would happily stay again!
48429	9075656	10.0	10.0	58249487	Quiet and comfortable location. Host was very responsive and accommodating to booking on short notice. Cats were cute and friendly :)
48430	9075656	10.0	10.0	58452855	A welcoming room with all the comforts of home. Extra hangers in the closet were a nice touch. 
50843	7900497	10.0	10.0	46039815	My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice, quiet place to spend the weekend with easy access to downtown Seattle and this apartment was perfect! Kathryn was really nice and helpful and we had a wonderful time!
51750	8473056	8.0	10.0	48829237	The house was exactly as described, small and charming and a perfect base for a weekend away.  Liza was helpful and quick to respond to queries, the neighbourhood is a quiet leafy suburb and a straightforward fifteen minute drive from downtown.  We were 3 adults and 3 children and we fit fine. Good value for a sweet house!
51751	8473056	8.0	10.0	57710454	We enjoyed our stay from the moment we walked into Liza's charming 1930's home. It was just as advertised, in a lovely neighborhood close to downtown Seattle. Since there were seven of us, we used the basement bedroom also, which was private and comfortable. It was our Christmas trip to see family and we spent our time playing games we brought - only to see they had games available there, too. Great first bnb experience for us. 
52087	4869458	10.0	10.0	29075384	Haotin was very welcoming and accommodating. He even gave me a welcome packet complete with needs to know around town and a Starbucks gift card. The listing was better than described. The neighborhood had a neat little community garden, a beaver creek and a super mall that had everything.
52088	4869458	10.0	10.0	29866530	The host is great. He made me feel at home right away.  The location is very convinient, less than 10 minutes walk to Northgate Transit Center, where there are buses going to all areas in Seattle/Bellevue area. There is mall, restaurant with in walking distance.  I ended up didn't need a car the whole time I was there.  The host and I I ran a couple of times to show me various parts of the town, which was very nice.  I would definitely stay again.
52089	4869458	10.0	10.0	30261902	"It was a very nice stay. The house is beautiful, I found lovely, fluffy blankets on the couch for me to use and stayed nice and warm at night and the bathroom is nice and spacious. I never got to meet Haotian because of conflicting work schedules, but we texted many times and he was very nice and hospitable and even left laundry soap for me to use when I had inquired about the washer and dryer. I am very happy with the experience I had and highly recommend this place to others. 

Also, the location is great if you're either traveling on foot or by car! Northgate Transit Center is just a couple of blocks away and you can get anywhere in the city from there. There's a beautiful hiking trail that goes along Piper's Creek on the same block as the house also, I definitely recommend walking that on one of these beautiful days we've been having lately. "
52090	4869458	10.0	10.0	31487324	Haotian is an amazingly nice guy. The couch is amazingly comfortable! It's an amazing experience.

52093	4869458	10.0	10.0	37730281	Haotian was a perfect host.  He went as far as installing a new ceiling fan for me during the heat wave that we had the two weeks I was in Seattle.  I loved the location and the hospitality that he and his family extended to me.  I will be back next summer for sure!
52094	4869458	10.0	10.0	41491932	Haotian was a friendly host. He provided me a lot useful information about Seattle. The house was easy to fined and very cleaning and neat. 
52095	4869458	10.0	10.0	41845221	I stayed at Haotain's place for 2 nights. The place locates in decent neighborhood. Easily transport from/to the airport by light rail and bus no. 41. Near the shopping mall, coffee shops, and restaurants. I was provided the passcode for the door prior to the arrival date, which is very convenient when the owner is away. I'm supposed to sleep on the couch but got upgraded to the bed in one of his bedrooms. The place has everything you need - Wifi, kitchen, cable TV. Overall, this place is convenient and affordable.
52096	4869458	10.0	10.0	43290428	Great host, clean and comfy couch, close to transit. I'd definitely recommend it to others.

He was generous, too, in allowing me to park my car in one of his driveway. He provided me a complimentary upgrade from his couch to the entire bottom floor (including a full kitchen) of his home for me to use. Though the place was quite cold on arrival, the heating system worked perfectly and provided a warm, comfortable place to sleep at night.
52099	4869458	10.0	10.0	56325976	I felt very welcomed and had nothing but positive interactions. The couch was indeed large and comfortable. I would have no hesitation staying with Haotian the next time I am in Seattle. 
53055	1534622	9.0	10.0	7170214	Quiet, convenient and comfortable - I had a nice stay at Melissa's place in Seattle. 
53056	1534622	9.0	10.0	8028183	Melissa's place was clean, quiet an safe, with convenient street parking and conveniently located next to the university village. Small and basic rooms in a large house in the U district, its nothing fancy but its great if you just need a dependable place to stay in walking distance of the university.
53057	1534622	9.0	10.0	8336755	I can only echo all that has been written below. Melissa runs a tidy clean and warm ship, excellently situated and she proved kind, caring and extremely accommodating. You will have to look far to get better......Book quick!
53058	1534622	9.0	10.0	9739427	My first experience with airbnb was excellent. The room was tidy and had all I needed. Melissa was wonderful, very helpful and respond quickly. I can absolutely recommend her.

53060	1534622	9.0	10.0	19656113	"Cute little room. Clean. You have a desk to put a laptop. Bathroom nearby, clean too. You will share it with others roommates but I didn't have any schedule issue. Free laundry in the basement. 
Melissa was nice, she checked everything was fine."
53061	1534622	9.0	10.0	19973317	It was awesome being able to stay in the U District. I am a transfer student to the University of Washington and I was looking for a place to live when I first got to town. Melissa's place was a good place to crash after a long day of apartment hunting and running errands. The place is simple, but practical. The Wifi was fast and the sheets were soft, and that's about all I needed. Thanks Melissa!
53062	1534622	9.0	10.0	21882284	Room as described. Was under the I I I had the impression that it would be cleaned twice weekly, but it turned out to be every two weeks. House was quite old and squeaky. OK stay over all
53063	1534622	9.0	10.0	27265130	The place was as stated: quiet. Though I did not meet the host until about two weeks after checking is, she was nice and friendly. There were three or four other people staying there; but you wouldn't really know it because they all kept to themselves. As far as the neighborhood goes, it is mellow, no crazy parties like you would hear when closer to the UW campus. Bus lines were close and so were all the essential stores. University Village is about 10 minutes away via walking.

53065	1534622	9.0	10.0	31648247	"Melissa was an incredible host.I had good time in this shore house.All share mates are kind and friendly.Location is so nice.Close to University Village,so I could go shopping to QFC(market).And more I went to University of Washington by working.
I would recommend staying at the house.Lovely house and host.
I felt satisfied:)"
53066	1534622	9.0	10.0	34318689	I had stayed in this room for a month and the room looks same as it is in the photo. I haven't met the host Melissa even once but there was no problem for me. She asked me to wash the beddings before I leave, and it was a little exotic experience to me because it is always the host's job in my home country. I had to unclog the toilet on the date I arrived and the bed was a little uncomfortable for me. Except for these, I really enjoyed my stay here! The location and neighborhood is really, really awesome ; clean, safe, quiet, and convenient. Everything is in a walking distance, plus the transportation is really easy of access. You don't necessarily rent a car to live here. I was satisfied for almost every aspect of this room and I will miss my stay here in U village.
53067	1534622	9.0	10.0	44630220	"A really great place  for my summer internship!

You can find anything you need in 5-minute walking distance. There are supermarket, restaurants, Apple store nearby. There is even a Michelin-starred one."
53068	1534622	9.0	10.0	45347669	Wonderful place close to University Village. Melissa was the perfect host, and the room is nice and lovely.  I love the comfortable bed! 
53069	1534622	9.0	10.0	46290973	"I stayed in this room for 3 days during the Labor Day weekend. The room is quiet and comfortable, as it looks in the pictures. The only thing is that there is not much sunlight because the window is small.
The location is very close to the University and about 10-15 minutes driving to any other place in Seattle. Plenty of street parking too.
There are two bathrooms (shared with the other guests) which were always clean.
I didn't meet Melissa because I was out most of the time, but she wrote to check if everything was fine on the first day. 
Overall I was happy with my stay and the price is very reasonable. I will definitely go there again if I return to Seattle."
53070	1534622	9.0	10.0	53179081	The room was just as it was described in the listing. The host was very helpful and quick to respond to any questions that I had.  I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again if I am ever back in the neighborhood.  The room is very close to UW, university village, and the Burke-Gillman trail making everything easy to access.  The neighborhood is nice, quiet, and safe. Nice place to stay for long or short term.
54079	3479851	10.0	10.0	38215960	"Morgan's apartment was charming, and the bed comfy. My daughter slept on the sofa with blankets from the chest by the wall. We didn't use the a/c, but I did use the small bedside fan in the bedroom at night. We boiled water for tea but did no other cooking, and besides the bottle of Washington wine (Thanks!) no food for us in the apt. Bring your own coffee tea sweeteners etc. You are allowed to use the spices and store grocs. in the fridge. Loved the balcony for the sights sounds and fresh air.loved the bakery near apt entrance (Le Fournil), got breakfast there everyday.
Location was good, bus ride downtown(several routes), bus etc transport good here.close to hike and bike across the bridge, also University of Washington campus.
Great stay, highly recommend!"

54087	3479851	10.0	10.0	50109654	Morgan was readily available to meet me at the apartment, left a bottle of wine, and a lovely place to stay. Clean, well outfitted, great location. Loved the balcony and the sound from city was more white noise than anything else. French pastries and fresh flowers down stairs. Great stay.
54088	3479851	10.0	10.0	50657968	We had an amazing 3 days in Seattle. Morgan's apartment was exactly as pictured, super clean, cozy, and had a lot of personal touches. We drove everywhere, and really liked how close it was to everything - 10 mins away from pretty much anywhere. She gave us a bottle of Washington wine with was very much appreciated, and gave us recommendations as to where to eat and drink. Overall a perfect stay. 
54089	3479851	10.0	10.0	51123232	Morgan's place was even better than expected. She met us when we arrived and gave us a little tour of her apartment and lots of hints on what to do and where to go, how to get there!

Would definitely stay here again.

54436	8597687	10.0	10.0	48978278	William and his mother Helen were so kind and welcoming to me even though I booked last minute. I was their first guest and they had a few things to still get in room but we're so accommodating.

59444	1790020	9.0	10.0	8515222	My daughter stayed just 1 night with Cc, but said the room & apartment were scrupulously clean, very nicely appointed and comfortable. Also he was so accommodating about the arrangements so everything was settled without a single problem & my daughter was ready to relax & watch a movie instead of worrying about where she would lay her head that evening. Thank you for being a great host & sharing your home.

59446	1790020	9.0	10.0	8707265	"Apartment is comfortable and well-(website hidden) Powell was very responsive.  Views from the apartment are indeed stunning.

Our one qualm was that host could have been a little more up-front about the fact that he would be renting multiple rooms to multiple air bnb'ers at the same time.  We did not realize this until after we had confirmed the rental.  It did not end up being a problem, but it would have been nice to have full information."
59447	1790020	9.0	10.0	8749207	Very nice and comfortable, and certainly a stunning view off the balcony of Seattle.  Though he stayed elsewhere, Calen was super nice and responsive.  Recommended. 
59448	1790020	9.0	10.0	8796580	We spent two nights at Calen's place while visiting Seattle. He made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed, which was much appreciated. The apartment has great views and is extremely clean. It is also conveniently located and there are a ton of things to do in the neighbourhood. We had a wonderful time!

59456	1790020	9.0	10.0	9933624	Calen's place was amazing and in a very convenient location. It was pleasure staying at his place and hope to stay again in the future whenever I visit Seattle. He was very responsive and available so my friend and I never felt lost in the city. Also, his dog Lucky was an absolute sweetheart. 
59457	1790020	9.0	10.0	10118600	"It was really great staying in Powell's place. Good location! It's quite convenient for grocery shopping and local restaurants. And there are bunch of bus lines for downtown. about 20 mins to get there.
The place itself is cozy and comfortable. I lived there for 12 nights. I did enjoy sitting on the high chair to see the beautiful sunset and space needle. And the room is comfortable. 
Calan is friendly and really responsive. He also gave me advice when I was finding a place to live in Seattle. BTW, I do like Lucky. She is so cute."
59458	1790020	9.0	10.0	10142659	My boyfriend and I stayed in the flat in Seattle and had a great time! The location is very convenient and the flat is super nice. We had everything we needed and were quite comfortable with our stay. I would highly recommend this place for any guests wanting to visit Seattle!
59459	1790020	9.0	10.0	10311875	Our time at the apartment of Calen was great! The communication with Calen was very smooth and the room was all set up when we arrived. Especially the breakfast place is great, with a nice view. We also enjoyed the location a lot, a great neighborhood where you wouldn't end up if you'd book a hostel/hotel. The only thing that didn't worked out for us was that the hot water wasn't working. However, Calen was on top of it to fix and it was probably an incidental thing.
59460	1790020	9.0	10.0	10423589	Great location and accommodation. Accommodation was comfortable. Apt is centrally located near great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. Highly recommend!
59461	1790020	9.0	10.0	10539567	Cc's  house was clean, comfortable, and very well located.  The view IS great, I wish the weather had been nicer so we could have used to patio more!  My only (small) complaint is that we did not realize that there would be other guests staying in the apartment, and in the morning they got up early and were a little noisy while we were trying to sleep (I don't think they knew we were there either).  Overall it was a great way to experience Seattle on a budget!  
59462	1790020	9.0	10.0	10613681	Calen was a lifesaver during a recent business trip to Seattle. When my travel arrangements were abruptly changed I was left without a room for the evening. Calen responded to my lodging request with lighting speed and within a matter of minutes I was on my way over to his Capitol Hill apartment. location location location. This apartment was mere blocks from so many of the shops, bars and restaurants that make Capitol Hill. The room was warm, comfortable and smelled of fresh laundry.  Having the bathroom next to the bedroom was very convenient as well. I slept soundly and awoke the next morning re-energized. The view from the balcony was to die for. The ease of booking last minute, the comfortable and well appointed room and excellent location turned my stay in Seattle from a business trip to one of pleasure. I will be giving Calen a heads up next time I am in Seattle and I recommend you do too.
59463	1790020	9.0	10.0	10675813	Great view! Great host! Very helpful and nice guy.

59465	1790020	9.0	10.0	10911079	Thank you so much for allowing us to stay! We had a great time in Seattle and the location of your place was just perfect. Hope to stay with you again :)
59466	1790020	9.0	10.0	10938702	Calen was responsive when I had questions and he allowed me to stay till whenever my ride could get me during the day of check out which was like 5pm and I was so grateful as I had so many bags and not much of anywhere else to go. I'm really grateful for that. The location was PERFECT. I would maybe suggest putting individual locks on the outside of the bedroom doors considering there's usually two separate bookings in the apartment. My bed and sleep were quite cozy.
59467	1790020	9.0	10.0	11101271	As like the last time, CC's place was warm and inviting. With a Perfect location and beautiful balcony view on a nice day, his place is a jewel of the emerald city! I will definitely stay there again! 
59468	1790020	9.0	10.0	11170893	Calen's spot was ideally situated.  Once we figured out the Seattle public transit system, it was a snap getting to different neighborhoods in the city.  Capitol Hill itself has some great restaurants.  And Calen's tourist guide resources (maps and guidebooks) made discovering Seattle lots of fun.
59469	1790020	9.0	10.0	11238006	His place is very clean and has a very stunning view !!! I love that it is very quiet and very close to Volunteer park and broadway! Will definately come back here !!

His balcony is awesome! It's covered and has a cozy sofa with an amazing view!"
59471	1790020	9.0	10.0	11287859	Apartment was in a great location, very close to Capitol Hill! Host was very quick to respond to questions, very helpful! There were a lot of stairs, heads up to folks with mobility issues (my partner has nerve damage in her legs, so it was a little rough for her, but then again, all of Seattle is a little rough for people with mobility issues). Parking in this location was difficult (all restricted with 2-4 hr limits 7am-6pm m-f), but cabs/lyft/uber are great in this area so if you're not driving it's a fantastic spot. 
59472	1790020	9.0	10.0	11503265	"Calen was an amazing host!! Even before I arrived, he contacted me to confirm the arrangements and give sine good suggestions and advice. He also checked in during my stay to make sure everything was going well.  He was very available and knew the city well.
The apartment was a cozy place with all the amenities of home.  You cannot beat the location; there was a ton to do and see in the immediate area.  Getting downtown or to other neighborhoods did not take long at all.  
If you are going to Seattle, stay here."
59473	1790020	9.0	10.0	11583910	My host was gracious and kind in the face of my inability to travel. Caught the flu, and he was sincerely disappointed we wouldn't meet. I will visit him on my next trip. His location is great, the heart of Seattle and near by daughter. I recommend him highly. 
59474	1790020	9.0	10.0	11678193	Cc is a great host. The location is the best! Lots of places to go for food and entertainment. A bus ride or a cheap cab away from downtown Seattle. The other house guests were very friendly.
59475	1790020	9.0	10.0	11834831	i really had a pleasant stay at cc's place.  the view of the seattle skyline from the balcony is fantastic!  the condo is located in the capitol hill neighbourhood and was (for me) a good walking distance to all of the tourist spots and things i wanted to see: the monorail and space needle campus, pike place market, and the ferry terminal to bainbridge (website hidden) was very easy to communicate with and very likeable and accommodating; when i arrived at the condo, he was there to meet me and chat for a while, even though he had someplace to be at that time.  his place is tidy and comfortable.  i only wished i had more time to spend in the city... one day isn't nearly enough... thanks, calin!
59476	1790020	9.0	10.0	11904318	Calen was a great host and his place was perfect.  He went out of his way to make it ideal for AirBnBers.  You won't regret staying there!
59477	1790020	9.0	10.0	11941008	Calen is a lovely guy. We left our wallet in the room accidentally and travelled back to Los Angeles which could have been a disaster but Calen was so helpful and fedexed it for us. He is really cool and welcoming. Great flat in the best part of town surrounded by bars, shops, great coffee shops..There are 2 rooms. One looked really inviting and well furnished. Our room was still being decorated and basically just a bed and a lamp so we felt the price was perhaps a little high considering but Im sure itll be worth it when its turned into a nice room.
59478	1790020	9.0	10.0	12096091	Calen was a very pleasant host. He was very respectful and made the experience that much better. He answered all of our texts and gave advice to the best of his ability. I would definitely recommend staying with him.

59499	1790020	9.0	10.0	15898400	The host was very on the ball. Made sure we had clear communication and regular updates to meet, even after I moved up my arrival time.  The place is very clean and has everything you need + more. Love the projection screen & comfy couch and room.  Was great to have a bit of time to chat and hang out with him.  The area is great if you love the Capital Hill area.  Will surely look to see if this is available again next time!
59500	1790020	9.0	10.0	15962620	Great spot in Capital Hill. Easy communication with host and simple check in process. I would definitely stay here again. 
59501	1790020	9.0	10.0	16108152	The apartment was in a great location, and on a quiet street. The bed was comfy and the balcony was an awesome place to watch the sunset over the city! We had a short stay and didn't have a chance to meet Calen, but he had a convenient key-system that made the check-in and check-out completely simple. thanks for sharing your space!
59502	1790020	9.0	10.0	16248088	Calen was an amiable host and gave me the lay of the land and points of interest in the neighborhood.  The bedroom I had was adequate but a little worn.  The space was definitely no frills but in general served my needs.  The condo is three flights up with no elevator.  The view from the condo is a nice lookout over most of the city.  It is conveniently located to all parts of Capitol Hill.  The bathroom and shower housekeeping could have been better in my opinion.  Communication between the hosts and the others sharing the condo with me was severely lacking.  They had no idea I was there and stumbled upon me in the bathroom and were rather vociferous in their disappointed surprise.  I feel better care could have been taken with this.  Also worth mentioning - my bedroom had a leak in the ceiling over the bed.  Luckily this presented itself on my last morning there.  All in all, an okay experience but I wouldn't book here again.  I would prefer a place with no others sharing.  Live and learn on my part.  I feel the pricing could have been better for what it was.  It is my hope that Calen will improve his offering based upon this listing.  Live and Learn on both our parts.          
59503	1790020	9.0	10.0	16570338	Close to downtown 
59504	1790020	9.0	10.0	16675834	Amazing set up by Calen. The place was very well cleaned and stocked. Great views and the balcony set up was perfect for watching the sunset with a beer.
59505	1790020	9.0	10.0	17166839	I have a lot of fun during my visit in Seattle, the place is strategically located only several blocks from Broadway St, 12th and Pike St, and 15th Ave where great restos and cafes, bookshops, records stores are. So in terms of location this place is ideal. Calen as the host is very easy to communicate with and very responsive. He provides clear direction and description of the building (sends pictures, nice!) and also makes sure that guests needs are accommodated. A very nice host. The place is as described by the owner, the view is nice especially to watch the sunset. The projector and Roku was a lot of fun, I watched a bit of movie while waiting for my taxi. The place has the feel of a bachelor pad, and it reminds me a lot of a graduate student apartment, which is not bad as it gives the instant welcome feeling but it yes I agree with some comments that say it could use some vacuuming.   
59506	1790020	9.0	10.0	17441566	I had a delightful time at Calen's. The room was clean and comfortable. The apartment is very nicely situated in Seattle and is a great launching pad to explore Capitol Hill. Calen was friendly and always promptly answered any questions. I would be very happy to stay with Calen again.
59507	1790020	9.0	10.0	17547152	"Calen was very helpful in our last minute booking, made it really simple to check in and always remained in contact with us. We only stayed for a short night but the apartment/mini two-room hotel is well run, very clean with everything you would need for a longer stay.  The balcony is quite a nice spot.

Residential neighborhood, parking wasn't easy to find later in the evening but it was just a short walk to the Broadway or the other busier streets of Capitol Hill.
I would recommend this place to others
"
59508	1790020	9.0	10.0	17590408	Calen was the best host we have ever had.  He knew when to email and when to let us be, the place was spotless, had ALL the amenities (blow dryer, water, shampoo, conditioner, maps of Seattle, brochures) - everything was thoughtful. The room stayed cool the way he had the windows and fan set up. The balcony was my favorite part. I fell asleep watching the downtown view of Seattle and listening to the sound of light traffic in the cool breeze. It was wonderful!
59509	1790020	9.0	10.0	17661165	I had a wonderful stay and really enjoyed the experience. The location was perfect in Capital Hill and the accommodations were as described. The view from the balcony was beautiful. I would definitely make a return visit!
59510	1790020	9.0	10.0	17775981	Calen was a very hospitable host- friendly and informative! The apartment was quite nice and in a pretty convenient location. We walked downtown from the apartment on both days, taking in lots of sights and coffee, and it only took about 30 minutes or so... The private room we stayed in was nice and clean... Yes, there is a lovely view from the terrace, and it was nice to sit out there, particularly at night with the city lit up... This was my first Airbnb experience, and I must say it was a positive one! I definitely would recommend Calen and his digs any time.
59511	1790020	9.0	10.0	18196140	Calen was a wonderful and engaging host. The space was awesome and it was great meeting so many interesting guests. The space was very clean and welcoming and OH MAN that view! I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Seattle. The neighborhood is fantastic as well, theres a ton to do and its all in easy walking distance. 
59512	1790020	9.0	10.0	18342624	"This was truly a great place to stay, a beautiful and safe neighborhood. Totally walkable and close to many gems in the city. 

Calen is a seasoned and respectable host. The room was a nice size and well ventilated. Great balcony view too; would come back! Thanks so much. "
59513	1790020	9.0	10.0	18410252	Calen was a good communicator and very nice. The place was Clean, comfortable and convenient.  Plenty of towels. The bed and sheets were comfortable. The fans were nice to have in the bedroom. I would describe it as a bachelor pad experience. Shared hallway bathroom with another guest.  He provided toiletries and blow dryer. 2 waters, but no coffee or tea. The apt was walking distance to a hip area. We easily found free parking. You have to walk up a lot of steps to get to the apt. He had a key box outside which made checking in easy. Calen provided a key to the bedroom which was good because another stranger is sharing the space.  The kitchen is good if you want to cook and there is a nice view. There is a great grocery store in walking distance.  No tv but he had a projector for netflix. Internet worked well.  Thanks for having us! 
59514	1790020	9.0	10.0	18631283	This is my second time staying with Calen and everything went well just like the first time. 
59515	1790020	9.0	10.0	18666530	The neighborhood had a lot of great places within walking distance.  We spent a lot of time down by the water which was a short, easy cab ride from his place.
59516	1790020	9.0	10.0	18992256	"Although we never met Calen in person, he was a wonderful host and easy to get in touch with! The space is exactly how it is shown here. There was another guest in the other room who we saw once or twice, but to be honest we were out of the apartment and exploring the city for the majority of our stay. 

The apartment was clean and cozy, hot water, room to unpack, a cute balcony and kitchen area. The area was great. Only a block or two from a grocery store. Less than a 10 minute walk to a ton of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and only a $6 Uber/Lyft ride downtown to the heart of the city.  

We had a rental car for one night and had no trouble with street parking right out front, although it may be a bit more difficult during a weekend. All and all, the bus system was easy, Captiol Hill area was safe, and Calen did a great job hosting my boyfriend and I in his apartment. Thanks!"
59517	1790020	9.0	10.0	19101412	Calen was great with checking in on us when we flew in, and making sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. Our stay was wonderful, and we had a great time there. The location was wonderful, and we just had an overall excellent time. 
59518	1790020	9.0	10.0	19565959	Our experience in Seattle at Calen 's place was really nice. Communication was clear and the apartment is located in a very nice area! We could walk to bars and restaurants easily.
59519	1790020	9.0	10.0	19662413	Although I did not get to meet Calen, he was very communicative regarding keys & check-in. The location of the place is great- it was walking distance to Pike St and Capitol Hill attractions. 
59520	1790020	9.0	10.0	19849254	"Calen was professional and responsive throughout my entire stay.  As other reviewers stated, he is also a nice guy and possesses lots of interesting information about Seattle.  

I definitely recommend him to other travelers.   "
59521	1790020	9.0	10.0	20297198	Calen was a fantastic host! He was very friendly, helpful, and easy to contact even when he wasn't at the apartment. The place was comfortable, clean, and in a really great location. I would definitely stay here again!
59522	1790020	9.0	10.0	20521795	Calen's place was great to stay at while in Seattle.  The place was tidy and the room was comfortable.  I walked to downtown twice, but there's also a bus only a few blocks away.  Plenty of food and bars also within walking distance.
59523	1790020	9.0	10.0	20638097	The apartment was clean. Calen was reachable via email, and quick to respond. The attached balcony had a great view of downtown. Capitol hill is by far my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, and his apt. Is within walking distance to it all. Was thoroughly impressed and would stay again.
59524	1790020	9.0	10.0	21108403	Good location in Capitol Hill, quiet and comfy bed ! 
59525	1790020	9.0	10.0	21360939	"Everything went smoothly with my stay at Calen's place. Apartment was as advertised, and while I did not get a chance to catch up with Calen in person, he responded well to my emails and texts in the lead-up to my stay.

Instructions on picking up the key from the key box and a map of street parking proved helpful as well. The room is fairly non-descript, nothing fancy, but it gets the job done if you are just in need of a bed for the evenings. Bathroom and rest of the apartment were clean, and the balcony has a nice chair to enjoy a sweet view of the city.

The location of the apartment is its most stellar plus. Calen's place is a good deal to be able to park yourself in a great spot in the city. Bars, coffee shops, etc. all within a short walk within Capitol Hill, and getting to other neighborhoods for further exploration is totally doable by foot or bus. 

Overall, a solid, successful stay. "
59526	1790020	9.0	10.0	21499818	Had a good stay at Calen's apartment. On the evening there was another guest, there was ample escape routes for my inner introvert  (deck couch, private room). And on the evenings there wasn't, I had the view of the city all to myself. The fridge was stocked with a surprising diversity of beer. Centrally located near Broadway, the beating heart of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. So plenty of good coffee in reach.
59527	1790020	9.0	10.0	21648389	We arrived late and left early. However, were able to enjoy the conveniently located apartment. Furthermore, Calen was able to seamlessly accommodate us last minute, which ended up working perfect for our roadtrip. 
59528	1790020	9.0	10.0	21817543	Calen was Johnny on the spot for welcoming us and showing me where everything was. His place is all it is cracked up to be location, location, location!! Straight shot to the waterfront, great walking around neighborhood and gorgeous view of the Olympic Mountains with breakfast. My husband and I were only there one night and wish it could have been longer!! We will definitely be back to Calen's!
59529	1790020	9.0	10.0	21920630	"After reading glowing reviews, was actually not that happy with my stay at Calen's apartment. Calen was friendly and my room was clean enough. The bathroom wasn't super fresh and I wish there had been a floor mat that wasn't already soaking and covered with dog hair. Didn't think it was worth $100/night.  But MOST IMPORTANTLY, Calen gave my room key to the other couple staying in the apartment for the weekend by accident and when we couldn't open the locked door because he had given them his only key (all my stuff was inside) he made NO effort to retrieve the key or rectify the situation. He only sent them a text asking when they would be back. Hours later I asked if he had gotten they key or heard from the other Airbnb guests, and he said they had texted ""oops"" and that he ""assumed they [would] be back later tonight."" So there I was alone in Seattle, all of my things locked in a strange apartment, and I wasn't even sure I would be able to sleep in the bed I had rented for the weekend. Not impressed. Luckily the other guests left my room key for me before they went out for dinner. "
59530	1790020	9.0	10.0	22268509	Calen was awesome! He was very informative, answered all my questions promptly, and the place was clean and organized when we arrived. He gave us clear instructions regarding parking and the check-in process. I would definitely book with Calen again!
59531	1790020	9.0	10.0	22391481	Awesome location, comfortable apartment, and very easy to communicate with Calen.  I recommend. 
59532	1790020	9.0	10.0	22449898	This is best place for the best value that you will find in Capital Hill Seattle. Hands down. It is in a central location, just a short walk to the Capital Hill scene. It's equipped for a quick stay, or a longer stay. It has an awesome deck with a view of the city skyline. The bedrooms are comfortable. The TV projector with Netflix is great. The place is thoughtfully arranged and equipped to make guests comfortable and efficient. 
59533	1790020	9.0	10.0	22474465	I was in late and out early, but the place was clean and well-located.  Calen was kind and easy to get in touch with.  
59534	1790020	9.0	10.0	22516738	Calen's deck is located in a quiet, pleasant neighborhood, 15 mins to the Seattle night life by walking (rests and clubs). Although we didn't get to meet, it was really easy to follow his instructions and access to the apto. Thank you Calen! Travelers'd better keep in mind that the bathroom is shared.
59535	1790020	9.0	10.0	22994863	Calen was a great host and was very helpful at helping me get my bearings of Seattle at large; as well as the Capitol Hill neighborhood. His place was exactly as described—very centrally located and with fast wifi.  
59536	1790020	9.0	10.0	23084773	Very responsive to messages and left clear instructions/pictures of the building including how to get in.  The room was clean and bed comfortable.
59537	1790020	9.0	10.0	23375135	Initially I was delighted with my choice of accomodations due to the four block proximity to my daughter. The bed was great, all seemed good, and the view was terrific. But life went downhill fast. thanksgiving night we returned to find the bathroom toilet was nonfunctional. After a large meal I found it necessary for a flushing toilet and we had to go out at 11:30 pm. But, hey, it was a holiday so I let it pass as things that happen. The next day though we returned to find it was still non functioning. I calmed Tim down and we decided to stay and just walked to my daughters that night. The third day we returned to an apartment that not only STILL did not have a functioning toilet, but now the heater was no functioning in the bedroom and it was 18 degrees outside, no electrical plugs worked in the bedroom(s) or bathroom, and Calen did not text me back until Sunday about where the electrical panel was. Too late. I have medical equipment that needed electricity so I slept on the couch because we found one in the living room that worked and I could plug to. There were not enough blankets and the German girl from the next bedroom came out, freezing, and slept sitting beside me. We left the bathroom door open Sunday to get enough light to shower and packed up. My partner, Tim, was furious and haranged me for the whole fifteen hour drive back home Sunday about the fact that he feels we should be reimbursed for the last two days. I had held him back from calling the city about sanitation laws when the toilet never got fixed!  It was disappointing as I love the location. Calen needs a property manager to attend to items of that sort!
59538	1790020	9.0	10.0	23517718	Had another comfortable stay on Capitol Hill at Calen's place. Coming in from Chicago for business this was an easy place to walk to everything on the hill. 
59539	1790020	9.0	10.0	23665435	Super convenient location, clean room, great communication from the host. Highly recommended.
59540	1790020	9.0	10.0	23851162	Calen has a very nice apartment located in an easily accessible part of Capitol Hill. Everything about the apartment was as advertised and I didn't have any trouble finding it or following Calen's instructions for how to get in. The bed is comfortable and there is a space heater in the bedroom so you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level. I didn't actually have a chance to meet Calen in person, but he was very responsive and helpful in providing information about his place.
59541	1790020	9.0	10.0	24156055	Calen communicated everything clearly in regard to the reservation and throughout the stay.  The room was clean and only walking distance from downtown.  I enjoyed my stay and would definitely return to Calen's Capitol Hill home. 
59542	1790020	9.0	10.0	24397484	Clean, simple, straightforward experience. Calen's communications made for a smooth transition in and out. Great neighborhood, lovely views. My first choice Seattle spot.
59543	1790020	9.0	10.0	24488162	Calen and his Capitol Hill apartment were awesome.  This place couldn't have been more walkable to everything I wanted to do in Seattle.  Calen was extremely helpful via txt message, he was kind and welcoming, and the instructions about the apartment were very clear.  I am definitely renting Calen's place on my next Seattle trip!
59544	1790020	9.0	10.0	24670372	It is as advertised with a great 4th floor patio view.  The bedroom as roomy and there are local transportation and travel guides provided.  Soaps and hair products are made available.  Heating throughout seems to be by only portable mini electric heaters.  Therefore, when, for example, the bathroom door is closed that room can get quite chilly because there are only heaters in bedrooms and the living room.  Overall, the place is clean, reasonably tidy, roomy, and very well located.
59545	1790020	9.0	10.0	24979559	We thoroughly enjoyed our Seattle experience at Calen's. This quaint apartment is not only close to awesome restaurants and bars, it is also just a short walk to downtown. Also, Calen offers several gracious amenities, including mini shampoos, and access to relevant literature to occupy cozy downtime. 2 thumbs up. This one gets the game ball.
59546	1790020	9.0	10.0	25244368	"The apartment was easy to locate, the directions were clear with photos. Calen provided prompt responses to questions throughout our trip. It was a wonderful experience to stay here. We were not only seeing the hotspots for tourists, but we were also able to explore Capitol Hill like a local. Easy access to nearby (3-4 blocks) bars, restaurants, pizza joints, super markets. Neighborhood was very pretty. Nice houses and nice people also.

The apartment was very laid back and chill. We were able to wake up warm, cook our own food, enjoy a great view, and just sit back and watch Netflix after a long day. Transportation to the rest of the city was spectacular and easy. It was a pleasure to meet and chat with Calen when he came by to clean up. "
59547	1790020	9.0	10.0	25304004	Two thumbs up. Calen is quick to respond and very organized. He had the room ready for my arrival and instructions in my inbox immediately. The house is very clean and comfortable. Calen had even left me a couple of bottles of water, which was a nice personal touch, especially if you've arrived thirsty from traveling.  The apartment couldn't be in a better location, just a few minute's walk from Capital Hill shopping, dining and nightlife. I'll definitely book the next time I'm in Seattle.
59548	1790020	9.0	10.0	25519546	Calen was an exceptional host, though we never met, he was very responsive to text messages and air bnb messages whenever we needed a question answered. He was very flexible and easy going by allowing us to sleep in a little over the check out time and was generous and gracious. 
59549	1790020	9.0	10.0	25588269	Calen was great and in constant communication. It was my first airbnb and I would recommend it. No complaints!
59550	1790020	9.0	10.0	25731429	Calen was a great host. Flexible with check in and check out times. The location is incredible, with great views from the apartment and lots of cools things to do nearby. I liked the neighborhood and was a better experience than when I stayed at a hostel in downtown Seattle. The room was clean and spacious. I liked that he had a desk where I could work when I needed to.
59551	1790020	9.0	10.0	25783204	Really great place, even better in person. Bed was comfortable, heating blanket and small heater in the room (not that it needed it). The apartment is on a somewhat busy street, but the bedroom was quiet. Parking was the only downside, but I can't argue with the location: within a 10 minute walk to about everything you would want to do. Calen was super quick to respond, even though I booked last minute. 
59552	1790020	9.0	10.0	25819017	Calen is a terrific host with a really great space. I had unusually warm January weather and having coffee on the balcony with a view of downtown and the Cascade Mountains was terrific. I walked everywhere and getting downtown was a snap. Thanks, Calen.
59553	1790020	9.0	10.0	26122673	We had an excellent stay at Calen's place, it is well recommended. Calen provides plenty information about the local area, the room and apartment is great and is located in a fun area. Would definitely recommend this place to others. 
59554	1790020	9.0	10.0	26345047	Staying at Calen's was incredibly easy and convenient. His apartment is in a phenomenal location to explore the city! And Calen is very knowledgeable about the neighbourhood and happy to provide suggestions! The apartment itself is clean and comfortable. 
59555	1790020	9.0	10.0	26547916	We had a great stay at Calen's. The room is small but cozy. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The living room has a projector that was fun to use during down time. The location is great! Close to everything we needed: pharmacy, supermarket, coffee shops, restaurants, and public transportation. I downloaded Lyft and got 10 free rides of $20 (try using ELISA233843 to see if you can get the same) and that was very helpful. We never met Calen but he was always very helpful and easy to contact. I wouldn't mind staying there again. Thanks Calen. 
59556	1790020	9.0	10.0	26668507	Very comfortable stay, nice guy. He accommodated us with very short notice and we were very happy!! Would recommend 
59557	1790020	9.0	10.0	27000869	"Calen is the man! His apartment was clean and conveniently located, he had a very generous set-up, and went well out of his way to make sure I had a great time in Seattle. You really can't go wrong with the host or the space. Thanks again, Calen!

59560	1790020	9.0	10.0	27898752	I stayed a little under two weeks while apartment-hunting and this place served as a great home-base. After getting a quick response for booking the room, check-in was explained clearly in a text message, so even though no-one was around when I arrived, I was able to get access to the place quickly and easily. Calen's knowledge of the city proved insightful when he was at the the apartment a couple days later. He has a bulletin board with loads of thank-you notes from previous guests, so I felt I wasn't the only one who enjoyed my stay. It was a positive AirBnB stay overall. 
59561	1790020	9.0	10.0	28188835	Two thums up! I deeply appreciate a very warm welcome from Calen. Few days prior to arriving his place, he already provided many details enough in clear ways, so I didn't get confused and didn't have any problem with enjoyng the place at all. I liked clean bedroom, fast wifi. The place is located in he Capito Hill area where you can enjoy nightlife.
59562	1790020	9.0	10.0	28278762	Good place. Calen was very helpful and easily reachable. He made check in and check out easy. The apartment is cool and good location. Thank you!

59567	1790020	9.0	10.0	29708833	We very much enjoyed our stay here. Calen was a great host and really helped the whole process run smoothly. It is very conveniently located and just what we were looking for during our few days in Seattle. Much recommended! :)
59568	1790020	9.0	10.0	30055671	I booked last
59569	1790020	9.0	10.0	30323600	Everything was great. The apartment is in a very nice part of Capitol Hill with all the amenities including a yoga and barre studio nearby. There were basic things including towels and shampoo included.
59570	1790020	9.0	10.0	30539550	Comfortable stay in a great location. The view from the deck is incredible.
59571	1790020	9.0	10.0	30720983	Perfect location! The place was close to the bus line and the city was a 15 minute walk away. The apartment was clean and has a balcony with a view of the city. Calen was personable and helpful. He gave us some suggestions of things to see based on our interests and even got us in touch with another guest staying the same weekend to see if we wanted to include him. Capitol Hill is a beautiful neighborhood with friendly people. I would definitely recommend this place to a fellow adventurer. 
59572	1790020	9.0	10.0	31019734	"Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood with wonderful restaurants and bars just up the hill from 12th Ave East on 15th Ave East - extremely accessible to Calen's place. I had a great late night meal on arrival at Hopvine, a pub, plus dinner with friends that I met on my trip at Jamjuree and amazing Thai place next door to Hopvine. We finished the evening with an amazing drink, ""Point of No Return"" at Liberty on the other side of Jamjuree. Try the drink if you dare:)

Calen was an excellent host. He communicated with me in advance when I asked questions. For the most part I didn't see him until my last evening because I was in Seattle working on a project at Creative Live and had to be in the studio by 8 AM and for the most part came back to Calen's place late.

BTW, there is excellent bus service to other parts of town just 2 blocks away. I chose not to hassle a car in Seattle on this trip."
59573	1790020	9.0	10.0	31861557	We had a great time staying in Seattle at Calen's place unfortunately we never got a chance to meet him but don't have a bad thing to say about the experience. This was our first airb&b experience and Calen was organized and made the process very easy for us.
59574	1790020	9.0	10.0	32042930	"Great, no fuss host. I tried to book at 9pm for same night stay and response within minutes, and clean sheets by 10pm on arrival. Great communicator for host, and super capitol hill location.

Would recommend for any guest."
59575	1790020	9.0	10.0	32210228	I from china and traveling in USA.calen is very nice people,I am no more English ,but Calen is very patience for (website hidden) is so close board way  .just 5miu by walk and here is very (website hidden) downtown just 13miu by bus.
59576	1790020	9.0	10.0	32404427	Calen was great!! Very easy going and accommodating. I was mainly just looking for any easy place to crash, leave my stuff, and take a shower. Worked great and he was far enough from the fun for quiet but not so far it wasn't walk-able to all the best Capitol Hill spots.
59577	1790020	9.0	10.0	33289748	"Calen was a very hospitable host. He was very professional  and experienced...he knows what he is doing. He was prompt in contacting me regarding the details of the booking sending pictures of the place and special instructions. He was generous in sharing tips on getting around the city, places to see and places to eat. I think he is pretty flexible in how much interaction you can get from him depending on how you prefer.

Location of his place was pretty convenient. Probably a 10 min walk to Pine/Pike St in Capitol hill which is a pretty happening place in Seattle. Pretty safe neighborhood. Lot’s of great food around the area without having to go all the way down to 1st Street. Definitely stumbling distance when you had too many Rainier Beers and Seattle dogs. And less than a 10 min walk to Volunteer park if you want to get some jogging done. 

The room was basic but sufficient. He has a nice Patio overlooking Seattle. Perfect for just hanging out with a cold brew. He has a nice comfy couch with a projector and a roku. Internet connection is decent and he even offers a guest computer. Just remember though that his place is on the 4th floor so you have 3 flights of stairs to go through if you have lots of luggage.

I would definitely stay with Calen again when I go back to Seattle.

59578	1790020	9.0	10.0	33718587	"Calen's apartment is a great spot to explore Seattle, very nice and lively neighborhood, we liked it a lot. 
Calen is a great host - easy to communicate with, gave us helpful tips for our visit, and keeps the apartment all clean & cosy! 
It was really fun staying there, thank you."
59579	1790020	9.0	10.0	33873327	I didn't get a chance to meet Calen in person, but he did an excellent job of getting everything arranged with me and was a fantastic host.  The room was clean and comfortable, and the location of his apartment (especially the view!).  Overall a great place to stay. 
59580	1790020	9.0	10.0	34028293	I had a great stay at Calen's apartment. The location is phenomenal...i was in walking distance from a great coffee shop, a yoga studio and great restaurants/bars. Calen was super accommodating-I arrived early and had a late flight out--and very nice/approachable. I highly recommend this stay!  
59581	1790020	9.0	10.0	34179799	Calen has a very nice place in Capital Hill and I enjoyed my stay. I had the place to myself for most of my trip and just briefly met Calen. 
59582	1790020	9.0	10.0	34567126	"My friend and I had a great stay at Calen's place!  We didn't get to meet Calen due to our hectic schedule (there is so much to explore in Seattle!) but he responded promptly to my reservation request and the questions I had along the way.  The location is great--it's close to tons of restaurants and the bus stop, so transportation was easy to figure out from there to other parts of the city.  I thoroughly enjoyed the view of downtown Seattle and the distant mountains from the balcony--it's absolutely gorgeous at sunset!  I would definitely recommend staying here if you're headed to the Emerald City for a trip!

"
59583	1790020	9.0	10.0	34879858	"We didn't get the chance to meet Calen until we were leaving but upon arrival, everything was clean and in order. His directions were very clear and easy to follow. Calen was also great at letting us know when other guests were checking-in to the second bedroom.
The neighborhood was great! There are tons of restaurants to eat at and places to explore. It was also nicely located between downtown Seattle (Pike's Market) and Seattle Center.   Overall, this was a really good Air BnB experience.   "
59584	1790020	9.0	10.0	35241840	"Calen was an absolutely amazing host! We had an amazing experience that was made easy for us from beginning to end.

Calen was even super understanding when we were late due to getting lost in public transit. I would recommend this Air BnB time and time again.

As my first time using Air BnB I can say that this has made me want to use it again."
59585	1790020	9.0	10.0	35487435	"Calen was great, as was the apartment.  Everything was as advertised, no surprises.  Bed was comfy and sheets were SOFT - must be a high thread count.  Also, the location is fantastic.  Just be careful of getting stuck on the wrong side of the 5 during rush hour - Seattle traffic is no joke!  

I would definitely stay at Calen's again."
59586	1790020	9.0	10.0	35663778	great place in a great area, exactly as advertised, easy check in and out...Calen was great and accommodating and easy to get in touch with, room and apartment was perfect for us...great deck.
59587	1790020	9.0	10.0	36150607	Great view. Loved the balcony. Clean, easy access. Worked out well! Thanks again. 
59588	1790020	9.0	10.0	36562724	Calen was a great host! The place was great and the location was awesome. Right in the center of everything you want to get to in Capitol Hill and not a far walk from downtown. I enjoyed getting to know Calen and the other guests too. I'll stay here again and again when I'm in Seattle!
59589	1790020	9.0	10.0	36751755	My stay was simple and seamless - exactly what I was looking for. I needed a quick comfortable place to crash for a relatively-last minute work trip, and the Calen's place delivered. His communication was flawless, entry was easy, the neighborhood is full of interesting places, and the bed was comfortable. I didn't get a chance to check out much of his house. It was hot and humid, but water and a well positioned fan helped keep discomfort low. A great stay all around.
59590	1790020	9.0	10.0	36870826	Calen was a nice guy and easy to coordinate with. The location was great. The common areas, especially the bathroom was in need of a good cleaning though.
59591	1790020	9.0	10.0	37094219	This place was great! Easy, flexible check-in, very comfortable, and awesome location. Will definitely check it out for future stays in Capitol Hill. 
59592	1790020	9.0	10.0	37372586	Great view of the Seattle skyline, especially at night.  Didn't actually meet Calen, but he gave us excellent thorough instructions on the apartment.
59593	1790020	9.0	10.0	37824660	Great place in a great location.  I had to book last minute and Calen was quick to respond and his directions were perfect and easy to follow.  The place was clean and comfy; I'd definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle! 
59594	1790020	9.0	10.0	39471467	Calen was extremely helpful finding parking and was very easy work with.  The place was nice, with an excellent location.  
59595	1790020	9.0	10.0	39556829	Apartment was in a great location.  It is nothing fancy but it gets the job done and as said the location was perfect.  Calen was very welcoming and made us feel like we were at our own home
59596	1790020	9.0	10.0	39650591	Calen was a great host! He was quick at responding to my questions and ensure that my friend and I felt welcome. The place was clean and well-organized. I am also very glad that the place is also close to everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle, making our stay that much more enjoyable. Thank you for having us, Calen!
59597	1790020	9.0	10.0	39798307	We were only here for one night. Place was fine. We had what we needed. Apartment wasn't super clean, but not too bad. 
59598	1790020	9.0	10.0	40405093	Yes, I felt welcomed.  Good communication despite hosts busy schedule. We connected several times with good results.
59599	1790020	9.0	10.0	41225912	 I came to Seattle with my sister for a little R & R. Our stay with at Calen's place was exactly what we wanted and needed.The apartment is smack dab right in the middle of great restaurants, bars, bookstores, cafes, etc., the balcony has a great view of downtown and the Space Needle, room and bathroom were clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. I would recommend staying here, most definitely. 
59600	1790020	9.0	10.0	41394171	Calen was incredibly responsive and accommodating.  Our flight got in 2 hours before our check in and Calen coordinated with the previous guests to see if we could check in earlier. The unit was as described, clean and functional. The only downside is that there was construction in the neighboring unit that was quite loud at times. The neighborhood is fantastic and fun to eat and go out in. I recommend this place.
59601	1790020	9.0	10.0	41466628	 Calen was an excellent Host.  The flat was everything that is advertised. Would Recommend this to everyone.
59602	1790020	9.0	10.0	41963383	While we did not get to meet Calen in person, my fiancé and I had a great stay at his place. Calen was really easy to get in touch with despite being out of town for the weekend and was very accommodating in arranging for a late check out since we had a late flight out of Seattle. His apartment is very conveniently located within walking distance to a lot of the attractions in the city and is close to great restaurants and bars. I'd definitely recommend Calen's apartment as an easy, convenient place to stay.
59603	1790020	9.0	10.0	42572706	Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this listing. While the host was very responsive in the beginning providing info and access to the property, he was completely unresponsive once issues arose that required resolution. MAIN ISSUE: the property was very dirty -- hair and grime in bathtub, toothpaste residue in sink, and enough dust everywhere to write in. We alerted the host, who came over to address this, but cleaning had been neglected for so long that it really required a professional deep cleaning. So even after host attempted to clean, it was still not OK. We left before our reservation expired and booked at a local hotel, which was very expensive on short notice in high season, but conditions at host's property were intolerable.
59604	1790020	9.0	10.0	43078770	The room was exactly as described in the listing; and location was great.  It was easy to get to and a great place for a weekend visit.  Thanks for the room!
59605	1790020	9.0	10.0	43468187	Calen was great. This was my first time on Airbnb. He was very helpful. The sign-in went flawlessly. A very clean, well equipped apartment. Nice view. I'd stay there again in a heart beat.
59606	1790020	9.0	10.0	43725239	"Smooth check in check out.
The shower is very good and the bed decent.
Nice location, walking distance to bars and restaurants. Also an enjoyable walk downtown.
I appreciate that Calen was able to place the sleeping bag that I forgot by accident at his place, in the outside for me to pick it up 2 days later.

"
59607	1790020	9.0	10.0	44621801	Our stay at Calen's was restful and casual. He sent us all of the info about the apartment in advance by email. That way, we were able to get the keys and leave our luggage even though he wasn't there. The bedroom was comfortable, and we were told to help ourselves to anything in the kitchen. Calen responded very quickly to our inquiries both beforehand and when we arrived at the apartment, which was extremely helpful for the stressful situation that brought us to Seattle. He was also very flexible about our check-in and check-out. We enjoyed the outdoor patio very much. There are comfy cushions and blankets everywhere. The location is also great for accessing Capitol Hill and bus routes. Thanks, Calen!
59608	1790020	9.0	10.0	45115116	Calen was a great host. He gave very clear directions and was also very welcoming. The description of the place was also accurate and looks just as it is in the pictures. The location of the place was also  conveniently located near many bus stops and stores. I highly recommend this airbnb! 
59609	1790020	9.0	10.0	45845172	"Calen got in touch with me in the days leading up to my stay and provided detailed instructions of how to get access to my room, which made things pretty simple. The apartment was clean and the room was as described. 

The neighborhood has a lot of great bars, restaurants and coffee shops, and has really great access to a public transit. I never felt unsafe walking around, even at night. I definitely made a smart choice by staying here."
59610	1790020	9.0	10.0	46291280	I had a great time staying at Calen's place. The location is actually pretty fantastic and his place is immaculate. Calen is a great host who made sure I was able to get into his place, and communicated with me consistently from check-in to check-out. awesome place, and GREAT wifi. :) 
59611	1790020	9.0	10.0	46988694	"I stayed at Calens for 5 nights, it's in a great location within walking distance to a ton of great places in the neighborhood.  It is on a pretty quiet street as well, I slept with the windows open and even on the weekends I didn't hear much traffic or people.  The balcony was also amazing, great view with a comfy place to sit and enjoy the evening air.

There were alot of thoughtful little things for guests like power strip near the bed, a desk, hangers and open closet space, lots of guides and maps, a shopping bag and grocery store card on the keys.  You can tell he takes pride in being a good host and put effort into making the place even more accommodating than a hotel."
59612	1790020	9.0	10.0	47677019	Calen was a congenial host.
59613	1790020	9.0	10.0	48633580	"I stay 5-6days. Here is best place.clean and walk to downtown 20min.
People is kind :)
There is big screen, so i enjoy watching movie.Thanks calen."
59614	1790020	9.0	10.0	48838910	Calen was easily available for questions. The neighborhood was perfect! His place was comfortable. My daughter and I went to Seattle to visit family and had a great time--no worries. 
59615	1790020	9.0	10.0	49189501	What a great place! I didn't get to meet Calen, but the room I had was comfy and the apartment was in a great location. Would recommend!
59616	1790020	9.0	10.0	49539726	Great calm spot in the middle of Capitol Hill! Though i never got to meet Calen,  he made sure everything went fine.  Clean, cosy bed, cool flat. Recommended 
59617	1790020	9.0	10.0	50153810	The apartment was fabulous. Without Calen present, we were able to check-in and check-out with ease. Calen was very helpful and we'd certainly stay there again!
59618	1790020	9.0	10.0	50339877	Great location, amiable host, easy check-in and checkout.
59619	1790020	9.0	10.0	50609597	It was very easy to work with Calen and the room is in a great location with easy walking access to everything around Capital Hill. 
59620	1790020	9.0	10.0	51206433	The location is perfect. The place and bathroom were very clean and welcoming. It was easy and comfortable, the way you hope for with an AirBnB. Thank you for a great stay. 
59621	1790020	9.0	10.0	51518302	First of all, staying at Calen's place was my first AirBnB experience and so thankful my plans fell through and I was able to stay at Calen's Capital Hill apartment. My original housing cancelled and I submitted to Calen and within twenty minutes I had a place to stay...for the very same night as I was pulled over at a rest stop in Portland on my way to Seattle. I had three interviews in two days and coincidentally Calen's spot was in the middle of all three so I was able to walk to all of them making the experience that much more enjoyable. I even lost (deleted) his e-mail laying out the finer points of entering the building and keybox information between walking from my car to the building and texted Calen. He responded within a few minutes with a call back. Extremely helpful! The place was tidy and quaint...a living, breathing apartment. Towels were left out and a couple bottles of water. I even pulled out the ironing board from a closet to iron my shirts. Great location...few blocks east and you're own 15th avenue with anything you might need. Walk down 12th and you're in the hustle and bustle of the downtown. Stay in and you've a nice little living room and fully functioning kitchen with a spectacular view of the skyline. Parking was a breeze. Again, I haven't had any other experience to compare it to, but I would highly recommend Calen Capital Hill spot...and would more than likely stay there again if I needed. 
59622	1790020	9.0	10.0	51865421	Calen was super attentive and everything was great, just what I was hoping for. Would definitely stay again.
59623	1790020	9.0	10.0	52064462	Capitol Hill was a lovely neighborhood; most things accessible by foot with adaptable transportation.
59624	1790020	9.0	10.0	52783461	Calen has set the bar high for my first Airbnb experience.  He was very friendly and very fun to talk to.  His house was well maintained and the location couldn't be beat.  I loved staying in and watching Netflix on his wall projector, and the views were gorgeous.  Plus Lucky was a real sweetheart and very cute. 
59625	1790020	9.0	10.0	53437710	I really enjoyed my stay at Calen's place in Capitol Hill. He was very accommodating and has a very nice dog. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here myself a second time.
59626	1790020	9.0	10.0	53738324	Host was so kind to take a very last minute request in the middle of the commute hours in the evening. He quickly went home and prepped my room for me. He was so gracious as to invite me to use his tv in the living room. Bed was comfy and for the price the accommodations were perfect! I would highly recommend Caleb as your host!
59627	1790020	9.0	10.0	53870762	Calen was wonderful, easy to coordinate with and really helpful and knowledgeable about the area. The place was clean and cozy -- we felt right at home!
59628	1790020	9.0	10.0	54187319	Calen's place was great! A perfect location to live like a local but with easy access to Seattle's best coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and parks. Calen may or may not be there but he's always available to answer any questions. 
59629	1790020	9.0	10.0	54364549	Calen was a blessing. When my flight got into Seattle at midnight (two hours late), I used the Instant Book feature and he helped me get adjusted—even way past check in time! Great place too, comfortable bed, and a great place to view Capitol Hill/dwtn Seattle on the balcony...I'll definitely stay here again :)
59630	1790020	9.0	10.0	54949437	Calen was extremely friendly and accessible. He was a great host! The location and view of the city was great. The walk to broadway was about ten minutes. Parking is always kind of an issue in Seattle but we managed to find a few spots pretty close by. Theres a lot to do in this area which is awesome. great deal for the price.
59631	1790020	9.0	10.0	55034565	Calens place is in an ideal location, has great views, and is very comfortable. Calen himself is a warm and welcoming host, clear communicator and available for anything that may arise. Single female travellers should be aware that Calen rents out both his rooms, so you might be sharing with someone who is not the host and whom you've never met. This was a surprise to me as I arrived home late one night to find a man I didn't know in the house. There are locks on the bedroom doors but only from the inside, so there is some element of trust needed if you choose to leave your things during the day (like a hostel). Everything was fine with my stay - most people are good people - and I had no incident. Just something to note. I walked everywhere and had a great time. Thanks! 
59632	1790020	9.0	10.0	55089226	Calen's place was easy to check into, very central location and at a good price. Calen was also accomodating and communicative, I Would come back. 
59633	1790020	9.0	10.0	55336238	The place was great. Spacious and convenient. 
59634	1790020	9.0	10.0	55506179	Calen was extremely helpful and responsive. His place was very clean and had an amazing view!
59635	1790020	9.0	10.0	57736229	Calen was very easy to work with, and his place was very accommodating and centrally located. I would stay here again.
59857	6835466	10.0	10.0	42017703	Great space - exactly as described. Whitney was helpful and accommodating - would recommend to anyone.
59858	6835466	10.0	10.0	46233112	Whitney was an awesome host! She is very friendly and very flexible. My overall experience was a good one.
60493	5067177	10.0	10.0	42940507	"The house felt just like your standard Ann Arbor building, so I felt right at home. Everything was clean, the instructions were clear, and everything went smoothly even though I never saw any of the hosts (which is fine). Having walked the town, now, I wouldn't mind the distance and staying at Crayola Home, their other property.

They are very kind in leaving food for guests in the fridge, including an Angry Orchard or two. It was just what I needed, late at night. Some instant Thai ramen was available that just about saved me after finally making it home from the bars at 3:00.

The neighborhood is a tiny San Francisco, which probably appeals more to some than to others.

I would happily stay here again, no matter the situation. Can't beat the price and the location."
60494	5067177	10.0	10.0	43551695	 this is a very cute room.  clean and nice organized. and leah is very hospitality. offering us guests a very clean kitchen and living room. there are also some food and drink. nice to share with others. the area is very good.  its very quite at night. i do had some nice sleep. and its two blocks from broadway, u can find good restaurants very easily. over all i like this place. do recommend!

60499	5067177	10.0	10.0	49007211	comfortable share house style accommodation in a beautiful leafy street. Leah was helpful and friendly, and even left Donuts for the guests!

Would thoroughly recommend staying here if you are looking for affordable accommodation.
60500	5067177	10.0	10.0	50681971	"Leah could not have been more accommodating and friendly during my stay. She and Michael have definitely done well jn keeping their pad sparkling fresh and clean. Seriously, this place is decked out with all kinds of amenities, even my own personal french press and some of the best coffee beans I've ever known. 
Also, you can't beat a 7 minute bike ride down the hill to get to downtown / S Lake union area!"

60502	5067177	10.0	10.0	54595694	I stayed four weeks, and while sharing space was a bit of an adjustment for me it was a good experience.  Leah was very helpful and welcoming, and the location was very convenient to a market, restaurants, shopping, etc.  
60503	5067177	10.0	10.0	55834269	Esta fue la primera vez que usé Airbnb y la verdad quedé muy contenta! La casa estaba muy bien ubicada, todo estaba muy limpio y gocé de mucha privacidad! El cuarto era muy pequeño pero más que suficiente para lo que necesitaba! La cama era súper confortable y el que junto con la llave hubiera una tarjeta del supermercado cercano me valió buenos descuentos cuando fui de compras! También fue muy agradable encontrar comida disponible en el refrigerador! 
60504	5067177	10.0	10.0	57349230	It was comfortable 
60505	5067177	10.0	10.0	57810244	The room and apartment were great. Clean, comfy and amazing. The apartment is very well situated and you can easily walk to downtown. I loved my stay there and I would recommend it 100%

60950	1039766	8.0	10.0	5802545	Lillian was able to accommodate my last minute booking for the same night and was very fast to respond to all messages. Her place was in a great location for visiting downtown and surrounding areas. Highly recommended!
60951	1039766	8.0	10.0	5848798	Lily was a great host; she was communicative and accommodating. She gave me complete privacy. The location of the apt could not be better, and with parking to boot!

60953	1039766	8.0	10.0	6561229	This was exactly what I was looking for—a clean bed in a great location at an affordable price. Lillian is very sweet and accommodating, as well. 
60954	1039766	8.0	10.0	6787494	"Lilian is a nice host who is nice and accommodating.  The apartment flooring is a bit older than what the photo shows due to natural wear and tear.  The room is a bit small and so is the window.  The living is room is nice and big and Lillian usually has no problem with the guest using that room.  The AC is only in the living room and is not powerful enough to cool the guest room which can get kind of hot in the hottest days of the Seattle summer.
The point of biggest complaint is the smell from the cat's litter box.  The litter box is in the washroom but the smell permeates into the hallway and makes the using of the washroom & kitchen (besides the washroom) a very unpleasant experience."
60955	1039766	8.0	10.0	6839976	Lily was great about communication and easy going about the whole thing. Thanks again!
60956	1039766	8.0	10.0	7068755	"I had a great stay with Lillian, although I wasn't around the house much as I was in Seattle for the PAX 2013 gaming convention.

Lillian was friendly from the moment I entered the door (as was her cat!), and any issues were quickly resolved with text messages (as I said, I wasn't at the house much).

The house was nice and clean, I had the use of the kitchen if I wanted it (although I actually ended up eating out for all of my meals - Seattle has a lot of great places to eat!), and the wifi was fine for catching up on my internets in the evenings.

20 minute walking distance from downtown Seattle (specifically the convention center) was fine for me, I'm from the UK and thus used to walking around cities. It's also a lovely place to wander.

I would definitely consider staying at Lillian's again if I happen to be travelling to Seattle in future!"
60957	1039766	8.0	10.0	7128558	"Lillian was a fantastic host.  She helped me find a restaurant late in the evening after I arrived.  I also enjoyed her cat that is very friendly.
I used her dryer to dry my clothes after I'd been walking in the Seattle rain."
60958	1039766	8.0	10.0	7284670	I had a such a great time here! Lillian is super friendly and willing to give you directions or recommendations. The apartment is in a great location, lots of good restaurants ect., and you can easily walk to downtown Seattle. The room had a big closet and was very clean and the kitchen and washer/dyer were a huge plus. Also, Mushi the cat is adorable and super friendly. I would definitely recommend staying with Lillian!

The house is in a great location on Capitol Hill which was my favourite part of Seattle, with lots of interesting places to drop into. 

Lily made the whole process really easy and helped me have a great visit. In fact she even put a load of my washing in the dryer for me on my last day which was lovely- thanks!!

60969	1039766	8.0	10.0	9337049	This apartment has a great location if you like urban, walkable neighborhoods. It's right in the middle of everything in Capitol Hill. The parking spot is a big plus too. The other thing I really enjoyed about the apartment is that I had a lot of privacy and space to myself, which was essentially what I was looking for. Thanks, Lillian.

60977	1039766	8.0	10.0	10380748	First time using AirBnB. Reservation & communication with host went very smooth. Received a very warm welcome on arrival. Room & facilities as described. Parking right in front of the door was very nice as I decided while I was there to rent a car. Interesting neighborhood - lots of cafes, bars and restaurants. Very accessible by public transport as well. Would stay again! :-)
60978	1039766	8.0	10.0	10487782	Very convenient location to down town and heart of cap hill.  I was a bit of a ghost (in late out early) but place met my needs readily.
60979	1039766	8.0	10.0	10524513	As my first airbnb experience, I made a last-minute reservation to stay at Lillian's for two nights in Feb 2014. She was the perfect hostess - responsive to enquiries, friendly but not intrusive, helpful and informative - and I had the run of her apartment including kitchen use and living room (which I really didn't have time to take advantage of). Room isn't huge but clean, warm, included wireless internet and was perfect for my short stay. All in all it was just what I expected/hoped for and the price was right. Her Capitol Hill location is perfect - great neighborhood and an easy fifteen-minute walk down to Central Seattle and the conference center which was the reason I was in town. I will certainly repeat next time I'm in Seattle.
60980	1039766	8.0	10.0	10655414	I was in town for a conference so I didn't spend much time at the house.  Lily was very communicative before and throughout my stay.  The accommodations were basic, but the place served my purpose well: safe place to crash, affordable, close to conference.  To anyone out there looking for a place to stay during a romp in Capitol Hill, this is an excellent location.  Thank you Lily!   
60981	1039766	8.0	10.0	10729911	"Lillian is very friendly and makes you feel right at home.  She also has some great suggestions for nearby breakfast areas!

The location is right in the heart of Capitol Hill with awesome restaurants nearby.  There is a bus service right to the downtown public markets at your fingertips.

Would recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore this area of Seattle.  Which in my opinion is one of the best!

Also, the location can't be beat -- in a very hip neighborhood and within easy walking distance (though I do like to walk, so my sense of ""easy"" might be warped) to downtown and the waterfront. "
60995	1039766	8.0	10.0	13566362	Our stay with Lillian was great! Her guest room is very clean. We were greeted with a friendly hello and some helpful tips about the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The location of the apartment is excellent, a close walk to many sites in Seattle. The bed is very comfy and she even provides complementary towels, a nice touch. As well, the kitchen is open to use which is very convenient. Thanks so much!
60996	1039766	8.0	10.0	13677143	"Lillian was very warm and welcoming! She made me feel very comfortable in her cozy apartment! The room is exactly as decribed and there is also a large closet (not shown in the photos) with hangers, which I used to hang some wrinkle-prone clothes :) The only minor issue I had was the comfort of the bed, especially since I have bad hips. I mentioned this to Lillian at the end of my stay and she, without hesitation, mentioned that she would have gladly switched beds with me for my comfort, which was very kind. After leaving, she replaced the mattress with a new memory foam one, which I can't wait to try if I am every in Seattle again in the near future! :)

Location, location, location! Lillian's apartment is located near the southern part of Capitol Hill - gorgeous area. I was meeting up with friends around downtown Seattle everyday, and was able to easily walk there in less than 40minutes - even to the Space Needle. I really appreciated the ease of access and gorgeous scenery along the way. 

(Rating is due to the bed, which has been replaced now anyways!)

Thanks Lillian!"

I was in a huge rush in and out - so didn't get to spend much time, and had to leave at 4:00am in the morning! So I left in a hurry at dark thirty! Didn't get to make the bed or wash my glass! Sorry Lillian!

61000	1039766	8.0	10.0	14657472	This was a short but very nice stay on Capitol Hill for me. Lillian is so nice and everything is perfect in the house, near the bus stop and downtown. Thanks again !

61003	1039766	8.0	10.0	15304248	"Lillian est une excellente hôte! Elle peut prendre le temps de répondre à vos questions sur la ville et elle est sympathique et très discrète. La chambre est d'une belle grandeur pour un voyageur seul et très propre. Son appartement est parfaitement bien situé dans le quartier Capitoll Hill, près des rues commerciales mais assez loin pour y être tranquille. J'ai vraiment apprécié y rester durant mon voyage de 10 jours à Seattle.

Lilian was an excellent host. She is open to answers questions about the city or chat with you if you want and she's very discreet too. The room is large and the appartement is kept very clean. Her apartment is perfectly located in the neighborhood Capitoll Hill, near commercial street but far enough to be quiet. I really enjoyed my stay there during my 10-days trip."
61004	1039766	8.0	10.0	16197721	"   The bedroom has enough room, a street front window with good ventilation and a fan, a good collection of brochures on the city, and a selection of books for evening reading.  The living room is spacious with a wide-screen television.  The kitchen and bathroom are adequate.  Security is very good.  The street is tree-lined, with jasmine in bloom while I was there.  The location is wonderful: a couple minutes from four different bus lines to various parts of the city, with two ending in the center of the Downtown after a bus ride of about ten minutes.  These lines also run west to Seattle Center with the Space Needle and other attractions, north past Volunteer Park with the Seattle Asian Arts Museum and its conservatory and to University of Washington campus, and south past the northern end of the International District-Chinatown.  A high-end supermarket is close, a four-minute walk; a cheaper Safeway is a couple of stops away on one of the bus lines.  Overall, a comfortable stay in a very fine location.

The room is as described, and I slept very well on the big bed. For warm nights there's a fan. I really enjoyed the time there. Lily is a great host, who gave me a bunch of tips and was always helpful. I regret I could not stay longer with her.
The location is perfect, you can't be in a better spot on capitol hill, walking distance to all the bars and restaurants.... I hope I can stay with her again when I come back!"
61006	1039766	8.0	10.0	18236116	"Honestly, I was disappointed. Lillian is a lovely person and I know that she truly tried to give me a good experience, but it was not at all what I was expecting. It is definitely a good value and a GREAT location, but the worst part (for me) was that the entire apartment smells really badly of cat/cat litter. I think the smell was probably the worst part for me to be honest. It also wasn't as clean as the picture makes it seem....just  heads up. 

For the price some of these things may be OK, and like I said Lillian is really very sweet. But just a heads up!"

61012	1039766	8.0	10.0	20497933	Lily's apartment was a great place to stay within a very short walk of Capitol Hill! I've mostly stayed in Airbnbs in Brooklyn previously, many of which were entire places that weren't lived in and basically felt like hotel rooms. This was obviously a bit of a different situation, as a spare room in a lived-in apartment, but that made it feel like a more authentic way to see what it would be like to live in Seattle. We only ran into Lily a couple times, but she was super nice and really communicative during our stay! Would definitely stay here again.

It's a very cool part of town with lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The room is simple and not big on luxury. Don't expect a hotel-like stay, but if you are planning on spending most of your time exploring the city it's perfect."

61028	1039766	8.0	10.0	23915351	I was very happy with my trip!  Lillian made sure that I had everything I needed for my stay, including stuff for the shower!  The room was comfortable and the apt. is very cute.  The location can absolutely not be beat!  Lillian was so considerate that when I asked if she had a small table lamp to read by, she went out and bought one!  I felt like a roommate instead of a guest, but I had tons of privacy.   Also, I never smelled the litter box!  The cat was adorable, and like my host, non-intrusive. Thanks, Lillian, for a great time!
61029	1039766	8.0	10.0	24311832	Lilly's was friendly and nice. Her place was great and an ideal location for great bites and nice cafes at Broadway. The room was clean and the bed warm and cosy. Would definitely go back if I ever visit Seattle again. Thank you Lily for your hospitality! 
61030	1039766	8.0	10.0	24793582	Lillian was an excellent host. The accommodations were clean and had all the necessities. Spacious closet and comfortable bed.

61031	1039766	8.0	10.0	24998954	My stay was part of last minute plans to visit seattle and Lillian was wonderful not only in her fast communication buy accommodating my same day reservation. Next time I'll be sure to give ample warning, but am grateful for her availability. Lillian is a great communicator and was only ever a text away whether at the house or not.
61032	1039766	8.0	10.0	25234292	This was my third stay with Lillian... I love the location and always have a comfortable week at her place.

The location of this place was great - right in the middle of an awesome neighborhood filled with fun bars, restaurants, shops, and a park. Also quite convenient to the touristy spots like Pike Place Market.

Thanks!"
61036	1039766	8.0	10.0	26758246	Lillian was a great host, everything was easy and as advertised. The location is excellent - very near Vivace! And yes, the cat is friendly and mellow.

61039	1039766	8.0	10.0	28385683	Lily was kind enough to stay up extra late to greet me and help me get settled when my travel plans were delayed. Very comfortable bed, great private room and awesome food/coffee recomendations. Central location to everything I needed and easy access to several different bus lines for travel all over the city. I highly recommend staying to anyone looking for an easy, convenient and comfortable place to stay in Seattle.
61040	1039766	8.0	10.0	28673904	Lilian welcomed me at her place and got me settled in. She was nice and we got to chat a little bit in-between me exploring the city. It is a great location with access to Capitol Hill and also easy access to downtown and the rest of the city via busses nearby.

61042	1039766	8.0	10.0	29239245	Lily's place was perfect for my stay in Seattle. It was just blocks from anything hot on Broadway and a short walk to the downtown/Pike/Pine corridor. Good exercise on those hills too! Clean house, cute cat, clean bed and linens, a convenient phone charger by the bed, and quiet location (even though its really close to the action). Highly recommended, I would stay there again in a heartbeat!
61043	1039766	8.0	10.0	29463408	Lilian's place was great, the area was lovely, the room was comfortable, the welcome was informative and warm. I would recommend it to anyone.

The house is located only a few blocks from the Convention Center area and is near several great restaurants. Everything is within walking distance which makes it very convenient.

There is also a market just three blocks away that is open very late and has a very large selection of great foods. 

The room is a very nice size and has a closet."
61045	1039766	8.0	10.0	29960111	Lillian is a great host! Definitely warm and welcoming. The neighborhood is great if you're searching for a true local experience. 
61046	1039766	8.0	10.0	30202732	Lily's home is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, surrounded by hip bars and good restaurants, and just a brief walk downhill to Downtown Seattle. She made my stay very pleasant with fresh towels and toiletry options. I definitely recommend her if you're looking for a comfy room close to hip nightlife. Oh, and her cat is adorable and very sweet.
61047	1039766	8.0	10.0	30463311	Very courteous and welcoming host. The room is in a great part of town with access to transit and bikeshare. 
61048	1039766	8.0	10.0	30779293	"Lily was accessible and communicated well.  Location was easy to find and she provided a parking space right in front of the residence. 
Although the space was small and the one bathroom shared it was available when I needed it.  Lily was respectful of my privacy while also friendly.
The apartment is an old building divided into 3 residences.  Her unit is up one flight of stairs.  The bed was comfortable and my room was superficially clean, though the whole unit is pretty run down and worn.  A friendly old cat lives here-those with allergies might want to know."
61049	1039766	8.0	10.0	31714251	I had another great stay with Lillian. Great place to stay when I want to be on Capitol Hill.

61052	1039766	8.0	10.0	32829991	Lillian was very welcoming and left me to myself after explaining the in's and out's of the place. She gave me some good recommendations for food and drink as well. The bedroom was well presented and there were clean towels and a washer and drier which was great.
61053	1039766	8.0	10.0	33035557	Lillian, her adorable cat and her place are all fantastic. Super centrally located, comfy bed and an awesome host. I would stay again and recommend to friends.

61057	1039766	8.0	10.0	35501688	It's a simple clean front room on the street-- some street noise, but not a lot considering how central the location, which is just a block off Broadway; super convenient, nice and accommodating host, super fat old cat.
61058	1039766	8.0	10.0	35788988	"Lillian was a great host. She made sure my late-night arrival was easy. She was very welcoming and answered all of my touristy questions.  

The apartment is in a great neighborhood... short walking distance to so much good food and coffee. Some of my favorites within walking distance - Glo's (amazing eggs benedict), Analog Coffee, Vivace Coffee, Cafe Solstice (cheap/yummy breakfast sandwiches) and Melrose Market (delicious wine + cheese counter). 

I even walked to the Space Needle one day! (It's about 1.5 miles - a good distance but worth it.) 

You are truly in the heart of Capitol Hill when you stay with Lillian. 

I can't wait to visit Seattle again!  "
61059	1039766	8.0	10.0	36206653	Lily is really nice and accommodating to your schedule. Great location within walking distance of downtown. However it could use a deep clean across the board.
61060	1039766	8.0	10.0	36589779	The place is exactly as pictured, and is clean and neat.  Lillian provided directions from the airport  to her place by public transportation, and was waiting to greet me when I arrived.  Her place is only one block from Broadway, which is the fun and lively heart of Capitol Hill.  There's a great used bookstore down the street.  It was only a 20 minute walk (downhill) into downtown and on the way you can meander past the Starbuck's Tasting Room and Serious Pie.  I'd be happy to stay here again.  
61061	1039766	8.0	10.0	36877847	Lillian made me feel very welcome and was most accommodating. The neighborhood is excellent with easy access to a bus that goes downtown and restaurants just steps away. There's a reading light and a fan in the room, and the bed is very comfortable. There's a closet for hanging clothes.
61062	1039766	8.0	10.0	37179353	"Lily was a great host who makes you feel like home from the first minute of your arrival. 

The listing is as described, room is basic and location could not be any better. The room gets some street noise and with the lack of an AC, it may get a bit uncomfortable if it is too hot out there. Fortunately that does not really happen that often in Seattle. "
61063	1039766	8.0	10.0	38132250	Lily welcomed me on a day of arrival and gave a tour of the house. She is attentive and helpful host. Room was exactly as described in listing, the location is great - close to park, restaurants and PRONTO station (bike-share). 
61064	1039766	8.0	10.0	39634377	The host was very nice and helpful who provided all the details about the house and neighbourhoods before you arrived. Cosy room and everything was exactly described in listing. It is definitely the place you wanna choose for your short vacation.
61065	1039766	8.0	10.0	40037519	Lillian was very nice and welcoming. She let me know quickly the details about the house and tips about getting around the neighborhood. Everything was accurate to the description in the listing. She was very accommodating and let me do my own thing. This is a nice, clean private room in a very good location in Seattle's capitol hill neighborhood.
61066	1039766	8.0	10.0	40239461	Great location and Lillian is friendly and helpful!
61067	1039766	8.0	10.0	40656209	"I felt very welcome upon arriving to Lillian's place. I usually woke up and turned in pretty early due to my work schedule while in the city. She is very helpful in getting you to her place and has loads of suggestions as to where to go. The room was comfortable and the mattress (memory foam!!!) was great to sleep in when paired with the clean sheets and cool Seattle air.

The neighborhood has a feel of a college town with older houses and plenty of bars and things to do everywhere. If you're going to primarily be walking or riding a bike beware of the hills.

Overall a great visit and very courteous and conscientious host. Would recommend for a stay."
61068	1039766	8.0	10.0	41086718	Lillian was very sweet and helpful thanks for letting us stay in your home 
61069	1039766	8.0	10.0	41927957	Lillian was a great host, she communicated with me from the start through the airbnb app and let me know of ways to get around the city. she greeted me and showed me around the house her home is a quaint little place. The room was great and very comfy. some street noise during the night but earplugs were provided so it wasn't an issue. the surrounding neighborhoods are lively with plenty of great places to eat at and shops around the area. She has a cat and with me having allergies it wasn't a problem at all. She made my first visit to Seattle wonderfull and go off without a hitch. Would recommend her and her home  to anyone thinking of taking a trip to Seattle. must try Americana brunch spot great breakfast meals.
61070	1039766	8.0	10.0	42252953	Lily was awesome! She was communicative, and really made the point to introduce herself and make me feel welcome. There is no AC, BUT even in one of the hottest months, I didn't mind it at all (this is also coming from a spoiled California boy). She really made the point to be super accommodating about my cat allergy, checking in and making sure I was comfortable. I also spilt a protein shake all over my pants, and she was very nice to allow me to use her washer and dryer. I would recommend this place to someone else, because it is in a convenience location, and Lily was great! Thank you!
61071	1039766	8.0	10.0	42528133	"Lillian was a wonderful host and her apartment is located just a 15-ish minute walk (downhill) to the city center; it is also located a block away from a few bus routes that will do the same. Just in case you want to take the bus, Lillian has a rotating transit card that can be reloaded.

The room looks just as it does in the pictures; quaint with a closet, phone charger, and fan - which was very appreciated in the summer! "
61072	1039766	8.0	10.0	42999713	Clean, quiet space for city adventuring. Adorable cat. Bed is slightly creaky with two people on it and so would recommend that sensitive sleeping couples (we're earplugs + face-mask people) be aware. Otherwise, super wonderful. 
61073	1039766	8.0	10.0	43300551	Lily was super friendly, and the room was very tidy. Excellent neighborhood too!
61074	1039766	8.0	10.0	43718391	The spot was clean and quiet and the cat was pretty cool. I didn't spend a lot of time at the apartment since I was wandering around Seattle most of time, which was very easy given the apartment's great location.
61075	1039766	8.0	10.0	44051794	Welcoming and friendly. Experienced host with all consideration taken care of
61076	1039766	8.0	10.0	44870935	comfy bed right in the heart of town. everything was great.
61077	1039766	8.0	10.0	45206131	Lillian was AWESOME, she's super down to Earth. Showed me where everything was, got me settled in and was an amazing host. Muushi was the best and sweetest cat too. I would definitely stay here again.  
61078	1039766	8.0	10.0	45644059	Great location and Lillian was very helpful!  Place is more rustic and in an older part of neighborhood. Good location to shops and bars. 
61079	1039766	8.0	10.0	46204244	Lilian is amazing. She made sure she disclosed everything about the house and the area. The house is pretty much centrally located so everything is either a walk or a bus ride away, which I loved. I wasn't home a lot since I was out exploring, but you definitely get what you pay for. Small quaint room, the bed was a bit squeaky, but other than that I loved it.
61080	1039766	8.0	10.0	46812906	Lily was a great host.  She was well organized and we communicated well many times before I arrived.  She welcomed me at the door and showed me around her place.  Smooth check in and check out.  She was very warm and friendly.  She was able to answer all my questions about the local area and guide me appropriately.  Her listing is as stated, a nice room in her home.  Her place was clean and tidy.  The Capitol Hill neighbourhood is a great central place to stay.  It was only a 15 minute walk to downtown, and a very nice one at that.  It was very safe walking around at any time of the day or night.  She lives right near a great grocery store.  It certainly was great value for the cost, as the local hotels start at $300 per night!  It was a great experience (my first one with airbnb) to have stayed in Lily's home - including using her kitchen for making breakfast.  Thank you for helping me learn about Uber and sharing your coupon with me Lily!!
61081	1039766	8.0	10.0	48519055	This was a prefect location --two blocks from a close friend's apartment-- and Lillian provided everything I needed. We didn't see much of each other, since I spent the time with my friend, but I loved her friendly cat!

61084	1039766	8.0	10.0	50115457	Lillian is a polite, gracious host and her location is perfect! I loved walking the neighborhood and into downtown. It is walkable to a great Thai restaurant, smoothie shop, thrift stores and acupuncture clinic, as well as to Volunteer Park & the Asian Art Museum. A large grocery store and used bookstore is also nearby. I was very pleased and satisfied with my stay at Lillian's.
61085	1039766	8.0	10.0	50599347	Lillian is a very nice girl,she always check me if I need help. Good location also. She has a cat. But if you mind the smell of the cat, you'd better think again before booking.
61086	1039766	8.0	10.0	51103000	Was great. She was super helpful 
61087	1039766	8.0	10.0	52451759	I had a great time staying in Seattle with Lillian. This location in Capitol Hill is super convenient to both UW main campus/ UW Medical Center, Harborview medical Center, and the Seattle Downtown area. It was perfect for me since I had to be in multiple locations for an interview and also wanted to visit Downtown/pike place market and whatnot while I was there. The room was as described with a comfortable bed and fast reliable internet. As an added bonus, Lillian has an Orca card available for guests to use, as well as a clothing steamer! I also appreciated that the house has good water pressure. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a convenient location while in Seattle. 
61088	1039766	8.0	10.0	52949665	Lillian was quite accommodating, bed was comfortable and everything was clean. Great location!
61089	1039766	8.0	10.0	53411566	Great location! Easy to access Capitol Hill and the rest of Seattle from Lillian's place. Lillian was very easy to communicate with and was there for check-in right when she said she would be.
61090	1039766	8.0	10.0	53582549	Lillian was very welcoming and accommodating. I was able to check in early and park my car just in time for my dance competition that morning. Comfy bed. I'm so grateful that she had a washer and dryer available! I am not the best packer and didn't pack enough clothes for the weekend so yay for laundry! Full kitchen and yummy French press coffee. Thank you for a great stay!
61091	1039766	8.0	10.0	54343383	Lillian was a very gracious and accommodating host and her cat Mooshi was very sweet!

61094	1039766	8.0	10.0	55492911	The stay at Lillians place was nice and the location is very convenient, pretty close to downtown and a minute from a bus stop away. Lillian was also very helpful with answering questions about things to do in the city.
61095	1039766	8.0	10.0	56935428	Lilly was great to stay with! Her place was super convenient to everything and she went out of her way to help me out! It made my move to Seattle so much better! Highly recommend.
61186	8150395	10.0	10.0	47238315	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
61187	8150395	10.0	10.0	52911586	"Sarah's apartment is the ideal place to stay for a weekend in Seattle.  Prime location near a strip of cute restaurants and a short walk to most of Capitol Hill.  The neighborhood is convenient and interesting to walk around.  Absolutely loved her style and the space. Very beautifully decorated, cozy, and clean!  

Side note: Sarah is a wonderful host!  I did not meet her in person, but she made me feel very welcome in her home.  "
61188	8150395	10.0	10.0	54260920	This amazingly cute tudor home was the perfect place for my weekend get-a-away. The place was extremely cozy, with all the amenities needed. Walking distance to many of Seattle's great restaurants and bars, this place offered everything!
61189	8150395	10.0	10.0	54533803	"This is one of the loveliest Airbnb apartments I've stayed in.  Seattle is a cool town, the location is awesome, and Sarah's communication is always punctual, helpful, and witty.  Checking in was a complete breeze and the home feels very funky and artistic.  It is exactly as it appears in pictures, probably having even more space than you realise.

I stayed alone and I was out a lot, but I think it would be a wonderful place for a romantic escape for a couple.  Many interesting books, comfortable bed and furniture, close to useful shops and amenities.  A really warm and inviting atmosphere!  There are only three things to point out - there are stairs up to the first floor, no lift; there is no TV; and it is no near the downtown area, it is in the hip Capitol Hill area.

Definitely stay here!"
61190	8150395	10.0	10.0	55423528	This was a lovely, very comfortable apartment. We had a wonderful time. It was clean, close to amenities and easy to get to. Would definitely recommend to anyone going to Seattle!
61191	8150395	10.0	10.0	56735325	Beautiful apartment and great location. Easy street parking in front of the building. Sarah was kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine, which was great after a stressful trip. Highly recommend this location. 
63341	2386589	9.0	10.0	10694341	Kabir and his house are amazing as everyone else here says. The apartment is in a great location close to everything and quiet. There is also a great view of the space needle from the living room. I woudl highly recommend this house and its host to anyone that is wanting to check out Seattle. 
63342	2386589	9.0	10.0	10867349	Had a great time staying at Kabir's place in Capital Hill. The apartment is very clean and comfortable, and he was very easy to work with on checking in late in the day. Capital Hill can be a very busy, party going place from what we saw on other streets on friday and saturday nights, but Kabir's place was exceptionally quiet! There are plenty of great restaurants, bars and coffee shops within a short walk. I would suggest to anybody.
63343	2386589	9.0	10.0	10990473	We absolutely loved our stay at Kabir's place!  We loved the location as it was so close to many nearby restaurants and bars.  Also, it is only 1.6 miles from the space needle and about a mile from downtown/the market.  We literally walked everywhere our whole trip.  Kabir's place was also very clean and well kept.  He has travel magazines and breakfast for the morning!  Overall, a great space!  We would definitely stay there again in the future.  Thanks so much Kabir!
63344	2386589	9.0	10.0	12314962	"Kabir's apartment was terrific!  Great spot to hang my hat for a quick trip into Seattle.  Great location and comfortable.

Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. "
63345	2386589	9.0	10.0	12443446	The place is neat and cozy, near bars coffee shops and restaurants and a close walk to downtown. Kabir is very logistically competent, and every little detail is taken care of before you step foot inside. Stay here!
63346	2386589	9.0	10.0	12629888	Kabir's place was great, really close to a lot of bars, shops. and a great breakfast spot!! It's about a 1-1 1/2 miles to pike's place, 1 mile to space needle, and 2-3 miles from kerry park, so that was nice! The place was overall pretty clean and similar to the pics which was nice to see. I would recommend staying at Kabir's if you're visiting seattle for a couple of days and need a place to stay!
63347	2386589	9.0	10.0	13426630	Kabir's apartment was awesome. Functional, near everything, close to a cool neighbourhood. It was a good sized apartment. And fit 3 people comfortably. I didn't get to meet Kabir but he seemed like a good guy. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Kabir!
63348	2386589	9.0	10.0	14982204	I've found that there are two main types of airbnb's: those that feel like impeccably curated spaces that rival the nicest hotel suites, and those that feel like you're crashing with a friend for the weekend who just stepped out. Kabir's space is the latter type. There's nothing wrong with that- the location is great and it was easy to contact Kabir to get the keys and find our way around. The park is a block away and all of Capitol Hill's bars and restaurants are a short walk.
63349	2386589	9.0	10.0	15335452	Kabir's place was in a fantastic location! We could walk to countless restaurants and shops! The space needle and waterfront was a tad of a longer walk but totally do-able. Kabir was a gracious host and very responsive in all his communication regarding our stay and logistics for getting the keys etc. I would definitely recommend Kabir's place to anyone visiting Seattle and wanting to be in a hip and trendy neighborhood. The only drawback is he parking in the neighborhood is pretty tough, but if you don't have a car it's perfect! (There is a public lot nearby to park but it has weird hours so we needed to move our car a few times). 
63350	2386589	9.0	10.0	16096479	Kabir was a great host. He wanted to get to know us a little and even met us to give us his keys. His tv remote had broken a few days before  and he had ordered a new one. He checked in with us to make sure that it was working properly. We stayed in 3 different airbnb places during our trip, but we felt most at home at Kabir's! He even left us some chips, salsa, and beer! The neighborhood was really cool. Analog coffee and Annapurna (Nepalese food) were so close. There are also some great bars within walking distance. 
63351	2386589	9.0	10.0	16312297	"Kabir was a very welcoming host.  He even left a bowl of assorted beverages as well as local maps and magazines to help us orient ourselves in Seattle. 

The description and pictures were 100% accurate. 

Kabir was an excellent communicator before, during and after our stay. 
"
63352	2386589	9.0	10.0	16729506	Kabir was a great host, very communicative. He provided an extra air mattress and sheets and had a stack of things to do around Capitol Hill, Seattle, etc. I will stay here again. 
63353	2386589	9.0	10.0	16920758	Great place, great location, and a great host!
63354	2386589	9.0	10.0	18907043	"Kabir is a terrific host.  Extremely accessible and communicative before and during our trip.  And there were snacks waiting for us upon arrival.

The apartment is exactly as shown and had everything we needed.  A pleasant surprise was the awesome view of the Space Needle!

We attended PAX Prime at the Convention Center and the walk was easy both ways.  I was worried about walking back up the hill, but it was a breeze.

Overall, Great Experience!"
63355	2386589	9.0	10.0	21627049	"Kabir's apartment is perfectly situated for a visit to Seattle. We walked everywhere we needed to go in the Capitol Hill area and Downtown. 

Although we didn't meet Kabir, as he was out of town, his directions for picking up keys and finding the apartment was easy to follow. It was well appointed and had everything we needed. A car isn't really needed if you stay at Kabir's, at least not for us. Thank you and we hope to visit Seattle again soon!"
63356	2386589	9.0	10.0	24004796	Such a great location!!! Kabir was very organized and helpful in making my first Airbnb experience a great one. The apartment was very charming (I loved the brick walls!). Although most of my visit in Seattle was spent out and about, I greatly appreciated how amazingly quiet the apartment was. Wonderful experience overall! Merci Kabir  =)
63357	2386589	9.0	10.0	24092915	Excellent location and comfy apartment with all the amenities. Loved the used bookstore right next door. 
63358	2386589	9.0	10.0	24379388	Capitol Hillニとても近く、Downtownへのアクセスもバスで15分程度と、便利な立地でした。室内は靴を脱いでいるようにしているせいか、部屋も十分清潔で、キッチン周りもひと通り揃っているのでほとんど不自由はありません。すこしベッドの部屋が12月ということもあり少し寒かったですが、掛け布団が薄いながら十分保温力があり、寝る際にはほぼ気にはなりませんでした。シャワーのお湯の調整は難しかったです。急に熱くなったり冷たくなったり…。こればかりは仕方ないのかもしれませんが。とはいえ、ホテルに住むよりも圧倒的に安い料金で快適に過ごすことができたのでよかったです。家主さんとはメールでのやりとりが素早く行えたので安心でした。
63359	2386589	9.0	10.0	24480517	The place was very cozy in an amazing location! It was very easy to go to the Capitol Hill bars from this address, and there is plenty of food nearby too. The apartment itself is clean and friendly, we had a great stay.
63360	2386589	9.0	10.0	25331022	My friends and I planned a short girls trip to Seattle and was very lucky to have come across this place! Kabir was extremely helpful and worked with me on times which made things a lot easier for us getting in and out of the place. His place was exactly like it was described and we would love to visit again. This place was at a fabulous location. Very close to great food places, coffee places, and bars. In addition, it was a hot spot for Uber!! We came at a pretty cold time of year, and the place was pretty cold, however, Kabir did provide lots of blankets and we got over it! We are from Texas... so 40 degrees was not ideal for us =p Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely come back again! Thank you Kabir for the great advice and providing such a great home for us. It was great meeting you and if you ever need a place in LA, Austin, Houston, or Corpus Christi please let us know :-)
63361	2386589	9.0	10.0	25819186	Kabir was a great host! I didn't get to meet him because he was out of town, but he was great with communication and very accommodating with getting us the key and checking in and checking out. Along with some brochures for the city, he even left us a cute welcome basket telling us to enjoy our stay! His apartment was in a great location too! A close enough walk to some pretty great bars and restaurants but on a pretty quiet street. Overall, my friends and I loved his place!! I would definitely recommend staying here! 
63362	2386589	9.0	10.0	26091375	Our stay at Kabir's place couldn't have gone more smoothly. He was very helpful and readily available via email to answer any questions. Great location and a very cozy apartment!
63363	2386589	9.0	10.0	27109782	Kabir's place was lovely. The location was great, very close to shops and restaurants we could walk to. The bedroom is on an inner wall so it was nice and quiet in comparison. He left us with a nice welcome bottle of wine and maps and guidebooks for our first trip to Seattle. Check-in was a breeze and communication was prompt via e-mail and text.
63364	2386589	9.0	10.0	27353467	Kabir was very attentive and communicative from the start. He got in touch right away to coordinate logistics and answer any questions, and stayed available throughout our stay. The apartment itself was in a prime location, with lots of light and an impressive view of Seattle and the space needle. We had room to spread out and relax. The building was quiet and removed, so it was easy to sleep there. The kitchen was pretty well stocked, except no kettle and no way to make coffee. Overall, we had a great stay and would stay at Kabir's again in the future. 
63365	2386589	9.0	10.0	27483896	Kabir's apartment is located in the heart of Capitol Hill, convenient to great restaurants and bars. It was a perfect match for us (rural Alaskans on a short vacation in the city). The place itself is warm and functional, with a surprisingly large living space. We enjoyed soaking up the afternoon sun and listening to music on the couch. The bedroom's got exposed brick and a cozy bed, but we were missing a top sheet and overheated a little. Worth bringing your own. The towels and other linens that Kabir provided were excellent. We never saw him during our stay, but his instructions on accessing the apartment - and little signs posted throughout the place - were perfectly clear. Kabir was easy to reach on messenger and overall, a fantastic host. 
63366	2386589	9.0	10.0	27664924	Kabir's apartment was perfect! Great location and he was incredibly helpful during the whole process. I highly recommend a stay here. Thanks, Kabir! 
63367	2386589	9.0	10.0	27963605	Kabir was a great host! Very attentive and communicative. The place was lovely!
63368	2386589	9.0	10.0	28589315	Great host, nice apartment, fantastic location! Check in was a breeze and we had everything we needed for a great stay in Seattle! Thanks again Kabir! 
63369	2386589	9.0	10.0	28669765	Kabir was an excellent host! It was easy to communicate with him during our stay. He left us snacks and drinks which was appreciated after a long road trip. His apartment is walking distance from coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed the stay. Highly recommend his apartment!  
63370	2386589	9.0	10.0	29053645	Kabir was a wonderful host! He left us a nice note with snacks and wine upon our arrival, and everything about this stay was perfect. Kabir's place was within walking distance to everything, checking in/out was a breeze, and he was so quick to communicate and share any info that we needed. Looking forward to renting with him again for future Seattle visits!
63371	2386589	9.0	10.0	29342558	Kabir was a great host! Great communication and detailed instructions. The place was neat and tidy, in a great location. 
63372	2386589	9.0	10.0	29925503	Kabir made us feel very welcome and checked in with us to make sure that we had everything we needed. The apartment was comfortable and clean and the location was right in the middle of where we wanted to be.
63373	2386589	9.0	10.0	33375816	We had a great stay in Kabir's apartment! It was perfectly located in a fun neighborhood with a quick and easy walk to downtown. He was incredibly accommodating and welcoming, and if I ever go back to Seattle I would love to stay here again. Thanks Kabir! 
63374	2386589	9.0	10.0	33825326	Kabir was a great host. Upon reservation, his response was very timely and friendly. He did not make me second guess my decision at all. Kabir left great checking in/out instructions and spot on about his complex/neighborhood. I flew into Seattle about 11pm and arrived at his home near midnight and he was out of town so we were unable to meet. Despite this, he provided me instructions that were very thorough. His home was a great place to stay and was in the heart of Capitol Hill - only walking distances from every major tourist hot spot. I highly recommend doing business with Kabir as he has done a great job being a host.
63375	2386589	9.0	10.0	34499175	Kabir was very hospitable and friendly.  He responded very quickly to any questions that we had, and made us feel very welcome.  It was a very good first impression of Airbnb.
63376	2386589	9.0	10.0	35295043	Great, cozy apartment. Perfect for a shot or long stay in Seattle. Amazing walkability in the neighborhood, especially for first timers to the city. Would gladly stay again next time I am in Seattle. Kabir was super flexible to our arrival time and accessibility to him and to the apartment was easy. And just as a general rule or principle, any apartment adjoining a used bookstore is worth a visit.
63377	2386589	9.0	10.0	35660613	A great apartment in a great location. We were able to walk to everything and have a comfortable space to return to after a long day. Kabir was extremely helpful and accommodating. 
63378	2386589	9.0	10.0	35819242	Kabir's place was great! As described, in a solid location in easy walking distance to everything you need, and comfortable. The bed was comfy and the shower had good water pressure (I like these things!). Kabir couldn't have been more welcoming or responsive to messages. He was out of town so we didn't get to meet him, but his instructions were clear and getting in and out was a piece of cake. Would definitely recommend renting from him!
63379	2386589	9.0	10.0	37357846	My boyfriend and I greatly enjoyed our stay at Kabir's for the 4th. The apartment was in a great neighborhood & in reasonable walking distance from all the main sights in Seattle.  Key pick-up and communication was a breeze, and the apartment has a charming character.
63380	2386589	9.0	10.0	39979955	Great place!! Walking distance to pike place and to a lot of great restaurants and bars. Kabir also communicated well and made sure everything was good with us! If I'm back in Seattle I will definitely try to airbnb here again!
63381	2386589	9.0	10.0	45952298	Kabir's place was great for me and my girlfriend for a long weekend in Seattle. Neighborhood was great and a nice walk into downtown. Kabir's apartment is nice, clean, and had everything we needed for a great trip. We would definitely consider staying here again! 
63382	2386589	9.0	10.0	50481649	Really nice flat in an awesome location.  Kabir is an excellent host - great communicator and extremely accommodating.  I'd definitely stay here again - highly recommended!  
63383	2386589	9.0	10.0	54898467	Great apartment in a great location. View of the space needle from the window. Quick replies and no issues whatsoever. Highly recommended.
63384	2386589	9.0	10.0	55215941	Kabir's apartment is very comfortable. It was a great place to kick back  between our visits to family and friends, and it is in a good location for exploring Capital Hill.
63385	2386589	9.0	10.0	56005907	Kabir's place was perfect. It was clean and very comfortable. Great neighbourhood!!! Would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the hospitality Kabir! 
63386	2386589	9.0	10.0	57810426	Kabir's place was warm, welcoming, and everything we could need for the three of us. The location can't be beat - near all of the bars, groceries, and restaurants. And there's even a view of the Space Needle! Worked perfectly for us. Bonus: parking is free on Sundays on the street. 
66057	7870538	10.0	10.0	47080640	Awesome apartment , great location and this placed served us well for our first trip to Seattle. Thanks again.
66058	7870538	10.0	10.0	48744362	We had a great experience! Valerie was a great resource - super responsive to questions and provided a lot of helpful information. The place was fantastic and it a great location!
66059	7870538	10.0	10.0	51164768	Absolutely loved the place! It was very modern, and was large enough to host our group of friends for the weekend. The rooftop deck is beautiful and the view of Seattle was great! We'll definitely be contacting Valerie again if we need a place to host in Seattle.
66060	7870538	10.0	10.0	55868299	The townhouse is so beautiful! The studio was my favorite room! Valerie is great with communication and gave me all the necessary information and resources I needed for the stay. She also left out little guides about Seattle for places to go and other suggestions. She's a great host!
66061	7870538	10.0	10.0	56951018	Valerie was awesome and so was her beautiful townhouse. It was very clean and modern, my party and I were very impressed. I would highly recommend staying here. The townhouse was in a great location with many restaurants,shops, and nightlife near by. 
67854	6276224	10.0	10.0	46289130	We had a lovely time here! The listing was even better in person-very roomy and comfortable. The apartment is tucked away in a beautiful brick building, very serene, and yet is less than a 3 min walk from the Seattle Center! Ashley is a great host and left us with all the pertinent information (wifi, laundry, key exchange, etc) as well as plenty of suggestions for local places to check out! I loved my stay in Seattle, and I would highly recommend staying at Ashley's place. 
67855	6276224	10.0	10.0	47074191	Ashely was an incredible host.  She was always available for questions and very quick to respond to messages.  The house was as-advertised and worked perfect for our trip.  We spent most of our days eating and walking downtown.  The neighborhood was great and within walking distance to the Space Needle.  Getting downtown was easy.  We walked (although a little long, but a good workout) and took public transportation.  We also used Lyft to get around, which cost approximately $6 to get downtown.  We had a great time and highly recommend Ashley's place for your stay downtown!
67856	6276224	10.0	10.0	48770855	The apartment was perfect for us and it was nicely cleaned and tidied before our arrival.  The Wi-Fi (always a concern!) was clearly posted as were direction to the grocery.  We also appreciated that Ashley had provided a stock of coffee after our long trip from the East!

69009	170273	10.0	10.0	417710	Nadine and Mark were great hosts! It was our first Airbnb experience and we couldn't have asked for better, more accommodating people (three words: homemade banana bread!). The house is fabulous, a true piece of Seattle history in a great location. If you have the opportunity to stay here when you're in Seattle, you won't regret it and will be staying in the best place possible. Many thanks again to Nadine and Mark!
69010	170273	10.0	10.0	442185	I had a great time staying with Nadine and Mark.  They were super welcoming and even invited me to run in the morning.  Their house was gorgeous in a nice neighbourhood--a really unique spot.  It's close enough to downtown and many tourist-friendly areas that you can walk easily.  Very comfortable bed and room, I wish I had taken advantage of the Jacuzzi bathtub.
69011	170273	10.0	10.0	447837	This was my first time using airbnb, and it was great!!!  The home is in a wonderful location with lots of nearby restaurants and a great park (Kerry Park) to watch the sunset.  We were very very satisfied with the experience, I would not hesitate to stay here again.  Thanks so much for making us feel at home.
69012	170273	10.0	10.0	465871	WOW! My friend and I were not prepared for this lovely experience! Nadine and Mark were so delightful, helpful, and fun to get to know. The house/room is the best that I have stayed with Air Bnb. It is an old victorian style bed and breakfast complete with a backyard to lounge about with a view of the space needle! The best part about the experience is truly the bed . It is amazingly comfortable with really nice sheets :)  You will rest well and wake up to the smell of lovely seattle coffee, pastries, and smiling knowledgable hosts. What are you waiting for? Book it now! 
69013	170273	10.0	10.0	484200	Great place. Great location. Great people. Definitely stay here!
69014	170273	10.0	10.0	511013	Great location, view and atmosphere. Nadine, Mark and their son were all great hosts. Very nice, made banana bread each morning and had coffee ready to go as well. Very knowledgeable about the fun things to do in the neighborhood and around Seattle. The room was nice, quiet and comfortable and we had our own private bathroom with a Jaccuzi. Made our trip down to Seattle spectacular, I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
69015	170273	10.0	10.0	528701	We had a beautiful room with a bathroom to ourselves. The neighborhood is lovely and close to Seattle Center. It's a short cab or bus ride downtown.  Nadine and Mark are great hosts!

We would recommend this place to everybody!

69017	170273	10.0	10.0	574480	We stayed at this beautiful home while moving our daughter into college.  The pictures you see in Airbnb are exactly what you will find at this pristine home and the bed is very comfortable!!  The location couldn't be any better as it is within walking distance to great restaurants and all major Seattle attractions.  Mark and Nadine were excellent hosts and made us feel welcomed in their home, but what we appreciated the most was their understanding and willigness to accommodate our needs while transitioning our daughter into her college life!  We highly recommend you stay here while in Seattle!!
69018	170273	10.0	10.0	610059	Nadine and her family are amazingly kind and lovely people. They made us feel right at home and Nadine even picked us up from the bus stop when our bus was running late. They left coffee and treats for us each morning and made us feel very at home. The house (and guest room) are gorgeous, impeccably clean, and welcoming. I slept like a dream (and I'm a very light sleeper). Location was good -- we were able to walk downtown and the bus is convenient if you want to venture to other areas. Highly recommend to others! 
69019	170273	10.0	10.0	662348	Charmingly well-appointed house, convenient and lovely Queen Anne location. Hosts are welcoming and helpful with any questions you might have about Seattle area. They gave us great restaurant suggestions!A very quiet and comfortable stay.
69020	170273	10.0	10.0	689958	Nadine and Mark were perfect hosts.  We were never in each others' way and they made us feel right at home.  I actually wish we would have taken time out to plan dinner or drinks with them.  I spent one afternoon with a book, glass of wine, and the Jacuzzi tub.  It was magnificent. Queen Anne's is a great area with plenty to do, too.  Thanks so much Hucks!
69021	170273	10.0	10.0	699607	Nadine and her family were accommodating and generous with there time. The house was absolutely lovely and had great details inside and out.

Beautiful, classy house, location is great, neighborhood too (Best view of Seattle is just short walk up the hill.) plenty of excellent restaurants within few min (make sure you don't miss breakfast at Shanty!) Free parking is a plus. I can absolutely recommmend this place, and will return here when back in Seattle.

69024	170273	10.0	10.0	738109	We have had an incredible time at Nadine and Mark's house. The house itself is a legend, it's over 100 years old and looks and feels like a castle from a fairy tale :) The room is beautifully decorared, suer clean and bright, the bed is ridiculously comfortable and even the sheets - were so nice and soft :) Nadine and Mark are amazing and very very friendly and easy-going, the sweetest hosts you can wish for. The house is located very close to ALL the awesome restaurants and bars. We enjpyed muffins and coffee in the mornings as well - thanks Nadine. Overall, this was a 6 star experience, even better than the 5 star! I can't stop talking about our weekend  :) Thanks!!
69025	170273	10.0	10.0	762236	Nadine and Mark were very friendly and helpful hosts.

69026	170273	10.0	10.0	780129	"Mark and Nadine were perfect hosts.  The house was in a great location for us since we walked to most of the destinations on our list.  When needed many different bus lines pass near the house.  The rooms were very comfortable and exactly as advertised. 

We would hope to stay with Nadine and Mark again if we get back to Seattle."
69027	170273	10.0	10.0	887670	Nadine and Mark are excellent hosts. Their home is beautiful and very comfortable. The location is great, Nadine's banana bread is wonderful, and they are so helpful and pleasant. I could just go on and on. We (3 of us) were in town on business. For the accommodations, in a location like this, it is such a great experience and value. We highly recommend it.
69028	170273	10.0	10.0	939837	"The house is wonderful, beautiful decorated. The room is exactly like the pictures.Above all, I loved the bed! Really confortable. ;)
Nadine et Mark are so kind, very friendly. I couldn't taste the famous(?) banana bread of Nadine, but I got the breakfast in ""Toulouse Petit"" which is near the house and the famous restaurant in Seattle! Anyway, thanks, Nadine and Mark!"
69029	170273	10.0	10.0	979347	"Nadine and Mark were great hosts. The house is absolutely beautiful - just like the pictures. After reading the reviews I was excited to try out the banana bread and the bed - both of which didn't disappoint.
Nadine and Mark were incredibly helpful with suggestions of places to eat or go for a drink - also, they were so hospitable and able to provide an early check in and late check out.
I would definitely stay there again."
69030	170273	10.0	10.0	1013079	Extraordinary hosts!!! Beautiful house with beatiful room, superb bathroom, and a view of the water. Nadine's morning treats helped start the day off just right.

69031	170273	10.0	10.0	1033184	Lovely home in a great location - walking distance to the shops and restaurants on Queen Anne, and an easy bus ride to downtown.  Free parking on the street within half a block.  Head up the street to spectacular views over the city.  Nadine and Mark (and Stanley the dog) are extremely quiet and welcoming hosts.  Guests are invited to help themselves to a glass of wine or a beer from the fridge - a nice touch!  Highly recommended.
69032	170273	10.0	10.0	1043173	What a great way to be introduced to the Airbnb experience. Nadine and Mark were wonderful hosts and the house is in a great location to explore the Queen Anne area and downtown. I won't bother with a rental car next time. The bed is wonderful, but my daughter would contest the Jacuzzi tub is the ticket. I did take them up on their offer of wine and discovered some nice local wines from the region. I would definitely recommend a stay here. Tremendous value for a beautiful room and your own private bath.
69033	170273	10.0	10.0	1063994	All good. Comfortable, clean, accommodating, welcoming, convienent
69034	170273	10.0	10.0	1134910	A very easy house to visit.  We were in Seattle for the ballet, which was a short walk down to Seattle Center.  Close also are good breakfast and late night dining places.   We felt very welcomed but not hovered over.
69035	170273	10.0	10.0	1156938	Nadine and Mark have a very beautiful home that is comfortable to stay in and in a great location to boot.  The bedroom was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was up to hotel standards.  Mark was an excellent host and very hospitable, providing coffee and pastries for us each morning.  Free parking was relatively easy and I would definitely recommend this location to a friend.   
69036	170273	10.0	10.0	1170006	A wonderful weekend in Seattle and this beautiful home is in such a good location that we parked our car when we arrived and didn't move it until it was time to head home! Our accomodations were wonderful .... We're already trying to figure out when we can get back!
69037	170273	10.0	10.0	1187564	"Nadine and Mark were very friendly and helpful hosts. I really felt welcome since the very beginning of my stay. I enjoyed chatting with them and I am still thankful for all their recommendations and insider's tips! Best of all: They have a great 'soccer taste' and and an 'invisble' dog named Stanley. :-)
The historic house is beautiful, comfortable, very clean and located in a calm neighborhood. I did not need my car at all during the stay: The city center is not too far away so I enjoyed walking there. A scenic view over the whole city, the space needle, bars and restauraunts are just around the corner. 
This was my first Airbnb experience. I will definitely do this again and I can heavily recommend staying with Nadine and Mark!"
69038	170273	10.0	10.0	1209555	Wonderful folks. Would recommend to anyone, anytime. Couldn't have been happier!
69039	170273	10.0	10.0	1304984	I loved staying at Nadine's place! It felt like home, yet I got my privacy. It is an beautiful house with an amazing and interesting history. It's a great area as well, everything was nearby: transit, convenience stores, restaurants, Seattle center, the King Tut exhibit ;) without the craziness of downtown. I absolutely fell in love with it! and was completely comfortable!
69040	170273	10.0	10.0	1328592	"We had a wonderful weekend at Nadine and Marks House. From the very first moment we entered he house we felt comfortable. The interior is decorated with a lot of taste. After my 20 hour flight my back hurt and I was so glad that I could ease the tension in the Jacuzzi Tub before falling into a deep sleep in the comfortable bed. We were greeted with delicious Banana Bread and Coffee in the morning. 
Nadine is a conscientious host and our communication before my arrival could not have been better. She and Mark are warm and genial hosts.
And the location is great. We had a car and did not use it once. 
This is definitely the place you want to be when visiting Seattle! Just wonderful.

69041	170273	10.0	10.0	1369738	My sweetheart and I stayed for the 3 nights of the Memorial Day weekend; we were in town for the Folklife Festival at the Seattle Center.  It was an easy walk to and from the Center, as Nadine had assured me, and we were so very comfortable with Nadine and Mark's beautiful home as our base.  The neighborhood is quiet.  The home is beautifully furnished.  The guest bathroom is luxurious, with heated towels and jetted tub.  And as others before me have exclaimed, the guest room bed is wonderfully comfortable!  We would happily stay here again.
69042	170273	10.0	10.0	1388908	Our stay with Nadine and Mark could not have been more perfect. Nadine was out of town during our stay but Mark was a wonderful host.  Nadine has quite the eye and I loved the decor throughout the house. The house is located on the outskirt of city center. It is the perfect location to still have that city feel yet far enough away from the crowds at Pike Place. I just wish we had some more time in Seattle to spend some time with our host. They seem like great people, I guess we will just have to make a trip back. It is a beautiful house and just the place for any responsible travelers to stay.
69043	170273	10.0	10.0	1410429	"Nadine & Mark were wonderful hosts, and I'm glad I got a chance to stay a few nights in their beautiful home. It's centrally located in Seattle, so everything is a pleasant walk (or a short cab/bus ride) away. They left breakfast for us every morning, and the bedroom/bathroom were great as well. Mark even gave us a ride downtown on the last day! 

If you have the opportunity, definitely stay with them at this house!"
69044	170273	10.0	10.0	1441227	Our stay at Nadine's and Mark's beautiful house was one of the best AirBnb experiences we've ever had, and we have pretty high standards.... Nadine was remarkably helpful in a way that made the whole experience feel more like staying with old friends than with someone you've only met over the course of a few hours.  The place itself is gorgeous, the bathroom better than you could imagine, and the location superb.  There is even a 24-hr supermarket heaven around the corner, a vintage book store, and old record shop within a 2-min walk.  But most importantly, if you're looking for a place with charm and character, and with hosts to match, you can't do better than this, in Seattle. 
69045	170273	10.0	10.0	1465093	A gorgeous historical house, with a great location and a story of its own. Excellent first AirBnB stay!

I really enjoy my stay with Nadine and Marc. The home is beautiful and very well situated: Easy access to attractions, restaurants and monorail to go downtown. It is a nice neighbourhood to wall and feel another side of this city : )

The home is nicely decorated, and the room and bathroom are more than comfortable!
Nadine and Marc are good host who make you feel just like home and do not hesitate to point out things and places that could interests you!

69047	170273	10.0	10.0	1548679	"We enjoyed our stay at the Historic House very much. Nadine shared helpful tips about sightseeing, restaurants, transportation and more. The room was comfortable and private bathroom was stylish and fully equipped.
The whole house reflects Nadine's excellent design sense. It's a treat to be her guest! The coffee and breakfast treats were delicious and an extra treat to have wine in the evening, I would definitely stay there again, which I hope to do on future visits to Seattle.

69048	170273	10.0	10.0	1600828	My wife and I recently visited Seattle as part of a brief tour of the Pacific Northwest, in celebration of our 35th wedding anniversary. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Nadine and Mark's amazingly beautiful historic home. We were immediately struck by how accommodating and helpful they were to us. Also, Nadine's recommendations for the area's  best restaurants and  other highlights were perfect ( we went back to her favorite eatery three times in two days - amazingly good!!). 
69049	170273	10.0	10.0	1619918	Mark, Nadine and Lachlan were extremely welcoming hosts.  They showed us around their gorgeous Queen Anne before allowing us to relax on our own.  They were informative and available but not overbearing, which in my mind, translates into a perfect stay.  Comfortable room with water views; clean, private bathroom. The house is located in a quiet yet happening part of town; super close to bus stops that took you right into downtown within minutes.  Wish we had more time to have a glass of wine with them in their living room! Thanks again!!
69050	170273	10.0	10.0	1729903	Our stay with Nadine and Mark in their beautiful home was great.  Location close to sightseeing and restaurants.  Nadine provided wonderful suggestions for restaurants and ideas for places to see and things to do including magazines and maps. The pastries/coffee and  available wine were such a treat!  Our room and bathroom were beautiful and refrigerator in the room was a bonus.  Parking worked out fine.   Top notch hospitality!  If your looking for more room, be sure to check out their new listing basement apartment (we were fortunate to take a peek). Large doors provide lots of light &  Nadine's style makes this place outstanding and provides everything needed for a perfect stay. 
69051	170273	10.0	10.0	1762611	Nadine and Mark were excellent hosts.  We loved the room and bathroom.  Everything was beautiful and clean.  The house was absolutely gorgeous.  The banana bread mentioned by other reviewers did not disappoint - yum!  We also loved the backyard and spent one afternoon enjoying the hammock.  At the end of our stay, Nadine went above and beyond by giving us a ride to the monorail station since it was a rainy day.  We would definitely stay again and recommend Mark and Nadine's to others!
69052	170273	10.0	10.0	1786922	"We made a great choice to stay with Nadine & Mark, in Seattle. Their earlier reviews say it all, excellent! It was interesting chatting with them and they genuinely make you feel 'at home'. Nadine was very helpful with advice about transport and sightseeing. Their house is well situated in a quiet neighbourhood just outside the busier areas but with very easy access to many bus routes to get you anywhere in the Seattle area, or simply walk just a few blocks to places like the Seattle Center / Space Needle, restaurants, etc. Buses from the railway station pass within a block so you don't even need a taxi. Their historic house is as interesting and charming as Nadine and Mark themselves. Thanks, we really enjoyed it.
Colin & Liz"
69053	170273	10.0	10.0	1827029	Wow - what a classy place, but with friendliness galore and a heartbreaker called Stan.  Our experience could not have been better, and Nadine's above and beyond touches made us feel pampered and more like family than guests.  Do yourselves a favour anyone looking for a quality stay in Seattle - a gold medal performance.
69054	170273	10.0	10.0	1870548	"We just had a wonderful stay in Seattle, WA and a big part of it was the comfort and convenience of our stay with Nadine and Mark. They have a beautiful home that is very close to Seattle Center. What a wonderful experience for our first time in Seattle. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting there.

69055	170273	10.0	10.0	1897741	Fantastic house, host Nadine, and host dog Stanley!  I really enjoyed staying here--the property is beautiful and situated in a lovely neighborhood, and Nadine was incredibly gracious and accommodating. THANKS!!!
69056	170273	10.0	10.0	1954892	We just spent 4 nights at Nadine and Mark's Seattle heritage home. This was our first AirBnb experience. The bed is very comfortable; a fresh air breeze circulates through this 2nd storey room; our private bathroom was well-provisioned. We greatly enjoyed being within easy walking distance of city centre yet located in the quiet Queen Anne Hill neighbourhood. Each morning a plate of freshly-baked scones and Nadine's welcoming smile awaited us downstairs in the kitchen. Kerry Park - the best overlook view of downtown Seattle - is only 2 blocks away. A 15 minute walk brings you to Seattle Centre where we explored the many parks and attractions. We recommend taking the water taxi over to West Seattle and walking along Alki Beach. Thank-you Nadine for your generous hospitality and best of luck with your upcoming Berlin marathon and Mark's Iron Man competition.
69057	170273	10.0	10.0	2096743	We stayed with Nadine and Mark for 2 weeks in August while visiting Seattle for our son and daughter in law's wedding. They were great hosts and the house was a charming and quaint. It could not have been a better or more welcoming stay. A most unexpected oasis in a busy city. We were made very welcome and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We would definitely recommend them, and hope to return for our next family visit soon.
69058	170273	10.0	10.0	2156721	"To enjoy the period style and convenience of a great location I would recommend that you stay with Nadine in her lovely home. The advice offered by Nadine and Mark was very helpful and spot-on. Mark parked his car several blocks away just so we could park in the driveway ( even though parking isn't actually offered ) The house was exactly as described and offers a relaxing environment to return ""home "" to. The quality of the linen and towels was really appreciated.
We found it a leisurely walk to Pikes Place Market and an easy stroll to The Space Needle but it was just as easy to catch the bus in the next street, 
Stephen and Linda     "
69059	170273	10.0	10.0	2190555	Seattle is a great place to visit with one of the best public transportation systems.  Nadine was very helpful with all of our questions, the house is gorgeous and my husband and I were very comfortable there.  We would definitely stay there again and hope to bring friends with us next time!
69060	170273	10.0	10.0	2261104	Nadine and Mark are a lovely couple and have a lovely home in a very convenient location.  We felt right a home with them immediately on meeting them.  The accomodations were just fine, the bed with top notch linens was really comfortable.  Good coffee was ready each morning along with Nadines delicious home made banana bread and if you are lucky you will get some of her wonderful scones too which we did one day.  We hape we will return to Seattle again one day and we would definitely  want stay here again.
69061	170273	10.0	10.0	2296106	Lovely host, very thoughtful, fresh coffee and banana bread every morning. Nadine drove us to collect our hire car. Beautiful house, great bedroom, very clean and comfortable. Walking distance to Downtown Seattle. Would highly recommend this charming house and host.
69062	170273	10.0	10.0	2300322	Wonderful historic home and extremely well set up bedroom & bathroom.  Excellent hosts but not enough time to enjoy.  Catch a cab (cheap compared to Canberra Australia) if climbing hills is a problem.  Would definitely return if opportunity arises.
69063	170273	10.0	10.0	2353256	"Nadine and Mark Huck are gracious hosts. They have a lovely Victorian home located on Queen Anne Hill... a convenient location for a Seattle stay. The accommodations were stylish and pristine. We enjoyed our stay very much. Thank you, Nadine and Mark!
"
69064	170273	10.0	10.0	2407487	Nadine & Mark were fantastic hosts. Their home was absolutely beautiful and our room was very clean, comfortable and private. We were in Seattle for a trade show but had plenty of time to sightsee and Nadine & Mark were great about helping us with restaurant suggestions and things to do. We were planning to go for a walk one evening and Mark suggested a lookout spot just up the hill. It was completely (email hidden)d something we might not have found on our own! Parking was difficult but with everything we needed accessible by walking or transit, it was easy to just find a spot and leave the car. I would highly recommend this place and hope we get a chance to visit again!
69065	170273	10.0	10.0	2435484	We had a wonderful stay with Nadine and Mark. The house was amazing, great restaurant suggestions and the house was peaceful. Hope to see them again on our next trip.
69066	170273	10.0	10.0	2456797	"Wow, This really was a 5-star-experience! Even though Nadine & Mark couldn't be around I really loved staying at their house. The location is very nice but you have to prepare yourself to do some up- and downhill walks if you like to discover the neighborhood on foot ;-) The house itself is just stunning: antique interior combined with modern and personal pieces create a very cozy atmosphere.
My room and the bathroom both were spacious and very clean. Nadine and Mark also offered some maps and additional information about the house and the area which was really helpful. I hope I can come back to Seattle to see more of this city and will certainly send a request for this accomodation again."
69067	170273	10.0	10.0	2563920	Amazing house located in a perfect place to explore the city. Comfortable beds, friendly people. Our trip was amazing thanks in large part to having a great place to stay. Thanks Nadine and Mark!
69068	170273	10.0	10.0	2679605	Our stay with Nadine and Mark far exceeded our expectations. The house is beautiful and perfectly situated in Queen Anne, with easy access to several bus lines and within walking distance to Seattle Center. Nadine gave us many helpful recommendations on where to eat and where to run, and she greeted us each morning with fresh-baked goodies and coffee. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Nadine and Mark, it was much more pleasant and comfortable than any hotel could be.
69069	170273	10.0	10.0	2745053	"This is the perfect place to stay while discovering Seattle. Neither my husband or I had visited the town before, but we quickly discovered that this house is located within minutes of all of the main attractions...yet it's totally quiet and tranquil.
If you're a history buff you'll get a kick out of the 'cursed tree' story (I'll leave it to you to find out!) and you'll love the feeling of staying in a faithfully maintained Victorian home with all modern accoutrements.
We stayed in the upstairs guest bedroom. Very comfortable and crisply linened queen bed, and an adjacent bathroom which my husband jubilantly declared to look like something 'out of a restoration hardware catalog!"" We were provided with mini hotel supplies and fresh towels.
Nadine and Mark were very welcoming and friendly, and we enjoyed coffee and juice in the morning plus fresh baked pumpkin bread and the nicest bread I had ever eaten! It tasted home made too.
This was definitely the nicest airbnb stop on our Pacific Northwest trip!"
69070	170273	10.0	10.0	2842321	Perfect stay as always. The house is beautiful, the location is great. Nadine is such a great host! 
69071	170273	10.0	10.0	2866219	We had a wonderful stay at Nadine and Mark's historic, 120-year-old home. They have done a great job of preserving its charm, and provided us with a nice bedroom and bath. They are gracious hosts; very thoughtful. We arrived to the delicious smell of freshly baked banana bread, made for us. The house in the Queen Anne area of Seattle is a short walk away from lots of restaurants and stores, the Seattle Center and Monorail to downtown. We just parked our car for the weekend and used our feet and public transit. Highly recommended.
69072	170273	10.0	10.0	3508727	"Nadine and Mark's home is truly a historic gem. My wife and I were really fascinated by all the original period detail throughout the home - a truly glorious stair and banister, period ceiling lamps, and stately dining and living rooms. Even though it was historic, we always felt warm, comfortable, and welcome in the home. Our room was spacious, had a comfortable bed, and useful mini-fridge. The bathroom was also convenient with 2 sinks and a jacuzzi type bathtub which was a great comfort at the end of a long day. The home is very conveniently located and walking we found an eclectic mix of interesting stores -  including an exceptional Japanese restaurant - ""Shiki"" whose fresh sushi we felt rivals what we can get in Tokyo.

Mark and Nadine were great hosts - appreciated the hot coffee and selection of home made breads and muffins which they had ready for us every morning. Above that though, it was a pleasure chit chatting with them about their home and things in general. Highly recommend their wonderful home!"
69073	170273	10.0	10.0	3626054	"I cannot say enough about our stay with Nadine and Mark. They were such generous hosts to my family. Traveling with a toddler and staying in someone's home can be risky, but they were more than accommodating and made every effort to make my daughter (and her parents!) feel at home. They were willing to offer suggestions for day trips and provided maps and leaflets of local sights and events.  And we woke up every morning to homemade banana bread.   

Their home is absolutely gorgeous. Amazingly decorated, roomy, and comfortable. And it is perfectly located for a trip to Seattle. It's just a short walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, as well was Queen Anne. We were also able to walk to Pike Place Market and Ballard, though these were lengthy, but very nice walks.  We really enjoyed our time with Nadine and Mark and would highly recommend their home. "
69074	170273	10.0	10.0	3861995	We had a wonderful stay at Nadine's home. She is very welcoming and nice. Her home is conveniently located within a few (hilly) blocks of Kerry Park, which has a wonderful view of Seattle. Queen Anne is a fun neighborhood to explore. It was also very easy to take buses from Nadine's home to other neighborhoods in the city as well as King Street Station (for trains). The room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. Nadine even let us check in and out a few hours early/late. Highly recommend staying here!
69075	170273	10.0	10.0	4048314	"This was a nice change from staying in a hotel as I have done in the past during my frequent work trips to Seattle. It was convenient, comfortable, and homey. Mark and Nadine were wonderful hosts and I enjoyed getting acquainted and learning more about the historic home before leaving on my last morning. I liked not having a TV in my room. Mark was kind to give me and my suitcase a lift to my office down the street so I didn't have to get out my umbrella!

I'll definitely take advantage of this as often as I can when I am in Seattle."
69076	170273	10.0	10.0	4159512	Fabulous house, great location, personable and helpful owners. We would stay there again.
69077	170273	10.0	10.0	4260793	Great stay. Walking distance to Seattle center and many great restaurants nearby.  Beautiful historic home that reminds you of what Seattle looked like long ago. Great hosts too.  We very much enjoyed our stay!
69078	170273	10.0	10.0	4364665	We had a wonderful stay at Nadine & Mark's beautiful historic home!  It was so peaceful! We woke up each morning to the sound of birds singing & the smell of fresh brewed coffee! The hosts are outstanding! They welcome you and allow you to enjoy the beautiful space at your leisure with privacy yet are there if you need them & go above & beyond to accommodate  you! It's truly the perfect balance of hospitality! Views in the area are spectacular! So many great places within walking distance! We look forward to staying again!   
69079	170273	10.0	10.0	4509858	"Staying at Nadine and Mark's place was wonderful!  It was everything I hoped for and more.  The house was gorgeous, the room was very comfortable and well equipped and Nadine, Mark, and the dogs made me feel very at home. Coffee and yogurt in the morning, a small fridge in the room, a great backyard to relax in and the whirlpool tub in the bathroom were extra special touches! The neighbourhood is great I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go in Queen Anne.
I would definitely return again!"
69080	170273	10.0	10.0	4589406	I visited this beautiful home with a friend of mine, for two days.  It's in a beautiful neighborhood and is very close to many interesting places to visit.  Nadine was helpful when I texted her, asking for her advice for a restaurant that would accommodate a party of 25 people, with varied dietary preferences.  She then suggested an ice cream place where we could take this group of teens, that was just  a few blocks away.  I appreciated her willingness to help us, as we tried to meet the needs of so many people.  My friend and I had a nice retreat to look forward to, after spending the day with these teen athletes.  There is a really comfy bed, towels that were soft and thick, and fresh baked banana bread to welcome us.  I would stay here again.  My only hesitation is that the upstairs is a very quiet space, but sound travels easily, so we were careful not to be disruptive.  If I were to come with children, I would like to look at the suite that they have downstairs.  Overall, a very positive experience, and I hope to stay again when we have more time to explore the area.
69081	170273	10.0	10.0	4942118	I had a wonderful time in Seattle and loved staying in Nadine and Mark's home.  Our room was quiet and private and loved having our own private jacuzzi tub bathroom.  Nadine's breakfast scones were to die for and her and Mark was super great host. The house was within walking distance to Pike's Market and the Space Needle.  If you love walking, there really is no need to rent a car; everything you need is close by. This home was beautiful and relaxing and I will definitely plan to stay here on my next Seattle Visit.   Thank you Nadine and Mark for everything!!!
69082	170273	10.0	10.0	5156239	"What a lovely house and wonderful hosts in a gorgeous neighborhood in Seattle. 

We enjoyed our time so much and it would have been even better to have had a bureau, mirror, clean under the bed, blinds on the window.  Mainly, it was hard to unpack and get comfortable and running across the hall for a mirror was a bother. 

Not to be negative, as hosts are great, but this didn't work. "
69083	170273	10.0	10.0	5295183	Nadine and Mark were amazing hosts. We had a wonderful stay in their beautiful home. The room was clean and comfortable. Every morning there was delicious banana bread for breakfast. Nadine was very accommodating and flexible with our check in/check out times. Additionally, she suggested restaurants, parks and other places to visit. Every place she recommended was phenomenal. Since we're runners, Nadine answered all of our running questions and offered great advise. We are planning a trip for next year and we're definitely staying here again! 
69084	170273	10.0	10.0	5474376	Stayed in their double room by myself! Room was big enough for 2 comfortably.  Had my own bathroom across hall with lovely Jacuzzi bath.  House is authentically old but the modern decor mixed with antiques make it a very great accommodation.  I came and went without much need to see Nadine and Mark so didn’t feel like they were intruding. Area is very safe and lots of nearby buses to downtown Seattle.  10 min walk to Space Needle. Would recommend and would visit again. 
69085	170273	10.0	10.0	5568526	Wonderful place to stay. My wife an I spent 3 nights here and the location along with Nadine's hospitality was a perfect place for a visit to Seattle. Close to public transit and within waking distance to the Space Needle and other great sites (Be sure to check out Chihuly Garden and Glass if you can). Comfy bed, nice bathroom, and tasty coffee/tea/pastries for breakfast. Earplugs are a good idea if your not used to city noise at nighttime like us. Would definitely stay here again!
69086	170273	10.0	10.0	5635738	The neighborhood is walking distance to Seattle Center, the aquarium, Pike Place Market, downtown and more. Nadine was an amazing host who provided great recommendations and a little history about the house itself. Stay here if you want a comfortable room in the heart of Seattle. 
69087	170273	10.0	10.0	5983904	A terrific find. Great hosts, the type of people who just seem good at life. Really easygoing and refreshing to meet. Big cosy towels in the bathroom, gorgeous (and clean) bedroom, thoughtful little details like maps & bus schedules on the desk and coffee in the morning. The location is also a plus - plenty of restaurants, and lots to see on the walk towards downtown. We were so grateful to be staying there. Thanks Nadine.
69088	170273	10.0	10.0	6030421	Nadine and Mark were super hosts. They were warm and flexible about my late arrival and my need to store my bags a little past my check-out time. Their home is beautiful and the guest room and private bath combine the charm of the home's long history with all the comforts of a modern hotel room. You'll even have a lovely view of the water from your window. Their home is a short walk to public transportation and the fabulous Toulouse Petit, where you'll want to dine every morning for breakfast. The Historic House at Seattle Center is a unique, pleasant and convenient place to stay while in Seattle.
69089	170273	10.0	10.0	6081204	This was an excellent place to stay, and Nadine and Mark were very helpful, kind and communicative. I found them exceptionally welcoming.

We were in contact with Mark for the majority of our visit and he was very attentive to making you feel at home and part of their family. There home was centrally located to down town Seattle, walking distance to great restraunts, popular tourist sites, music artist, the space needle, and many more fun things to do.
Your sleeping quarters were very comfortable, and we liked the back yard for morning and afternoon treats and play time with their 2 dogs, Bell and Stan.
We would rate our first visit at a 4 star accommodation.
This was our 40th wedding anniversary present to ourselves and we were very pleased. Thanks to  Mark and Nadine!!!!

69094	170273	10.0	10.0	6864389	What can I say more than all the compliments that have been done to Mark and Nadine? We came from France. We did not know at all Seattle. Mark and Nadine welcomed us as friends. Their kindness, their hospitality, their humor, their availability, all has enlightened our stay in Seattle. We were happy with Mark and Nadine, and very sad when we left. Seattle, Mark and Nadine : trio of our best memories in U.S.A..
69095	170273	10.0	10.0	7112779	Nadine and Mark are lovely people who welcome you and make you feel comfortable. We stayed in the guest room upstairs and needed to ask about our daughter coming with us at the last minute. Nadine graciously prepared another room for her and welcomed her, as well. The entire house is beautiful and accessible, with fun old-fashioned keys and authentic restoration, down to the door hinges. Lovely place, lovely people.
69096	170273	10.0	10.0	7229031	Nadine and Mark were such warm and welcoming hosts. I hugely enjoyed my stay in their beautiful and comfortable home and wished that I could have stayed longer. They were generous with their recommendations for walks (I enjoyed a walk to view the beautiful sunset and views of down town and Mount Rainier) and restaurants. Hopefully I will be back in the future with my husband and daughter!
69097	170273	10.0	10.0	7240417	We truly enjoyed our stay at Nadine's Historic Home. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome, to accommodate our need to drop bags off early, and to help us retrieve our rental car from downtown. Her recommendation for Toulouse Petit for breakfast hit a home run. We enjoyed both excellent service and food. She also had good recommendations for jogging/walking routes. And we appreciated the private bath with two sinks.  
69098	170273	10.0	10.0	7435907	"My wife and I had a lovely stay at Nadine's lovely historic home in the  Queen Anne district in Seattle. Our bedroom was very comfortable, we had our own private bath, and we had access to much of the rest of the house and backyard. Each morning Nadine had coffee, tea, fruit, yogurt, juice and bakery available for us.
Nadine was also kind enough to pick us up at our bus stop downtown and drop us off at the light rail station to get to Seatac airport for our flight home.
The Queen Anne district is a wonderful location to stay in. Only blocks away were wonderful restaurants and pubs with all kinds of ethnic eating, a movie theater, and a major music venue.
A car is really not needed in Seattle, and finding parking may be difficult or expensive. Seattle's public transportation is fantastic, and you can get anywhere easily. However, we would encourage anyone to walk as much of the city as possible, and Nadine has great information available for all kinds of city walks.
We hope to return to Seattle one day, and will definitely book with Nadine when we do."
69099	170273	10.0	10.0	7795858	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the beautiful Historic House with Nadine and Mark! The room and private bath (across the hall) were spotless and the bed was so comfortable, with soft pillows and a fluffy warm comforter. I felt very welcome by the hosts, who were warm, friendly, and accommodating. The location was perfect for me - just outside the hustle and bustle in a quiet neighborhood yet steps to stores, restaurants, and the bus lines. A short walk up their street leads to Kerry park, with views of the city and the space needle. Loved my time there and hope to return! 
69100	170273	10.0	10.0	8134524	We enjoyed our stay with Nadine and Mark very much. Their home is lovely and Nadine takes excellent care of her guests, with homemade pumpkin bread every morning. We were super busy during our stay so did not get to spend that much time at the wonderful home. But Nadine kept an immaculate bathroom and bedroom, with a very comfortable bed, even for someone with back problem. We love the Queen Anne neighborhood which was very convenient to downtown and provides many interesting walks.
69101	170273	10.0	10.0	8231999	My stay with Nadine was perfect.  She is the consumate hostess, friendly and helpful but not intrusive.  The house is in a great location. The room was quiet, well-appointed and stylish.  I was able to walk everywhere while in the city and use their driveway to park the rental car for day trips.  Not sure when I'll come to Seattle again, but I know where I'll stay if I do!  Thanks Nadine :)
69102	170273	10.0	10.0	8410991	Nadine was awesome. My boyfriend and I slept like rocks! I appreciated the thoughtfully decorated home and the care our host had for this historic landmark building. She has super friendly dogs, a beautiful backyard, coffee in the morning, and is very flexible with her driveway space. Not to mention within walking distance of all of the tourist sites!  Really a great place to stay if you are visiting the city for the first time. 
69103	170273	10.0	10.0	8575400	Best, the location is excellent. We are definitely among the senior age group but this is so low on Queen Anne that walking to the (great selection of) restaurants, lounges, music) is comfortable.  And if you like sleeping in a place that feels like you are at home, this is it. Everything you need from bed and bath to simple but perfect breakfast.  Plus we had a view of the great wave activity on Elliott Bay.  We travel worldwide a lot and would recommend this anytime we need a place in Seattle.
69104	170273	10.0	10.0	8719166	"Nadine and Mark were great hosts. The house is perfectly located, tastefully decorated, very clean, the bedroom is a little nest. 
And overall Nadine's breakfast are very good.
Being with Nadine and Mark is a real airbnb experience : discussing, sharing tips about both our cities, having a nice moment together, meeting with local people.
Their dogs are sweet angels.
We will definitively come back to Nadine and Mark's.
And hope to see them in Paris soon.
"
69105	170273	10.0	10.0	8959305	Great hosts!   Comfortable and nicely furnished.  A nice breakfast with a touch of Irish Cream for the morning coffee.  Oh, and if you are lucky, Belle will greet you!
69106	170273	10.0	10.0	9081721	My second stay was as comfortable as the first.  Wonderful hosts!
69107	170273	10.0	10.0	9160589	I have nothing but positive things to say about my stay at Nadine and Mark's. They are wonderful hosts. The house was beautiful, with lovely antique furnishings, and it was all done up for Christmas. It even smelled yummy! The room and bath were super clean, as though I was the only one who had ever stayed there. They graciously allowed me to park my car in their drive and leave it there all weekend. It needed to be moved at one point, and they took care of it. On top of all that, they have two of the sweetest dogs you'll ever meet. I already miss Bellatrix's enthusiastic greetings and Stanley's handsome, kind face.
69108	170273	10.0	10.0	10055998	"My husband and I just spent an enjoyable weekend in Seattle at the Airbnb of Nadine Huck. Nadine was welcoming, accommodating and knowledgeable. The house was warm and inviting and in a fabulous part of town. We walked almost everywhere. We are already planning our return. Thank you Nadine. 
Deb and Perry Braun"
69109	170273	10.0	10.0	10449573	Nadine is a great and nice host, their house is so classic, clean and beautiful. My husband and I love here so much. The location is good and easy to find the way go to downtown and if you want to go Space Needle and  Chihuly Garden and Glass, just take a walk around 18-20mins from the house. In short, Nadine's house is a good place when you stay in Seattle and we will come here again.
69110	170273	10.0	10.0	13923087	"We spent 3 glorious days and 2 nights in the capable care of hostess Nadine.  Our room was beautiful- elegant linens,  beautiful decor, every convenience.   The house itself is a an usual and interesting historic home which Nadine and Mark graciously share with guests.  Nadine's touch with interior decor made for ""eyecandy"" everywhere we looked.  The  pretty back yard with its view of the Space Needle and comfortable furniture welcomed us for lunches and evening quiet time.  The location is excellent - close to Seattle Center and public transportation and   wonderful restaurants......and an easy jaunt to downtown, Lake Union, and beyond.  "
69111	170273	10.0	10.0	14191164	"Great experience. I plan on coming back with my wife. Unfortunately my conference was so demanding that I did not have the time I had planned to get to know my hosts better or spend time with them. Very accommodating with the parking, as the Queen Anne area of Seattle can be messy with the parking.

The room and bed were very comfortable, and having lived in Europe for many years made the trip to the non-adjoining bathroom a breeze. I know many shy away from that set up, however, the fact that I literally always had the hallway to myself made it feel very much like home. Yes, I am a married man and my wife ""owns"" the master bathroom, so I have my own.

I will have to say that the only reason I would not stay in that room again is because they have a piece of my childhood in their backyard - a gleaming and well appointed Airstream trailer, just like the one I spent many fishing trips in as a youngster.

The bathroom was always impeccable and I tried my best to keep it that way, after every use, although I am sure Nadine would have tackled anything I could have thrown at her. The rest of the house was also well appointed, I simply did not have the time to use it!

Well done you guys, you have managed to create a great and very restful space for guests. It also seemed that travel time to great restaurants and my conference were extremely short and quite acceptable (I don't like city traffic).

Thanks for having me! In those famous and trite words of Arnold, ""I'll be back!"""
69112	170273	10.0	10.0	14970961	"Excellent room, excellent location, unique house, and last, but not least, excellent hosts!
Highly recommended.
My wife and I enjoyed our stay very much!
- Raiah & Ronny"
69113	170273	10.0	10.0	15597764	"My husband and I were in Seattle for three days on business.  This was our first Airbnb experience.  Nadine was welcoming and helpful.  Our schedule was very busy, but coming back to the house really felt like coming home after a long day.  The house itself was very clean and charming.  Nadine really has the little touches down: high thread count sheets, fluffy white towels, a killer shower head, nice strong coffee and even a cold beer in the fridge!  
We had a great time and look forward to our next visit."
69114	170273	10.0	10.0	15758363	Great host, beautiful home, wonderful location. Would highly recommend it.
69115	170273	10.0	10.0	16003513	Nadine was an awesome host!  She was very friendly and every tip she gave us on places to eat or things to see was fantastic. The house is beautiful, the bed was super comfy, and the bathroom was great for my wife and I. The location is easy walking distance to Seattle Center.  We stayed for a few days before our Alaska cruise, and I'm so glad we're staying there again for a few days after the cruise.
69116	170273	10.0	10.0	16219074	Nadine was the perfect airbnb host! She often went above and beyond, for example, carrying my heavy luggage upstairs after I dropped it off the first day, preparing a wonderful Continental breakfast and coffee for me each morning, and just being super friendly and welcoming. The house was also perfect - comfy, beautiful, immaculately clean, and in a great location in Lower Queen Anne. I can't recommend Nadine and her home enough!
69117	170273	10.0	10.0	16410313	Our visit was delightful.  Nadine could not have been more gracious.  The room was attractive and comfortable - great bed - and everything was handled beautifully from nice thick towels to locally sourced berries and yoghurt for breakfast.  I highly recommend this listing.  One note - the are on a very steep hill- makes for a great view, but a steep climb!
69118	170273	10.0	10.0	16604834	It was comforting to bookend our Alaskan cruise with stays in Nadine's home.  Our second stay was every bit as great as the first!
69119	170273	10.0	10.0	17118685	We enjoyed our stay very much, great walking to many activites Seattle has to offer. Easy to get to by bus! Very quiet and cozy
69120	170273	10.0	10.0	18809027	The listing description was spot on.  It was everything I had expected, and more.  Nadine was incredibly accommodating, and the home is in a perfect location.  Within walking distance to many great sights. 
69121	170273	10.0	10.0	19690333	Nadine made my wife and I feel extremely welcome. The room was exactly what we were looking for, and the location can't be beat. She gave us only as much interaction as we wanted, and made some great recommendations for local restaurants (including the best breakfast we've ever had). We loved our experience, and would stay again without hesitation.
69122	170273	10.0	10.0	39983173	Nadine and Mark were absolutely great. They were kind and accomodating. Everything was as described on the listing: the house is really beautiful, the room was cozy and comfortable, the neighborhood is quiet and convenient to get to anywhere in Seattle. Strongly recommend this place!
69123	170273	10.0	10.0	40538929	If you are looking for a first rate Airbnb experience then this is the place for you. I only have good things to say about staying at Nadine's house. She is a superhost for a reason.  First of all, she let us stay there on short notice after our previous reservation was cancelled. She invited us in and made us feel like old friends. The house is in great shape and is very much designed around its Airbnb visitors. It's easy to tell that a lot of thought was put into making it a pleasant stay for guests. Breakfast was from the local market a few blocks away. My wife and I would drink coffee in the mornings on the back porch overlooking her beautiful backyard. I very much enjoyed having conversations with Nadine in the morning as we planned our day's adventures. As first time visitors to Seattle it made a huge difference having someone point us to the right places to go for sight seeing and public transportation. Her generosity with her time was so appreciated and valuable. The location of the house is ideal for people who are trying to avoid renting a car. Public transportation is just a few blocks away and the Seattle Center is very close. From there you can pretty much explore the whole city. Her house is in a very nice neighborhood. We felt safe walking home at night. We slept on an incredibly comfortable bed with the windows up and were never once bothered by outside noise. The Wi-Fi in her house is very fast. I will definitely stay here again.
69124	170273	10.0	10.0	41623669	"Nadine went out of her way to accommodate me at every turn.  Took plenty of her own time to orient me to the city and was a gracious host in every conceivable way.   The house is gorgeous and impeccably decorated, and the backyard was an added bonus where I spent more than a few hours relaxing and socializing. 

No reservations whatsoever about giving full marks.  Bedroom and private bathroom were extremely pleasant, hosts were exceedingly gracious, and the location was absolutely perfect for my plans at Seattle Center.  Hope to return!"
69125	170273	10.0	10.0	42066855	Nadine was wonderful! This was my first airbnb experience and she exceeded my expectations. The place was just as described, and she was very helpful in getting us situated and providing us with suggestions for our stay. Would stay again!
69126	170273	10.0	10.0	51165587	Nadine is a very gracious hostess.  She supplied us with all the information we needed for our stay.  The house is a vintage treasure and we greatly enjoyed the opportunity to stay in it.  We walked to the Space Needle, great restaurants and the movie theater.  Also, we found public transportation to be very easy in Seattle.
71454	7803176	10.0	10.0	43445675	Comfy bed, quiet neighborhood, cheerful friendly hostess, and a chocolate bar on the pillow in case I was hungry arriving from the airport. Everything one could hope for!
71455	7803176	10.0	10.0	44217745	I had a very nice four night stay at Angie's.  She made me feel very welcome as a guest in her home.   The room is a very comfortable size, with a big window for sunshine and fresh air.   Her place is in a nice neighborhood, with a couple of restaurants within just a one minute walk.  I had to visit Seattle for a family health issue, and while there I was able to relax in the evening and keep up on work items, as Angie's home was very quiet.
71456	7803176	10.0	10.0	45324456	Angie's apartment was a nice option for our visit to Seattle during the Pax convention.  We didn't see her much, but felt at home with her cat, who never wanted to leave the right side arm of the sofa.  Spartan room but comfy bed.  Bus 28 (less than a block away) can get you downtown in 35-45 minutes for $2.50, and get you back in 20.  There's a nice food market on the corner for coffee and quick meals and more options a 5 minute walk away.  Overall, a good place to crash if you don't mind a little journey into town, or staying in a very quiet, residential area. Angie is very accommodating.
71457	7803176	10.0	10.0	51065906	Angie was a great host. She went out of her way to accommodate and welcome me. Her home was very clean and comfortable. The location was perfect for my needs. I really enjoyed my stay!
71458	7803176	10.0	10.0	51452186	Great experience! All I ever need when I travel is a comfortable, private room to sleep and Angie's place did just that and more. There's a small TV on a dresser with Chromecast (if you want to watch something), a comfortable bed and a window. You're in a great neighborhood with really cool restaurants. Old-hen, ridgeback both had great breakfast, the market on the corner has great espresso and the Barking Dog has a good beer for you. Downtown is only a bus ride away and Uber and Lyft are always easy options. Angie and I only saw each other for about 2 mins during my entire stay but was a great host. I'd stay again if I was welcome. 
71459	7803176	10.0	10.0	54924509	I had an awesome time here. Angie was a fantastic, friendly host who made me feel welcome instantly. Gold star!
71950	6992387	10.0	10.0	38234879	Alex was very quick to reply to my last minute and very urgent need for accommodations.  Great host!  Would highly recommend!
71951	6992387	10.0	10.0	39817515	We had a very good time by staying at this house. It has a very big living room and the kitchen almost has everything. There is a yard too. The neighborhood is very nice also also, just a few minutes drive to Safeway. If you want to stay in Seattle, this is definitely a wise choice.
71952	6992387	10.0	10.0	40956589	The home and property were just as described and very nice. Checking in and out was easy. The home and garden are beautiful and very comfortable and relaxing. The location is great with plenty to do nearby while being located in a quiet and parklike setting. I'd definitely stay again and recommend it highly. 
71953	6992387	10.0	10.0	45033589	Good instructions, easy to follow. Neighborhood is great.  Lovely neighborhood to walk around.  We walked to the zoo, two blocks away, and to many restaurants.  Front porch is a great spot to sit and watch the world go by.
71954	6992387	10.0	10.0	47727508	"Even nicer than in the pics. Alex left logs in the fireplace and a bottle of wine and smoked salmon to make us feel at home. He invited us to pick kale from the garden. Wonderful living room and lovely porch. Felt ""at home"" away from home."
71955	6992387	10.0	10.0	48344041	"Alex's home is beautiful and extremely comfortable. I had a very nice stay and felt at home in his lovely neighborhood.  

Very comfortable bed, great art around his house.  It's set apart from the street as well; it was very refreshing to be in a ""city"" with so many trees and so little noise.  Beautiful yard and garden. "
71956	6992387	10.0	10.0	55208673	"Alex was a great host! He went out of his way to obtain a Pack n Play for our son for the house; he was also extremely responsive to the many questions I had. He also left great instructions in the home. 

The house itself is very comfortable and charming--we particularly enjoyed the common areas. 

The kitchen in the house is also excellent. Alex has it stocked with great kitchen equipment and wonderful coffee making supplies as well. 

One of the best things about the rental is the neighborhood. There is a nice zoo just a block up the street with a playground right across the street, coffee shops within walking distance, and great views all around. The neighborhood is also very quiet. 

The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the stairs leading down to the second bedroom are very steep and might not be safe for all guests. For example, I did not feel safe carrying my baby up the stairs.

72507	6127974	9.0	10.0	31083383	Michael was a great host. He responded quickly and made sure that I had everything that I needed and more. The apartment was in a perfect location and was beautiful. The bed was so comfortable, I didn't want to get up. It was way more than I expected and would gladly stay there again next time I am in town. A great first Airbnb experience.
72508	6127974	9.0	10.0	31153900	Michael was a great host.  He confirmed within an hour of my request and sent me the entry code.  He also called shortly before my scheduled arrival to make sure I got the information and answer any questions.  The studio was recently renovated and immaculately clean.  All the photos are completely accurate. He has good info on his listing and also in the room for parking, etc.  The bed is Sterns Foster (fantastic quality), large, super comfortable and the sheets very nice. I know Seattle and this is definitely a nice neighborhood.  Micheal is dedicated to making his place nice for his guests and for their stay to go smoothly--well that is they way I felt. When I left we spoke and he told me about the improvements that his making even before I could suggest them.  I don't have any complaints. This will be one of my top choices when I visit my family in Seattle.
72509	6127974	9.0	10.0	31677000	The greenlake studio was very clean and well put together. The fixtures, floors, and feel are very contemporary and comfortable.
72510	6127974	9.0	10.0	31742084	A neat and meticulously clean studio in a great location.
72511	6127974	9.0	10.0	32196873	"This is an awesome studio-- it was perfect for me and my husband. Michael was so easy to communicate with and even had wine and snacks for us on the dresser! The heater was a lifesaver for us since, as Phoenicians, were freezing in the May Seattle weather. Also, we loved the comfortable bed, especially the pillows! 

The neighborhood is wonderful: market, restaurants, retail and coffee shops were literally a short walk up/down the street. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you again, Michael!
"
72512	6127974	9.0	10.0	32845208	I loved  the studio!It had everything you could need: complimentary bottle of wine and snacks were so thoughtful, too. Close to everything;  yoga studios, across from Ken's market. Walk to Greenlake. 
72513	6127974	9.0	10.0	33300782	"My wife and I stayed at Michael's place with our toddler son for one night. It served us well, and it worked fine to use a pack-and-play crib for our son in the corner. It was very clean and tidy. 

A few minor cons: the bed did have a fairly pronounced low spot in the middle that my wife and I found ourselves rolling into during the night. Also the bathroom is very narrow; my knees were pressed tight against the wall when using the toilet. Taller or larger folks might have a bit more trouble.

Overall it worked very well for us. The location was just what we were looking for and the price was great. Also we loved being just 2 blocks from a tasty ice cream parlor (Bluebird Ice Creamery, two blocks north) that was open late!"
72514	6127974	9.0	10.0	33705476	Very nice and convenient studio in Phinney Ridge.  I would stay there again.
72515	6127974	9.0	10.0	34014233	We had a nice and pleasant stay. Bed was super comfortable. Michael was also very accommodative as far as our check-in time was concerned. Overall we will highly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice and cozy getaway in a great neighborhood.
72516	6127974	9.0	10.0	34550330	Michael's place was perfect. Simple, private, and cozy, with everything we needed. The bed was really comfy and we enjoyed sitting outside on the steps in the morning while drinking coffee. Will definitely stay there again. 
72517	6127974	9.0	10.0	34898752	The neighborhood was exceptional as well as the property. The bathroom was a snug fit but I'm 6'2 and all legs, regardless we made it work. This spacious homey location reminded me of a studio hotel room only a lot more private which I enjoyed. Mike was there when we needed him, which we didn't really need because he set the place up just right. The guidelines were very helpful and to the point. The neighborhood is a great place to walk around and exceedingly quiet and quaint. All and all a great stay and would return any time we are in town.
72518	6127974	9.0	10.0	35146580	The studio was exactly as pictured. No surprises. Great location. Extremely clean, compact, modern. Very safe with it's own individual lockbox. Highly recommend.

72520	6127974	9.0	10.0	35925916	Fantastic space!  It was convenient and in a great neighborhood for walking to get a latte in the morning, or driving downtown for the day. The bed is large and comfy; a great bed to fall into after a full day out and about in gorgeous Emerald City!  
72521	6127974	9.0	10.0	36320106	I loved the location, so many restaurants and bars close by and a great grocery store across the street. Phinney Ridge is super cute, quiet and close to Green Lake and Woodland Parks. 
72522	6127974	9.0	10.0	36694502	Michael was available and responded immediately to email or call. Great locations! We loved Phinney Ridge neighborhood. Plus quick drive into the heart of Seattle. Bed and pillows very comfortable. Small but very nice. We enjoyed our visit! if you think you will need an iron, bring your own. That's the only thing missing.
72523	6127974	9.0	10.0	39174788	We were made to feel very welcome and we were kept well informed. It was as expected and very comfortable.  Ken's supermarket across the road is open until 11pm and very good.  We had a lovely meal at the Stumbling Goat Bistro. Thanks again for hosting us Michael. 
72524	6127974	9.0	10.0	39632167	The studio apartment in Phinney Ridge was exactly what we were looking for during our short stay in Seattle.  The room was quite spacious and the bed was comfortable.  The arrival time was pretty flexible once the room was cleaned from the previous guests.  The location of the apartment made it easy to access all parts of the city.  the community has a lot of restaurants and a great coffee house a block away (Herkimer Coffee).  Would definitely stay here again!
72525	6127974	9.0	10.0	40409020	Great location, quiet and comfortable!

72527	6127974	9.0	10.0	42452505	Michael was an excellent and attentive host. The studio was clean and nice to stay in. The proximity to coffee houses, grocery and Phinney live was excellent.
72528	6127974	9.0	10.0	43546629	Studio was exactly as expected, photos and description accurate. Door with electronic lock is a good idea, no fumbling around with a key exchange. Thanks!
72529	6127974	9.0	10.0	43858969	Great location, clean apartment, and easy check-in process! Out-of-town family stayed in the apartment while visiting me in Seattle. It was great to have them so close by in the neighborhood. They said the bed was very comfortable and it was quiet and peaceful at night. Great space. 
72530	6127974	9.0	10.0	44335725	Enjoyed the spacious studio in a fun location. 
72531	6127974	9.0	10.0	44722968	Inexpensive and clean studio rental in a fantastic neighborhood.  Very easy and would highly recommend.
72532	6127974	9.0	10.0	45403658	The process was easy and seamless, the room was comfortable, and the neighborhood is great! Lots of restaurants and shops, and easy transportation to downtown. A great place to stay for a weekend, or a month. One minor thing, the bathroom layout is a little awkward (particularly toilet placement). But I would stay here again, and recommend to friends.
72533	6127974	9.0	10.0	46388516	We really enjoyed our stay. Being in the heart of a neighborhood is much more enjoyable than a hotel. Easy walking distance to great hole in the wall restaurants, a grocery store, and was very convenient to other Seattle neighborhoods. The studio had everything we needed. Great shower!
72534	6127974	9.0	10.0	47090905	The location was in a cute and cozy neighborhood with some amazing views just a few blocks down. Their were tons of restaurants, bars and coffee shops in walking distance, which was very convenient . The home was also attached to a record and vintage clothing shop. Simply wonderful and just as described in the listing! 
72535	6127974	9.0	10.0	47799597	"Place was great!  Exactly as described in listing.  Right off the main street for the neighborhood with grocery store, bars and restaurants all right within walking distance.

Host had all prepared upon arrival and good instruction in the place.  Will stay here again upon return to Seattle!"
72536	6127974	9.0	10.0	48339146	Nice and private studio in a great neighborhood. Mike's instructions made it very easy to access the studio despite my late arrival.
72537	6127974	9.0	10.0	48768260	Although my boyfriend and I didn't have the chance to meet Michael in person, he welcomed us to the studio via e-mail beforehand, was available to be reached via e-mail and phone throughout our stay, left information and instructions in the studio, and responded to my messages quickly. The studio was exactly as it appears in photos- beautiful and clean, with a great kitchen setup that had everything we needed. We loved the convenient location- right on the bus line to downtown, across the street from the grocery store, and within walking distance of places to eat, drink, and shop in Phinney Ridge, plus Green Lake to go for a run. We really enjoyed staying at Michael's studio for our first visit to Seattle and would recommend it to anyone! 
72538	6127974	9.0	10.0	49694971	We had a great stay! The apartment was really nice and in a cute neighborhood. Tons of coffee shops, cafes and bars just a short walk away. The market across the street was really convenient. Would definitely stay there again.  
72539	6127974	9.0	10.0	50950746	"My girlfriend and I had a blast at Michael's Studio
This place had the Best Bed, I felt like i hadn't slept right in years haha.
The studio pretty much had everything we needed except for maybe a cutting board haha but other than that, We felt in love with the awesome neighborhood."
72540	6127974	9.0	10.0	51372541	This place has one of the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed at! Place is super clean, plus it has a mini kitchen and fridge. It's close to supermarket, bars, restaurants, book store, coffee shop. About 15 min from downtown Seattle. Only weird thing is the bathroom space but not a big deal. 
72541	6127974	9.0	10.0	52921268	They apartment was absolutely wonderful and you couldn't ask for a better location; from the market across the street, to all the little bars and shops that are all within walking distance. My wife and I had an absolute blast and can't wait to return! 
72542	6127974	9.0	10.0	55411844	We booked this place for my in-laws to stay in while visiting us over Thanksgiving. They loved it! The bed was huge and comfortable (a real bonus in this day and age) and the really liked having the ability to make coffee and breakfast in the mornings. The location is great as it is a very short walk to 2 great Seattle coffee shops and having Ken's Market across the street was highly convenient for them. They said it was quiet and they slept well every night. The instructions given by Michael were concise and prompt and we had no problems getting into the unit. The host also left detailed instructions in the unit about anything we might have had questions about. Our in-laws will definitely stay there again, and we will recommend this place to our own family and friends when they come to town. 
73045	7564942	10.0	10.0	41552892	Clean and friendly host
73046	7564942	10.0	10.0	41872493	Nick was an amazing host. He went above and beyond by providing an extremely place for us to stay as well as a quiet environment. He also had muffins and coffee ready for us in the morning and took time to get to know us. I was looking at moving to Seattle possibly, and his hospitality really spoke to how amazing the people of Seattle really are. Thank you again Nick!
73047	7564942	10.0	10.0	42060840	We really enjoyed our stay with Nicolas. The room was very nice and clean, the bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. Nicolas was very friendly, personable, and accommodating. I would highly recommend him to anyone! Thanks Nicolas!
73048	7564942	10.0	10.0	48457564	Room description very accurate. Very clean home. Host was very welcoming and offered delicious homemade coffee cake and fresh pressed coffee ready for me very early in the morning. Also was very flexible with my schedule. 
73268	8012443	10.0	10.0	45023886	Great location, responsive host.  
73269	8012443	10.0	10.0	45631033	"特别棒！！我来西雅图的前一天定下来的，当时选是因为价格在西雅图算便宜的，但是环境真的特别好，房子特别漂亮和干净，房东人也超级好，去机场接了我、还给我下了饺子吃。地理位置也很好！小区很安静，门口不远游有巴士站很快就到市中心。强烈推荐！！中国人来旅游的话来这住就对了！

It's an awesome experience!! The room is super clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and clean. It's close to the bus station and easy to go to downtown. Btw, Matt is really really nice and responsible, with a cute dog, Louis. Strongly recommended!!!!!"
73270	8012443	10.0	10.0	46424893	I lucked out when I picked place (SuiteLouis--the owner, Matt Luu,  has named it after his dog, Louis). I'd never used Air BnB before, but couldn't find a hotel in west Seattle, near my son's home, that had vacancies. So I took a chance. This turns out to be a very nice three-story town house in a new development. It was very clean, and nicely decorated. It was so quiet I overslept the first day--I woke up at 10:00 thinking it was 8:00!  I had the entire first floor to myself---there was a bedroom with a small refrigerator, hangers in the closet, extra towels, and my own bathroom. On the second floor is a kitchen (Matt has stocked a few snacks) and a living room that are both available for guests' use.  There's a second guest room on the third floor, as well as a washer and dryer. The owner was very welcoming, even though I got lost and got there late. I was one of the first guests to stay here, and apparently benefited from some kind of introductory rate, which was an added bonus!   A lovely place, and perfect for people visiting west Seattle or the Delridge neighborhood. 
73271	8012443	10.0	10.0	46847959	I needed a place to stay in Seattle for a night during a last minute trip. The room and bathroom were both very clean and and the bed was comfortable. Matt was also very responsive. Overall, it was a great experience.
73272	8012443	10.0	10.0	51859014	Matt and Amanda were very welcoming hosts and Louis was such a sweet little guy too. Their place was very clean and comfortable, with great attention to detail and small extras like snacks. There was great lighting in the room from the big windows, and we could control the temp with in-room thermostat, which was perfect. We had our own car, and it was only a 15-25 minute drive to downtown Seattle (depending on traffic) and easy to find and get around. Matt and Amanda have really thought about all the little details to make our stay enjoyable and we had zero issues from the moment we arrived to when we left SuiteLouis!
73273	8012443	10.0	10.0	52174051	Can't expect more welcoming and helpful hosts than Matt and Amanda - speaking from my own experience all over the places! They really made out of their way to make me feel home, at the same time, left me with enough space and privacy. Special thanks for the weekend tour and the stop at C&P - totally warmed up the raining day. Bathroom is 5-star hotel standard and living room is more than beautiful - overall made my stay in Seattle lovely and memorable. Last but not least, Louis is the coolest dog, only wish I got the chance to read his mind! 
73274	8012443	10.0	10.0	52945517	Our second stay here and everything was just as great! We also had a bit more free time to interact with Matt and his wife, and also play with Louis! Sorry if we depleted a lot of the candy stash:)
73275	8012443	10.0	10.0	53151486	What a wonderful stay! Matt and Amanda were great hosts and very kind and responsive, their dog Louis is an absolute cutie. Lovely clean room with a great bathroom in a really nice neighbourhood. About 10-12 minutes drive into Seattle which was perfect for us. We would come back and stay again if we are ever in the area. Thanks for a great stay!
73276	8012443	10.0	10.0	53315063	Great room!  Exactly as pictured.  Super comfortable bed!  Easy in and out.  Perfect communication.  Loved that the suite is named after the dogs and that many of the details reflect that.  Matt has put a lot of thought into hosting.  Great location - not far from downtown or the airport.  Would definitely stay again!
73277	8012443	10.0	10.0	53921570	"Matt is a very nice host, thanks Matt for picking us up in the airport and driving us to dinner.
The house is delicate and clean. We enjoyed the stay very much."
73278	8012443	10.0	10.0	54414974	Matt and Amanda are the best host we have ever met! They are so attentive, welcoming, helpful and super awesome! We got some troubles on the way to their house and they tried their very best to help us without any hesitation. They invited us to join their tea time and made us feel like at home. The room is like 5 stars hotel, beautifully decorated and fully equipped, especially the bathroom, so bright and clean. We never stayed in such a clean and tidy bathroom. Matt and Amanda's hospitality and fantastic house will definitely be the reason we will come back to visit Seattle again!

She even left out some postcards and toiletries-which were very much appreciated. I loved that there was a Trader Joe's across the street. I would definitely stay here again. Cheers!
79674	8009814	10.0	10.0	47389088	Kate lives in a beautiful neighborhood and she is an extremely gracious host with the two cutest cats ever. If you plan on visiting the area, you can't go wrong with Kate and her bungalow.

79940	4993710	10.0	10.0	32540829	"There was a bit of confusion the first night when I went to check in, but Shawna was able to come up with a solution and helped me stay with another Airbnb host that night. It worked or very well and she was very eager to come up with a solution to the issue immediately.

After that night I had a great stay in Shawna's apartment. It was very nice, clean, and comfortable. I hope her place is absolve the next time I come to Seattle!"

79948	4993710	10.0	10.0	38495669	"Cozy condo in Fremont was exactly that! It was comfortable and cozy. Great location for walking to anything you might need from groceries, to a fabulous cup of coffee to fine dining.  It was also  great to have a place to park a car for when you need a car to get somewhere farther away. 
The condo was exactly as pictured. Tastefully decorated, clean  and extremely comfortable. Everything you might need with the comforts of home. Great views from the balcony. We arrived in Seattle during a ""heat wave"" and  Shawna had several window fans for us to keep us cool.  We appreciated the thoughtfulness and we were never uncomfortable. 
Thank you Shawna for letting us stay in your condo! I've never stayed in Fremont before. I loved it and found the location to be amazingly convenient to anything we wanted to see and do in the Seattle area. It really is the center of the universe."

80497	7745196	10.0	10.0	45526721	"Trevor and Emily are wonderful hosts for an absolutely modern and complete apartment in a wonderful neighborhood in Seattle.
They were so caring about us, and we could ask them every question, it was like staying at home, or with good friends.
The accommodation is in a close distance to Seattle, and you can reach downtown with the very good bus system. If you´re not intending for the big city, you´ll find yourself in a nice and cool suburb, hosted by one of the nicest couples to find."
80498	7745196	10.0	10.0	46329749	Trevor's place was awesome. Clean, bright, beautifully decorated, comfortable and cozy. It was perfect for our three-night stay in every way. It appears to have been newly renovated so we felt like one of the first guests to stay there. Location is also great, short drive or leisurely stroll to awesome restaurants, cafes, bars and shops in Fremont. Trevor was extremely welcoming, attentive and responsive, and the apartment had everything we needed. He even left us passes for local tourist attractions. The only unfortunate thing was that we weren't able to meet him in person. Next time!
80499	7745196	10.0	10.0	46821286	"Trevor was the most responsive host I've ever run across. He went out of his way to be fast and courteous throughout the booking process. I needed a local place to put up my sister and her husband last minute, as I procrastinated actually booking something. With Trevor's help, this wasn't a disaster at all!

My sister and her husband raved about the space. They couldn't believe it was so reasonably priced and the location can't be beat. I highly recommend that anyone looking to stay in Fremont give Trevor a chance. You won't regret it!"
80500	7745196	10.0	10.0	48009470	This is a really nice little place in a great location! I stayed for about a week with my wife and 5-year-old son. Booking process was smooth and Trevor went out of his way to accommodate my son with an air mattress. The apartment is small, but the perfect size for 2-3 people. Extremely clean and well-kept with some great amenities like a dishwasher, washer/dryer, wifi, and a large flat-screen TV with Chromecast (plus a few local HD channels). The bed was comfy with plenty of blankets, and the shower was hot and had lots of pressure. Hard to beat the location as it is walking to distance to lots of great stuff around Fremont and Wallingford but also a quick trip from downtown. Bus stops are close by and an Uber/Lyft from downtown typically ran about $10-12. Very quiet neighborhood as well, and very secure with a fenced yard and keyless entry. Trevor and Emily were great hosts, and even checked in to make sure we had everything we needed during our stay. Overall, would highly recommend this place!
80501	7745196	10.0	10.0	48359267	Trevor and Molly kindly accepted my offer on very short notice and were nothing short of fantastic.  The apartment is impeccable, just as pictured and artfully decorated.  It was easy to find, access, parking was a breeze, and the walkability to Fremont is perfect.  Trevor is a total pro when it comes to communication and hosting.  I travel frequently for work and would highly recommend their apartment for work and or pleasure.
80502	7745196	10.0	10.0	48778170	"The apt was cute, very clean and in a great neighborhood. It had a great view of the city at night and was only minutes away from restaurants, shops and the University of Washington. We had no problems finding parking (huge plus).

There were a couple tiny glitches, that were out of Trevor's hands, the last day of our stay but Trevor was very responsive and accommodating which was greatly appreciated! I can't emphasize how great it was to have Trevor respond so promptly with any questions we had.

If you plan to be in the Seattle area, I would definitely recommend staying here. You won't be disappointed.
