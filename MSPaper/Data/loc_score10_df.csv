1444	8515408	10.0	10.0	50568620	Jennifer was a fantastic host and resource to all things Queen Anne/Seattle.  The neighborhood is VERY walkable and public transportation is accessible. The living space was extremely comfortable and well appointed.  I would highly recommend this apartment!
1445	8515408	10.0	10.0	51502448	Jennifer was very accommodating and the studio was in a great location and neighbourhood. Studio was everything as described and felt very homely. Just what I needed after staying in so many hotels!  Walking distance to Kerry Park, restaurants, shops and bus lines. I've also walked as far as downtown from the studio. Overall, perfect experience and would stay here again!
1446	8515408	10.0	10.0	58074973	Jen made us feel very welcome and was very easy to contact for any information we needed. Parking was included and the studio apartment had everything we needed. Its location was ideal and within easy walking distance to the commercial district of Queen Anne.
1447	5383192	10.0	10.0	36515902	Christine made us feel very welcome. The neighborhood, house and yard were lovely. 
1959	7077910	9.0	10.0	41978601	"The place was very large, neighborhood was quiet and convenient. Clean and wonderful place. Dina was extremely helpful when we needed help. 

Awesome place. Went for TI5. Would definitely stay there again. She gave us directions and was communications in answering us was too notch."
1960	7077910	9.0	10.0	42911648	"Dina was an incredible host! She goes above and beyond for her guests and has a wickedly quick response rate for questions. 

The house was so charming and spread out with more than enough room for 6 people. There is a really nice energy in the house as well! The neighborhood is great and very easy to get around. I definitely recommend it. "
1961	7077910	9.0	10.0	43707599	It was simple to get in and settle down in this cute townhouse. Dina was communicative and accommodating!
1962	7077910	9.0	10.0	46994971	Dina was great. After a last minute cancelation of another airbnb, she was able to accommodate us in her home on short notice. The place is great, along with the location. Coffee shops, the locks, restaurants all within walking distance. She was also very easy to talk to and quick to respond to my questions.
1963	7077910	9.0	10.0	48745073	Dina was a wonderful host. We were in Seattle for a golf trip and she gave us excellent recommendations for golf, places to eat in Ballard, etc. The location is fantastic near the locks (a must-see) and restaurants. 
1964	7077910	9.0	10.0	49899675	The house was in perfect condition when we arrived, and the host provided the information about the home in an e-mail and in person.  There were many goodies in the fridge.  We loved the location because it was convenient to my son, and we could walk to the Locks and the downtown area of Ballard.  The neighborhood was wonderful.
1965	7077910	9.0	10.0	52096802	"Dina was very helpful to us even prior to our arrival. She was cooperative and willing to permit an earlier arrival time. Although we didn't end up needing the early check-in, she was very flexible and responsive to our request. Dina checked in with us a few times during our two week stay and was responsive to our questions throughout our visit.

Overall, we were happy staying at the Ballard townhouse. The location is fabulous. We were a short walk to the library and a variety of restaurants and shops. The locks and botanical garden are also a short walk away. The year-round farmer's market is fabulous. Be sure to get the doughnuts! They are the best. The location couldn't be better to access all of the fun of Ballard. 

While we were generally content with our stay, we were intially taken aback by the state of the townhouse. While it was obviously cleaned for us (baths and kitchen tidy, floors swept and vaccuumed, beds freshly made, fresh towels placed in all baths) , it looked a little ""worn"". The walls were banged up (many marks, patched but not painted in a variety of spots) and the carpet had many stains. There was only one picture hanging in the whole house with a number of empty picture hooks throughout. The house generally has the feeling that someone lived there but moved out and left a bunch of stuff behind.

There were several issues with the master bedroom. While there is an overhead ceiling fan and light, the light was not functional. There was a post-it with instructions for the overhead light but at the bottom of the note it said the light may not work so just use the lamps instead. There were two small lamps for lighting but only one lamp worked. Fortunately, the closet light worked. Another issue with the master bedroom is that one of the closet doors had fallen off and was standing in the closet. As this was a safety concern for our two-year old, we had to move the closet door to another safer location. The dressers in both bedrooms were generally not usable. The drawers were either stuck or without bottoms all together. The master closet had nice shelving that we could use and there were some hangers in the closet.

The kitchen generally had all that we needed with some searching. The kitchen cabinets were full which made it challenging for us since we were staying for two weeks and had brought a few things for our temporary home. We were able to rearrange the cupboards a bit to make space for our items. There was a vareity of items for cooking such as oil and salt and pepper which was very helpful. We were very pleased to have a washer and dryer to use.

While the Ballard townhome is in a great location, has a lovely host,  and easily accomodates a large group/family, aesthetically it could use some TLC.

1966	7077910	9.0	10.0	52971722	Dina's house was a great find for our trip! It truly felt like staying with family. The location was wonderful - being able to walk to restaurants and bars around the house was such a treat! Dina was incredibly responsive to any question that came up. We truly appreciate all the accommodations for our stay!
1967	7077910	9.0	10.0	55193951	Had a lovely time staying with my family at the townhouse. It was very nice and clean and was fully furnished with everything we needed to for the week we were there. We were even able to cook thanksgiving dinner without any issue! The location and just overall functionality of the townhouse was great, and I would definitely look forward to another opportunity to stay here. Thanks so much for letting us use your home!
3595	20928	10.0	10.0	34338491	My stay at Brad and Liz's was exactly what I was looking for. Both Brad and Liz were very friendly and welcoming. The space was very comfortable with a cozy bed with nice linen, a small table and kitchenette and even a couch. It was all very comfortable. I only wish I had more time to enjoy the lovely gardens out back! 
3596	20928	10.0	10.0	34753607	My girlfriend and I stayed 3 nights in Brad & Liz's new basement studio and had all the space and accommodations we needed throughout. There is super easy access to food and transit. I don't want to suggest this space was only adequate - If you grant Airbnb the status of being a radical, modern way of redistributing human access to resources, Brad & Liz are at the top of that evolutionary food chain. If their availability calendar ever overlaps with the need for a place to stay in Seattle, don't hesitate.
3597	20928	10.0	10.0	34971766	"Love the convenient location to Ballard/Freemont and more.  Both Brad & Liz made us feel very comfortable, as if we were good friends!

The actual basement ""apt."" was very clean, tidy & updated decor`.  The use of the garden area was a special treat as the weather was fabulous!  

We will be back Brad & Liz!  "
3598	20928	10.0	10.0	35475344	We did not meet Brad and Liz as they were out of town. They made arrangements though for a friend to welcome us and be available during our stay. The one thing I would add to the current listing is that the entry to the basement guest room is down a steep set of stairs that would be difficult for anyone having mobility issues.
3599	20928	10.0	10.0	35822706	"Brad and Liz's place was great! The location is beautiful and right by some very cool places to visit. I definitely recommend the Ballard Locks and the Ballard Sunday Farmer's Market. The basement ""apt"" had everything we needed. Access to a fridge and microwave is so helpful. And the gardens are lovely! We knew we were in good hands!"
3600	20928	10.0	10.0	37094309	Great place to stay!  Although our hosts were out of town, it was no problem getting in and around.  Had several options left in case we did need anything.  Great room with everything we needed, great location near to transit.  Well-maintained home and beautiful yard!  
3601	20928	10.0	10.0	37657965	"Brad and Liz were amazing Airbnb hosts.  They are very knowledgeable and friendly -- we loved chatting with them when running into each other.  They know the area very well and are wonderful people all-around.

Their house in Ballard was warm, welcoming, and felt just like home -- the basement room (which did not at all feel like a basement) was nice and cold during the recent heat wave.  They provided everything we could have possibly needed and then some. The bed was super comfortable and the kitchenette/dining area was extremely convenient. (Oh, and they have the two sweetest kitties hanging around the yard!)

The neighborhood is safe and interesting, too -- we loved it.  There's lots of cute shops and restaurants/bars nearby, as well as a variety of more nature-y things to do (Ballard Locks, Golden Gardens, etc).  We miss Ballard already!"
3602	20928	10.0	10.0	38296995	Liz and Brad welcomed us by chatting and explaining all about the place where we would call home for the next five days.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and more than adequate for our home away from home.  Even the coffee was good (good coffee with a french press maker) and we are picky!  The sitting are in the back yard is beautiful, whimsical, full of all kinds of flowers.  Brad and Liz are always busy working on something creative and industrious.  We really liked staying here for five days.  It was great place to spring from.  The neighborhood is fun too with lots going on and great eating places.
3603	20928	10.0	10.0	38612887	Absolutely wonderful space to stay in! Location was perfect, an easy walk to many nice cafes including Cafe Besalu. Sheets on the bed are super soft. Kitchenette has all the necessities: cups, flatware, cutting board, teapot, electric kettle, and mini fridge. Brad and Liz are excellent hosts, we felt very welcome. They gave us great recommendations for new places to check out in Ballard. It was very easy to access public transportation from this location too when we needed to head downtown or catch the bus up to Mount Vernon. We will definitely miss Jasper the cat and the lovely garden. 
3604	20928	10.0	10.0	38868755	Listing description is accurate. We were very comfortable and Brad and Liz live in a great neighborhood -- in a quiet are that is walking distance to the main commercial strip and the Locks.
3605	20928	10.0	10.0	39515183	Brad contacted us before check in to make sure everything was good and to make sure that they would be around when we were expecting to arrive.  Brad and Liz seemed eager to meet us, and Liz showed us all around the beautiful garden and our room.  While she showed us around she was giving us lots of great information of Seattle and Ballard, while answering any question only a local would know.  The home has lots of great character and we even got to try our first fig from their tree.  It was truly a pleasure to stay on their property.  
3606	20928	10.0	10.0	40456910	Brad & Liz are wonderful easygoing and interesting hosts. Their home including the place you'll be staying is very comfortable and clean. The area of Ballard is gorgeous and it's an easy public transport connection to Downtown. Stay here, and like me, you will fall in love with Seattle
3607	20928	10.0	10.0	41090267	Very kind and helpful couple. Great and very comfortable space in a beautiful house and garden.   Great Neighborhood too. Would love to be back there.
3608	20928	10.0	10.0	42262665	"Liz and Brad are just great hosts, and provided a welcoming atmosphere the moment we arrived for our week long stay.  The two resident cats, Jasper and Lily, are just so sweet and friendly. This was our first experience with Airbnb, and we couldn't be happier.  We walked through a delightful rose garden full of colorful flowering plants as we walked to and from our entrance, and this provided such a good atmosphere. 

 The quiet  location was perfect as  it was an easy walk to the Chittenden Locks, and picturesque downtown Ballard with all the great eating places and Farmer's Market on Sunday. Golden Gardens Beach is a short drive with a great walking trail. We took the #40 bus to downtown Seattle, so it was very convenient  for many reasons including ample parking.

 The bed was very comfortable with soft sheets.  In fact, I'm missing the bed!!!   The kitchenette had beautiful new cabinets, and the entire space is very light and airy due to large windows even though it is in the basement.  

Also, it was fun to spend a little time at the hosts' joint birthday party in the rose garden with their delightful friends. It was a good feeling to be included.   I am missing the Seattle area, and look forward to a return trip one day, and a chance to enjoy the Victorian home once more."
3609	20928	10.0	10.0	42695476	That was a great first stay at an airbnb. Brad and Liz accommodated our late arrival time with no difficulty, the place was just as advertised, and we had plenty of space. The bed was comfy- super soft sheets! We had a chance to visit with our hosts and they are fantastic people. I would absolutely stay here again. I'm allergic to cats (they have cats in the house) so I discussed that with Brad beforehand. He was quick to respond and answered all of my questions. My allergies did not bother me at all here. Overall, great visit. Thanks!
3610	20928	10.0	10.0	43625974	Brad and Liz were great, the room was clean, and in a great location.  Would definitely stay here again. Again, great hosts.
3611	20928	10.0	10.0	43929993	"Brad and Liz were great. They were very welcoming and gave us some great tips about the area!
The space was very nice & comfortable and very close to a lot of great shopping and. Dining.
We wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"
3612	20928	10.0	10.0	44420025	This is a very nice private bit of the house and we really enjoyed our stay here. Brad and Liz are super friendly and it was lovely to chat to them. I would highly recommend staying here! Also, Ballard is a lovely area... plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants.
3613	20928	10.0	10.0	44773867	We had a great stay at Brad and Liz's beautiful house. The apartment was very clean and spacious with everything we needed including a beautiful garden. brad was available very late to let us  in, show us around and give us pointers on where to go in the neighborhood. We were walking distance to all of the bars, restaurants and shops in Ballard and had a great time exploring the area and relaxing in the garden. Would definitely stay here again!
3614	20928	10.0	10.0	45092551	This was an excellent place to stay in the beautiful neighborhood. The people were great and caring of us. The outside garden in the cats were great. Jacuzzi was fantastic as was the bed.  They should install a motion detector for the stairs going down to apartment.  If you forget to turn the light on at noon and come home at midnight it's dark.  Definately will return. 
3615	20928	10.0	10.0	45411052	Great space in a great neighborhood. Easy street parking. Very welcoming hosts! An absolutely charming house!
3616	20928	10.0	10.0	45783579	Everything as described, very cute and cozy space, essentially an entire unit as opposed to a rented room. Brad and Liz were very hospitable and made my trip a great experience. Thanks! 
3617	20928	10.0	10.0	46389130	Brad and Liz were great hosts, very pleasant and kind.The space was very clean, with coffee, tea and a mini fridge and kitchenette available for use. They also left maps of Seattle and info about things to do which was a great touch. The private entry was convenient for when we stayed out a little later. And lastly, the location was perfect! 
3618	20928	10.0	10.0	46601697	Brad and Liz were very responsive from the beginning. They were flexible when our arrival times changed. The apartment was great and matches the description accurately.   The property was beautiful and the neighborhood was convenient and walkable.  I would definitely stay there again.
3619	20928	10.0	10.0	47643082	When we arrived, Brad showed us around the room/bathroom where we would be sleeping and getting ready, and then he sat down with us and chatted about what kinds of things there were to do around the area. He was extremely friendly and made great suggestions as to where to eat, what venues to check out, etc. He and Liz live in a beautiful residential neighborhood within walking area of breakfast places, nightlife, the bus system, and even the beach. We always felt safe walking back late at night and really loved the area. 
3620	20928	10.0	10.0	48756966	Great basement studio with everything you need for a few days or a week. Close enough to Ballard shops and restaurants and adequate public transport to the rest of Seattle.  
3621	20928	10.0	10.0	49268346	Great experience - Brad was a super nice guy and everything was there as promised. Very easy to get in and out of the house, didn't have to disturb them either which was nice. Would stay again!
3622	20928	10.0	10.0	49638067	Brad and Liz have a wonderful home! The space they rent is beautiful and well maintained - the Internet is speedy, the bed is comfy, and the neighborhood is quiet but near lots of lovely restaurants. They were kind and welcoming hosts, and I'd recommend them with 100% enthusiasm :) thank you both for having us! 
3623	20928	10.0	10.0	49887988	Brad and Liz's home is comfortable and situated in a really fun part of Ballard. Brad gave us a brief orientation to the neighborhood when we arrived which was really helpful. While we spent minimal time in the Alchemist's Den, it was a nice, quiet outpost to explore Ballard and the rest of Seattle from for a couple of days. Thanks Brad and Liz!
3624	20928	10.0	10.0	50122356	"Beautiful lower-level space in Brad and Liz's home, situated in a really cool city neighborhood. Brad was easily reached via cell and very warm and welcoming upon my arrival.  The place is equipped nicely with a very comfortable futon bed and sweet leather couch.  Nicely appointed bathroom is outside the actual space.  The garden outside is gorgeous and the two resident cats are very sweet and friendly. The location (Ballard) is very chill and features a lot of interesting places to hang out, as do the adjacent areas.  

This was my first experience renting a place like this and as far as I'm concerned, it was absolutely a home run in every way for me.  Next time I'm planning a Seattle trip, I will be checking these folks' availability first.   Thanks Brad and Liz.  "
3625	20928	10.0	10.0	50494440	Brad and Liz were very welcoming and easy to talk to. If you love books, you should be in heaven as there are books everywhere! The pictures are accurate, the location is awesome! Thank you!
3626	20928	10.0	10.0	51288816	Brad and Liz were very welcoming and fun to talk with. My husband and I had a pleasant and relaxed stay.  We enjoyed the cats and the yard and the quiet neighborhood. The room was comfortable and as described, but the room is directly under the livingroom so you will hear a bit of upstairs activity.  We made good use of the kitchenette and wifi. The deep bath was a plus. We were out and about mostly; it was easy to walk to restaurants and the Locks from their charming home.   Thanks Brad and Liz.
3627	20928	10.0	10.0	51574748	"Great space. Great people! 
Highly Recommended!"
3628	20928	10.0	10.0	51818522	Very nice place to stay in a very good neighborhood. Clean and set up nicely with plenty of room new furnishings. Of course you are staying in someone's home in a private area, so you will hear normal family sounds in the main part of the house. Cats are a plus! Large comfortable room, bed is excellent. Garden level so its a great place to sleep in late!
3629	20928	10.0	10.0	53342006	The room we stayed in was perfect for myself and my husband. We had lots of privacy however, felt comfortable asking Brad for anything we needed and he was accessible. The neighborhood was awesome and located in walking distance to downtown Ballard, which was so cute! I highly recommend staying here if you can, we had a wonderful experience. 
3630	20928	10.0	10.0	53862287	Brad and Liz welcomed me directly. They were very warm and deeply fascinating. I had to put in effort not to monopolize Brad's time. The neighborhood was perfect for my needs and, while I didn't get to walk around as much as I would have liked, the area has a lot within easy walking distance. Their daylight basement was also comfy, cozy, and perfect for my needs.
3631	20928	10.0	10.0	54487248	Very accommodating hosts, cute unique space with all the essentials. Was exactly what I needed. The location is an easy to walk to buses to get downtown and very close to some beautiful parks! The only things to note: the shower is a bit non traditional and took some getting used to. It's not a completely private separate space, but the hosts were respectful and it was not a problem. I enjoyed my time here and would recommend it. 
3632	20928	10.0	10.0	55102098	My parter and I stayed with Brad and Liz over the Thanksgiving holiday and enjoyed the space very much.  Our hosts were friendly and welcoming and the neighbourhood is quite lovely and close to all Ballard has to offer, which is quite a bit.  The bed was comfortable as described...and I am not a futon fan.   All this and just three blocks from the people we were visiting!  Changes?  Just one:  Unscented, 'green' laundry products.  Otherwise -full marks!
3633	20928	10.0	10.0	55670694	"Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by Brad! He guided me through everything I'd need to know for my visit and made me feel very comfortable.

The space was everything I needed (and more) during my week long business trip in Seattle. The various amenities in Ballard were within walking distance, and Brad had very helpful recommendations for great food and coffee.

I would absolutely stay here in the future and can't wait to visit Seattle again."
3634	20928	10.0	10.0	55864373	Brad and Liz were wonderful hosts.  Spoke briefly with Brad the first day and from there was on my own.  Beautiful house in a great area.  Easy to get to bars and restaurants in Ballard as well as a short ride to Fremont.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to explore those areas and the rest of Seattle.
3635	20928	10.0	10.0	56760599	Brad and Liz were great host and the Alchemist's Den was lovely.
3636	20928	10.0	10.0	56960769	Great folks,  cool accommodations, and friendly cat.  Brad and Liz provide a winning Seattle experience in the hip Ballard neighborhood.   Excellent stay!
3637	20928	10.0	10.0	57271928	Pretty luxurious...warm, spacious, basically feels like your own apartment minus a stove. Very personable hosts as well.
6064	3975434	10.0	10.0	18772995	Victor was great! Nice room in a central location. 
6065	3975434	10.0	10.0	18868723	Vincent was accommodating with my arrival a bit later than expected and last minute reservation. The apartment is nicely furnished and within walking distance to some cafe's, nightlife, and not too far from the Space Needle. A few things to note, the washer/dryer are not located in the unit but in the building and require quarters and there is only 1 of each so you may have to wait to do a load. The bedroom is very tight and the bed is small and has a crease down the middle (because it is broken into a left side and right side then put together) and I didn't sleep well. There is also parking on the adjacent streets that was not too difficult to find (just don't park in front of the building or you will get a ticket). 
6066	3975434	10.0	10.0	19494405	Vincent's is in a neighborhood close to the Space Needle and a very pleasant walk toward downtown. He gave me a walking map to my conference and recommended a great coffee shop just around the corner that I stopped at 3 times. His style is minimal, everything is carefully placed and the apartment is spotlessly clean. The room was perfectly set up with a reading lamp, luggage rack, hangers in the closet and an operable window for fresh air. The bed is comfortable (I slept soundly) and the linens were new and comfortable. I would definitely stay with him again. 
6067	3975434	10.0	10.0	19583302	My girlfriend and I had a very nice time in Seattle and it was a delight to have Vincent as our host. He was a most friendly soul and considerate  he showed us around the place and was able to guide us to some very nice eateries in Belltown. All in all a most pleasant stay and a short distance to great nightlife. 
6068	3975434	10.0	10.0	19812037	I had a brief, one-night stay with Vincent when business kept me in Seattle for an extra night. He was a great host — friendly and responsive — and I found the private room in his apartment to be comfortable, quiet and very convenient to Seattle Center. Ask him about the amazing, life-changing work his nonprofit does around the world!
6069	3975434	10.0	10.0	19909638	Vincent was a great host and very considerate. He waited up to let us in because our flight arrived pretty late. The apartment is very centrally located and the room is comfortable. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we had to alter our reservation.
6070	3975434	10.0	10.0	28311657	"I really enjoyed staying at Vincent's apartment.   I came to Seattle to see my daughter (recent grad from UW) who lives very close by.  Vincent's apt is in a great location, near downtown, Lake Union, and you can see the space needle from his living room.
The room I stayed in was great.  The combination of cool Seattle air, quiet location (room faces back of apt), and comfy bed allowed me to sleep very well.
Vincent is a very friendly guy who made me feel immediately at home.  I was on the go most of my time in Seattle, but enjoyed the time I did spend at his place.   I was especially entertained by his playful cats.   Vincent has great knowledge of the city, although I already had my days planned out since I've visited Seattle many times.  "
6071	3975434	10.0	10.0	34316615	Vincent was an excellent host. I stayed at his place for 3+ weeks, while settling into Seattle, and throughly enjoyed my stay. The apartment was very spacious and very clean. There were tons of good places to eat and major transit lines within a few blocks. It is right next to Seattle center and situated in a really nice neighborhood. Vincent was accommodating, courteous and welcoming. Overall, it was a great experience and I would highly recommend staying here. 
6072	3975434	10.0	10.0	34786067	Wonderful location and cute cats. 
6073	3975434	10.0	10.0	35692684	Vincent was a fabulous host!! He was a very gracious and accommodating. The view from the apartment is amazing, and it's only a short walk to the Space Needle. There were lots of great cafes and coffee shops within walking distance as well. I'd stay here again just to stay in the super comfortable bed!! 
6074	3975434	10.0	10.0	36448418	"Vincent was a great host! He made us feel very welcomed from the first minute we arrived. The place is very beautiful and in a PERFECT location. He had everything ready for us when we arrived and we would definitely stay there again. The bed was so comfortable. 

Our interactions with Vincent definitely helped us get a feel for the culture of the city. He answered all the questions we had and got us in the right direction for exploring. We definitely recommend staying here."
6075	3975434	10.0	10.0	37401815	Vincent was a nice host. He prepared kinds of maps for traveling. I stayed there for one week. The location of apartment is convenient to take bus to downtown Seattle or walk to the Space Needle/Lake Union. Oh yeah, there are two cute cats you will like.
6076	3975434	10.0	10.0	38837077	This is a nice place to stay at a convenient location. Vincent is a great guy and very accommodating. 
6077	3975434	10.0	10.0	39792923	Vincent was a great host, he gave really detailed list of activities to do in and around Seattle, and pretty accommodating. He also at one point called to ask how we were doing on a rainy day which o thought was sincere. I would highly recommend his home for anyone looking for a really convenient neighborhood and great host.
6078	3975434	10.0	10.0	40164179	This was one of the best AirBNB locations I've ever booked. The room was exactly as described and very comfortable. Vincent was a great host, providing info on local points of interest and generally welcoming us into his home. His cats are cute and social as well. 
6079	3975434	10.0	10.0	41972484	Vincent was a great host. From the time I stepped in the door he made me feel at home in Seattle. He offers a lot of information about sightseeing and local places to eat. I would love to stay here again. Thanks Vincent!

Vincent has been a welcomed host and accommodated our need for late checkout.

Hugo and Leo, the cats, are friendly and cute. We miss them already!"
6107	5487934	10.0	10.0	40021203	Louise was a fantastic host. She was quick to respond to my emails and very easy to communicate with. She offered cereal and eggs for breakfast which was very nice. You can see views of the lake from the kitchen, living room, and outside patio. It was neat to eat breakfast and watch as some small sea planes take off and land in the water (you can't hear them at all). The bed was comfortable and I had my own bathroom. The location of her place is a short walk from Fremont or a cheap and short uber ride $5 to $10 downtown or capital hill. 
6647	1167507	10.0	10.0	4926688	we much enjoyed our stay at Thomas & Leona's, they are a warm and friendly couple, very kind and helpful. Their knowledge and advice helped us  to  navigate, & explore  the city.  The rental was exactly as advertised: clean, warm, cozy  & yet spacious. the bed was very comfortable. The full kitchen and full bath were well supplied, & immaculately clean. The apartment was centrally located, nothing was more than a 25 minute drive away.  The immediate area is  quiet, the traffic, what there was, is minimal. There is a  small  jewel of a neighborhood park close by. We would return here in a heartbeat, and will recommend it highly.
6648	1167507	10.0	10.0	5103761	"The basement apartment was comfortable and VERY clean. Leona was kind and helpful with her advice on the area, and then left us on our own to enjoy the place, which we appreciated. 

I will mention that you can hear kid/s running upstairs and the very occasional conversation, but we didn't mind either as they were not too intrusive.

The location is great for exploring (somewhat posh) Queen Anne, and there are two nearby bus-stops for hitting other parts of town. I actually found the walk downtown both doable and enjoyable, but it's not for those unaccustomed to hills. "
6649	1167507	10.0	10.0	5189488	"I reserved this rental for my parents while they visited Seattle. Says my mother: ""The apt. was cozy, comfortable, and very clean.  A great home away from home with everything that you would need.  At check in, Leona was extremely helpful and courteous.  She gave us excellent info about the neighborhood and even included some grocery ads and coupons for the local markets.  I had a couple of questions while we were there.  I texted her and she gave an immediate response.  I would highly recommend this rental."""
6650	1167507	10.0	10.0	5268914	The Queen Anne apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle! Getting to the Seattle Center was a short walk and it was also located to many grocery stores and small coffee shops. The apartment had everything we needed, from a lot of towels to a fully equipped kitchen. It really made us feel like we were living in Seattle rather than just passing by. Thomas and Leona were such gracious hosts and we hope to be back in Seattle soon!
6651	1167507	10.0	10.0	5367440	Great for 2 people - cozy, clean, quiet, well equipped.  If there are more than two in your crew, it could be a bit cramped.  If you are driving, hope  you are comfortable with steep hills ;-)

6653	1167507	10.0	10.0	6530811	We had such an amazing holiday with Thomas & Leona. The place was fantastic, extremely clean, and exactly what we were looking for. Queen Anne is the perfect location to explore Seattle, only about 7 minutes walk (with the shortcut) to the Space Needle. Leona was always very accommodating and always offering to help us out. We had the best time here. Will definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle! Thank you!
6654	1167507	10.0	10.0	6707151	We had a perfect vacation at Leona and Thomas' place. The apartment was cozy, welcoming, clean, and tastefully appointed. Ideal for two people, or possibly for a couple with one or two small children. The location is great, in a charming neighborhood within easy walking distance of lots of cafes, restaurants, and attractions. Leona was a fabulous and attentive hostess. We felt lucky to have found this place. Thank you Leona and Thomas!
6655	1167507	10.0	10.0	6795249	Thomas and Leona were terrific hosts! Their ground floor apartment was nicely appointed, quiet and extremely clean. Leona was engaging and very helpful. She even gave tips for getting around. This was our first time using Airbnb, but thanks to our great experience with Thomas and Leona, it won’t be our last. We hope to stay with them again on our next visit to Seattle.
6656	1167507	10.0	10.0	7160713	We had a great time in Seattle. The MIL was the perfect home-base for us. We walked most everywhere and then took advantage of the nearby public transportation. Apartment was great, clean and well equipped, and in a nice quiet neighborhood. Not too far from eateries, grocery, drug store etc.,  The walk to city center as directed by Leona had great views of the city. Leona was very helpful and friendly. Queen Ann has a lot of ups and downs but the bus stop at Boston and 4th was an easy walk of only a few blocks (Taylor and Galer is a climb!). No complaints, better than a hotel. Thanks so much to Leona and Thomas!
6657	1167507	10.0	10.0	7679238	Greatly enjoyed our stay here. The unit was stylishly decorated and very clean. The kitchen had a good supply of dinner ware and utensils. The hosts provided good information on nearby restaurants. Great location with beautiful view of the city just down the street. The roads leading to the house were surprisingly steep. We had planned to rent bikes and ride to the house. Took the bikes by car instead.
6658	1167507	10.0	10.0	7858868	Clean, tidy and well equipped. The neighbourhood is fantastic but you have to be in good shape or use the public transport if you don't have a car. Great place to stay in Seattle.
6659	1167507	10.0	10.0	7956737	We needed to book at the last minute in Seattle and Thomas & Leona stepped right up.  Their apartment is a wonderful place to stay and is in a gorgeous neighborhood.  Leona responded right away to our messages and had everything set for us when we checked in.  We travel to Seattle several times a year and now wish we had known of Thomas & Leona's place before.  
6660	1167507	10.0	10.0	8139481	"We had a lovely time in Seattle, Tom and Leona's apartment looked just like the pictures, and was very clean.  They were very friendly and organized, and quickly replied to any questions we had.  I would only caution that the pull out sofa was not very comfortable. 

The location was close to all the attractions we wanted to go to, we had bought the Seattle City Pass.  We rented a car and were happy we did, there are a lot of hills in the area and it would have been difficult to walk especially with the kids. 

Thanks for having us!"
6661	1167507	10.0	10.0	8422301	Thomas & Leona's Mother-In-Law was clean, quiet, and well-organized, and they were gracious enough to host us last-minute!  The location is excellent. We had a great time exploring the lovely neighborhood and beyond.
6662	1167507	10.0	10.0	8529827	Such a wonderful place to stay. Just the right amount of space for a vacation or weekend getaway. Easy access to bus stops and just a short walk from Queen Anne's shops and restaurants, not to mention close to one of the best views of Seattle. Highly recommended!
6663	1167507	10.0	10.0	13419543	I cannot say enough good things about Thomas and Leona's rental. Everything was more than adequate for our needs. Their neighborhood is beautiful, very quiet, and easily accessible to restaurants and bus routes (we took bus 4 most of the time). They gave us great directions for our arrival, and they have a binder prepared with everything we needed as far as bus maps, restaurant suggestions, emergency info, etc. The living room is comfortable and cozy, and the kitchen was well equipped which allowed us to prepare many meals there. The bed is very comfortable with plenty of blankets and pillows. The weather was a little chilly for us Californians, so we took advantage of the heater they provided.  It was a perfect place for us, thank you, Thomas and Leona! 
6664	1167507	10.0	10.0	14129679	"Experience was wonderful.  Thomas and Leona were helpful and always responsive via text messaging.  I was in town with family and needed a getaway place...this was absolutely wonderful.  Close proximity to everything.  One of the biggest perks was the parking right in front of the apartment; for those who are not familiar with Seattle and you are driving, parking can be one of your worst nightmares.  The apartment stayed very cool, which is another Seattle element, very few (if any) locations will have AC. 

Overall, wonderful time and wonderful hosts.  It provided me a chance to get away and not be bothered by anyone.  Leona was certainly available via text, but as a true introvert, the lack of intrusion was just what I needed.  I also had the WONDERFUL surprise of coming back to cherries one night.  Thank you so much! "
6665	1167507	10.0	10.0	14282682	We loved this adorable Queen Anne Mother-In-Law!  We were celebrating our son's graduation from Seattle Pacific University and the location of this place was perfect.  Although we wish we had known about this MIL when our son was a freshman, we definitely plan to stay here for any future travel.  The hosts left us a note that we can stay pass check-out time (1:00pm) since nobody was checking in on that day.  We thought that was extra kind of them.  We would highly recommend this rental unit!
6666	1167507	10.0	10.0	15593061	Thomas and Leona were great hosts. The instructions for check in we're very clear and thorough. Their place was so comfortable and cozy. We had everything we needed for our stay! Plenty of towels, fully equipped kitchen so we could make our own meals, and a comfortable bed. I loved the attention to detail. There was a folder with lots of information and interesting facts about the area, as well as brochures about things to do in nearby Fremont. We will definitely be staying here again!
6667	1167507	10.0	10.0	15818523	We had an excellent stay. The location was great, the apartment had everything you would need for a great stay and was very clean. When you consider the location and off street parking included it was a great value.  The hosts were accommodating to late check in and were extremely responsive to any questions or needs we had. Which was really not much as they had everything in place including an ice pack in the freezer to use in your cooler, umbrellas (we lucked out and did not have to use) and great instructions and information on the area.  The Queen Anne neighborhood was great - it has everything you need (restaurants, Grocery, bakery, etc) along with parka with great views (don't miss Kerry Park).  It is also strategically located near Space Needle, Chihuly Glass Garden, Pikes Place Market and Lake Union. 
6668	1167507	10.0	10.0	16198773	We needed a place nearby Key Arena for the weekend and the MIL was perfect for our needs! I primarily dealt with Leona, and she was very available and friendly. Whenever an issue would arise, she was quick to respond and remedy the problem with minimal trouble. The price beat anywhere else nearby and we were all very comfortable and enjoyed our stay thoroughly. If I need a place to stay in Seattle again, this will absolutely be the first place I look. 
6669	1167507	10.0	10.0	16421617	"We had a great stay at Leona and Thomas' beautiful MIL suite in the gorgeous Queen Anne section of Seattle. We arrived very early in the morning so the keybox approach for entry was perfect. The apartment contained everything we needed for our short stay and we have no problems whatsoever.  We would definitely recommend their place highly and would stay there anytime we could. We loved Seattle.
"
6670	1167507	10.0	10.0	16616088	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apt. is comfortable and clean and in a GREAT location.  Nice walk, or easy cab ride ($10) to most anywhere in the City ~ not far from downtown.  Just big enough for the 3 of us, my husband and teenage daughter and me. Close to yummy coffee shop and restaurants by taking a nice stroll in the n'hood. Nice and private. Great host can be contacted if / when you need.  The Queen Anne neighborhood charming architecture and fabulous views of the City of Seattle make for a perfect stay.  We would absolutely stay there again!  
6671	1167507	10.0	10.0	17498276	"I booked the Mother-In-Law suite for my father as well as my older aunt and uncle for two weeks when they were visiting Seattle for my wedding. My younger brother also joined them for part of the stay. Thomas and Leona were extremely communicative throughout the booking process and during the stay. They graciously offered to perform a complimentary cleaning midway through the stay, and having laundry facilities was very beneficial as well.

The neighborhood is great, as it was a 5min walk from our wedding venue and there's a Safeway nearby. It's very easy to get downtown for all of the touristy sites, and the parking spot was awesome as they rented a car to get around to destinations slightly out of the city.

I asked my relatives what they thought, and my dad says ""yes we liked the place and we would like to recommend it to others"". My younger brother said ""Although its a little small for 4 people the AirBnB is at a great location with a Safeway not too far away."" (We were definitely aware of the size before we booked.)

They had a great time staying and the location was so convenient. Thanks!"
6672	1167507	10.0	10.0	17937044	Enjoyed our stay. It was clean, comfortable, and had plenty of towels and hot water. Location was perfect. Would stay here again. 
6673	1167507	10.0	10.0	19024056	This place was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It was very cozy and clean. It is near bus lines 3 & 4 which will take you downtown. Upon (email hidden), Thomas and Leona provided brochures and maps of Seattle and it's many attractions. They provide umbrellas and shopping bags for your stay as well. Also, Thomas and Leona provide a folder which gives you all the information you need to stay at their place (wifi instructions, trash instructions, hot spots near by, grocery stores nearby, restaurants nearby, etc.) There is a parking spot available in the drive way. This location is near VERY steep hills. You will hear footsteps and voices on the floor above you when you stay here. 9/10. Would book again. 
6674	1167507	10.0	10.0	19530202	"The description of the MIL apt. is exactly how it was described in AIRBNB.....warm and cozy, quiet and located in a very nice, private neighborhood and only walking distance to the numerous Seattle tourist sites.  The apt. is very clean and it has everything you'll need when you're in a home away from home.  It has a great view of the city and the lake while walking down hill from the apt. to get to the city.  There are plenty of information pamphlets about the area available for the guests which is very helpful for newcomers like us. I would definitely stay here again when I return to Seattle to visit my son.
"
6675	1167507	10.0	10.0	19836640	I found the place to be clean and convenient. It's nicely located, as long as you don't mind walking up and down big hills. Very quiet and peaceful. Didn't get a chance to meet my hosts, though they were very gracious and quickly responded to my messages. Would definitely recommend.
6676	1167507	10.0	10.0	20573177	My friend and I had such a great stay at Thomas and Leona's lovely home.  Leona was apologetic because there was some construction going on when we arrived, and went above and beyond making up for it by leaving us a sweet note, fruit, vegetables, and a bottle of wine.   That was so unnecessary, as the work being done didn't bother us one bit, but we really appreciated the gesture and definitely made us feel welcome.  The neighborhood was gorgeous...better than we expected...super convenient if you're comfortable taking the bus around (which we were).   We loved it so much, and would definitely stay there again! 
6677	1167507	10.0	10.0	20878932	"Communication ahead of time was great. The space was very clean, furniture was nice. All in all a lovely place to stay. 

Great location, too. Quick walk to the Queen Anne ""village center"" and good connections to the city. "
6678	1167507	10.0	10.0	24602451	Our hosts were very responsive to any questions or concerns we had regarding our stay. Anything we needed was immediately taken care of. The accommodations were very clean, and looked as advertised. The queen bed was comfortable, and there were plenty of additional blankets should those be needed. We appreciated their thoughtful appointments (such as a hairdryer in the bathroom and coffee filters for the coffee maker). I would recommend this to anyone!
6679	1167507	10.0	10.0	25824018	"Thomas and Leona were gracious hosts, starting with the first few minutes after my arrival when the power went out in the neighbourhood! Leona quickly came downstairs to provide me with flashlights and a candle and even offered me to use their kitchen upstairs if I needed to heat anything up (b/c this apartment's kitchen runs on electricity).

The apartment space is great, and basically everything you'd need for a short or long-term stay. Clean, comfortable bed, couches, etc. It's nice. 

The location is also pretty great. Prepare to walk up a couple hills if you're going to or from the nearby restaurants, but there's an endless list of delicious places to eat and drink in Queen Anne and Lower Queen Anne. It's also a relatively easy walk to the Seattle Center (Space Needle). Most days, I'd walk down the hill to wherever I was eating, then take a Lyft back to the apartment for a few bucks because I was lazy.

Extra plus for those with a car: Off-street parking. 

My only nitpick, and this is not a criticism of the apartment at all, just a personal thing that I'd like to make others aware of: This apartment is not for really tall people (after all, it is a basement apartment!). I'm 6'3"" (190cm), and I was nearly grazing my head on the main doorway, ceiling beams, etc. I bonked my head on a light next to the bed when I was getting up from plugging something into the nearby electrical outlet. Also, the foot of the bedframe doesn't allow you to hang your feet off the end, so if you're 6'5"" or taller and don't sleep in the fetal position, you will feel confined. Again, this isn't intended as a slight against the apartment, it's just #tallpeopleproblems. Just want to make people aware in case there are any 7 footers looking to stay here :)"
6680	1167507	10.0	10.0	28078123	I felt immediately welcomed - Leona was there to show me the ropes, and there were even fresh flowers on the table for me.  Nice neighborhood though I usually took Lyft ride back at end of day because the hill was so steep (down was fine - up was rough).  The apartment was clean, comfortable, and quiet. 
6681	1167507	10.0	10.0	28488330	Tom and Leona were very responsive throughout all of our communications. They made it very easy to check in and check out. The MIL is small, but a good size for a small family. The kitchen wares were a plus and a minus: the pots and pans are really good, but the cooking utensils were not very good--pieces of plastic floated off into our food as we were cooking. They included disposable chopsticks, so we were still able to cook! A lovely and comfortable stay in a beautiful neighborhood. If you get the chance, you should definitely walk around that area!
6682	1167507	10.0	10.0	28752265	"The stay in Thomas and Leona's MIL unit was fantastic. My friend and I had an excellent time and we're actually disappointed that we didn't book for a couple more days. The unit had everything you need for a short, mid or longer term stay - comfortable bed, clean bathroom, well-equipped lounge room, and a small but certainly adequate kitchen. The hosts also provide plenty of helpful information about both the unit and Seattle itself. 

The neighbourhood is quiet, safe and a useful base for exploring surrounding areas or downtown Seattle. Queen Anne is quite hilly, but there's always the cheap option of Uber and Lyft if you don't feel like the walk back up the hills after going out to a bar or restaurant. 

We'd both definitely stay again."
6683	1167507	10.0	10.0	29761278	"If you are staying in Seattle as a tourist, you cannot go wrong with this listing. There is no better location than the wonderful Queen Anne neighborhood. Just walk the length of Bigelow Avenue and you'll see truly beautiful residential  architecture.  

The area has wonderful restaurants within walking distance and is a bus-ride or downhill walk (about 40 min.) to downtown. 

Returning home its a $10 taxi fare.

6686	1167507	10.0	10.0	34525431	"Owners communicated and there very responsive.  We were informed by way of a note that there would be neighborhood garage sales on a Saturday that we were staying there and it would be busy.  We strolled through the street that had some garage sales and had a good time.  The unit offers a parking spot, so parking was not a problem.  This was a great bonus!  We loved the Queen Anne neighborhood filled with big, stately homes and mature trees.  We were thankful to have a rental car as we explored downtown Seattle and the surrounding areas and had a short time in which to see a lot.

The kitchen had all the utensils and dishes that we needed for breakfast.  There was a also some oil, sugar, salt and pepper that was very useful to have. The bathroom is on the small side, especially the sink.  The bed is quite comfortable.  It was nice to have a hairdryer in the bathroom.

The unit is super clean and cozy!

We were warned about some creaking stairs and some walking above us, but some nights it was more than we would have liked and it went past 10 pm and early am.

There is another door/window to owner's unit once you enter it. This area is not very private as it is visible both ways."
6687	1167507	10.0	10.0	35290320	Thomas and Leona were fantastic hosts. We stayed in the apartment underneath their house and it was the perfect size for 4 friends over 5 days. Thomas and Leona were gracious enough to have given us a ton of information on the neighborhood we were staying in, how to get around Seattle, and Seattle in general. Their home is located in a beautiful area with amazing views of the city. I would definitely recommend staying in this beautiful house during your trip to Seattle.

Leona was welcoming and generous. We arrived late on Sunday night and we asked for a cup of milk for tea. She gave us a carton of milk, fruit, eggs so we could have a snack. That made a huge difference given we didn't have a car to shop and had been on a long flight. 

Leona was responsive to every request. And at the same time left us alone to enjoy our stay. It was a little hot and we walked up the steep hill from Queen Anne every day so we asked if there was a fan. Leona said she didn't have one as the flat is cool. We came home to find a new fan waiting for us. They were also happy for us to have a late check out. Very flexible and friendly hosts.

The flat is small (cosy for two as the description says) and was fine for two adult friends. Please do note that the bedroom is separated from the rest of the flat by a curtain, it isn't actually a separate bedroom.  The bed is comfy, and there is a sofa bed which is not so comfy for us as two older women. 

The kitchen has all you need, and importantly there is an excellent shower. 

Thanks Leona and family

Tom and Leona were wonderful hosts! They are very organized and left clear and simple instructions all around the room to ensure the place was kept clean and undamaged. For example, I liked the note to take our shoes off while inside the room (which I usually do in my own house) so I felt more peace of mind while walking barefoot around the place, relieved that the floors were clean and dirt-free. 

They kindly provided some nice pamphlets on Seattle sightseeing on the coffee table as well as in the very informative binder where it contained the WiFi login info. The living room and bedroom nook was exactly as the pictures described, and the place was cozy and tidy. I liked the double shower heads, that was really nice! All the essentials were provided: dishes, towels, appliances and cookware... they even had some new bottled waters chilled in the fridge, small shampoo samplers, caramel melts for the pancake mix, and extra blankets. Everything was well maintained, clean and operational. There was a neat convection oven which we used to toast waffles.

The living room area was fairly spacious with two very comfortable couches, plenty of windows for ventilation, and a small electric fan (we used it as it was a particularly hot week!). There were even board games and a cute mini bingo cage, though we had plenty to do while in this beautiful city! The bed was very large and comfortable, and since we were staying around a week, we were allowed access to the laundry.

Tom and Leona were always very friendly and helpful to us whenever we happened to see each other while waiting outside for the Uber. Leona even gave us clear instructions on where to find the ""secret stairs"" that led straight down to the Key Arena--it was very fast and saved us a lot on taking Uber everyday! She also informed us of where the closest convenience stores were located. The whole neighborhood felt very safe and quiet!

Wonderful time, wonderful hosts! I hope we can stay here next year!"
6698	1167507	10.0	10.0	43069220	Great location and very clean!

The neighborhood was quiet and close to downtown, with plenty of free parking spots on the street.
Leona and Tom was wonderful hosts: everything was perfectly organized, and they have been always very kind and helpful.
When I'll come back to Seattle (a great city), I will definitely choose their place again."
6700	1167507	10.0	10.0	44533398	The MIL is in a lovely historical neighborhood. We met Tom when we checked in and he was very helpful in introducing us to the neighbourhood and orienting us. There are great coffee shops and grocery stores near by. The kitchen is fully equipped and we made ourselves breakfast a few mornings. We enjoyed our walk to Kerry park and space needle. Getting to downtown was a short Uber ride. I would definitely stay again if I visit Seattle again.
6701	1167507	10.0	10.0	45251693	My friend and I stayed in this MIL for a few days while taking in the Seattle sights. Space was very clean, comfortable and spacious. Appreciated the fully equipped kitchen. Location is in a quiet neighborhood away from the city bustle – but only 2-3 miles from downtown and the highway. Neighborhood is Upper Queen Anne, so you’re going to drive up a couple of steep hills to reach the house (I’m a Florida girl so that was interesting , ha). But it was easy to find. Hosts were very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend.   
6702	1167507	10.0	10.0	46284743	Thomas and Leona were extremely welcoming.  Their space had everything laid out and provided all needs for a kitchen, as well as providing information for around the area. They were also quite accommodating of all requests (which were minimal).
6703	1167507	10.0	10.0	46639718	It's a pretty nice stay in a great location to view Seattle on a hill. The room is even better than the photos, really beautiful, clean and cozy. The neighborhood is also one of the best in Seattle. I will definitely come back to have a stay again. A++.
6704	1167507	10.0	10.0	47157373	My brother and I enjoyed our stay in the MIL suite. The pictures do not do this place justice-felt roomy enough for two people. The Queen Anne neighborhood has some great options for food and coffee, yet downtown is within minutes. Loved the proximity to Kerry park and all the great views. We didn't want to leave! Will recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle.
6705	1167507	10.0	10.0	48092435	"This is a wonderful location and the MIL suite
as well as the grounds are immaculate.  The views from the neighborhood are stunning.  Is was a short, albeit steep, walk to Seattle Center and the restaurants of Queen Anne Blvd.  Leona was kind enough to let us use the dryer when we came home soaked to the skin from a rainy day even though we weren't there the required 7 days.  "
6706	1167507	10.0	10.0	51059138	"Thomas and Leona have a wonderful apartment in an awesome location! It's in a very quiet and beautiful neighborhood (Queen Anne) and close to everything. I stayed there for two weeks while I was in town and they are fully equipped with kitchen and laundry (for those staying long term) which made my stay as smooth as possible. Street parking was easy any time of day or night.  

They are gracious hosts and I would definitely choose to stay here again. I highly recommend considering this place when visiting Seattle!"

I enjoyed being able to cook for myself, as well as the proximity to the U-district and 45th for restaurants and take-out. Would gladly stay here again.
7844	4384343	10.0	10.0	22614546	Carrie answered all my questions and made sure our stay was comfortable.  I liked the fact that it had a private entry.  Carrie's place was very cute, super clean and had everything you needed (living room area, private bath, kitchen, bedroom and it even had a washer and dryer.  We took the light rail to downtown and the bus to her place and dropped us off less than a block away from her place.  Area was very cute and close to bus stops and Univ of WA.  We will definitely book again when we return to Seattle.  
7845	4384343	10.0	10.0	28049302	"Carrie's rental space was ideal for my stay in Seattle.  Upon arrival we did a walk through of the apartment and she familiarized me with everything I needed to know during my stay.  She made herself available for any little extras I inquired about. The apartment is clean, well laid out, comfortable, and centrally located for access to UW or downtown Seattle.  

There were fresh flowers upon my arrival which was a nice touch.  She even asked for any suggestions on making the stay for future guests (which may well include myself!) enjoyable.  I would recommend this property for a single traveler or couple. "
7846	4384343	10.0	10.0	28321643	"I came to Seattle with a friend for a wedding and wasn't disappointed by Carrie's apartment! The space is absolutely beautiful: very well-maintained, impeccably decorated and light, despite being in the basement. The neighborhood is great too, just a short walk to many coffee shops, bars and restaurants.

Carrie was very communicative before and during our stay. We had the opportunity to meet her and she was lovely -- and even came through with a safety pin for last-minute dress alterations. I'd highly recommend this place!"
7847	4384343	10.0	10.0	29761739	Carrie's space was awesome! Exactly as pictured, it was quiet and cozy, and had everything we needed for our stay. Carrie made the check-in process extremely easy, and was available for any questions we had, too. Would definitely stay here again!

7849	4384343	10.0	10.0	32995257	Chic is right; this semi-subterranean apartment is elegantly outfitted and immaculate.  Carrie was a pleasure to talk to, responsive, flexible, eager to make improvements, and very respectful of our privacy.  Entry is via a garage door keypad so coming and going is easy.  The location is choice - quiet and within easy walking distance to one of the hippest streets in town.  We drove, and only once did we have to park more than a 30sec walk away.  Definitely recommended.
7850	4384343	10.0	10.0	34073067	Carries apartment is wonderful from the chic design to the very comfortable queen bed.  The kitchen is very functional with all the comforts of home. The photos, description, and reviews are accurate.   What stands out is Carries caring hospitality.  What a gem she is.  When we return I'd love to take her up on the gin and tonic she offered me - and I'll bring the gin!
7851	4384343	10.0	10.0	34328527	Nice and beautiful host. Welcoming us at 22:00 pm. Clean and quiet place for stay. Everything is prepared. And also you can just park before the house. It's safety!  I've already introduced it to my friends! Thank you so much Carrie .
7852	4384343	10.0	10.0	35567873	Carrie was really friendly and flexible, and eager to provide a comfortable experience for us. She was super easy to communicate with and even after checking out of the apartment, she made sure to let me know that I had left behind a treasured bracelet! Really appreciated her letting me know and she made it easy for me to retrieve it. The place was exactly as pictured and provides access to so many other great Seattle neighborhoods (we walked and took the bus everywhere)! Highly recommend for your next Seattle trip 
7853	4384343	10.0	10.0	35953302	Carrie was very nice and accommodating.  Her place was comfortable and clean, which was exactly what we were looking for. I would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in Seattle again. 
7854	4384343	10.0	10.0	36290067	Carrie was a great host and very hospitable.  She even picked me and my husband up from the train stop once we arrived!  The place was exactly as pictured and in a lovely neighborhood.  We were walking distance to several restaurants and ice cream shops.  We talked to some locals and when we told them where we were staying, they raved about Molly Moons and The Whale Wins.We used Uber to navigate the city and were 10-20 minutes to downtown depending upon traffic.
7855	4384343	10.0	10.0	37836760	Everything was a described. Unfortunately, I left early and arrive back late so little time to interact with Carrie.  However, she did offer me a welcoming gin & tonic that was much appreciated and she printed out my boarding passes when I left.
7856	4384343	10.0	10.0	39908852	Carrie was very sweet and accommodating. The basement apartment was nothing less than amazing great! Located in a quiet street and in a beautiful neighborhood. Also close proximity to bus 26, that goes to downtown. The apartment has a very comfortable bedroom, and very high standard of bathrooms and kitchens. A great place and stay! Recommended! Thank your Carrie!

An all around positive and great experience. Thank you Carrie!
7858	4384343	10.0	10.0	41597689	"     Carrie's chic apartment was a perfect place for me to spend a week visiting family in Seattle. It is very bright, fresh and clean.  Everything seemed new.  It has everything needed for a comfortable stay, including a large bedroom with a super comfortable bed and a bathroom comparable to that of a luxury hotel.
     There was a heat advisory the week I stayed with Carrie, but the apartment was comfortably cool even in the hottest part of the afternoon. This apartment is ""cool"" in every sense of the word!
     The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  On-street parking was never a problem.  Restaurants, coffee shops and other amenities are not far away.
     Carrie is the perfect hostess.  She gave me all the information I needed, and it was plain to see that she genuinely wanted me to enjoy my stay.
     So long as my sons live in Seattle, Carrie's apartment is the first place I will try to book whenever I go to visit.  Thanks for everything Carrie!"
7859	4384343	10.0	10.0	42297354	Our best experience to date. Carrie was a delightful host, our apartment was beautiful, clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed, the bus was a three minute walk and took us right to the centre of town and also to the train station, the supermarket a few more blocks away. The area was a quiet suburban street but only a fifteen minute bus trip to everything. Thanks Carrie, so friendly  and welcoming, you absolutely made our stay in Seattle perfect. 
7860	4384343	10.0	10.0	43225590	Carrie was immediately responsive to e-mail questions and very easy to get hold of.  We loved this location; just outside the bustle of the city, but walking distance to great coffee shops and restaurants.  We found we were never more than 3 miles from wherever we wanted to go.  The place met the description, quiet clean and very comfortable.  
7861	4384343	10.0	10.0	44651791	"I didn't realize I only had a limited time to write a review and as we are still travelling I had put it off until getting notice that today was my last chance! This was our very first AirBnB experience, and it exceeded our expectations!  I have even more positive memories from our stay after having a couple other less-than-up-to-expectations.

Carrie's place was clean and inviting and beautiful!  Everything we could think to need was provided, and she even brought us coffee for our first morning!  

It is as pictured, and the new purple area rug is lovely to walk on and the bathroom even has heated floors! We enjoyed time spent in the neighborhood, and out in the garden watching the world go by as well. We even caught a bus downtown and back, another first for these inexperienced in public transportation.

I have only good recommendations for Carrie's place, we would stay there again if ever back this way!"
7862	4384343	10.0	10.0	45107165	This was an incredible Bnb! The location was phenomenal for us and I truly suggest it. The space was perfect for a couple and very light and bring despite being a downstairs location. It was incredible that there is a full size kitchen available in the unit - which is really a game changer for some of us out there. Everything we could have needed was available to us and Carrie was easy to get a hold of when we needed her. I absolutely recommend this Bnb and will be back soon! (PS the design in the unit is incredible. So classy and modern!)
7863	4384343	10.0	10.0	45666461	Carrie's place was so wonderful!  The pictures are very accurate, but my wife and I agree it's even better in person.  The bathroom was big and immaculate which my wife loved.  We love her style and how her basement apartment was furnished.  And we never felt like we were in a basement as the windows allowed enough light in and played well with her choice of decor.  Carrie was very accommodating for our check-in as we ended up arriving a little later than we initially agreed upon.  We loved having a full kitchen available allowing us to cook breakfast each morning.  Her location is in a cute, quiet neighborhood w/ a nice coffee shop a few blocks away.  She's also very convenient to the Burke-Gilman bike trail which we took advantage of.  Overall a very memorable stay thanks to Carrie's place.  We could see ourselves living there which is always our measuring stick and definitely would love to come back!

7866	4384343	10.0	10.0	50551116	Awesome apartment! It was comfortable and clean. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to make a simple breakfast for the days that wanted to stay in.  Check-in/out was easy--Carrie was very accommodating to our schedule. She was also very responsive to all of the questions and concerns we had during our stay. The bathroom was our favorite feature of this cute little unit. Nothing beats coming home from a day of sight-seeing and stepping out of the shower onto heated floors! All-in-all, we'd most definitely recommend staying here
7867	4384343	10.0	10.0	51147167	This was our first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have been a better one. Carrie is a wonderful host, she was very accommodating to our schedule (as far as check in and out), checked on us through out the stay to make sure we were comfortable and gave us recommendations on restaurants in Seattle.  The apartment is super clean, nicely decorated and it has everything you would need (kitchen utensils, towels, shampoo, soap, blow dryer, iron and iron board, etc) the location of the apartment is perfect, there are coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance, and all the major attractions are a 10-15 min drive. We rented a car and found it fairly easy to find parking on the street. Overall it was a great stay and would definitely recommend it!

Carrie is a wonderful host and made sure that I had a perfect stay. She is very kind and hospitable and helped me a lot with all kinds of things. She accommodated to my schedule regarding check in and check out and was very responsive when I had any question . 

The apartment is beautifully decorated, very spacious and well equipped. I was cooking almost every evening and had everything that I needed. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is great, with a nice and large shower and heated floors.

The apartment is conveniently located. Buses downtown and to the university are close, the Burke Gilman bike trail is 5 min away. Furthermore, there are nice restaurants and coffee shops around. I also had a rental car and always found a parking spot closeby.

All in all, I had a great time and can very much recommend staying in Carrie's apartment."

Though we didn't meet Kymber in person but we were welcomed with a gift ( thanks again). She left a detailed instruction for the house and neighborhood. The house is close to all the attractions we planned to go and also has parks nearby for my two years old to run around. It is tastefully decorated and has a state of art kitchen and remodeled bathrooms. The neighbors are really nice too. We were even invited to a beer night with them. The two cats are easygoing and my daughter enjoyed watching them. 

We had a great time and will definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle to visit. Thank you for everything, Kymber and family!

A couple days, we ventured a mile to Green lake and mighty-o donuts (right next to Tangletown brewery). The price at this location is great! Also, we have a 1 year-old and Elizabeth graciously let us borrow a pack n play crib, toys, VHS tapes, and a high chair. It was such a relaxing trip. We will definitely book again. Thanks!

I recently relocated to Seattle and decided to use AirBnB to spend a couple months living in different neighborhoods while looking for a permanent place.

The apartment is exactly as described and the pictures are very accurate. It is a very comfortable and warm feeling place. It felt like coming home after a long day at work. The kitchen is wonderful, it is fully furnished and has a gas stove. I was able to easily make christmas dinner for my girlfriend and I. It comes with nice quality pots and pans and everything you need as a cook. There is also access to a washer & dryer which was very nice.

Elizabeth says she prefers longer-term renter. It's a perfect place for a professional in town temporarily, say a guest lecturer at UW or someone relocating to Seattle for work.

She was very upfront about the fact that she has two small children and the noise from upstairs might be excessive. It honestly was not that bad and didn't start until midmorning. As someone who is an early riser this never was an issue.  

I would highly recommend a stay here!"
8871	3626162	10.0	10.0	25398481	"Since I extended my stay I guess I get two reviews. Since I already commented on how wonderful the apartment was. I'll mention the neighborhood.

It's in a very easy to navigate walkable neighborhood. Grocery store is maybe four blocks away. Forty-fifth street is a little more than a block and is a long stretch of a walkable street with many very good restaurants. There's an Afghani place that's great and a number of Japanese noodle bowl places that are also very good. Uptown Espresso is less than two blocks away and makes great espresso (I only drink espresso so I can't vouch for the lattes.)

About six or eight blocks south you are at Gas Works Park on the Northern side of Lake Union. Also it's only about a twenty minute walk to Downtown Fremont (maybe 30 depending on your pace).

Bus access is very good with dependable routes within just a few blocks in all directions."

8874	3626162	10.0	10.0	27276226	Elizabeth's place was perfect for my needs.  Close to my new grandbaby!  On-street parking and laundry were plusses.  I manages to lose my key plus lock myself out - both of which Elizabeth and her husband remedied without complaint.  I would/will stay here again.

8882	3626162	10.0	10.0	35661549	My family wished we had more than a few days to spend at Elizabeth's comfy apartment. The place is as described; between the great book and game selection, the full kitchen, the comfy furniture, and the great restaurants nearby, it was the perfect haven for us.
8883	3626162	10.0	10.0	36115844	After several telephone calls with Host, we felt comfortable renting apartment. Our arrival was after midnight which darkness created a different problem. We had a little trouble finding address, but nice neighbor helped us locate apartment. Once inside everything was found as described. Host had informed us She would be out of town until our last day,and we would meet up then. Rooms were large with full kitchen, nice living room , and bedroom in the back. Bathroom was spacious with plenty of room. We met Host and her family on 3rd day. Was invited to dinner but had to graciously refuse as we had plans for the evening. We had a nice visit with our Nephew and his family and even attended  Seattle vs Kansas City Baseball Game. This Apartment provided us with the perfect location to see the City of Seattle and Visit with our Nephew. 
8884	3626162	10.0	10.0	36690110	"Absolutely loved this apartment! I stayed there for three nights with my parents, and they couldn't stop raving about what a great place (and deal!) it was.

Key points:
+ very spacious, comfortable, and homey, with everything you could possibly need
+ close to the university area, but in a quieter residential neighborhood
+ nice and cool—no A/C necessary, even when the temperature was over 90º
+ although I didn't get a chance to meet Elizabeth in person, it was easy to communicate with her, and she was flexible in accommodating our late-night arrival
+ much cheaper than hotels in the downtown area

Overall, a wonderful stay. We would definitely look into staying here again if we're in Seattle in the future!"
8885	3626162	10.0	10.0	41308757	Elizabeth and her lovely family was very welcoming and  made our stay to a wonderful time. We stayed for almost six weeks and had a great time. The description of the house was perfect, and it was clean and comfortable. We liked the opportunity to have a full kitchen. The location was perfect for us: walking distance to University of Washington, to Gas Works Park and to Green lake, and easy to take the bus to downtown, to the Monorail or the Ferries. It was also easy to park on the street. The garden was great for our children to play in and for us to relax in. We would like to stay here again! 
8886	3626162	10.0	10.0	43068312	Elizabeth's private apartment was spacious and homey. We loved staying in her apartment, and her family was very welcoming! She left plenty of guidebooks and information around that made our stay in Seattle perfect. Thanks, Elizabeth! Hopefully, we'll get to stay at your place again in the future!
8887	3626162	10.0	10.0	43573297	We were greeted upon arrival by Elizabeth and her darling children, who showed us around the space and gave tips for enjoying the neighborhood. This was a great apartment, with everything we needed and in an ideal location- easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go. We mostly used it as home base while we explored Seattle, so were gone most of the days. The apartment is very homey and full of personal touches- tons of books, movies, games. The weather was quite warm while we were there, but since it's a bottom floor apartment it stayed nice and cool and we got a great breeze through the open windows. The bed was unbelievably comfortable.
8888	3626162	10.0	10.0	45372585	This was a great place for my friends and I to stay. It was much larger then the photos made it seem. Elizabeth wad very friendly and helpful with all the questions we had. Location worked out really great by being able to walk to both food and public transportation. I would definitely stay here again.
8889	3626162	10.0	10.0	47694518	"The Wallingford haven was a tremendous place to stay. I recommend it without any hesitation!!

I was in town with two colleagues for a conference at UWashington, which is a relaxing 20 minute walk from Elizabeth's place. The house was a perfect place to relax, with comfortable beds, nice sofas, a full kitchen, a nice shower, lots of books to read, etc. It was big enough for a small family, which meant it was much larger than we needed, but we enjoyed it! I couldn't say enough good things about the place. It's exactly as described, and more. 

Planning to stay here again when I come back to Seattle!"
8890	3626162	10.0	10.0	50671314	The room is very big and clean, with two cozy queen-size beds which can actually easily host 4 people. Many many tools in the kitchen, no need to worry, because anything needed can be found. Elizabeth made the guest area kind of separated from their living area, which provides privacy. Wallingford is a quiet but amazing neighborhood - 2 minutes walk to Domino's, 5 minutes to QFC, Drugstore, Japanese restaurant, Dick's drive-in and so much more. Bus 44 goes directly into UW campus, even if it's only about 25 minutes walk. 
8891	3626162	10.0	10.0	51338036	My family so enjoyed staying at Elizabeth's place in Wallingford. As per a few of the other reviews here, the space is actually much larger than it appears in pictures. With five of us hanging out during the day, we had plenty of space and were amply comfortable. The kitchen was well-stocked with pots & pans & everything else for making meals. My husband and I slept well in the cozy private bedroom, and our son slept great out in the shared living space. Hot showers. Lots of natural light. Easy access to wifi in the house. A number of great VHS tapes to watch. :) We had a wonderful time. Thanks so much, Elizabeth. This is a great spot for our family. We will be back! 
8892	3626162	10.0	10.0	54506237	Elizabeth's apartment suite was lovely. The bed is very comfortable and the pictures don't do the space justice. It really opens up when you step in. Natural light does get in plentiful as well, as it is a walkout basement. Convenient to many restaurants and activities on 45th. I recommend Westward just down Sunnyside toward the Lake. Great spot for dinner and drinks. Would stay here again, lovely home!
8893	3626162	10.0	10.0	58138366	Elizabeth is awsome host and her husband and childs are kind. She trys to accomodate us and respects our privacy. I and my boyfriend stayed more than a month. In the house, there is everything you need such as plate, spoons and coffee and tea. We had a great time staying this beautiful house. I think this house is the best house near this neighborhood. Thank you for your hosting.

Pretty sure they're the kind of hosts that will let you dictate the level of personal interaction you're most comfortable with.  They've struck the perfect balance between giving their guests space and privacy while at the same time being incredibly  accommodating, responsive and easy to communicate with. I booked last minute and they had the place ready within hours. I loved the space- it was stylishly decorated, comfortable and very conveniently located. Right next to a park and walking distance to all the amenities that Wallingford has to offer.
I was traveling with my toddler, and when I was trying to check out, I realized my cellphone was missing. While frantically searching for my cellphone, Jason was kind enough to call it for me and a man answered saying he'd found it in the street. So, while I tended to my toddlers needs he DROVE TO PICK MY PHONE UP FOR ME!!! Not only were they amazing hosts, the space was perfect. I'll definitely stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone. "
9945	6707735	10.0	10.0	34826494	James and Carolyn were lovely and gracious hosts. They even came back early to let us in and volunteered to help with luggage. 
9946	6707735	10.0	10.0	35031359	"Though my boyfriend and I did not get a chance to meet Carolyn & James in person, the basement apartment was so comfortable and charming we felt we got a good sense of their personalities. 
There was great art on the walls, a wonderful book collection and fresh eggs from their yard hens in the fridge! (Along with a sweet note to please enjoy.) My bf & I were completely charmed and we hope to return and stay longer.
The apt was clean, neat and hospitable. The table was set and there were all the dishes, pots, pans and silverware we could have possibly needed. Carolyn responded quickly and efficiently and the check-in & out process was a breeze.
The apartment is in a great neighborhood called Wallingford that is nearby tons of options for food, coffee, movies, groceries, chocolate, sushi, you name it! Yet, it still has a clean, small-town feel to it. 
Great neighborhood, stylish spot, perfect hosts and right price!"
9947	6707735	10.0	10.0	35161133	"Charming doesn't do this apartment justice.  So cozy...artsy...super quiet neighborhood in the heart of Wallingford.  Very close to everything you could imagine....and....a magical gift of eggs from their very own hens were waiting for us in the fridge.   Bed was very comfortable....great nights sleep after a busy day in Seattle.  Very quiet....cute kitchen.....darling breakfast nook....just the right size for us.   I will come back again for sure!

9948	6707735	10.0	10.0	35595217	"My in-laws came to town and needed a place to stay, but here is their review:
Carolyn and James were such great hosts for us! When we needed to stay an extra night Carolyn was more than accommodating. It was a great first airbnb experience for us! There was coffee, tea, fresh eggs, fresh towels. Carolyn checked in with us via airbnb to make sure we had everything we needed and respected our privacy. Their home was beautiful and they have a beautiful dog and cat! We would love to stay again and will definitely be booking with them when we come to sSeattle next.

9949	6707735	10.0	10.0	36075119	I really enjoyed your cool place, and also your prompt response, thank you for wonderful stay.
9950	6707735	10.0	10.0	36139061	"Upon arriving I met James and was shown around the property to the basement apartment. Inside James and Carolyn had left a handwritten note welcoming me and my dog. Along with the note they also left some eggs in the fridge that were from their very own chickens. You can really tell they care about their guests and want to provide a welcoming environment. 

The apartment was furnished well and I really enjoyed the decorative art around the place. After speaking a bit with James I believe everything was either made by him or second hand, which is really cool. Their entire garden is comprised of all second hand plants that he saved from the brink of death. I really enjoyed my stay and appreciate their hospitality."
9951	6707735	10.0	10.0	36578237	I love James and Carolyn's basement apartment! Check in/check out was a breeze.  The space is inviting and homey plus, bed is comfortable, neighborhood is lovely, and includes parking.  Next time I'm in the Seattle area, i will be checking their availability.  
9952	6707735	10.0	10.0	36809849	Carolyn and James are very considerate hosts and I had an excellent stay. The space was clean and welcoming, with a very thoughtful spread of everyday things you might need on a trip out of town.  The entrance was private as was check in and check out. I definitely recommend staying. 
9953	6707735	10.0	10.0	37201408	"Host stayed in contact with me, I texted our arrival time and got great directions to the place. Great hosts. 
Accurate description. Great location. really great location! Quiet street, parking, walking to shops, restaurants. Next to parc. Farmer's market on Tuesday afternoon.
Apartment is spacious, pleasant, well furnished and outfitted.
"
9954	6707735	10.0	10.0	37671870	We loved our stay in Carolyn and James' home! The apartment was clean and comfortable with all the amenities we needed for our four-night stay in Seattle. Despite the unusual heat in Seattle, the basement apartment was very cool. Though we didn't see Carolyn or James during our stay they left us sparklers to celebrate the 4th of July and fresh eggs from their chickens. 
9955	6707735	10.0	10.0	37769871	"Carolyn & James were lovely! We arrived in Seattle early and they were kind enough to clean the apartment so we could drop our dog off early.

The apartment was incredibly clean, cute, and charming. We enjoyed the neighborhood and all of the wonderful shops/restaurants nearby.

Carolyn was even kind enough to email us some fantastic suggestions of places to eat and see while were in Seattle. Not to mention the farm-fresh eggs in the fridge. Fabulous!

We will definitely be staying there again in the future when we visit Seattle."
9956	6707735	10.0	10.0	37999390	I had a great experience! They accommodated my bike and let me bring my stuff over a little bit early. I'd happily stay there again if I ever come back to Seattle.
9957	6707735	10.0	10.0	38295413	We loved staying here and would highly recommend it. A great atmosphere and happy vibes permeating the home! The neighborhood was just what we were looking for and we had a great time!
9958	6707735	10.0	10.0	38412179	We only talked to Carolyn and James once on our trip and they were very friendly. The basement we stayed in felt more like a home with its own entrance, a clean kitchen, bathroom, and separate bedroom. There was a ton to do in the area even though the house was tucked away on a quiet residential street. James was nice enough to point out a cool bar for us to go to just around the block. We'd definitely stay here again and would recommend Carolyn and James' home to anybody.
9959	6707735	10.0	10.0	39188750	Carolyn and James were incredible hosts! The apartment itself is remarkable, and they went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and help us with whatever we needed.  Their place is in a great residential area of Wallingford. Coffee shops, a supermarket, restaurants- all are only a few blocks away, but nonetheless at night the neighborhood is quiet as a mouse. Bus stop is three minutes' walk away. Amble down the driveway and look along the street and you're staring smack at downtown- a wonderful sight at night! If you're staying in Seattle, stay here- you won't regret it. Plus, you get to make fresh eggs for breakfast in the cute kitchen from their own chickens. How cool is that? 
9960	6707735	10.0	10.0	39950682	The apartment was exactly as advertised. The added touches of personality from James and Carolyn really made for a unique stay such as fresh eggs from their chickens and their own artwork. The kitchen was well equipped. I have stayed in many vacation rentals and typically the cookware is extremely cheap and worn out. That was not the case here. The neighborhood is excellent with many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and a grocery store all within a few blocks. Carolyn and James were attentive during our stay without being intrusive. I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in north Seattle.
9961	6707735	10.0	10.0	40157114	Carolyn and James were easy to work with and very accommodating.  Their home is in an interesting and pedestrian friendly neighborhood.  The apartment was basic but cozy, comfortable and private. 
9962	6707735	10.0	10.0	40351616	Everything was great. The space looked just like the pictures, was cozy and clean! They left some awesome farm fresh eggs that were awesome. It was a short drive to Seattle and had lots of stuff walking distance. It was a great stay!
9963	6707735	10.0	10.0	40527072	Carolyn and James were wonderful hosts! The basement apartment is cozy and cute, and Ruby the dog is even more magnificent in person. The bed is super comfy, and the hosts were totally accommodating (there were even fresh home-raised eggs in the fridge!) -- we'll definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. Thanks again!
9964	6707735	10.0	10.0	40661395	This apartment is in a cute neighborhood. The decor is unique and adorable. Carolyn & James made sure to contact me prior to check-in regarding key location. And they left fresh eggs in the fridge! My stay was short so I didn't get to meet the hosts, but we enjoyed the apartment. I would definitely recommend this location!
9965	6707735	10.0	10.0	41670186	Apartment is very comfortable and fun. We had everything we needed, and the location is fantastic. Just a short uber ride away from everything you want to see in Seattle, and located in a really cute fun neighborhood to explore right outside your door. Would definitely book here again, thank you Carolyn for your hospitality. Boyfriend loved the chickens! 
9966	6707735	10.0	10.0	43071899	"Communication was fast and easy, and the location was fantastic - quiet neighbourhood, but so close to the I-5 and our friends' wedding venue!

Great space, comfy bed and couch for lounging, colourful and funky with lots to look at while we enjoyed the fresh eggs for breakfast - fresh flowers on the table were glorious too!

Extra care and attention throughout (while very much giving us privacy, perfect for us introverts!) spoiled us. Future Airbnb hosts will have a lot to live up to, after this great experience with Carolyn and James!"
9967	6707735	10.0	10.0	43403357	This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful, the apartment was super convenient, comfortable, and clean. Our hosts were extremely responsive and friendly, making the trip a breeze! I would go back to Seattle just to stay at this apartment again!!
9968	6707735	10.0	10.0	43593641	This was mine and my husbands first experience with Airbnb. We were very happy with Carolyn and James basement apartment, it is exactly how you see it on the website. The apartment had a bit of a musty odour to it and there wasn't enough toilet paper in the bathroom. That being said, the apartment was very clean and the fresh eggs for breakfast were lovely and very much appreciated. Great neighborhood and close enough to downtown in a Uber taxi.
9969	6707735	10.0	10.0	44338806	The neighborhood is very charming.  Nice to walk to coffee and the store.  Kitchen is nice with welcoming touches.
9970	6707735	10.0	10.0	44529095	This was our first airbnb experience. Communications with Carolyn before our arrival were clear and easy. We loved the basement apt that was creatively furnished with comfort, whimsy and a great sense of humor! Two place settings at the dining nook  and fresh eggs from their chickens in the fridge were an especially nice touch. The location could not be better. This is a great neighborhood in Seattle. We would definitely book this apt again and will recommend it to friends.  Oh--comfy bed too!
9971	6707735	10.0	10.0	44715849	Bill was happy with the apartment.  It was really close to the school he was working with and he loved the neighborhood.  Will be back.
9972	6707735	10.0	10.0	44831695	Lovely colourful basement suite in the Wallingdon area, around the corner from a small park - and with chicken's eggs in the fridge, fresh from the coop in the owners backyard!  Great welcome from Carolyn, with some useful tips on what's in the area.   Little taco place a couple of blocks away did some great take-out so we could dine in our kitchen nook, where the table was laid for a romantic dinner, complete with cloth napkins.   Fab home from home -  completely recommend.  Decorated with a confident artistic touch.  Very relaxing suite.  And nice and cool in the hot weather Seattle's just had.  
9973	6707735	10.0	10.0	45117411	We loved it and didn't want to leave as soon as we pulled up to the neighborhood.  Very friendly neighbors and great hosts.  The home is taken care of with love and you can feel it when you enter.  Exactly as the pictures show.  Loved talking to their dog (very calm dog) and having our chicken eggs in the morning.  Walking distance to many great stores and restaurants as well.
9974	6707735	10.0	10.0	45613388	This is a lovely hidden gem in the Wallingford neighborhood.   A few minutes walk to good eats, quaint shops, and a grocery. The basement apartment suite is private and clean.  Carolyn and James have thought of everything!  There were fresh eggs in the fridge and a full assortment of teas.  The outdoor patio is perfect for enjoying the weather and catching up on some reading.  They were sure to check in on me and brought fresh towels down.  I will stay again the next time I'm in Seattle.   It's Perfect!
9975	6707735	10.0	10.0	45685103	This basement apartment is in a lovely neighborhood. There is an entrance to a beautiful park at the end of the cul de sac that I highly recommend any other guests visit.

9986	6707735	10.0	10.0	54393080	"I walked into this cozy place during a cold day and it was the perfect temperature with full central air (unexpected for a basement). Everything was in order, including fresh sheets, towels, even preset dinner plates. 
The hosts made sure I got in okay, and ensured if I needed anything to just give them a call. I absolutely loved the art as well. My preschooler thought they were pretty rad he even took one to school for show & tell. Would definitely book again"

The location is a quiet verdant neighborhood with interesting shops a walk or quick drive away, and about one minute from the I-5, putting the whole metro area within a 15 minute drive. Getting to the university was easy too. Allison and Crai were so nice, and Crai's recommendations were excellent. The space was very private and clean.
10271	8533375	10.0	10.0	53538742	"Alison and Crai's apartment was a lovely and perfect destination for a weekend getaway in Seattle. The accommodations were comfortable, private, sizely, and accessible. Alison and Crai were gracious hosts, even providing us with fresh baked cookies upon our arrival, and a fresh supply of coffee and teas. 

The location was perfect. The town of Wallingford is charming, and Crai (as an accomplished travel writer) proved to be a great resource in navigating the trip. There is plenty to do in the neighborhood, as well as easy access to transportation should you want to go elsewhere. 

The pair made coordinating very easy and were great to work with. 

I highly recommend this apartment. "

Milk and coffee were in the refrigerator for the morning.  The location is excellent.  It is walking distance to several great neighborhood coffee shops and to 45th street where everything is happening.  It is a great neighborhood for walking and you feel very safe.
11198	9596	9.0	10.0	2228152	Nice place to stay.  Joyce is wonderful and helpful.
11199	9596	9.0	10.0	3189281	"Our stay was not the usual Airbnb experience, nor it seems a usual stay with Joyce. The bed squeaked horribly, the hot tub was not on during our stay, the coffee pot was not functioning, there were quite a few cob webs about, the bed was not a tempurpedic as advertised and had mildew under it on the plywood base, we had a squirrel chewing in the wall every night and our host changed her ""house rules"" 1/2 way through our stay to add on $75 more for a pet fee and state that the hot tub was normally off during the winter months AFTER we sited our grievances. Thankfully Airbnb takes a ""snap shot"" of the listing when you book so we were not charged.  The ONLY house rule when we booked was ""n.s.""...that's it. We sent photos to airbnb and described the situation. Airbnb refunded about 1/3 of our stay, our host gave us $40 in cash & champagne but we don't drink. We would not stay there again. P.S. Watch your step on the way in..very steep and dangerous, not for someone with any kind of mobility issue."
11200	9596	9.0	10.0	5472435	NIce place. Great location. Easy walking to restaurants and coffee and Gas Works Park on the lake. Quick and easy trips to the city.
11201	9596	9.0	10.0	5860044	"My girlfriends and I had a wonderful stay in Joyce's home. We had the main house and this down stairs apartment. Everyone enjoyed the lovely garden, neighborhood and of course the classic turn of the 
century home. 
Joyce was helpful and welcoming. She made us feel right at home. "
11202	9596	9.0	10.0	7477095	"My husband, son and I really enjoyed our time in the downstairs apartment in Wallingford.  Joyce has made the apartment welcoming, comfortable and created a lovely homely atmosphere with character of a country cottage.  The beds are really comfortable and the place is quiet at night - I had some of my best sleeps here during my 1 month long USA trip.  Her place is set in a beautiful garden and tree lined street and yet, up the road there are an array of great shops, restaurants, galleries, parks and the Fremont Troll.  I loved staying in the Wallingford / Fremont area plus the bus is 2 minute walk and a 15 minute ride downtown to the major attractions of Seattle.  

Joyce is also a helpful and fantastic host and she will give you lots of tips of things to see and places to eat and shop plus maps!  We highly recommend!
"
11203	9596	9.0	10.0	8093141	Joyce was a great host and more than accommodating to our group. The welcoming wine and bread were a very special touch after our long drive. We appreciated the hospitality. Thank you for allowing us to use your home during our trip. - the Canadian Crew.
11204	9596	9.0	10.0	8404754	We enjoyed an long week stay at Joyce's place.  It is a quiet location central to great shopping, bus lines and wonderful restaurants.  It is easy to catch a bus downtown and to other locations in Seattle.  Everything was as it is described in her description.  The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen is well equipped and the living room is spacious.  There is also Internet and satellite TV.  We were not disappointed and would do it again. 
11205	9596	9.0	10.0	14601155	Hi, we had a good experience at the down home. It was clean and Joyce was responsive and accommodating.
11206	9596	9.0	10.0	15856660	"Hi,
Joyce was an excellent host.  the down-home flat was clean and met our needs very well while attending our son's wedding in Seattle.  Seemed like anything that came up whether we needed needle and thread or bandaids, iron, ironing board, it was available.  The front patio was great for morning coffee and the weather made it exceptional.  
Joyce was very responsive to emails and phone calls etc.  and quickly took care of any issues.  Thankyou to Joyce.  "
11207	9596	9.0	10.0	16199821	The place was great, clean and well prepared. Joyce left us to ourselves which was very welcome. The apartment was spacious enough for all three of us and the price was really great. Fresh water was provided via a Brita Water Filter, I think I might have to get one of those now :) Definitely recommended to live here if you're in the area.
11208	9596	9.0	10.0	16895496	"This was my first time ever staying in a basement. It was an interesting experience. Joyce left us a small bowl of fruits and the local paper and was hands off for the rest of the week.

The apt was neither too close or too far from any of the popular spots. If you're thinking of napping or sleeping in bring earplugs. There were moments when I thought the tenants above us were moving out and about to fall through the ceiling. Very efficient use of space."
11209	9596	9.0	10.0	18245969	"The place was lovely and the beds soooo comfy.  We didn't actually meet Joyce, but she left fresh picked plums at our door. 
It's a great location. Close to good restaurants/coffee shops/bars. The bus links were adequate,  but i am a Londoner and used to great public transport.  
Very friendly place.  I would recommend you stay here.  "
11210	9596	9.0	10.0	18876750	"The apartment was nice and comfortable. Plenty of room for my husband, myself and his mother. The only thing to consider is that the stairs into the apartment are very steep, so be aware if you have young children or elderly. Otherwise it was perfect for our needs. Joyce has put together a nice little spot for her guests. It is central to all of the Seattle hotspots. Definitely would stay here again, if we find ourselves overnighting in Seattle again. Thanks Joyce!!!
"
11211	9596	9.0	10.0	20041707	Had a  wonderful time.... Joyce was kind enough to have baked us a delicious loaf of bread, which we devoured! We didn't  want for anything.  Place is very clean and comfortable, the beds were absolutely WONDERFUL! Great location. We plan on staying again when we come to Seattle to visit family!
11212	9596	9.0	10.0	20425660	This is a great basement apartment within walking distance of great stores and restaurants in Wallingford!  We loved our time here and Joyce even welcomed our Golden Retriever with open arms (and dog treats)!  
11213	9596	9.0	10.0	33513624	"My daughter and her three friends had a great experience in the down home. The apartment was spacious and clean with several very comfortable beds. Joyce was a great host who offered advice about navigating the area and made sure they had everything they might need during their stay. She even brought down some breakfast on the first morning before they had a chance to go shopping. Parking was available on the street and the location was within walking distance to Fremont and the bus stop. 

Five Stars. 


"
11214	9596	9.0	10.0	35371555	"The listing was confusing for us.  The host's attempt to list 3 different units with a single listing creates complete confusion.  The pics show the outdoor amenities that are not made available to each of the 3 units.  We thought we would return each afternoon after a day of site seeing and relax outdoors.  Use of the outdoor amenities were restricted from the tenants of the down home unit.

There are a set of concrete stairs without handrails that are not shown in the listing's pics. Tenants of the down home basement apartment are required to use the concrete stairs to gain access.  My parents are elderly and were not able to safely maneuver the concrete stairs that were necessary to get from the street to the house and then to the basement apartment.   Had a pic of the concrete stairs been in the listing, we would have booked elsewhere.  We left early due to the stair issue and the safety concern for my parents

The basement apartment was clean and the kitchen had awesome utensils.  The beds were extremely comfortable.  It was nice having WiFi.  The location is close to public transportation and the neighborhood is quiet.  It was super convenient to have the washer and dryer access.  "
11215	9596	9.0	10.0	35796900	The downstairs unit was perfect for me and my two girlfriends! We stayed for three days and walked to Fremont street and Gasworks park easily. Lots of shops and music venues in walking distance, surprisingly easy parking and a little neighborhood grocery store just a short block away. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe and the house was also very quiet and peaceful. The unit was very clean, there was fruit and coffee waiting and Joyce was available for any questions or concerns. 
11216	9596	9.0	10.0	36199982	Joyce was nice, she made us delicious scones for our arrival. The place is pretty much like in the photos, great use of space in that apartment and very comfortable beds. The location is good because north south buses work well in Seattle. The Wallingford street area is nothing to rave about, but Fremont at the bottom of the hill is really great.
11217	9596	9.0	10.0	37451062	We had a great time at Joyce's cozy and lovely basement bungalow. She was very accommodating and gracious and had great suggestions on places to visit. Most importantly, beds were first rate and location is perfect for exploring Seattle.  
11218	9596	9.0	10.0	38495776	We absolutely loved staying at Joyce's basement apartment. It was exactly as described, and super cozy. The apartment is very close to a great commercial strip on N 45th St. that had great restaurants, bars, and shops. And it is about 1 mile away from Gas Works Park, which HAS to be one of the best parks in Seattle, amazing views! We were sad leaving, it was such a great area!
11219	9596	9.0	10.0	40324696	"Joyce was an excellent host during my stay in Seattle. She provided me with all of the necessary information to make the most of my trip; nice restaurants, places to visit, things to do etc. The apartment was furnished with everything I needed and was very comfortable.

I would highly recommend staying in this accommodation. Joyce is a fantastic host and she was kind enough to arrange my taxi to the airport on the morning of my departure."
11220	9596	9.0	10.0	42822293	"We stayed in the basement of Joyce's orange house and it was cozy and just right for us, a family of three. Everything was clean and we had the amenities we needed. We used the bedroom and my daughter used the pull-out bed. The small kitchen was useful for quick breakfast in the morning before we went out and about. 

It's centrally located, west of campus and north of downtown area. It was a quick drive to everything. I highly recommend it as a place to stay for a couple or small family."
11221	9596	9.0	10.0	46893251	The down home, central and fab was the perfect location with a lovely, inviting yard in a lovely neighborhood.  The apartment is lovely and super clean.   So nice to be in a daylight basement on hot days!   Thanks, Joyce
11222	9596	9.0	10.0	48032697	This was our first Airbnb experience and it could not have been better.  Everything was exactly as shown in the photos, the apartment was quiet and very comfortable.  We loved the neighborhood and it was very central to everything.  We were able to walk or take a short Uber ride to most everything we wanted to see and do.   Joyce was very responsive to our questions and an excellent hostess, although she was not in town while we were there, we did appreciate her leaving us snacks, fruit, etc....and we enjoyed meeting her adorable dog, Cleo!  Thank  you Joyce :)
11223	9596	9.0	10.0	48414088	We had a great experience at Joyce's place. It was just as the photos depicted. Great location and Joyce got right back to us making our check in and check out a breeze. Quiet home in quiet neighborhood walking distance to restaurants. Very easy commute to downtown Seattle. I would recommend  this location without a doubt. 
11769	2267088	10.0	10.0	10503138	Barbara, Michael, and Max are wonderful, generous hosts and the space is wonderful!  It is well stocked, cozy, spacious, and very homey.  The Queen Anne area is absolutely beautiful and conveniently close to so many Seattle attractions.  Not only were all of these features perfect for us but on top of it all what really made this a fantastic experience is that we were able to bring our cat with us.  They were very welcoming of her which made the challenge of having to bring her especially helpful. We definitely plan on going back!
11770	2267088	10.0	10.0	11119045	This was a great little suite for our family with 2 little kids.  A truly fully equipped kitchen and helpful host. The neighborhood is full of beautiful, unique homes and it's near many amenities. We liked the ability to go down to the walkway by the water and then walk across the Fremont draw bridge to explore more little shops and cafes.
11771	2267088	10.0	10.0	11194004	The space is sunny and clean, with beautiful art and comfortable beds, in a safe and scenic neighborhood. Barbara and Michael are lovely, gracious hosts who immediately made us feel welcome. Upon our arrival, they even provided our 2 year-old with milk in a cute little elephant cup, and introduced her to some wonderful toys. We wish that we could have stayed longer, as it felt like a home away from home.
11772	2267088	10.0	10.0	11356331	"A real find for SPU parents!  Debbie, Justin (our college student), and I enjoyed our time in this super convenient and very clean apartment.  Loved the lay out and the off-street parking.  Plus walking to campus was a breeze - only about 2 minutes.  Barbara, Michael, and Max were wonderful hosts-making sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. There were so many extra ""nice little touches"", it felt just like home!  We liked it so much we booked it again for next month.  "
11773	2267088	10.0	10.0	12292495	The perfect little get away, again! This is the second time I have stayed in the garden apartment and it was just as convenient and cozy as the first visit.  Queen Anne is fast becoming one of my favorite places, love the coffee shops and the restaurants. On Saturday and Sunday morning, our son, Justin, walked over from his dorm at SPU and had breakfast with me. Thanks to the great hosts who stocked the fridge with bread, eggs and milk so I was able to make french toast.   I am trying to come up with another reason I can go back again...
11774	2267088	10.0	10.0	12623473	Our hosts were gracious and informative.  Their apartment is clean, well stocked, comfortable and well located in Upper Queen Anne.  We had a good time, would highly recommend them to all.
11775	2267088	10.0	10.0	12831336	Michael and Barbara were very friendly and accommodating.  The apartment had everything we needed for a great stay in Seattle, they even provided a crib and changing table for our infant, and provided breakfast items in the fridge!  They were very informative of the city, and gave us great restaurants tips.  I highly recommend them to anybody looking for a great place to stay, with lots of privacy and in a great location to the city.  We will definitely use this accommodation again for our future Seattle trips.  
11776	2267088	10.0	10.0	13079778	We really enjoyed our stay here. Michael was a great host and very friendly and helpful. The unit is very clean and functional and has everything you need for a short or a longer stay. It is roomy, comfortable, very nice. There is off street parking for one car which is very helpful. If you are needing to be at SPU this is absolutely perfect. It would also be great as a home base for exploring the Seattle area. Highly recommended. 
11777	2267088	10.0	10.0	18835480	"We were a little worried, having had no experience with airbnb to date,  however, I can recommend this location easily, as Michael and Barbara were excellent ambassadors for airbnb.  Prompt and courteous in all communication, they made adding a day to our stay a smooth/easy transaction and Michael put us at ease from the moment he greeted us and took the time to show us the space.  The off street parking spot was right outside the door to the unit so loading and unloading the car was easy.  The unit was relaxing, quiet, clean and peaceful enough that our cat was immediately put at ease and was ready to explore the whole place without needing any time to get acclimated.   The unit is within walking distance to the Sunday Market and the PCC, as well as all those sweet little shops, etc, in Fremont. There were unexpected, nice touches inside the unit as well- like fresh oriental lilies on the dining table and organic peanut butter, organic oatmeal, etc, stocked in the kitchen.  We enjoyed staying here and would do so again.
"
11778	2267088	10.0	10.0	19087745	A spacious apartment in a beautiful neighborhood, well stocked with everything we could possibly need for our stay. We were even surprised to find the fridge lightly stocked for breakfast! Thank you very much!  
11779	2267088	10.0	10.0	19927870	"Barbara and MIchael were really excellent hosts. They were absolutely striving to do their best to accomodate us. They even started us with a few breakfast items in the fridge and bread and cereal so we didn't have to worry about grocery shopping the night we arrived. The communication process was really smooth and Barbara checked in with us via texts on a regular basis to make sure we had everything we needed. The apartment is really spacious which I hadn't really anticipated as it looks smaller in the pictures I believe. The king bed is amazing too. The place was very well stocked and very clean. There is a laundry area too which we got to use. The area in which the house is situated is amazing, fairly close to downtown in a very quiet a quaint neighbourhood with a nice view of Fremont from the patio which we enjoyed on a few sunny days. All in all I would highly recommend staying with Barbara and MIchael. If you have never been to Seattle before they will also gladly provide you with information about the city, what to see and where to go.
Thank you Barbara and Michael for an excellent last week in Seattle."
11780	2267088	10.0	10.0	20856674	Barbara and Michael were gracious, knowledgeable about Seattle and the apartment was perfect for our three nights! My daughter and I enjoyed the spacious layout and cool Jacuzzi type tub! We felt 'at home' and would stay there again :)
11781	2267088	10.0	10.0	21093065	We loved this comfortable and clean apartment in Queen Anne. A true 'home away from home' with two spacious bedrooms and beds, a living room and full kitchen. It's also very close to Trader Joe's if you want groceries. Barbara was in touch and very informative about the neighborhood as well. We would stay here again. 
11782	2267088	10.0	10.0	21197938	"Wonderful stay with Barbara & Michael!!  This was our first use of Airbnb and they have set a pretty high standard.  Apt is spacious, immaculate and exactly as described.  Barbara kept in touch and welcomed us warmly.  It was so nice having the ""basics"" in the refrigerator so when we got up in the morning we didn't have to wonder what we were going to do for breakfast.  It was a perfect location (near the Fremont district & the marina).  

We will definitely be back and stay with Barbara & Michael, as we have relatives nearby and this worked out perfectly.   It gave us the ability to see what it is like to live in Seattle, instead of just feeling like a tourist."
11783	2267088	10.0	10.0	21503264	Barbara and Michael are wonderful hosts!  This was our second visit and we plan on staying here for our future visits to the Queen Anne area.
11784	2267088	10.0	10.0	21880535	Looking for a Seattle rental? Look no more! The top three things about this rental are 1. the hosts, 2. the space, 3. the location. The hosts: (Barbara and Michael) have hospitality down to a T. We had a quick introduction with Barbara, which was lovely, and then were able to get  questions we didn't even know we had answered through the helpful materials they had supplied within the unit. I appreciated the check-in text that she sent me during our visit as it was nice to know someone was available in case I had a Seattle question. The space: This unit is awesome! The kitchen was more than equipped with everything we needed (including coffee!) and the added touch of rolls/jam/eggs in the fridge was extremely thoughtful and appreciated! The living space was quite comfortable, plenty of seating for our party of 4. The bedrooms are HUGE! It was nice to not be tripping over suitcases. I appreciated the fact that I could unpack my things and not have to keep digging through my luggage. The beds were the right levels of firm/softness and the temperature throughout the unit was great. We are from Arizona and big babies when it comes to cold...we never felt cold in the unit even though it was cold outside. I was a little concerned about sharing one bathroom, but there are enough mirrors in the bedrooms that we were able to share the space easily and use the mirrors in our individual bedrooms for the female primping. It was quite nice to know we had a designated parking spot to come back to and didn't have to fight it out on the city streets. After being caught in a rain storm it was much appreciated that I could throw our jackets/hoodies in the dryer instead of hoping they would dry out for the next day. The location: we had friends that stayed in a hotel that missed out on the unique layout of the city. We were able to explore varying areas of the city and get back to the unit with ease. There are so many services in the neighborhood, that with better weather, we could have walked to. We found plenty of local eateries, a local Scandinavian bakery, and of course local bars. We 110% had a fantastic visit and will most definitely stay here again on our next Seattle trip!
11785	2267088	10.0	10.0	22245637	Barbara and Michael were great hosts to work with. I had family coming into town so we needed some extra space and their 2 bedroom apartment worked perfectly for us! Barbara was very flexible in our check in and check out times and we loved the space! There is a Roku box connected to the TV which makes it very easy to watch Netflix and Hulu and they had a carton of eggs, English muffins, and a carton of milk in the fridge for us for breakfast. Location is great as long as you have a car, downtown is only a few minutes away and Upper Queen Anne is just a quick drive down the road. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Seattle!
11786	2267088	10.0	10.0	22532100	"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Barbara and Michael's. We were in Seattle attending Oprah's ""The Life You Want Weekend"" and found this location perfect. Just a short bus ride and we were at Seattle Centre. The suite was ideal; well stocked for all our needs. Even fresh coffee beans and grinder.
Having two private bedrooms with amazingly comfortable beds was such a treat.
Barbara was very accommodating and super helpful.
We highly recommend this suite and would certainly stay there again.

11787	2267088	10.0	10.0	26125849	Barbara and Michael are gracious hosts.  The accommodations are very clean and it is a quiet place to stay. I look forward to being a guest of theirs again.

Barbara was there to greet me when I arrived.  She spent an hour with me telling me about the house, showing me things in the kitchen and giving me tips for restaurants in the area."
11789	2267088	10.0	10.0	27274133	We were very happy with Barbara and Michael, the perfect host. The breakfast items left in the fridge were very much a surprise and very appreciated since we arrived later in the evening.  The suite was spacious and suited our needs.  The neighborhood is very quiet and right in the middle of were we wanted to be.
11790	2267088	10.0	10.0	27762024	We could not have been happier with this apartment and with Barbara and Michael, who are great and gracious hosts!   An incredibly well equipped kitchen, with all the essentials (spices, olive oil, sugar) we needed for the meal we cooked there.   There were lots of tasty things for breakfast--milk and oj, teas and coffer (and grinder!), english muffins plus butter and jam and peanut butter, eggs,and cereal.  The beds were very comfortable and the apt is well located yet quiet.  Extra benefit to have washer, dryer, and parking place!!  We would definitely recommend to others.  Thanks Barbara and Michael for making our stay in Seattle so comfortable!     
11791	2267088	10.0	10.0	28254695	The garden apartment was great in so many ways. It is completely private, well equipped with washer/dryer, kitchen needs a great bathroom and great internet options for watching tv. The hosts are very knowledgeable about the area and offer helpful tips on what to see and do. Plus I felt like they really cared about us. 
11792	2267088	10.0	10.0	28698027	Home sweet home! This was our fourth stay in this charming garden apartment! Barbara welcomed us when we first arrived and provided wonderful breakfast goodies including coffee, cereal, butter, eggs and other items. We always feel so comfortable in this home and love the Queen Anne neighborhood! Being one block from SPU, our son's school, makes it a perfect location for a family get away. Thanks Barbara and Michael for another great vacation! Hope to see you soon! 
11793	2267088	10.0	10.0	30071165	"Barbara and Michael's apartment was just perfect for our needs ( a family of 4).  In a fabulous location within easy walking distance to the Queen Anne shops and further to the city (its not that far and the views are fabulous!).

Barbara kept in contact with me in the days leading up to our arrival and made some really helpful suggestions about places to go in Seattle and to eat locally.

The apartment was extremely comfortable, especially the beds, and the fridge was equipped with coffee, tea, organic milk, cereal, English muffins, eggs, butter and more for breakfast. Everything you would need to cook for yourselves is also provided.

The TV is internet based so we had access to Amazon, Netflix etc which was useful. It was also very good having access to a washing machine and dryer.

This is a great place and I would happily return if I find myself back in Seattle.

Thanks Barbara and Michael. "
11794	2267088	10.0	10.0	30554145	"When I arrived at Barbara and Michael's home, Barbara greeted me and showed me around the apartment. It was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The backyard area had a great view of the Fremont neighborhood and would have been a great place to sit on a warm day, but it was a bit too chilly for us to do that during our stay. The kitchen was stocked with English muffins, jam, and coffee -- a perk we did not expect but definitely enjoyed and appreciated. The apartment also had tons of extra towels, blankets, and pillows. 

There were four people total in our party, and we all slept comfortably. Five people would be doable here, but I wouldn't add more than that. 

The location was also great -- this is a quiet, charming neighborhood that's far enough away to give you a taste of life outside the downtown hubbub, but close enough that you're not paying $30 for an Uber ride every time you visit something more touristy. 

All in all, we loved staying at this charming, clean Queen Anne home and would heartily recommend it. "
11795	2267088	10.0	10.0	30791681	Barbara and Michael were wonderful hosts! The listing is exactly as described and the place was super clean. The neighborhood is wonderful and quiet. This was my first airbnb experience and they were great. Definitely recommend if you plan to visit Seattle.
11796	2267088	10.0	10.0	31163202	Barbara and Michael are the most pleasant. All went smooth, reliable and pleasant. Place is clean, hosts very gracious and nice. Place is quiet, located in the most beautiful location. Barbara prepared map , bus routes and schedule for us without us asking. They left us a few things as welcome that served us for breakfast and made us feel at home. Top Hosts!   If we ever in Seattle again , no question we'll prefer to stay with you. 
11797	2267088	10.0	10.0	31933975	Barbara and Michael were great hosts and provided everything we needed for a fun stay in the Queen Anne district and surrounding Seattle area. The quiet area and views from the back deck area were great and we really loved Sammy their pup! They were able to make some great suggestions for food and entertainment as well as a quick primer on where to catch the local bus service for our daily trips into Seattle City center. This saved us a lot of money in parking fees (and avoided some thick traffic) and allowed us to see a different side of the city as well. They provided lots of information, flyers, and travel books for us to use while there. The home was cute and cozy, plenty of room for the 5 adults we traveled with. The house was well appointed and we had everything we needed. Besides the bus access to the city, from this location we walked across the canal bridge to the Fremont district for all they had to offer, a really fantastic spot for exploring this area! Thanks for everything!!!!

Four of us stayed in the unit and the beds were clean and very comfy. 

Barbara was always available for information and very accommodating. She has a wealth of local knowledge and was quick to offer us a list of activities or dining options. 

We had a fantastic time and will definitely be staying here again next time. "
11799	2267088	10.0	10.0	32674704	I sent a list of specific logistics questions which Barbara answered in time for us to make travel plans.  We notified her via text message when we were on our way to the apartment.  The location was good - a comfortable distance from downtown but easily accessible by bus or taxi.
11800	2267088	10.0	10.0	33350185	Nice and quiet location.   Very close to almost everything we like to do in Seattle..  This venue had a red informational book; it is very thorough and if one of our party had any questions, I would have them look in the book.  :-)
11801	2267088	10.0	10.0	34047397	Barbara couldn't have been more welcoming.  She thoughtfully provided everything that might be needed during our stay, even breakfast items so we could have a quick meal the next day before sight seeing. The apartment itself was very warm and truly felt like our home while we were in Seattle. The walk in tub was fantastic! Barbara provided many great tips as well as material on Seattle which we gratefully used. The location as well as the apartment was beautiful and Barbara was lovely - we couldn't have asked for a better experience  and will be staying here again.
11802	2267088	10.0	10.0	34287393	Michael and Barbara have a very nice apartment. It is clean and well kept. It is very comfortable. The Queen Anne neighborhood is wonderful with friendly people and breath taking yards. The streets are narrow so don't bring your large car or truck
11803	2267088	10.0	10.0	34928245	We had an awesome experience staying at Michael and Barbara's apartment. It was clean, comfortable, well-supplied and very conveniently located--loved having a parking spot and access to the laundry. The hosts are thoughtful and were a pleasure to meet.
11804	2267088	10.0	10.0	35644115	Michael was there to greet us when we arrived and show us around the apartment. We met Barbara later in our stay. They both made us  feel very welcome and had wonderful advice about Seattle. The apartment was very well maintained and fit all our needs. It was a great home away from home for the 4 nights we were there. We especially loved the little patio area. Plus they had some food available to get us started when we arrived which we really appreciated. The neighborhood was great with several places to eat and get groceries. We had a wonderful stay! 
11805	2267088	10.0	10.0	36174896	A perfect spot for our family of 4. The apt. was exactly as described and had all the amenities to make us feel at home. The neighborhood is quiet, clean and within walking distance to many great restaurants, cafes, shops etc..... Also very close to the main tourist attractions in Seattle. Barbara met us when we arrived and showed us the place. I definitely will recommend Queen Anne to my family and friends. Beautiful weather and beautiful city! Thanks....
11806	2267088	10.0	10.0	37128026	"It was my pleasure to stay with Barbara and Michael! The unit was perfect for our group. It was great to have a kitchen to cook in-- and three separate beds. 

Barbara and Michael ensured that we knew the layout of Upper Queen Anne and where all the best local spots were. "
11807	2267088	10.0	10.0	37727212	The place was great, Close to everything we wanted to do. There was food there for us when we got there, that was nice. The walk in bathtub/ shower was really nice. We had a really good time. Barbara an Michael were great.

Michael was so friendly, spending the time to give us directions to restaurants and orient us to what the neighborhood has to offer.
We loved the neighborhood! Close enough to walk to all sorts of restaurants and we had gorgeous evening walks through the neighborhood."
11809	2267088	10.0	10.0	39273956	We had a wonderful experience ! Barbara greeted us upon arrival, gave us a tour and answered any questions we had. She had a red binder full of helpful information about the area including bus routes , restaurant recommendations and grocery shops. The accommodations were immaculate , spacious and well supplied. They even supplied breakfast items such as muffins, eggs, milk, coffee and teas!! We highly recommend this listing and we will return! 
11810	2267088	10.0	10.0	39729646	Michael and Barbara were great hosts! The apartment was very comfortable and made our stay in Seattle very relaxing. We had a great time! The parking spot was very convenient! 
11811	2267088	10.0	10.0	45051370	"This was one of those amazing experiences where awesome hosts, in an adorable apartment, in a fantastic neighborhood, in a wonderful city all came together.  We stayed here for a month and as full-time travelers, this is our favorite rental!

The apartment:  We arrived to a clean, comfortable, tastefully decorated apartment fully equipped for our month long stay.  Everything we needed was provided and more!  Ample breakfast items to get us started awaited us:  teas, coffee, eggs, orange juice, bread, cereal, milk, fresh flowers…. The apartment had great natural lighting and was easy to open up to cool summer morning breezes.  We slept well at night; it was very quiet and the beds were comfortable.  There is a beautiful outdoor patio area where we enjoyed morning coffee.  A true gem!

The hosts:  Barbara and Michael have perfected the art of hosting.  They warmly greeted us upon arrival and were a wealth of information about the area throughout our stay.  Our time in Seattle would not have been the same without them.  Not only are they fantastic hosts, they are down-to-earth good people and a pleasure to chat with.  They even remembered my husband’s 50th b-day and brought a gift.  Yet, they also were respectful of our privacy and would text us, so as to not disturb us by knocking on the door, when they needed to contact us for things like cleaning and changing the bed linens and towels weekly.  Hospitality at its finest.  Thank you Barbara and Michael for everything!

The neighborhood:  Aside from historic, hilltop charm, this neighborhood is a runner’s/biker’s dream!  A 0.4 mile walk (through a beautiful college campus) leads to the Ship Canal Trail which connects to the Burke-Gilman Trail.  These trails offer 30+ miles of traffic-free, mostly flat, running/biking bliss.  We also used this trail to access downtown by biking to Lake Union Park (bike racks at MOHAI), then walking into downtown.  Closer to the apartment is Queen Anne Street where there are two grocery stores less than 1 mile away (Trader Joe’s & Safeway) and a plethora of restaurants, coffee houses and shops. We had our car, but rarely used it because everything was so accessible by foot or bike.  There is also a bus stop close by.  During evening strolls, we met some of the neighbors:  Max, Gary, and Keyoo.  They were all great sources of info and conversation.  Very friendly neighborhood.

All in all, this is our favorite rental and I would HIGHLY recommend it!  Great apartment, great hosts, great neighborhood...it doesn't get better than this!
"
11812	2267088	10.0	10.0	45779551	Barbara and Michael were very helpful and informative. The neighborhood was a great place to use as a base for exploring both Queen Anne and Fremont. Both neighborhoods are really great places to explore in Seattle. The place was very clean and the hosts were awesome!
11813	2267088	10.0	10.0	46570699	Barbara was the perfect host she made us so welcome.The apparment was even better than we thought it would (website hidden) was in a good area to get around also for food (website hidden) we were going onto a cruise from Seattle it was great to be able to use the washing machine.
11814	2267088	10.0	10.0	47958591	Barbara and Michael are excellent hosts.  I have stayed with them previously and they have such a welcoming way about them.  The location is quiet and the accommodations are very clean.  I look forward to visiting again.
11815	2267088	10.0	10.0	48273686	Wow. There are hardly words to describe our very wonderful stay at this convenient Queen Anne apartment. Barbara seems to have thought of everything - yes everything, you migh need as part of your stay. We felt at home after a very busy day of orientation for our daughter at SPU. We will definitely be a repeat guest at this property. Thank you to the hosts.
11816	2267088	10.0	10.0	48685135	The location was superb; fast and easy access to downtown, Lake Union, Woodland Park Zoo, Capital Hill, etc. Barbara was extremely kind, informative, and a wonderful host. The basement apartment is quite spacious. Both bedrooms are rather large. The back patio is really  a small concrete in the driveway, but it is a nice extension. The back is not fenced in, so this makes it tough for little ones or pets (if latter are allowed). All in all, this place is an exceptional value. You couldn't ask for better hosts.
11817	2267088	10.0	10.0	49434219	We had a wonderful stay!  Michael and Barbara have a beautiful home in an equally beautiful neighborhood. Within walking distance of Queen Anne Ave where there are lots of quaint restaurants and shops. I would stay again and definitely recommend booking this home!

11820	2267088	10.0	10.0	53958906	Barbara and Michael were superb hosts, very warm and friendly, and very concerned about our comfort during our stay; if there was something we needed not already provided, or directions/advice about Seattle they unstintingly took the time necessary to make things clear and understood. Their apartment was clean and neat and comfortable, had virtually everything we needed for a restful, enjoyable stay. Barbara and Michael obviously love Seattle, love being hosts, and this was reflected in how they approached us and providing for our visit. We unhesitatingly recommend them, with the highest marks, and look forward to our next trip to Seattle and (hopefully) stay with them.
11821	2267088	10.0	10.0	56204166	We found everything very comfortable! Clean. Kitchen had food on arrival. Nice neighborhood. 
11822	2267088	10.0	10.0	56590620	"The apartment was great, exactly as described, and Barbara and Michael were good hosts.  They met us when we arrived, and showed us around.  They were easy to contact and always quick to respond.

There was a lot of information in the apartment about the neighborhood and transportation options, including maps.  Barbara had ideas for walking routes for us, as well as buses to use.  The living room/dining room was very cozy and nice to lounge around.  The beds were top notch.  Everything was spotless.  The kitchen was well equipped and the hosts had thoughtfully included some breakfast food including milk, juice, eggs, muffins, and most important - coffee and tea!

For me, the best part of the apartment was the neighborhood.  It was an easy walk to a variety of coffee shops, restaurants, and small boutiques.  The buses were very convenient and easy to figure out.  The neighborhood itself is full of beautiful old houses with well-kept gardens, and it was especially nice to walk after dark with all the Christmas lights.  One day we even walked down to the Seattle Center, although the hill back up to the apartment was a challenge!

I would love to come back and stay again, and confidently recommend the apartment to other travelers."
11823	2267088	10.0	10.0	57198049	"We had had a long flight and to arrive at Barbara and Michael's flat was a delight. She was so welcoming and the flat was warm and comfortable. She had even provided us with some breakfast things. (which was incredibly helpful and desired after a long long day traveling.) She provided us with a lot of good information about the place and everything near us. Hospitality, in its finest form. We slept so well.
Even in the lead up to our arrival, communication was excellent. 
This has to be one of the best places I have stayed and I would encourage friends to stay here when visiting Seattle. 

"
11824	2267088	10.0	10.0	57755442	Barbara and Michael were absolutely wonderful hosts while we were here. The garden apartment was very cozy while we were there over Christmas. It was cold outside but warm as a mitten as soon as we walked through the door. Bedrooms were large and beds were very comfortable. Barbara was very knowledgable and informative about the neighborhood and city as a whole. Would highly recommend the garden apartment!

12773	1483944	9.0	10.0	10447026	A wonderful host with a great breakfast both days.  The room was clean, quiet and better than what the listing stated.  I would confidently send others to stay at this property and will ask to go back again when in Seattle.  I was able to easily get to the bus and downtown without any hassle.  Green Lake was fun to walk around and the restaurants nearby were great.  Thanks for a nice stay.
12774	1483944	9.0	10.0	10551174	Betty is the absolute best.  She was very accommodating when we needed to arrive a few days early and could not have been more helpful or kinder. She is also a fabulous chef and we really enjoyed our breakfasts and chatting with her.   The room was very comfortable and everything was spotless.  A great place to stay.  THANKS BETTY!!!

Betty provided us with a healthy lite breakfast for each of the days that we stayed with her.  She was very helpful in sharing and recommending some Seattle sites for us to explore.  They were very easy to talk to and we enjoyed our wonderful stay with them.   They both truly made you feel at home!

The room was comfortable and a nutritious and tasty breakfast each day was a real treat.  We enjoyed our morning conversations while Betty prepared our breakfast.  Be sure to ask her about a ""wheat grass shot"" or one of her healthy smoothies-- both were surprisingly delicious!"
12786	1483944	9.0	10.0	17594998	Betty was a good host and was willing to work with us on our travel time. We came into town for a late baseball game. The room was clean and inviting. She made a delicious breakfast in the morning for everyone.

12788	1483944	9.0	10.0	17780791	We had a great stay in Betty's house for 2 nights. Betty is so nice, her breakfasts are so wonderful. Betty's home is quiet and comfort. The room is very clean. The travelers we met at Betty's home are also very nice. It's really a beautiful memory in US. Thanks, Betty!
12789	1483944	9.0	10.0	18249421	This is the first real B&B that I've booked through airbnb, and it was lovely. Betty is generous and accommodating, and her home is bright and peaceful. We enjoyed getting to know Betty over her healthful breakfasts - a great way to start each day. We would stay here again.
12790	1483944	9.0	10.0	18596194	Our stay at Betty's home was wonderful. The house is located at the end of a very peaceful residential street. The room and bathroom were clean, well stocked and both the bed and the couch were very comfortable. And the breakfast! Betty is a superb cook and everything is organic and/or homemade. Do ask for her delicious chia porridge topped with homemade almond milk and a wonderful assortment of fruits and nuts! Betty makes you feel very welcome and it was lovely to chat with her over breakfast each morning. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

12793	1483944	9.0	10.0	19005914	Betty and her son were great hosts. They made me feel at home from day one. The room was spacious and very clean. Their lovely house is located in a residential area north of Downtown Seattle.  No need to rent a car. Public transportation is pretty reliable. I'd love to stay at Betty's again in the future.
12794	1483944	9.0	10.0	19182844	My wife and I wanted a place to stay close to all our favorite Green Lake/ Ballard stomping grounds before we relocate for work. Betty was quick to respond (same day) and host us for the weekend. As our first AirBNB booking, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and right off our room, and it was quiet so we got plenty of sleep. Being located at the end of a dead end made it safe and private but just minutes from the main roads. We would definitely stay again with Betty if we come to town for a visit. 
12795	1483944	9.0	10.0	19558069	I had a nice experience, never got the chance to actually meet Betty.  The room/bathroom were clean. The room was a little cold for my liking. 
12796	1483944	9.0	10.0	20571012	Listing was accurate, yes.  Neighborhood pleasant,  near North Seattle Community College and I-5.  For the recommended exit off I-5, do not find yourself on the express lane, however.
12797	1483944	9.0	10.0	21794388	Betty greeted me and showed me my room, bathroom etc. She was pleasant and welcoming and the bedroom, bathroom and common areas were clean and well kept.  I was just there for 10 hours so had relatively little interaction. Place was on cul de sac and in quiet, pleasant neighborhood.  Very easy to reach from I-5.
12798	1483944	9.0	10.0	21914544	Neighborhood was very nice, and location easy to find.  We found a wonderful Italian restaurant nearby to have dinner while waiting to connect with our host.
12799	1483944	9.0	10.0	23107834	"My husband and I stayed with Betty and Frankie for a month while work was being done on our house. She is friendly, communicative, and laid-back - I feel really lucky we found a place to stay nearby where we felt comfortable and could take the bus to work easily.  A month is a long time to be away from home!

Another bonus is that private room is quite and has plenty of storage space (which was perfect for our long term stay.) There is a large, bright kitchen for guests who may want to make their own meals. Betty is an excellent cook herself - I regret not being much of a breakfast person because I enjoyed what I did taste of her cooking/baking :)

I should also mention that the area is quaint and beautiful - I enjoyed several walks in the neighborhood. "
12800	1483944	9.0	10.0	23304694	Betty was a wonderful host and her place was lovely, clean, and comfortable! The location was perfect for us because family was just across the street. I should add that Betty's breakfasts were great and she was savvy about accommodating the needs of my gluten sensitive daughter without blinking an eye! We readily recommend this warm and friendly home. 
12801	1483944	9.0	10.0	23394695	Betty's hospitality started with checking for food/breakfast preferences prior to our arrival, and continued to accomodating our arrival and departure times. Her home was located in a quiet easily accessible neighborhood that was so convenient for the things we needed to do in downtown Seattle. Our room was lovely-clean, quiet, and comfortable and had everything we needed. I would definitely love to return if the opportunity arises!
12802	1483944	9.0	10.0	24434205	Very welcoming home and hostess! Super comfortable room and great breakfast. It's home away from home for me; have stayed twice now and will again.
12803	1483944	9.0	10.0	25516548	Home away from home...Betty is like family. It was our third stay there and we will continue to return.
12804	1483944	9.0	10.0	26576310	Betty was a wonderful host! Both her and her son were very welcoming and open. If we wanted space they would give it to us, but if we wanted to interact with them they were great conversationalists. And Betty's chia porridge was delicious, unlike anything I've had before. Overall great stay!
12805	1483944	9.0	10.0	27094041	"Betty's place was perfect. Exactly what I needed at the end of a busy day. Quiet, private and very comfortable. The room is spacious and bright.  Betty is a lovely person whom I regret I did not have enough time to spend chatting but she was very sweet to understand. 
She is a wonderful host and makes everyone feel at home.  I look forward to returning in June with my husband."
12806	1483944	9.0	10.0	28551872	Betty greeted us and provided the things we needed for a night there.  Her son actually originally let us in as she was at work, and he is very sweet as well.  After walking to find Green Lake on our own and failing, he helped us with the simple directions to it.  We totally enjoyed walking around the lake and having dinner at a local chowder house along the lake.  Very relaxing after a day of driving!  In the morning she made us and the other guest there a yummy chia porridge breakfast.  She was busy getting ready for the day making her raw foods and we felt like we got a great education in that as well.  Her sweet open personality and gracious hospitality just made us feel comfortable and cozy.  At this point we're thrilled to have found Airbnb and this way of traveling to see our sons.
12807	1483944	9.0	10.0	29249791	Wonderful place to stay - nice and cosy room and a great host! Betty, again many thanks for your warm welcome and the marvellous breakfasts you surprised us with every morning!! I do hope we'll be able to come back again!

12809	1483944	9.0	10.0	30704754	The room was comfy, the bed more so.  Pillows are key for me and they were great as well.  My Daughter slept on the futon and like that as well.  Betty is very sweet and charming.  Enjoyed our stay!
12810	1483944	9.0	10.0	31263026	Quiet street, clean room. Keys where not where they were supposed to be at check-in. Spacious driveway area for parking.
12811	1483944	9.0	10.0	32252318	"We both consider this airbnb one of the best in North Seattle.  Our third stay here.  The host(ess) is warm, friendly, helpful, flexible.  She truly cares about her guests.  Breakfasts rate an A+, morning after morning.  Food is healthy and nutricious.

12812	1483944	9.0	10.0	32759386	Betty is an amazing and gracious host! She tended to all of our needs, especially with our 1 year old. The neighborhood is very quiet and within walking distance to shops and parks. We came at a beautiful time with all of the flowers blooming. We definitely recommend Betty and using Airbnb again!
12813	1483944	9.0	10.0	32949461	"Betty made it super easy for us to ""check in"" at the house even though we were unsure of what time traffic would let us arrive. We stayed in the room closest to the downstairs entrance, which was perfect since my roommate and I came home late from dinner. Betty is wonderful and very hospitable. She even offered to cook us breakfast! The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and super close to Green Lake, where there's a great walking/running path. Would definitely stay here again. "
12814	1483944	9.0	10.0	33509108	It was a great experience. Betty was so nice. She made delicious dishes for breakfast. The room was organized and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. In general, this place is recommended.
12815	1483944	9.0	10.0	34096915	The room is nice and the bathroom fine. Breakfast was great and Betty is easygoing and friendly. If you are going to bed before 10 or 11 pm, you should know that you can hear a lot of what is happening elsewhere in the house, including voices and footsteps.  We stayed with our baby so were in bed pretty early. Overall the experience was good. 
12816	1483944	9.0	10.0	34935884	Betty has hosting down to a science. We were very comfortable and the house is clean and lovely. But it is her sense of hospitality that comes through loud and clear. We truly enjoyed our stay.  Highly recommend this location which is a short walk to the lake and an easy bus ride to the city center. 
12817	1483944	9.0	10.0	37188864	"Betty was very friendly and sweet! We stayed for a week and she cooked great breakfast for us every morning, and they are so yummy! Betty was also very generous and would share a lot of stuff with us. The room downstairs gets a little hot as we were in ""the hottest summer"" in Seattle history, but if you open the window cool air gets in and that will make you feel comfortable. Best to have two people in this nice room.

I highly recommend Betty's place. Staying with a great host was a wonderful experience."
12818	1483944	9.0	10.0	37703554	Betty has a warmly heart,  and served delicious breakfast. The room was nice and clean, it was convenient to  take bus  to downtown and airport. We lived there for three happy days with betty, thanks.
12819	1483944	9.0	10.0	38200219	It was a very pleasant experience staying here. Everything is perfect and clean. The host will even prepare breakfast for us. We are very happy that we stayed here.
12820	1483944	9.0	10.0	39298920	"Betty gave us a warm welcome but gave us privacy when needed. The neighbourhood was quiet and had eclectic houses to look at.  The park nearby was great for walking, swimming, and we even saw a play. Because we had a car, and  she was conveniently located near two major arteries of the city,  we could get around easily. She provided travel information when needed and was kind and respectful.   At one point it was really hot and the air conditioning was a great relief.
Her breakfasts were something to look forward to.  Fresh juice, waffles, omelates, fruit and we learned about raw eating.    I  also liked the separate entrance and the bathroom to ourselves.  The room was clean and spacious.  It gave us everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.  "
12821	1483944	9.0	10.0	39949061	Betty was very friendly and helpful. She cooked some very good breakfasts and made us feel welcome. The location was great as we were able to catch a bus downtown so we could leave our vehicle at her place. We would definitely recommend this B & B!
12822	1483944	9.0	10.0	45365733	"My wife and I stayed at Betty’s B&B for the month of August. We stayed in the first floor bedroom, which has its own bath. She also has an upstairs room to offer. 



There are many good things to be said about this place, not the least of which is Betty herself. Like any good host, she is very helpful and hospitable. But more than that, she is unfailingly cheerful and friendly and does her best to accommodate reasonable requests. In addition, she prepares wonderful breakfasts for her guests, up until 8:30 AM. These vary from day to day but are always tasty and healthful. 



The house itself is relatively new, on a very quiet residential street and close to bus stops for buses (the 16 and the 48) that go downtown, to the U-District, Ballard or Wallingford. It is less than a mile walk from the north end of Green Lake.  



The kitchen, like the living room, is a shared room. It is well-equipped and roomy. If you’re planning a long-term stay, like we did, or plan to use the kitchen to cook in, you may find that you need to ask Betty to make space in the fridge and on a cupboard shelf for you. When asked, she was more than cooperative. Another thing about the kitchen, which is on the second floor, is that it is adjacent to a wrap-around patio. This is one of the nicest features of the house. There is a hot tub on the patio and numerous bird feeders. The house has a screen of trees most of the way around, which lends it a feeling of semi-privacy. 



The bed in our downstairs room was adequate. It has one window. It lacks bed stands next to the bed, as well as a TV, but one is available in the living room upstairs. There is ample closet space to hang clothes in and a good-sized chest of drawers. There were not enough clothes hangers, so we purchased some ourselves. The downstairs bedroom has its own bathroom but it is not en-suite. The bathroom has cupboard storage and a roomy shower stall but no tub. 



All in all, Betty’s house is a good choice for someone on a budget who wants to stay in a residential north Seattle neighborhood and does not mind using shared facilities."
12823	1483944	9.0	10.0	46002011	Betty was a wonderful host. We had breakfast our first morning and it was so good!  Easy walk to the express bus on Aurora which got us downtown quickly and cost much less than parking would have.
13253	5602370	10.0	10.0	45765567	Couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay in Seattle. Our hosts were very friendly, helpful and we enjoyed spending some time with them! Great location-- easy access to the bus, walking distance to our daughter's home, and a great jog around the lake. One of our favorite restaurant, Duke's Chowder House is in the neighborhood as well. The  flat was clean and roomy. We hope to stay again on our next trip to Seattle!

Even though there were lots of awesome landscapes in Seattle, we had not wanted  to go outside and to stay more longer than our plan!
We loved like that. We'd like to visit again and are satisfied with host's service and resonable rental fee."
17482	4757025	10.0	10.0	27945040	Ella, thank you very much for your wonderful hospitality. It was my first experience in airbnb and I couldn't have asked for anything more. The place was exactly what it was described, few minutes to all the attraction. Walking distance to nice restaurants. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a place in Seattle. 
17483	4757025	10.0	10.0	28263404	Ella is very nice and the home is sweet and clean! She already prepare all daily necessities to us and all needs of kitchen~ we like it very much! it's a good memory in our travel experience!
17484	4757025	10.0	10.0	28315496	This apartment is the jackpot if you want to stay close enough to downtown to have a million things to do and far enough away that you don't deal with the noise of the city. The house is private, quiet, beautifully furnished and so comfortable. The entrance is private, away from the rest of the house. It has everything you could want for as little as an overnight stay or as much as a weekly vacation rental.   The hosts are incredibly friendly and welcoming and would stay here again in a heartbeat. 
17485	4757025	10.0	10.0	28941710	Ella and John were great hosts in this lovely apartment. The location was amazing and was easy to access. The apartment looks exactly like the photos.

17487	4757025	10.0	10.0	29116425	Ella and Joe and their home is the type of home you want to stay in every time you travel using airbnb. I had a 100% wonderful experience at their place and I'm so looking forward to coming back!
17488	4757025	10.0	10.0	29304547	This was our first Airbnb experience, and we were so glad we chose Ella's home!! The location was very convenient. Ella's house was so clean, cozy and her service was so thoughtful, we really felt like home. Thank you very much for your hospitality. You have my 5 star rating! 
17489	4757025	10.0	10.0	29558329	"I highly recommend this place.  It is clean and very tastefully decorated.  It has 2 queen bedrooms that are nicely separated from each other for privacy...prefect for two couples, or in my case, a family of 4.  We stayed at Ella's place while touring colleges and sight seeing in Seattle.  The location is excellent.  Close enough to downtown, but in a very quiet, residential area.  It is 1-5 minutes from excellent dining, coffee, etc.  If I moved to Seattle, I would strongly consider this neighborhood.

Ella and Joe were excellent hosts.  They made sure we had everything we needed, and made themselves available for any questions.

If my daughter goes to school in Seattle, I will be staying at this place a lot..."
17490	4757025	10.0	10.0	29768505	This home is wonderful, set up perfectly, and is very warm and welcoming.  It also has very sophisticated yet homey decor that adds a feeling of comfort.

17491	4757025	10.0	10.0	30209671	I worked with Ella to rent a space for my family, visiting for the opening of my exhibition! The location was (email hidden)ally close to us...and a short walk to delicious breakfast spots. I did not get to meet Ella, but had an easy time making arrangements for my parents, sister and niece. Easy to communicate with, quick to reply! My family was delighted with the space and all of its lovely decorations! It worked great for four. They enjoyed meeting Ella and were considering relocating to Seattle so they could stay here! Recommended!
17492	4757025	10.0	10.0	30522592	The apt was impeccable well decorated and incredibly comfortable. Our host has gone to great lengths to have anything and everything there for your comfort. All in all a 10+. Well done Ella we will see you again.

 The house facilities, if the next time we come to Seattle will choose this!"
17494	4757025	10.0	10.0	30931935	Ella's place is amazing. It was exactly as described in the listing, lots of amenities, and was spotless and clean. Ella was super nice and accommodating and was really helpful. The place is also well located with tons of great places nearby. Would definitely stay here again. 
17495	4757025	10.0	10.0	31663304	This is a fabulous place- Ella is so friendly, the place is immaculate and well decorated, and the livingroom and master bedroom look onto a charming garden and Afternoon sun streams in. It's convenient to transportation but a quiet oasis. 
17496	4757025	10.0	10.0	31898728	Great apartment, plenty of space, with all facilities and furniture (particularly in the kitchen), super clean; quiet neighborhood but not far from downtown. We had a great time, and Ella was extremely welcoming and responsive (we enjoyed a lot arriving and spending time at Ella's place after our long flight from France). Thanks again Ella! 
17497	4757025	10.0	10.0	32115734	Very cozy, well kept home. The apartment had lots of light and was nicely appointed. Ella was responsive and accommodating. The listing description and photos are very accurate. Would happily stay again.

Loved the decor and style, and I felt very comfortable there. The location was great and the neighborhood quiet. There was even a washer and dryer! The apt was a gem, and I will definitely stay again in the future!! 
17503	4757025	10.0	10.0	33918251	Ella's place is spotless and tastefully decorated. It had everything you could want and more. We only got to stay one night but wish it could have been longer!
17504	4757025	10.0	10.0	34138405	WE DONT HAVE ENOUGH SUPERLATIVES TO DESCRIBE ELLA AND HER RENTAL.  WE ARRIVED LATE BUT THE ROOM WAS READY TO GO. NO  ISSUE. IT IS ON THE LOWER LEVEL OF HER HOME. THERE WERE PLENTY OF AMENITIES AND SHE EVEN HAD HALF AND HALF FOR OUR COFFEE. BEDROOM SPACIOUS AND A COMFORTABLE BED. PLENTY TO DO IN THE AREA. #11 BUS TAKES YOU TO DOWNTOWN AND PIKES MARKET. RESTAURANTS ARE WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE. (RECOMMEND THE FRENCH ONE FOR BREAKFAST AND LUNCH). ELLA WAS FRIENDLY AND ACCOMMODATING.  WE HAD A 2PM CHECK IN FOR OUR NEXT LOCATION. NO ISSUE WITH KEEPING LUGGAGE THERE PAST HER CHECK OUT TIME. ELLA TOOK TIME TO TALK WITH US MAKING SURE WE HAD A GREAT STAY.....WE DID. WE RECOMMEND ELLA HIGHLY.
17505	4757025	10.0	10.0	34409694	"Ella was very responsive and accommodating throughout the process. The apartment was lovely, very clean and modern. It was a warm weekend and the apartment was nice and cool with a fan in the master bedroom. The bed linens and pillows especially all felt very high quality. We were traveling with our 2 year old and were very comfortable during our 3 night getaway at ""Ella's house."" "
17506	4757025	10.0	10.0	34534415	Ella's place was fantastic. I wish I stayed there one more night.
17507	4757025	10.0	10.0	34623646	Ella was very helpful and nice to talk too.  She has a good sense of humor and living above the apartment was quick to respond to questions or texts.  The space is eclectic - quiet, peaceful, clean,  with a nice king sized bed in one of the bedrooms.  We loved staying there and it's closeness to the shops/restaurants located on Madison (two walking blocks away).   You can unload your vehicle at the house but must park about a half block away.   Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  
17508	4757025	10.0	10.0	34709363	"We just adored Ella's beautiful home! It's even better than the photos. The rooms are bright and airy with lovely decor! The full kitchen is well equipped and having a washer and dryer on site is great for longer stays! The beautiful private back yard patio is lovely too.  Free close parking is a plus too! 

The location is fabulous, right in the Capitol Hill area and close to a cute neighborhood shopping / dining area and easy access to everything Seattle has to offer. We were only there one night but had were close to all the things we had to do in the area as well as a quick trip downtown.  

Ella was lovely and made an effort to stop by and say Hi and see if we needed anything during our stay! We'll be back for a longer stay!"
17509	4757025	10.0	10.0	35062408	"My mom and I stayed with Ella during a two-week vacation to the Pacific Northwest. We were the first to book with Ella and chose her place because it has two bedrooms and looked super cute!

The apartment didn't disappoint. It looks exactly as pictured, both bedrooms are very comfortable, there was plenty of space for relaxing at the end of a long day, and we LOVED the water pressure in the shower! The apartment really has anything you could possibly want. Coffee, tea, luxury toiletries, kitchen appliances, fans, ample closet space...the works!

Ella was there to meet us and kindly let us check in early. She's a friendly, communicative, and gracious host. It's clear that she put a lot of thought and care into making the space comfortable for guests. Also, I accidentally left a pair of jeans when we left, and we've made arrangements for me to stop by on our way back through Seattle on the way home to pick them up.

The location is charming and green and seems to have a lot of French influence. We enjoyed getting coffee and pastries each morning at Belle Epicurean at the top of the hill, and we had a nice Sunday brunch at nearby Cafe Flora. It's a straight shot down Madison into the downtown area on the 11 or 8 bus, which takes about 20 minutes if the buses are running on time. (This is no fault of Ella's, but we found the bus service unreliable and frustrating -- you have to have exact cash to buy a ticket onboard. We were never able to find anywhere to purchase a bus pass.)

If you're looking for a lovely, garden retreat after a day in the city, Ella's place is for you! You won't be sorry."

We really could relax when we stayed at her place: we watched movies, sat in the patio/garden and slept excellent.

Ella is a great host: she is very welcoming and gives all the information you need. We came earlier than the official check in time and she had no problems about us leaving our luggage already at the apartment, which helped us out a lot. "

Your place in Seattle is just beautiful.  We passed thru for a short stay but everything was just perfect. 
We found everything we needed to be very comfortable. This home was one of the cleanest we remember and we loved that. 
The location made it a straight shot downtown to the tourist district. 
Thanks for sharing this lovely home. "
17518	4757025	10.0	10.0	36767326	What a wonderful rental. I stayed here with my partner and his parents for two nights. Ella has gone above and beyond all expectations. Her house is clean and inviting, with adorable decor and a beautiful garden. Everyone was impressed and commented on how nice everything was. From the luxurious bed linens, selections of coffee and tea, to the abundance of high end toiletries, we felt like we were in a boutique hotel. And the location was perfect for our needs; we were close to downtown, but in a cute a quiet neighborhood. Thank you Ella, for being such a good host!
17519	4757025	10.0	10.0	36945981	"Ella's set up was just perfect for us--private, sunny and airy, in a nice neighborhood, fabulous restaurants near by. Ella has the place well-stocked with thick towels, nice bedding, and all you would need in a kitchen and bathroom. There is a beautiful little patio/courtyard right outside the door. Trader Joe's is nearby, so we did a little ""dining in,"" but the restaurant Ella recommended--Harvest Vine (within walking distance)--was divine, and we appreciated the tip! So glad to have stayed here, and would do so again without reservation. Ella, you are a wonderful hostess and a kind soul :)"
17520	4757025	10.0	10.0	38301622	Everything was exactly as described in the listing.  Very nice, clean and comfortable.  Ella has done an excellent job with the decor.  Beds were very comfortable and we loved the little patio out back.  
17521	4757025	10.0	10.0	44627213	We spent 6 weeks at Ella's charming apartment during the spectacular Seattle summer, and we couldn't have asked for a more gracious, thoughtful host. We were relieved to find that the apartment was just as beautiful as the photos. We appreciated a clean, quiet, calm place to call home during our extended visit. Ella supplied us with everything we could have needed and more. The garden added another element (and a nice BBQ) which we took full advantage of during the warm evenings. The location was perfect, with quick and easy access to Lake Washington & Lake Union, Madison park, downtown, and freeways on either side. For those who are up for exploring, we would recommend a walk or run through the arboretum - which is just a block away and will take you all the way to Union Bay on Lake Washington. We bicycled to all Seafair festivities, and there are coffee shops and great restaurants within walking distance. We absolutely enjoyed every moment of our stay, and most definitely recommend Ella's lovely apartment. Thank you for an amazing summer!

17524	4757025	10.0	10.0	46114297	100% as shown in the photos which was PERFECT. Ella is the sweetest lady as well. I travelled with my husband and my parents in their 60s and 70s and when we arrived a bit earlier before our check-in, Ella was wonderful enough to accommodate us. We only stayed one night as a stop-over but everything was as described. The place was super clean, the beds we so comfortable and we had a great time. This was my parent's first Airbnb and it has left a positive impression on them. 
17525	4757025	10.0	10.0	46696322	"The listing and photos were accurate, it is a charming, well appointed home and a most attractive neighbourhood.  My daughter and I felt quite spoilt for choices, enjoying a lovely walk by the lake ( 10 mins away) and stroll around a relaxed, almost country style village.  Cafe flora we would highly recommend for food and ambience.  And, it is a simple 15 min bus ride to downtown on bus 11, almost outside your front door.  We also hired a car and drove to Whidbey island one day for a kayaking experience, simple, easy and a total contrast.
Ella is a wonderful host, so helpful, beyond call of duty and we felt really cared for and given all that it takes to have a superb holiday.  While I would recommend her home 100%  I would also be wary of doing that, as next time we book, there may  be no space!!
Thanks Ella.

17532	4757025	10.0	10.0	50752647	This was one of my best Airbnb experiences. Ella's house looked more beautiful and more spacious than pictures. Ella considered every detail and gave us enough privacy. Hope to come back again.
17533	4757025	10.0	10.0	51265212	"We loved staying at Ella's place. It's in a perfect location, about a 5 minute drive into downtown Seattle. The neighborhood was quiet and cute, with a pizza place and a little cafe within walking distance. The house has a totally separate entrance and you would never realize it's connected to the main house. 
Ella was sweet to introduce us and show us around the place and then came and said goodbye the morning we were leaving. This is the perfect neighborhood to stay in! "
17534	4757025	10.0	10.0	51632841	The apartment is incredibly cute - very smartly decorated and Ella thought of everything we might need from bathroom supplies to kitchen amenities. 
17535	4757025	10.0	10.0	52480673	This flat is very well furnished.  The beds are super comfortable and everything works brilliantly.  The kitchen has just about all the stuff you'd need for some excellent home cooking.  The neighborhood is one of seattle's best with two of my favorite restaurants very nearby, Cafe Flora and Jae's Sushi.  Ella and Joe were very welcoming and accomodating.  They've definitely made my short list for return trips to Seattle.
17536	4757025	10.0	10.0	52717420	We had a memorable stay. The apartment was spacious and clean and thoughtfully stocked with amenities such as shampoo, soaps, coffee, teas....  Ella and Joe were friendly and helpful.
17537	4757025	10.0	10.0	53117912	Wondeful place in a very nice part of the town. Ella and her husband Joe are great hosts and we felt very comfortable at their home. Thank you
17538	4757025	10.0	10.0	53344105	"We had a wonderful time staying at Ella's place - it is just as cute as it looks in the photos, extremely quiet, and was absolutely spotless.  Ella made us feel welcome when we arrived - and the little touches (cream waiting in the fridge, lovely toiletries, and every kitchen utensil you would want!) made it feel just like home.  The beds are both really comfortable, and the neighbourhood is quiet but a 5 minute walk from a really nice restaurant strip, and a 15 minute walk from Safeway for those that feel like cooking at home.  
Parking is easy and available, and it is a short drive to downtown/shopping/attractions.  Highly recommended & we hope to be back!"
17539	4757025	10.0	10.0	54094123	We had a great time staying at this apartment. What a find?! We were lucky to be booking far in advance and it was available. I understand it's popularity. We were just a group of 4 in town for a weekend for a Seahawks game and this was a perfect place for us to rest our heads and feet. We felt totally welcome and, despite not needing much assistance, Ella and her husband made it known that they could help with any needs we had. Highly recommend this as a place to stay.
17540	4757025	10.0	10.0	54962389	Ella was responsive and warm from the moment the interaction on AirBnb began.  Her lovely home was above and beyond.  It was clean and pretty with everything one would need, along with comfy beds, and plenty of privacy.  We were so happy with our stay.  We were all wishing that we could have spent more time there.  If we need a place in Seattle in the future we will definitely try and stay here again.  
17541	4757025	10.0	10.0	54973876	"We had such a wonderful overnight in this spacious apartment. Kitchen is stocked with more than basics, helping us convert some groceries into a cozy home-cooked meal. Lovely neighborhood for strolling and exploring too - lots to do within a short distance.
But the prime attraction was our host- Ella. Just a brief encounter endeared her to us and makes us look forward to a return (and longer) visit when we can appreciate the outdoor space as well."
17542	4757025	10.0	10.0	55390555	Our experience at Ella and Joe's home was stellar!  It was sparkling clean, and all the lovely touches made it so comfortable.  We felt so welcomed, and hope we can stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.  This spot made a special family visit just perfect.
17543	4757025	10.0	10.0	55642083	"My family and I stayed at Ella's house for one night in our way up to the San Juan Islands. We were having trouble finding a hotel room large enough so I booked the room last minute. My parents had never stayed in an Airbnb and were sort of skeptical. 

The place was great. It looked even nicer than the photos, every room was very well appointed, and the process of getting checked in was super easy. My parents haven't been able to stop talking about how much they loved it and it was just so much better than a hotel for half the price."
17544	4757025	10.0	10.0	55683964	Nice neighborhood, very clean and comfortable apartment, had everything we needed. Great experience, thank you Ella!! 
17545	4757025	10.0	10.0	55855383	This was my first time using Airbnb, and it was a great experience with this gem of a listing. Clean, bright, well-equipped (half and half in the fridge, coffee in the cabinet), and spacious. Parking nearby, but I recommend taking your belongings into the flat, as we had our car broken into after we had checked out, in a neighborhood about 1/2 mile from here. This neighborhood is quiet, safe, residential but close to several really good dining options, including a great brunch spot (Luc). Ella was a fabulous hostess, really enjoyed meeting her and the lovely home-baked Madelines she brought us! Thank you Ella for a warm and inviting spot in our Seattle weekend.
17546	4757025	10.0	10.0	55963118	This was my first experience with Airbnb. Ella's place was exactly what she said, very clean and spacious. This was also our first time to Seattle. Her place was close to downtown you could walk some places or can it or drive. Prefect experience. Thank you Ella 
17547	4757025	10.0	10.0	56101538	My parents stayed with Ella for a second time and everything was just as great as it was the first time.  The pictures and descriptions are accurate, the space is quiet and roomy, and we especially liked the gas fire-place.  Thanks, Ella!
17548	4757025	10.0	10.0	56223640	"Ella's unit is adorable.  The pictures are reflective of the décor and cleanliness and the kitchen is well stocked for a day or a longer stay. 
We will be booking this location again. 

Thanks Ella!"
17549	4757025	10.0	10.0	56375395	Ella was a great host. She provided a beautiful home to stay in and had everything we needed even for the one night. If you are looking for a cozy place to stay that is a short drive from downtown Seattle, come by Ella's home!
17550	4757025	10.0	10.0	57922597	We had a wonderful time at your place. My aunt did not want to leave your place for the tour! Ella is so thoughtful about all details. We can confirm that out of 10 air bnb we had experienced. This one is by far the best.
20709	4256705	10.0	10.0	22569440	Kevin was great,  very helpful and helped me with getting to know Seattle. His place is very nice and comfortable.

his room is really comfortable undoubtly, everything was ready when i checked in, and the puppy of his roommate is really so cute and lovely."
20713	4256705	10.0	10.0	46199760	Kevin's place is in a great location and close to lots of bars/public transport. He was super welcoming - left us a bottle of wine and snacks upon arrival. The roommate's puppy was super cute too! Would stay here again. 
20714	4256705	10.0	10.0	47124208	Kevin and his roommate Craig are friendly and tried to provide everything I need. The room is clean and comfortable. The location is great and convenient to downtown Seattle.
20715	4256705	10.0	10.0	51841047	Kevin's place was great, with awesome views from every room of the apartment and in a perfect location. Kevin was really accommodating and was responsive to questions while I was out and about, even when he wasn't around the apartment. Highly recommended!
20716	4256705	10.0	10.0	53730763	Kevin's place was wonderful; conveniently located and easily walkable to lots of Seattle hot-spots. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and exactly as advertised. Kevin's communication was always prompt and polite, and he was tremendously accommodating and responsive when attending to our last minute reservation. I would definitely recommend Kevin's place to other travelers. Thanks Kevin, and Airbnb, for another wonderful experience!
20717	4256705	10.0	10.0	54268034	Convenient location.  Kevin was VERY helpful with arranging our stay, with parking information, and his roommate meeting a relative to get the key.  Very clean apartment!
20718	4256705	10.0	10.0	55250730	Our stay in Seattle was short but so sweet! Kevin was an amazing host; very welcoming and friendly! He made us feel right at home in his beautiful condo and the view from our bedroom was absolutely spectacles. We were lucky to be able to meet him sometime. He shared his stories with us and make sure we were confirmable staying at his place. The location was great and we could just catch bus in front of his apartment to the downtown Seattle which makes it very convenient and safe late back. There were quite many restaurants nearby, so it was easy for us to grab some food on the way back.We highly recommend Kevin place for anyone, perfect for visitors and first timers in Seattle! Kevin will ensure you have a great and comfortable stay!!! 
20719	4256705	10.0	10.0	56855559	Comfortable and beautiful place to stay, nice hosts. Kevin's place is beautifully decorated for the holidays. It's a convenient location to the downtown as well! Definitely recommend.
20856	1978743	10.0	10.0	10472190	Melissa and Abil's home is inviting, lovingly maintained, and was the perfect place to stay on our 5 day trip.  They put a lot of care into making sure their guests are comfortable and happy.  I was traveling with my partner, who is vegan, and Melissa researched and made a different vegan baked good for our breakfast every morning along with plates of fresh fruit, which were laid out when we came downstairs.  She also packed our breakfast for our very early return flight.  They were very helpful with suggesting transportation routes, things to do, and places to eat.  We are considering a move to Seattle and Melissa answered all of our questions and had a lot of great insight about the city she so clearly loves.  Their home is centrally located and a good home base for exploring many different parts of the city.  I would highly recommend their place to anyone and will definitely stay there again on future trips.  Thanks for everything!
20857	1978743	10.0	10.0	10704978	Melissa and Abil are excellent hosts! You will not be disappointed with the level of comfort, privacy and price. Beats a hotel in Seattle any day. Plus, Melissa bakes continental breakfasts. Put in a request for her banana nut muffins. Thanks guys!
20858	1978743	10.0	10.0	11213183	"We stayed in both the Garden room and the Cedar Tree room during our stay.  The Cedar room was so bright and open.  The couch, chair, and desk gave us a great private place to just sit and read or work.  The art on the walls was eclectic and wonderful.  I can't wait to stay in this room again.  

This place is so much better than a hotel.  Feels like a home, with great food and good people."
20859	1978743	10.0	10.0	11354992	Melissa was amazing. I put my mother up here for a week while she was in town. Not only were the accomodations spectacular, Melissa happens to be an incredible chef. Daily my mother boasted of the delights that awaited her in the kitchen, and on my mother's birthday, Melissa was so kind as to bring her breakfast to her room! If you're looking for an amazing place to stay in Seattle, this is the place! 
20860	1978743	10.0	10.0	11617982	My daughters and I stayed with Melissa and Abil to celebrate my daughter's 30th birthday.  It was our first stay at an Air BnB and we were more than thrilled with our experience.  Such gracious hosts, beautiful house and rooms.  They gave us just enough privacy mixed in with a blend of their expertise with suggestions of things to do, transportation, restaurants ect.  We wanted for nothing and loved our stay at their home. The breakfasts were delicious and just enough to start us off on our day exploring Seattle.   I highly recommend staying with them!
20861	1978743	10.0	10.0	13154017	"My stay was very pleasant.  The room  provided all I needed and the bed was very comfy!  Melissa & her partner are great hosts.  The location is good if you need to be close to the central Seattle area, and public transportation stops are
close by.  I would definitely stay there again."
20862	1978743	10.0	10.0	13423352	We had a great stay with Melissa and Abil! Their house was beautiful and every room had its own individual style. All the artwork was gorgeous and we really enjoyed seeing the different pieces. The breakfast was always great with different teas coffees and yummy baked goods! A must do is a beer tour with Abil and ask them about any cool events going on in Seattle when your there; they both have great knowledge and could suggest something new and interesting. All in all a great stay with an awesome couple and some really cute cats!
20863	1978743	10.0	10.0	14038013	This is just home from home. No! Better. Melissa and ABil made us so welcome in their lovely home we felt like old friends. Beautiful clean room. Comfy bed. Delicious home made fresh muffins every morning, and really helpful for good addresses and how to get around. Wouldnot, could not go anywhere else.
20864	1978743	10.0	10.0	16092658	"Brilliant first airbnb experience. I came to Seattle to spend time with a friend and work the following week. It was the perfect place to do both and within easy walking distance of Capitol Hill for all our restaurant, bar and shopping needs! Other local (10 minute walk) restaurants and bars were easily accessible and recommended highly by Abil.

The room itself was adorable - plenty of closet and drawer space for two. We had water in our room ready on arrival and a lovely tour from Melissa. Every morning, a beautiful breakfast of fruit, coffee/tea and baked goods were served. When I had work early (this was every morning for a week!!!) Melissa and Abil packed some fruit to take to work with cute notes that brightened my day. They even saved me a baked good every day for when I came home. I really appreciated the little touches and detail during my stay, especially the guest shelf loaded with beer and their outside picnic table when I got a chance to relax :)

Melissa, Abil and Jenna made every effort to make my friend and I welcome :) Melissa and Abil left for a weekend and Jenna made every effort to help me and other guests on their absence. My friend enjoyed the camp fire night! I hope to stay in Cedar Tree when I come back! "
20865	1978743	10.0	10.0	16549308	Melissa and Abil could not have been more kind or accommodating. The house has been lovingly designed and decorated to make their guests comfortable and at home. The continental breakfasts were yummy! I truly felt like I was staying with friends. And the proximity to Pratt Art School, where I was taking a class, was perfect! I highly recommend their lovely home to anyone visiting the school. 
20866	1978743	10.0	10.0	16890402	"Melissa was a fantastic hostess!  My husband and I enjoyed the breakfast treats, including fresh fruit muffins.  Melissa was able to help direct us to great local spots like Chuck's, where you can get amazing beer and ice cream.

The house is in a pleasant neighborhood that is a bit more bohemian than other parts of the city. We managed to find the house via public transportation in the middle of the night, and while some of the people on the bus were a little strange, we never felt unsafe.  We ended up using the bus quite a few times, as well as Uber.  Melissa will provide you with a code that gives you a free Uber ride!

I would recommend our room, which was comfy and cozy.  Never had a problem getting to the bathroom down the hall.  All in all I would say it was a great place for us to stay on our short visit to Seattle."
20867	1978743	10.0	10.0	17508342	the house is very nice,the host is very great！
20868	1978743	10.0	10.0	18000612	This was our first time using airbnb. We couldn't have been happier with the whole experience!  We spent a total of nine nights in Melissa and Abil's comfortable and beautifully decorated home. Melissa never served the same muffin or breakfast cake twice!  All delicious and from locally found sources, as in rhubarb and apples from backyard. The fruit plate was always artfully arranged and they happily satisfied my desire for decaf coffee each morning. It was always so interesting and such fun each morning to discover who else was staying in the house and to hear their stories. We experienced a very international representation of cool folks!  Great location too! We walked to four different independent coffee houses as well as to the International District and many city parks.  My husband enjoyed the Pike's Brewery beer provided by Abil in the fridge. We both enjoyed going on her tour at Pike's Brewery as well!  Both women and Jenna were very helpful with special requests, such as using the washer, dryer, and closeline and needing help with cable connections.  Both rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable. I appreciated the white bed linens and towels. Even though the house was fairly full of guests when we stayed in the Cedar Tree room, there was never any issue with using the shared bathroom. I would definitely recommend these accommodations. The only negative thing I can think of is they did everything so well, we hated to leave!  
20869	1978743	10.0	10.0	19957933	We were warmly welcomed by the housekeeper, Jenna and by Melissa herself when she arrived a few minutes later. We found the room and ambiance very comfortable and having access to the entire house, including free beer in the fridge(!), was an unexpected bonus, as were the coffee, sliced fruit plates, and breakfast pastries created by Abil. Overall, it was more like a family gathering than a hotel experience. Highly recommended but suggest bringing a vehicle. Regular taxi service in Seattle is a bit of a gong show at the moment, apparently due to fierce competition from the Uber online service.
20870	1978743	10.0	10.0	20448075	"We had a great experience with Melissa and Abil, they are very communicative and friendly, helped us a lot with  exploring the city.
Especially the breakfasts we will remember, as Melissa baked every day a special treat for us. 
The room had all we expected, we could use the kitchen if we wanted to.
And we could do our laundry, which was great.
There is a lot of information laid out for guests and we got even two orca-cards for the bus, which we could use to travel arround in Seattle.
The house is in a nice area of Seattle, we liked to just walk there and look at the trees and houses. We got arround by bus pretty good and did not need a car.
"
20871	1978743	10.0	10.0	20826693	"This is a beautiful home, kept by beautiful people! We couldn't have been happier with our time at Melissa and Abil's place. Jenna made us feel welcome immediately, and hurried to make our room up for us early (we thought we were just dropping off our bags). The entire house is just as lovely as it looks in the photos, and immaculately clean. We truly enjoyed chatting with the hosts and felt like we had found new (old) friends!
The neighborhood is very safe and walkable--you can walk to Capitol Hill, Pike Place Market or the International District in 20-30 minutes. It's also very easy to catch a bus back home at the end of a long day exploring. The room and bed are very comfortable, and the bathroom is super nice too. Great breakfasts every day with our choice of beverage (tea). Melissa and Abil take care of every detail to make sure you have a wonderful, carefree stay. We will definitely return the next time we are in Seattle!
"
20872	1978743	10.0	10.0	21907537	This was the first time we've used Airbnb so we weren't sure what to expect, but we loved it. Both Melissa and Abil were extremely hospitable. They were always up for great conversations, especially when sitting around enjoying a local Pikes beer that Abil kindly keeps stocked for the guests. The suggestions for things to do around Seattle we found extremely useful and we did most of them. We never felt uncomfortable at any time staying with them, and we were more than comfortable in their home. The freshly baked muffins/pastries and the fresh fruit every morning was incredible. Also, because they have 4 guest rooms the chance of meeting other travelers is a good one. We absolutely loved our weekend in Seattle and if we ever make it back we will definitely be staying at Melissa and Abil's again!
20873	1978743	10.0	10.0	22583343	It's pure perfection. We were welcomed with open arms and showered with attention when appropriate. Everything was clean and there was loads of room to hang out in. Our friend became seriously ill and they helped take care of him and schedule a doctor's appointment. The hosts were accommodating and flexible with everything. A best stay anywhere ever, I recommend it to anyone going to Seattle.
20874	1978743	10.0	10.0	24095911	This has to be the coziest coolest place to stay in Airbnb. Better than 5-star hotel by far. Place is super comfortable, bed is awesome, rooms are great, super fast wifi! And I haven't even mentioned the hosts, these ladies are super awesome. On top of everything breakfast is not only delicious but nutritious.  This place and hosts will make you feel at home and possibly better!!!!
20875	1978743	10.0	10.0	24680918	"Melissa and Abil are really nice!!! The house is really adorable. They really care about their guest, we felt just like at home. We had wonderful breakfast everyday mad by Melissa. If we have chance to come to Seattle, we will definitely visit this place again!!!!

"
20876	1978743	10.0	10.0	25335342	We had a wonderful time!  We didn't meet Melissa and Abil as their assistant, Courtney, was left in charge. She was a terrific host and extremely gracious and accommodating ... and her breakfasts were delicious!
20877	1978743	10.0	10.0	25715571	It s the second time we stay there because it s cozy and the hosts are fantastics. This time my  lost his passport in Portland airport. Melissa organized everything to have it back! And of course the freshly baked muffins are still delicious! Well it was perfect as usual!! 
20878	1978743	10.0	10.0	26270140	"I still can't believe what a stroke of luck it was finding Melissa and Abil. Scouting the perfect location for a short film can be one of the most difficult things to do on a budget. When I saw the most suitable place (this is an understatement) on airbnb, not only was this couple open and excited about the idea of accommodating a film crew, but they helped us through the whole day as well. Melissa is a top-notch professional chef who figured out a catering and craft service plan that kept the cast and crew morale high throughout the day. Delicious muffins, polenta stacks with pine nuts, oven-roasted yams, rosemary chicken, enchiladas with home-made sauce and Mexican rice, gourmet desserts, and plenty of fruit and vegetables and salmon and coffee to keep us going. One actress was had a handful of dietary restrictions, but Melissa took them all into account, making her feel very welcome. Also, she timed the preparation of everything to perfectly harmonize with the shooting schedule. We were constantly busy filming the whole day, but looking back now, I honestly don't know how she was able to do all of this.

When Melissa gave a tour of the whole place (they also have their own costume studio), I wondered how the house was so perfectly charming and victorian, and the only explanation has to be the years of hard work and artistic talent she and Abil put into creating it. Again, I feel touched and ridiculously lucky that they welcomed our crew. As a seasoned traveler myself, I have often wondered where someone would stay in Seattle to feel not like a traveler/tourist, but a resident of a home. This is that place.

Melissa and Abil are two intelligent and experienced, and incredibly patient people, warm conversationalists, and the whole cast/crew fell in love with them. It was a long day of filming (13+ hours), after which Abil picked out the perfect beer for each crew and cast member and we all celebrated. We certainly wouldn't have made it through the day without them, and now I know two people I'll want to stay in touch with in the years to come."
20879	1978743	10.0	10.0	27983305	I arrived late nite on a short notice booking, and Melissa and her partner Abil were extremely warm and friendly welcoming me to their huge, historical home in Seattle's central district.  I was in Seattle for a short time and in fact spent just a short 2 nite's in a very comfortable room with ample space and privacy, just what I needed to rest up after spending a fast weekend out socializing w old friends.  The hosts provide great hospitality and there are many small, but welcome details such as water pitcher/ glasses in the room and continental style breakfast.  Very cool house and property!
20880	1978743	10.0	10.0	28435685	"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great.  Melissa  met me at the door , gave me the tour, and I immediately felt at home.  The old Victorian home was spotless through out, tastefully and interestingly decorated.  My bed and bedding was very comfortable.  Fresh baked muffins, fruit and coffee were a perfect start every morning.
  The neighborhood is residential  and quiet.  A few restaurants within walking distance.  Figure out how use the bus system and you can go anywhere for cheap.  Take the 3 or 4 bus from the corner stop to 3rd street, from  3rd you can walk, bus , train, or trolley anywhere.  Get a samosa at the bodega across from the bus stop while you are waiting.
 Melissa, Abil, and Courtney were fun, easy to talk to, and made me feel I could really relax and ""let my hair down"" 
  Oh, I almost forgot the best thing.  A refrigerator shelf full of complimentary beer!
"
20881	1978743	10.0	10.0	29738663	"I consider ""Bed, Baked and Beyond"" to have been a very lucky find and I recommend it very highly. The hosts, Melissa and Abil and their assistant Courtney are all friendly, thoughtful and helpful. There are 2 cats. El Gato is aging and sedate, while Perla is elusive almost to the point of invisibility. The neighborhood is convenient to downtown and to Capitol Hill and is lovely in its own right.  If you bring a car, the hosts will provide you a guest pass allowing you to park in the street without time restrictions. The house and rooms are tastefully appointed with many thoughtful touches such as a desk and a pitcher of drinking water and glasses in every room.  The wifi is reliable. Guest rooms are on the second floor and there are comfortable sitting rooms on the first available for use by yourself and your guests. Every morning there is a breakfast consisting of fresh fruit, your choice of coffee or tea and Melissa's baked goods of the day, usually two muffins per person.  Melissa is a chef with a large repertoire and the baked goods are varied and delicious.

Based upon a stay of almost 3 weeks, I think the clientele is another advantage here. I met friendly people from the UK, China and South America.

The only potential problems during a stay here that I can imagine would be for people who have difficulty negotiating a flight of stairs or who are allergic to cats.  Unless, of course, you bring your problems with you."
20882	1978743	10.0	10.0	30578605	This was my first stay through Airbnb and it certainly set the bar high for any future trips. Melissa and Abil (and their assistant Courtney) were very welcoming and instantly made me feel right at home. Their home is a true Seattle historical gem that is beautiful inside and out. My room was bright, clean and comfortable. I was taking a class at the local hospital and they made sure that I had fresh fruit and coffee each morning before I left. The house is located in a really fun neighborhood with many bars and restaurants within walking distance. I only wish that I had had more time to explore the neighborhood and house. I fully intend on returning for a longer trip with friends in the future. 
20883	1978743	10.0	10.0	32357839	We really enjoyed our stay at the Cedar Tree guesthouse. Melissa and Courtney were easy to communicate with and very accommodating about our arrival time. Courtenay greeted us and was super friendly. The house was very lovely and well maintained, felt right at home. Comfortable bed, very clean and well appointed. Loved the artwork and books. We had the run of the house and helped ourselves to delicious leftover muffins at midnight after returning from dancing. Overall great experience. 
20884	1978743	10.0	10.0	34132870	"This was our first time to use Airbnb and what a pleasant surprise. Our problem now is Melissa has set the bar of expectations too high that most will surely suffer.  
Courtney who welcomed us when we arrived immediately attended to our needs by answering the typical queries of a first timer in a place.  And she gave us a tour of the house.
The place was as pictured, if not more. In this case the place was much nicer ""live"".
Melissa's muffins were something else.  Even her coffee was also very good.  Complaints, minor ones, were immediately attended to.  Melissa's wife  helped us in finding solutions to our travel issues. 
The couple indeed will make guests will at home thus improving the overall quality of one's vacation.  "
20885	1978743	10.0	10.0	34939722	Our hosts Melissa and Abil and their assistant Courtney were so charming, warm, intelligent and joyful.  Their home is beautiful..clean, inviting, full of character and lovingly appointed. Breakfast is simply and deliciously homemade - healthy and served on china! Our room the Cherry Cedar was quiet and so very comfy.  Their garden and outdoor sitting area was picturesque with flowers birds squirrels and a very cool housecat smartly named El Gato. We Loved our stay with these amazing ladies...truly we wished we had booked a longer time.. We really felt at home.

The room is quite spacious, with a dresser, desk and big closet which are not shown in the main picture. I travel light, and my hosts provide me with towels and shower essentials. I find myself feeling at home in this place. 

It is also a safe neighborhood to walk around.  "
20888	1978743	10.0	10.0	36569189	All the hosts were extremely welcoming and super sweet! They'll do anything to make you feel at home and help out with almost anything, such as getting around Seattle, etc.The room in my opinion looks a lot better in person than the photos. The neighborhood is a bit old fashion but it has great bus lines that'll take you to UW and downtown area without any transfers. Parking is super easy which is also a plus, most likely will stay here again!!
20889	1978743	10.0	10.0	37177646	Melissa and Abil are gracious and entertaining hosts.  Our room was large, clean, comfortable and decorative.  Melissa makes delicious gluten-free muffins! We enjoyed our stay and we would stay with Melissa and Abil again.
20890	1978743	10.0	10.0	38119542	"Melissa and Abil are amazing hosts! They are so thoughtful, and really took the time to make sure we had a comfortable stay while exploring Seattle. We were so grateful for their travel recommendations, since we were traveling from the NYC area and weren't too familiar with the neighborhood. By the end of our trip, we felt like pros! :)

Their bed and breakfast is beautiful, conveniently located, and there was plenty of on-street parking on their block. I can't say enough good things about our stay -- We can't wait to come back again! Thanks for all of your hospitality, Melissa & Abil!"
20891	1978743	10.0	10.0	38600651	"As a Superhost myself in San Francisco, I have a good idea what it is like to create a setting and experience for Airbnb guests.  I can tell you that my stay at Melissa and Abil's home was fantastic.  They are both such warm, inviting and open hosts that make everyone feel welcome and special.  

The home itself is wonderful as they've fixed up a beautiful 1903 home to be the ultimate pensione for visitors to Seattle.  I stayed in a wonderful room that was clean, roomy, had great cross ventilation and just down right comfortable.  There are other rooms on the same floor that also look great.  The two bathrooms they have are convenient, clean and well equipped.

Melissa makes a fresh continental breakfast each morning including fresh fruit and it was divine each day.  I also had many wonderful conversations with Abil who is a fantastic woman.

One final note, I am quite allergic to cats, and they have two cats living in and around their home, but there was not once that I had any trace of allergies in my room and that was a huge and wonderful  benefit.  

All in all, this is a great place to stay for anyone coming to Seattle.  It is also especially close to Seattle University.  Very highly recommended!!
"
20892	1978743	10.0	10.0	39063695	Our experience with Melissa, Abil, and Courtney set the bar for what home away from home should be! We felt instantly welcomed and charmed by the aesthetics and history of their home. But it was the hosts that made it all come together so perfectly. The reviews and photos were spot on and we can not say enough great things about our experience. In fact we did not want to leave and only wished we had more time to stay and talk with everyone. Don't think twice or waste your time and money elsewhere. Book your stay or private event here, they book up very quickly!
20893	1978743	10.0	10.0	39542433	Melissa, Abil and their assistant were absolutely wonderful and welcoming. We felt at home right away in their beautiful home.

20895	1978743	10.0	10.0	40232768	"Abil and Melissa were delightful hosts and wonderful, funny ladies to be around during my recent 3 night stay in Seattle.   I felt completely at home the entire time.   The Arty ""Cedar Tree"" Room of this beautiful and charming home is exactly as advertised- clean, comfortable, and cozy, all the while having a artsy aesthetic and an overall great vibe.  The bed is particularly heavenly-- just sayin'. 

Upon arrival, I was greeted by Abil and immediately given a tour of the entire home.  Everything including daily procedures, home etiquette, directions to and from downtown Seattle, as well as transportation, and nearby restaurants and cafes.  Both Abil and Melissa were extremely helpful in suggesting the best local spots to visit.  You're given keys to your room and the house as well and complementary breakfast is served from 8-8:30 every morning including delicious muffins (made by Melissa) fruit, and coffee.  There's also a lounge area out back in the shed which they've transformed into a cozy space for a recreation of your choice.  Also, don't forget to say hi to their cat ""El Gato"" if you bump into him along the way.

Just can't say enough good things about this place.   I will definitely return the next time I'm in town! "
20896	1978743	10.0	10.0	40900619	Melissa and Abel were fantastic hosts! We had such a blast in their beautiful home. This is not a typical air bnb experience because they take it to the next level. We were served a beautiful breakfast of fresh fruit and fresh baked muffins every morning along with our choice of coffee or tea. Two lounge rooms, big dining room and kitchen all available for guests to use as well as plenty of outdoor space. They had plenty of recommendations for our stay as well. Courtney the house assistant was also extremely helpful, so you had three great ladies there and available if you needed anything. We highly recommend staying here if you're in Seattle! Location wise, it's a close walk to the Capital Hill area and a longer walk and short uber ride to Pike's place. Oh and we can't forget the fridge full of complementary beer for the guests! Not a thing to complain about here! We were even fed dinner the first night we arrived thanks to Courtney cooking up a large batch of chicken pot pie! So lucky to have found this place and will stay here again if we come back to Seattle!!
20897	1978743	10.0	10.0	41237644	This place is hands down the BEST bnb you can imagine. Warm, humble beautiful hosts, great attention to detail and amazing cooking. The muffins for breakfast are to die for (and Pikes Place beer stocked in the fridge is a bonus). Our hosts had great knowledge and understanding of the local area and their passion for showing off Seattle made our stay the most incredible experience we've ever had traveling. Thanks so much for your hospitality. If you're in town make this your number one stop for AirBnB, you will love it! 
20898	1978743	10.0	10.0	42688712	"This was the best airbnb experience I've ever had! Melissa and Abil were welcoming hosts, even stocking the refrigerator with free beer for guests. The room itself was tastefully furnished, clean, and comfortable. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I've never slept so well away from home (even in comparison to hotels)! 

Every morning, a light breakfast of tasty, homemade muffins were provided along with fruit. Melissa and Abil were both quite knowledgeable about Seattle, and my husband and I had a great time chatting with them about the wonderful city. Street parking was not a problem, and the location itself is convenient to downtown. Overall, Melissa and Abil made us feel right at home with their kind hospitality, and I would not hesitate to stay at their place again in the future."
20899	1978743	10.0	10.0	45074286	Excellent accommodations and excellent hosts!! Super wonderful place to stay for any trip you have to the Seattle area. The hosts were very welcoming, everything in the accommodations was as posted. It was not like staying in someone's home, but in an actual Bed & Breakfast. The complimentary breakfast of muffins and fruit was delightful! We will absolutely book here again!!!
20900	1978743	10.0	10.0	46325851	Melissa and Abil are fantastic hosts who seem to love what they do, and they do a wonderful job keeping up with all their guests and making sure everyone has a great time. The location was great for us (just a short stroll to get to downtown or public transport) and our room was very nice, clean and cozy. Melissa was very great at accommodating my difficult dietary restrictions and the great local beer in the refrigerator was a very nice touch. All in all, the reviews don't lie; very positive experience and a great place to enjoy what the city has to offer!
20901	1978743	10.0	10.0	47104911	From the moment I walked through the door I felt like was at my friends' home.  I arrived late in the evening from Olympia and Melissa immediately offered me something to eat.  The room was great, the bed was comfortable, and everything was super clean.  I had to leave for a meeting early in the morning so they saved me fresh fruit and a muffin for when I got home.  They also were flexible on when I turned in my keys and parking pass which was helpful since I had to be at a conference until 4pm.  This was a wonderful first time airbnb experience.  Thanks to Melissa and Abil!!!! 
20902	1978743	10.0	10.0	51695366	This place is amazing. Melissa and Abil are wonderful hosts and really make you feel at home. They have a great knowledge of the city and great suggestions for things to do. The house is beautiful and amazing as well. My husband and I did 7 days in Seattle for our honeymoon and cannot express how much fun we had. Thank you so much for everything!
20903	1978743	10.0	10.0	54459896	It's our third time at Bed Bake and Beyond and as usual, our stay was perfect. Abil and Melissa know how to make you feel at home. We walked down to Downtown Seattle, it's only 30 min and it a great way to discover the city. The neighborhood is very pleasant and peaceful. There are some very nice restaurants near by and we're also close by Lake Washington for a nice run on the morning. 
21125	3024336	10.0	10.0	14297714	Fantastic house in a great location. Very close to public transportation and lots of great places to eat nearby. It's a very comfortable home and having 1.5 baths is great. Camille let us use her washer and dryer which is an added bonus and we optimistically brought too many summer clothes and not enough cool weather clothes. She also had a lot of fantastic tips of where to eat. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
21126	3024336	10.0	10.0	14626811	The townhouse is clean and modern as shown in the photos.  We were able to fit our compact car in the garage which made it more convenient. The place is in a fantastic location with many great restaurants within walking distance.  Other than occasional noise from people leaving pubs at night, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place.  Camille was quick to respond to any question I had for her and gave us tips on where to eat in the area.
21127	3024336	10.0	10.0	15048555	"For a first time user of Airbnb, I couldn't have had a better experience. Camille will go out of her way to settle any unknowns that may pop up for your trip. Her beautiful home made my trip greater in magnitude than I anticipated. The pictures in her listing don't do it any justice. Whenever I can visit Seattle again I will most definitely consider her place of stay. You will surely say ""we're home"" when you arrive at the front door after a full day of experiencing Seattle. Bonus: a bar with Bocce ball around the corner!"
21128	3024336	10.0	10.0	15684416	Camille was absolutely amazing! She not only provided her wonderful home to us but left us with detailed instructions for everything we could possibly need.  In addition, she left us with a list of some wonderful places to try nearby.  She was easy to get a hold of and was really quick with responding.  She was incredibly accommodating to all my needs and requests.  The home was very clean and well maintained and it was in a fantastic neighbourhood.  I would strongly recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay close to DT Seattle.  I will for sure be contacting Camille when I return to Seattle one day!
21129	3024336	10.0	10.0	16088973	The listing was beautiful! The beds were soft and comfortable and the kitchen area was stocked with anything we would need to cook during our time there. The neighborhood was full of little corner stores and lots of bars for the evening. Camille was attentive and responsive with any questions or issues we had throughout our stay. Wonderful host! 
21130	3024336	10.0	10.0	16558115	Listing was just as described, and just what we wanted. Beautiful and comfortable home, helpful hosts, and great neighborhood
21131	3024336	10.0	10.0	17448014	We absolutely loved staying here. The neighborhood was so interesting and convenient to everything we wanted to do, the space so comfortable and cozy, the host do accommodating: they thought of everything, right down to great coffee and great neighborhood recommendations. Thank you, thank you.
21132	3024336	10.0	10.0	18315562	Me and my friends stayed here over the weekend and had a blast! The area is very accessible to walkways so we walked to downtown seattle everyday (30 minute walk). The house is very cute and tidy. The mattress on the couch is also so comfy! Also there are so many great restaurants nearby. The population of this area is mostly students since it is close to the university but that's what we enjoyed most. The nightlife is also very alive :) recommend staying with Camille. 
21133	3024336	10.0	10.0	18570915	"The apartment was lovely, clean and well equipped. The location was perfect for access to Seattle U, Capitol Hill and for walking down town.
Camille was really friendly, helpful and welcoming.
I can't recommend it enough!"
21134	3024336	10.0	10.0	18875695	"Wow, my experience with the house and Camille were amazing. I was in town for PAX Prime and I didn't want to pay up the wazoo for the hotels in downtown. No way, dudes. No way.

The space is true to the pictures posted and it wasn't difficult to find. You can take the Link from SeaTac and transfer onto the bus to reach the house. No biggie. If you want to go into the city, walking is plausible but if you walk back, you have hills to climb. Haha.

The neighborhood has the college vibe going on because Seattle University is right there. So are the bars and restaurants. Sometimes it gets rowdy at night with those whippersnappers, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

As for Camille, she was spectacular! She was very accommodating and so nice. She went out of her way to help me out every time. I don't think I could thank her enough.

All in all, great place, great host. I highly recommend her.

"
21135	3024336	10.0	10.0	19271197	"Let me start off by saying that communication with Camille was very easy and the response was almost immediate. I never had to worry about getting information regarding the home or the reservation. Check-in and check-out couldn't be easier.

The townhouse is beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice! It's very modern and tasteful with a lot of unique touches that really make the place feel warm and inviting. I was in town for a volleyball tournament, and this townhouse was the perfect place to relax after a long, tiring day. I spent many nights on the patio enjoying the ambiance.

In terms of location, it's in an ideal spot. I was able to walk to Capitol Hill within 10 minutes and be around lots of restaurants, shops, and nightlife. Even better, it's like 2 blocks away from the frozen custard place! It's close to several bus lines that go to downtown, but you could easily walk that as well. It's also 1 block from Seattle University, so if you're child attends school there, it's also very convenient when you are visiting.

I would highly recommend Camille's home for your travels. Whenever I'm in Seattle, this will be the first place I look. Hopefully it'll be available, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's booked."
21136	3024336	10.0	10.0	19691481	"Camille was a great host!  This was my first time using airbnb and she made the entire process easy from check in to great things to do in their neighborhood.  The apartment was perfect for what I needed - was a great place to relax when not out exploring Seattle.  There are so many great restaurants all within 3 blocks including some of the best sushi I have had.  

Camille made sure everything was smooth during check in and the entire stay, even letting me leave my bags after I checked out since I had a flight much later in the day.  She had coffee ready to be made for the mornings and a full list of must sees.  I will definitely stay there again when I come back to Seattle."
21137	3024336	10.0	10.0	20083743	This place is fantastic! The pictures and description sold me on the listing and I was not at all disappointed. Camille is a fantastic host. She left great suggestions for places around the neighborhood, all sorts of directions for the house and even left her favorite local coffee for us to drink. So close to everything you want to do on the Hill without the bustle. Great, quiet neighborhood. Couldn't be more satisfied and hope to book with her again when I go back to Seattle. 
21138	3024336	10.0	10.0	20502353	"Wow, I can't think of a better place to stay while in Seattle. Camille's home was incredibly beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. 
As comfortable and stylish as the digs are, the location is the real winner. It is a very easy walk to almost anywhere in the city, including Pikes Place, the Space Needle, downtown, and to about a million restaurants, shops and bars. 
While it can be overwhelming visiting a new city for the first time and trying to figure out where to eat and what to see, we walked around like seasoned pros based on Camille's recommendations. 
I have a new favorite city, and I can't even imagine looking elsewhere if Camille's place is available! "
21139	3024336	10.0	10.0	20926699	Communication with Camille was easy and friendly. The house has an excellent location. The space was as described and we feel comfortable at the house. Everybody enjoyed the time we had in Seattle.

Walking distance from the downtown too - especially the downhill leg! The apartment is well laid out and very roomy. The flat was exceptionally clean and well prepared for our stay. Bed was very comfortable and also a proper double sofa bed. Balcony was an added bonus too.
21141	3024336	10.0	10.0	22617116	Camille's property was amazing. She left us brownies and a list of great spots to check out while I was in town. The location of the property couldn't have been better. It is literally walking distance from  no less than 20 restaurants/bars. Couldn't ask for a better stay!
21142	3024336	10.0	10.0	23481860	This apartment is even more impressive than on the pictures. The couch was probably the most comfortable one we've ever enjoyed. The decoration was very nice. We didn't meet the host, but she left us a list of highlights in Seattle and other instructions concerning the apartment. The neighborhood itself is not extremely exciting, but it's close to downtown. We can definitely recommend this place.
21143	3024336	10.0	10.0	24444055	Camille has a beautiful house and we had a great time staying there. We had everything that we could need, including some bonuses like delicious specialty coffee! It was also helpful to be able to park in the garage. My favorite thing about this house was the walking distance to Elysian brewery on Pike. We would definitely stay again. 
21144	3024336	10.0	10.0	26718957	This was by far my favorite Airbnb experience! Camille's place is beautiful, impeccably clean, and in an amazing location. Camille was incredibly communicative and helpful with everything. She left us a list of her favorite local places and some local coffee to try out... so thoughtful!

21148	3024336	10.0	10.0	34456186	Beautiful home in a great Cap Hill Location!  We arrived to a personalized note from Camille with all the information we would need to use the wifi, TV, etc.  Even though the temperatures were in the 90s during our stay, the home managed to stay relatively cool which was nice.  Everything we needed was easy to find and the checkout procedure was way easier than some other AirBnBs I've rented.
21149	3024336	10.0	10.0	35194064	My mother and sister and I travelled to Seattle for my son's graduation from Seattle U.   We stayed at Camille and Gaelen's airbnb which was PERFECT!   It was just one block to the University where my graduating son and his brother stayed in the dorms.   The place is just adorable!   So comfortable, and unique!   We waked to everything - wonderful restaurants, Trader Joe's.  
21150	3024336	10.0	10.0	35798480	Camille was a great host! My friends and I really enjoyed our stay and it was walking distance to a lot of eateries/bars. It wasn't too far from all the touristy spots either. Camille also provided us with all the necessary info we needed to get around town and if we had any questions, she was just a text away. Definitely recommend staying at her place when visiting Seattle.

The condo is extremely clean and nicely furnished. The full kitchen allowed us to shop at the neighborhood safeway for basic groceries to cook and enjoy homemade meals. The bed downstairs in the living room was so comfortable. The location for us was perfect! We walked to local restaurants and bars each day and all the ""tourist"" stuff we wanted to see was a quick 10-15 min drive. We enjoyed our stay very much."

21155	3024336	10.0	10.0	41085777	"Camille was a wonderful host and we loved our time in this modern home! The extra care she took in approving us to stay, to us only meant that she cares deeply about her home.  We felt very welcome with the list of places she enjoys visiting, maps and tour books, and the couch turned into a bed (that you never would have thought was a couch after the restful sleep it provided.) We found ourselves needing nothing that she didn't already have available for our use. Although we got along without a car, she provided the garage door opener in case we needed it. Capital Hill was a short walk and further on you could get to downtown Seattle. We got around the city by walking and using Ubers - which were great! 
"
21156	3024336	10.0	10.0	42121485	I could not have asked for a better first-time Air BnB experience. Camille made everything very easy. From simple and detailed instructions to get into the apartment to a great welcome letter with a list of things to do in the area. Camille's home was in a great neighborhood with easy access to the whole city. Also, the home was even better than the pictures. I had no issue with this listing. I would definitely recommend, Camille is a professional!
21157	3024336	10.0	10.0	43246088	"We had an awesome time here. We were kind of high maintenance with early check in, but Camille was completely accommodating. The neighborhood is great. Good for walking and a good central location to get around on public transit. I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. 

Camille gave us a great list with local restaurants/shops to visit. Highly recommended. "
21158	3024336	10.0	10.0	44131077	This home is stellar. The place is very charming and extremely clean, well appointed and comfortable. The beds are fabulous and we slept very well. Camille has a sweet place!  We've stayed at a lot of airbnb's and this place has an excellent balance of personal charm and anonymous luxury. If you're used to trolling airbnb for the perfect place, then you'll know what I mean. If you're newer to airbnb, then just trust me: this place is a gem. Aside from the kickass kitchen, lovely common space, comfortable beds, squeaky clean condition, and darling outdoor space, it's located in a ultra cool area just walking distance from everything cute about Capitol Hill. Can't recommend this place more. Thank you very much Camille!
21159	3024336	10.0	10.0	45382557	Listing was excellent! They left a lovely detailed note for us with instructions + recommendations of local food, and some great coffee to indulge in. Everything was well kept and clean, the house was pleasant and in a great neighborhood. Overall great!
21160	3024336	10.0	10.0	46301742	Camille's duplex apartment was comfortable and clean. Our favorite feature was the balcony, which overlooked a quaint, leafy street. We also took advantage of the garage which, as the host notes, can only fit a compact car. The location is convenient, with plenty of food and drink options nearby.
21161	3024336	10.0	10.0	47847536	Camill'a place was roomy, modern, and very close to all the action in Caphill. The garage parking was a great convenience, though street parking is easy to find. Highly recommended!
21162	3024336	10.0	10.0	48772689	What a wonderful experience! We booked the Sparkling Modern Seattle Home because of its great airbnb reviews and are absolutely happy with our choice. The apartment is situated in a quiet side street close to Pike and Pine Street and offers everyhing we (two couples) could wish for. Two comfortable beds, a fully equipped kitchen and a beautiful bathroom with hot water and fresh towels. The location close to downtown is superb. We went for dinner in Cascina Spinasse which is only two blocks away. Best pasta we ever tasted. Long story short: you don't have to look any further. Book this place and you won't be disappointed! 
21163	3024336	10.0	10.0	51501348	"Our stay was amazing! Awesome town home in a beautiful neighbourhood. Lots of bars and places to eat nearby which is ideal! We also were able to easily walk downtown and Uber/Cab anywhere else we needed to go. 

The place had everything we needed and was very clean/organized when we arrived. We didn't get to meet Camille but check in was easy and smooth. Would definitely stay again! "
21776	3691288	10.0	10.0	53867015	My friends were visiting me in Seattle so I booked the house for them to stay. We had 7 people and the house has more than enough space to accommodate all of us. Everything was great. The house was very clean and perfect for our needs. It's only a few minutes away from Chinatown and Capitol Hill where all of the restaurants and bars are located. Young was very attentive to our needs and made sure we had everything we needed. We also appreciated that there was washer and dryer in the house. I would highly recommend this house for anyone visiting Seattle. 
21777	3691288	10.0	10.0	55584246	I loved staying at Young's place. The place is heated and has everything we needed. The house is exactly as described in the listing, so i am not going to repeat that. I would definitely come again if possible.
21778	3691288	10.0	10.0	55704827	"Our host was incredibly gracious and accommodating.  Young went out of his way to take care of our needs.  The house is charming:  

Modern, clean, comfortable and the location is optimal.  The price was right, and the experience was start to finish delightful."
21779	3691288	10.0	10.0	57570187	The place is nice and neat. Young is very nice and helpful. The kitchen is great and has everything we need for fixing light meals. The location is close to highway and bus stop. We definitely will stay here again when we visit Seattle next time.
21780	3691288	10.0	10.0	57906529	"Great location in an up & coming neighborhood that is a short drive from Downtown Seattle. Nice little house that will comfortably house a family or group of friends.

25106	7439802	10.0	10.0	46910730	The penthouse is stunning. A work of art! Chasten was over the top accommodating to us and really went out of his way to make sure everything went smoothly. Cannot recommend this luxurious stay enough!
25107	7439802	10.0	10.0	48748309	5 Stars!!!  The penthouse is well appointed and beautifully decorated. Chasten is quick to respond to any questions.  It was a great central location to explore Seattle. We did a ton of walking and used Uber when we needed it.  Would book this listing again in a heartbeat!  
25108	7439802	10.0	10.0	51324201	Chasten's penthouse was amazing!  Top of the line finishes, convenient location, and a luxurious feel.  Chasten was prompt in all communication and he made me and my guests feel very welcomed.  Would not hesitate to stay there again on my next visit to Seattle.
25109	7439802	10.0	10.0	54250499	Have you ever walked into a place and couldn't believe how spectacular it was and how you were hoping it wasn't a mistake that you were lucky enough to be staying there?  Like the best dream you didn't want to end?  I have just described the grace, beauty and sophistication of Chasten's penthouse.  If you ever have the opportunity to rent it, don't hesitate! It is wonderfully located just two blocks from Whole Foods, a tram across the street and Pike's Place Market no more than a 15 minute walk. It is beautifully and masterfully decorated and appointed.  There is nothing more you could ask for in the kitchen for the most gourmet of chefs.  The bathrooms and showers were so spa-like.  The view occupied three walls of windows and the roof was so great, I wished it weren't raining so I could barbecue up there. Speaking of rain, it gives you a great excuse to cocoon inside the penthouse with a great bottle of wine, some smoked salmon, grapes and figs from Pike's Place, and some French bread from Le Panier wishing that you could live there forever.  Chasten has done everything possible to this penthouse to make me want it as my own, from great art, to wonderful conversation inspiring books and collections of heartfelt objects.  It is an oasis to a weary traveler that speaks of world treasures within its own walls, offering insight into the world outside, while keeping you surrounded by the ultimate in comfort and luxury inside.  Chasten, you have done a masterful job!

25111	7439802	10.0	10.0	57134879	Chasten was easy to communicate with and very accommodating and a gracious host. We had everything we needed and the place was just amazing. Impeccably clean, simple, modern and luxurious ambience. It was a perfect place for our family to unwind after a busy day of exploring the city.
25112	7439802	10.0	10.0	57439512	Great penthouse unit in the happening South Lake Union neighborhood.  Not a single thing could be improved.  Top notch.  Chasten was responsive, even though he was in Europe on vacation.  Hope to stay there again.  
25577	3876097	9.0	10.0	18041525	Tessa is just wonderful and a great person to meet and stay with. The apartment is just off of Discovery Park for any nature lovers looking for a great walk and there are buses right outside that take you downtown in about 15 minutes. It's the best of both worlds. 
25578	3876097	9.0	10.0	18606969	With a welcoming and gentle presence,  Tessa was a generous and truly caring host. She was flexible when I had an unexpected delay in my arrival time.  Tessa is genuinely interested in people and we had some great conversations. The part of town where she lives is next to a beautiful park and has great bus access.  No problem with street parking and tea was offered several times.  Highly recommended! !
25579	3876097	9.0	10.0	18640622	Tessa is a wonderful host, really welcoming and friendly and made my first AirBnB experience really enjoyable. We spent a good few hours over my 2 day stay talking about travelling, our experiences and life over many cups of tea. When I asked (very last minute) to stay on for a third day, she accommodated me with no problems at all - she is very flexible and easy going. There is a supermarket 5 minutes away from her house and there is a bus stop that takes you straight to town just outside her doorstep, as well as a beautiful park a 2 minute walk away. The neighborhood is safe and easy to access.
25580	3876097	9.0	10.0	18642431	The reservation was canceled 49 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
25581	3876097	9.0	10.0	18933579	Tessa was welcoming and accommodating. The couch was comfy and I slept well. This space is right by Discovery Park which is a huge plus.
25582	3876097	9.0	10.0	35613963	I had a fantastic experience staying with Tessa. She was a wonderful host who made sure I felt at home as soon as I walked in the door, offering me a cup of tea and sitting down for a chat. Her home is very clean and comfortable and the neighborhood is gorgeous. One of my favourite AirBnB experiences to date.
25583	3876097	9.0	10.0	35984935	Tessa was a wonderful host. Her home was comfortable and cozy- while I was there, she slept in the living room as well but had put up screens so that each of us had a little privacy in our spaces. Her home smelled like Eucalyptus. She was flexible about my arrival time and even let me stay an extra night with her. I didn't get to spend much time chatting with her but it was a wonderful and affordable place to rest for a couple of nights- and the bus to downtown is pretty easy to navigate from her home as well!
25584	3876097	9.0	10.0	36325393	"Tessa was such a wonderful host. She welcomed me right as I arrived and recommended some great places to visit around the area. Her apartment was very easy to get to and on-street parking was always available. The entrance to Discovery Park was just across the street! Great, quiet location. 

Tessa was exceptionally kind and we shared many great conversations. I had an excellent stay. I highly recommend staying at her place if you are in Seattle. "
25585	3876097	9.0	10.0	37684294	Tessa was such a gracious host and made my stay in Seattle very pleasant and enjoyable! She's such a sweetheart and I had a wonderful time visiting.
25586	3876097	9.0	10.0	38778817	Tessa really helpful and friendly，and pretty nice place，beauty and quiet surrounding.
25587	3876097	9.0	10.0	40816275	Tessa was a fantastic host during my short stay. She has a very warm and kind personality and made me feel at ease in the space immediately. Her place is located in a safe area and also very close to the Zoo which I had plans to visit. I would definitely recommend a stay with Tessa she is a delight! 
25588	3876097	9.0	10.0	41017766	Tessa was so fantastic and welcoming during my short day for only 1 night. Her place is so quiet and peaceful. She offered me fresh fruits and warm black tea,both were my favorite.  The couch was so cozy and I really enjoyed a good night~ I definitely recommend a wonderful stay with her~ Thanks~
25589	3876097	9.0	10.0	48052548	"My stay in Tessa's House was awesome :)
She is very welcoming and friendly. She also offered me some tea and fruits. She took care of me as a daughter during I stay :) Thank you very much Tessa!
The couch is very comfortable and bathroom is clean as well. I totally recommend her couch! I want to go her house if I go to Seattle again :)"
25590	3876097	9.0	10.0	48849300	Tessa was an awesome host! She greeted me at the door with hot tea and we sat and chatted for a while. The house was clean and  organized. The couch was very comfortable and I felt welcomed the entire time.
25591	3876097	9.0	10.0	54824375	Soooooo happy to stay here. The host is a very gorgeous and friendly lady. We talk many about the city. The life style and the cooking things. So warm to be live here. Will stay more days next time. 
25656	8173487	10.0	10.0	46107432	Leroy was an amazing host! He was extremely accommodating when I booked for one night and then immediately changed my mind wanted to extend my stay another night. He stocked his refrigerator with appetizers and drinks for the 5 of us staying. I don't have enough praise for this host. I would most definitely go back! The view was incredible and very close to fun bars/restaurants. Two thumbs up! 
25657	8173487	10.0	10.0	55408732	The place is awesome, and the location is great as well. Nice kitchen, comfortable beds, off street parking, great views. However, the heat did not work, and it was below freezing outside! Leroy responded by text, offering to pay for a space heater, which we bought, and he did pay for it, in addition to $40 extra. However, the penthouse is really too big to be heated by a space heater, and we never were comfortable, temperature-wise. Additionally, the shower head in the master bathroom was unusable, it hung straight down, next to the wall, with water coming straight down from about the 5 feet level. And finally, there is no window covering in the second bedroom, although the window of the opposing apartment is a mere 15 feet away! I asked Leroy by email if he was going to fix these things, because the location is great for us, but I haven't had a response yet. If he does, I would love to stay here again!
28002	3820186	10.0	10.0	19853449	Sea To Sky's Penthouse in Belltown was the perfect place for me and my co-workers. We were in town for business and found this to be an incredible alternative to impersonal (and booked up) hotels in Seattle. The views are amazing, the layout of the flat perfect for providing lots of personal space, and we had every amenity we could ask for including a lovely gas fireplace for the cooler evenings. The concierge service downstairs is very helpful and allows you to pick up and drop off keys at any time. Belltown is conveniently located near downtown and is close to convenient stores, delicious Macrina bakery, as well as tons of restaurant choices along 2nd and 1st Aves. Recommend this spot enthusiastically!
28003	3820186	10.0	10.0	26591501	"A group of 8 girls stayed at the Olympus for a Bachelorette party and we couldn't be more pleased. The service inside with the concierge was great, the penthouse itself was great and the overall neighborhood was amazing. We had a front row view of the water right outside on our patio - it was absolutely amazing.

When we did have problems with the penthouse, i.e. one of the toilets flushed incredibly slowly, SeaToSky responded back very quickly and had the problem fixed in no time. 

I would very much love to stay at the Olympus again should I return with another big party."
28070	4677524	10.0	10.0	26257872	This charming studio suite was the perfect size and space for our trip to Seattle. It is located in a great stretch of Belltown with easy walking access to all the common tourist sites. Marilyn has appointed the suite with great bedding and towels and a complete kitchen that comes in handy for cooking up those finds from the market. We didn't get around to using the pool or gym, but they looked awesome. I will definitely be back.
28071	4677524	10.0	10.0	27184401	The location and building were quite lovely, as was the place itself. I loved that that kitchen had everything I'd need for preparing healthy food while travelling. Bed was super comfy too, and decor was beautiful. Communication was great.
28072	4677524	10.0	10.0	28571723	Second time I've stayed at Marilyn's flat- Marilyn is friendly, communicative, and the flat itself is quite nice. Recommended :)
28073	4677524	10.0	10.0	28950018	I absolutely loved my stay in this condo... to the point that I felt heavy and sad when I left. I came to Seattle for vacation and found an oasis of space and beauty in this studio. I loved the quiet this building offered and the view was incredible. Entry and departure were easy as could be and Marilyn offered much flexibility for my early arrival. I felt so at home in this space and spent almost as much time in it as I did wandering Seattle. I truly needed a space to escape work and the busyness of life and found this to be the perfect spot. I was able to make one meal during my stay and enjoyed how clean the entire space was. The location could not have been better - Pike Place Market is within walking distance, in addition to the Macrina Bakery and Belltown Pub, which I loved. Fantastic experience!
28074	4677524	10.0	10.0	29856115	Very nice apartment, very nice building, very well located (near space needle and pikes market), nice restaurants and bars very near. Would stay again for sure if I go back to Seattle.
28075	4677524	10.0	10.0	30190452	She was really great. easy To communicate with and answered right away 
28076	4677524	10.0	10.0	30730122	Check in/out is easy and straightforward. The apartment is a very well-laid out studio that feels more like a one bedroom. Convenient location. 
28077	4677524	10.0	10.0	31910993	This listing is in the best location of Seattle.  Everything was seamless and arriving and leaving was a breeze.  Would definitely book again.
28078	4677524	10.0	10.0	32184114	It was a nice time spending in this suite. The location is really good, convenient to walk to the Space Needle and even Pike Market.
28079	4677524	10.0	10.0	33264918	The place is really nice. Location is good with great view. Really good for traveler with no car.  
28080	4677524	10.0	10.0	40085612	"The suite was just as described, and the location was great!

Marilyn was quick to respond to our request and answer any questions.  The unit was in great shape, and had everything we needed for a great few days.  We would stay there again, next time in Seattle."
28081	4677524	10.0	10.0	40398611	Very happy with the space. So close to everything we wanted to visit. All the best restaurants are literally within 2 blocks! It's a high end apartment with very cute decor.  Marilyn was very responsive in text msg. Never met her in person, but everything was taken care of before & during the visit. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Seattle.
28082	4677524	10.0	10.0	43976307	Marilyn's place was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle. It was easy communicating with her, and she made sure we were able to get settled even after our delayed arrival from a long international flight.  It was late when we arrived, but we were well received. There were 3 of us staying here and her studio place was really clean and very comfortable. It provided us with everything we needed including parking. The location was near the reception of the wedding we were attending, but we noticed how close to so many bars and restaurants it was, so thats a plus as far as location. It was nice that we could see the space needle from where we were. I would recommend her place and we would definitely want to stay there again on our next visit.
28083	4677524	10.0	10.0	46872507	"We had a little trouble getting into the building, but Marilyn promptly responded and helped us get in. The studio was comfortable and clean when we arrived. Location was great - we spent a lot of time at Pike's Place and the pier. We only used the car when we traveled to the University District, Fremont, the  Space Needle, and the International District. There are lots of great restaurants within walking distance to the apartment. 

Some reviews mentioned that there is a lot of outside noise. Coming from NYC, we found that the noise was not at all bad, excepting the sirens that we heard on average twice in the early mornings. The noise that did bother me a bit, however, was from the person living upstairs who seemed to be stomping around everyday. 

The apartment was a nice respite after exploring Seattle. We took frequent mid-day breaks while staying there. Given the convenient location and comfort of the studio, I would stay here again. 
"
28084	4677524	10.0	10.0	48684763	Location, Location, Location . . . Marilyn made us feel at home and the apartment was exactly matched the description.  Marilyn was very accommodating because we were traveling by train to Seattle and the train was late . . . and we communicated that to her and see made sure we were taken care of even though we arrived late in the evening.  The place was really clean, bed was very comfortable and again the location was THE BEST.  It is my hope that when we return to Seattle again this property will be available and Marilyn will allow us to stay here again.  We had a great time in Seattle!
28085	4677524	10.0	10.0	49337516	This place is much better than I imagined. It was located in a great part of the city where it was easy to walk to so many great places. Plus you can see the space needle from the window! Also, the bathroom, which is not in the pictures, was huge and nicely decorated. Marilyn answered my questions prior to our arrival and settling in and checking out were a breeze. I would highly recommend and stay there again.
28086	4677524	10.0	10.0	50944977	"Great place to stay. Next to great restaurants and bars. Walk to Pike market or needle.
Would stay again."
28087	4677524	10.0	10.0	52274684	Great location! Walkable to space needle and pikes place market. Parking very convenient. Apartment very well decorated with nice personal touches. Very clean. Comfortable for 3 guests. Overall great experience and would stay again. 
28088	4677524	10.0	10.0	53742504	Absolutely loved staying at this studio in the heart of downtown...seriously, perfect location if you are new to Seattle! It ended up being close to some of our favorite restaurants and is a short walk to the market. Check in was a breeze. We loved using the kitchen to cook some meals and also utilized the washer/dryer in the unit.  The bed is more comfortable than my own + extra pillows was a nice option. Note that the person upstairs has a lead foot, but nothing major that kept us awake and very little street noise. We had a minor issue with a plumbing piece that came loose that was promptly fixed - be gentle with the toilet handle! We highly recommend this location to a couple or a few friends! 
28089	4677524	10.0	10.0	53956746	"This was a great ""home base"" for a first-time visit to Seattle. It was so conveniently located. We were able to take a short walk to all of the ""must see"" places for tourists (e.g., Space Needle, market), and on the way, spotted dozens of restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops that we knew we wouldn't get to on this trip but filed away for future reference. We did not cook but saw that the kitchen was well appointed if we'd wanted to have a cozy dinner in the studio.  The bakery on the 1st Ave side of the building is phenomenal. The only recommendation I'd make for future guests is to bring earplugs, as our slumber was disrupted each night by what sounded like stomping on the floor directly above the bed. "
28763	5446180	10.0	10.0	29122284	Easy, comfortable, great location
28764	5446180	10.0	10.0	30532972	Check in and communication was exceptionally easy and professional. The apartment was well stocked, clean, comfortable and in perfect condition. Beds were comfortable, amenities were exceptional. Couldn't have asked for anything more!
28765	5446180	10.0	10.0	36884318	This condo was in a great downtown location - we walked to the Space Needle, Pike Market, the aquarium, etc.  The building had wonderful amenities - nice gym, coffee shop, small gourmet market, etc.   The condo was beautiful and felt very safe.  The sofa bed was broken and slanted down awkwardly at the bottom and the sheets provided were way too small and couldn't be used.  If you do plan on cooking much in the condo - would recommend stopping outside downtown area for food.  The markets in town are all gourmet markets with more ready made foods.  All in all  - we had a great trip!
28766	5446180	10.0	10.0	38425918	All was great. Zero host interaction, but everything was as advertised and ran like clockwork. Great location. Coffee, Sushi, market and more in the building. Highly recommended. 
28767	5446180	10.0	10.0	40335078	Great apartment in a fantastic location! It was as the listing described. We really liked how there were restaurants and other things on the ground floors. The only thing we would say that it might not be ideal if you need a living area and are using the pull out bed. But that was just our needs and would totally recommend this property! 
32307	934123	9.0	10.0	7260194	"Great location, smooth check-in and check-out and a good value.
I will definitely recommend."
32308	934123	9.0	10.0	13543591	The host was responsive, friendly, and professional. The apartment had all the basics. It was in an apartment building that has multiple vacation rentals. It was located an easy walk to  many downtown destinations. I have to say I was completely satisfied with the place and would stay there again.
32309	934123	9.0	10.0	19886559	Jordan and Stay Alfreds were quick to respond and help. They were kind enough to accommodate our earlier arrival after a long flight. The apt is perfectly located in the heart of downtown Seattle. It is very spacious, in an apt. complex with shops, supermarkets, restaurants all around. The subway is two blocks away and the sky train about 10 minutes walk. The waterfront and the Pike market are right around the corner. We loved our stay there and would definitely recommend!
32310	934123	9.0	10.0	21445047	Excellent communication, location and experience. Great airbnb renter
32311	934123	9.0	10.0	26210907	It was a perfect position from which every hot spots of Seattle down town can be reached by a little walking. And Jordan shows his best effort to support our staying. The parking area can be a maze at first because the apartment is complex building.
32312	934123	9.0	10.0	36133755	Clean and welcoming environment. Great location!
32313	934123	9.0	10.0	41116258	We arrived pretty late and self-check in at the Harbor Steps was a breeze. Apartment is as described on the website. Get this place for the location! We took LINK from the airport, rode mass trans the whole time and really enjoyed Seattle. I would highly recommend this place to a family with older kids like ours. Thank you, Jordan & Stay Alfred.
32314	934123	9.0	10.0	49034730	Excellent location despite plenty of traffic around the building.  Bedrooms obviously have double glazing so a good nights sleep is  possible. Living room area nice and clean, but not for spending a lot of time in with excellent bars, coffee and kids activities directly downstairs.  Highly recommended for location. 
32315	934123	9.0	10.0	50306356	good location， easy to go to pike market， so comfortable.

32604	935432	10.0	10.0	20440122	Jordan provided very detailed information on the condo, checking in, parking, checking out, etc. which made our arrival and departure very easy. The condo, building, and amenities were very nice. You can't beat the location! The Condo is a 5 minute walk to Pike's Market and across the street from the Seattle Art Museum. There are many great places close by to eat, get coffee, or hang out. Amazing location! We will definitely stay with Jordan again.
32605	935432	10.0	10.0	34044749	We were looking for a place to stay near Pike Place Market the night before the date of arrival. Even though our initial place didn't work out, Jordan recommended another place for us to stay around the same price range but this has ocean view. Jordan was very quick to respond, which made reservation very quick and easy. The place was clean and had everything we needed. It was less than 5 min walk to Pike Place Market and less than 10min to the freeway (I think it was Hwy 5). It made our time in Seattle very enjoyable. Very close to first Starbucks
33387	7763613	10.0	10.0	45868398	Angela was great! She met us to check us into the apartment and make sure we had everything we need. The location is prime, and walking distance to Pike Place and Capitol Hill (about 10m each way). The addition of a parking spot was a huge plus as we drove up from Portland. I would highly recommend anyone thinking of visiting Seattle to stay at Angela's place. I certainly will on my next visit!
33388	7763613	10.0	10.0	46216772	"We were in Seattle for just a day, so we really didn't want to spend time driving around and searching for parking. This apartment was a perfect fit for our needs as it is in a prime location: walking distance from Pike place market and a short 5 minute drive from the space needle.
Angela greeted us at the apartment entrance and showed us our parking spot in the garage. She then gave us a walk through of the apartment. Honestly, we didn't really use much of the amenities but everything looks as advertised.  Angela made us feel very comfortable and welcome.
If I were to visit Seattle again I would not hesitate to stay here once more."
33389	7763613	10.0	10.0	47513784	"Angela was an excellent host--prompt correspondence, flexible, timely and very friendly. She gave us some info about the area and offered to answer ?s during our stay if we needed.

the location is excellent. little loud from the traffic--but what do you expect for being in the city!!  it was fine!  

the condo was clean, comfortable and exactly what we needed. 

I would gladly stay there again and/or recommend it to friends. "

The apartment was lovely and had everything we needed. there is a small store nearby which was handy for supplies.
33394	7763613	10.0	10.0	51511982	A great Seattle apartment. Convenient location and much larger and roomier than the photos suggested (easily accommodated 2 couples). Steps away from great coffee, cider and beer - what more could you need! The rooftop patio was an amazing bonus - perfect for wine at night and coffee in the morning. Thanks Angela!

33398	7763613	10.0	10.0	53347524	The condo was comfortable, clean, and in a great location-- really close to Belltown, Cap Hill, Starbucks Reserve, and downtown. There was a minor hiccup when we arrived-- we couldn't get in touch with Angela to access the building which was a stressful way to start our trip, but otherwise had a good stay.

It was a perfect location to walk downtown and close to many good restaurants, bars, cafes, etc. Angela was very accommodating with some special needs with my group and always responded promptly. Thanks for a great stay!
33402	7763613	10.0	10.0	56394259	"As our first time visiting Seattle, Angela's place made the perfect location for us to see and do all the touristy things around the city. Everything we could ask for was in a 15-30min walk. We tried to walk as much as we could if it wasn't raining - typical Seattle experience!

Her home was stocked with everything you could need. I even forgot my shampoo, but of course, she had that covered as well! I also loved visiting during the holiday season since she also had the place decorated - complete with a Christmas tree! Felt very homey."

33404	7763613	10.0	10.0	57386567	Great location- near Pike place market. Everything we need is provided. Warm, comfortable and safe. The only thing is that we were woke up by some loud noise from the heater every night. The house is clean as a whole except some few dusts on the sheets.
33405	7763613	10.0	10.0	57726806	Angela was great! And her place was unbelievably convenient. Definitely a perfect place for central city living with the comfort of home.
34442	8553556	8.0	10.0	49284625	We had a great stay at Kevin's apartment! It's very conveniently located to downtown, public transit, and the major attractions. The apartment itself is nice, with a great kitchen and comfy bed. Kevin was really flexible with our arrival and departure, and quick to respond to messages if we had any questions. We will definitely stay there again if we ever return to Seattle!
34443	8553556	8.0	10.0	49850818	We really enjoyed our stay at Kevin's. The location is perfect for when you want to get out in the city everyday, which is what we did. The place has everything you need and the bed is super comfy! Kevin stayed in touch, got us in late, and gave us tips on how to get from the airport to his place. 
34444	8553556	8.0	10.0	50557891	This was a great airbnb experience, once again. Kevin was awesome, he took us up and gave us a tour and the keys before he left for his flight. The location was fantastic, just up the street from Pikes place and the fact that parking was included was the cherry on top. The place was great, spacious for a one bedroom city center condo. All of the amenities I could have asked for were provided. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Seattle, thank you again!!
34445	8553556	8.0	10.0	51191901	Kevin made us feel welcomed and kept in touch with us frequently. He showed us around and let us occupy his parking space. The neighborhood was safe and close to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. The apartment was spacious and was in the perfect location.

We arrived early morning and he was flexible with check-in which was amazing. He also gave us helpful tips regarding airport transportion which immediately saved us a few bucks. 

Overall, fantastic experience and would recommend's Kevin's place to anyone!"
34451	8553556	8.0	10.0	54868699	Very very easy visit to Kevin's nice place. Great location, perfect for our purposes on our one-night stay.  Unit is pretty much exactly as pictured and described in the listing, very comfortable, convenient, and parking passes just make it that much better. Kevin himself easy to work with and get in touch with, very responsive and helpful. We would love to stay there again.
34452	8553556	8.0	10.0	55141901	Great place overall. Kevin was very attentive and explained everything to us when we got in. Everything was as described in the listing, the only confusion being that the WiFi is an open network, not private, so we did not feel comfortable using it. Overall great spot in the perfect downtown location. Thanks~!
34453	8553556	8.0	10.0	57342235	Location was great. Place was smaller than I realized. Linens rumpled, generally less clean than expected, parking was slightly inconvenient, but Kevin was nice and helpful. 
35552	7735282	10.0	10.0	55599289	James was a great host, very helpful and kind. The location was ideal, minutes from pike place and the room was very clean and welcoming. Highly recommended if you're looking to stay in the downtown Seattle area!
35553	7735282	10.0	10.0	55875525	James was very attentive! He made sure that I had everything I needed during my stay. He even offered to go out for a drink with his friends! The location of the apartment is unbeatable. Restaurants, grocery stores, bars, gym, you name it; everything is in the neighborhood. The place itself is exactly what is shown in the pictures.  The bed was very comfortable, and I enjoyed using the little yet accommodating kitchen.
35554	7735282	10.0	10.0	56013890	James was an excellent host. The listing was prepared and in excellent condition. Clear instructions on how to check in as well as great tips on things to do within walking distance. Would definitely stay with him again.

The space was just as described and was very comfortable, and located in a very happening part of town. Lots of restaurants, coffee houses, and night life within walking distance. I would definitely stay in one of James places again.
35557	7735282	10.0	10.0	56648321	I had a great stay at James's apartment which was warm and inviting having arrived during a cold, rainy day.  It was clean and comfortable with a great eclectic style and a very comfortable bed.  The apartment is in a neighborhood which felt homey and local, though a short walk from downtown and major sites in Seattle.  A big plus is if you want to go to a bite to eat or get some coffee, there are many choices a short walk away.  Though I didn't get to meet James, he was very responsive in communications and provided great service through self check-in and out as well as provided great advice on local eats, transport, etc.  Overall, it was a great place to stay that I'd book next time if work takes me to Seattle again.
35558	7735282	10.0	10.0	57320748	James was an outstanding airbnb host, his place was very nice and clean and was one of the better airbnb places I have stayed at. It is located in a prime location in Seattle, with a lot of nice cafes and bars nearby. James was also very accommodating and helpful whenever we had any questions to ask him about the place/the city of Seattle.
35559	7735282	10.0	10.0	57839135	"James, was very responsive in answering questions.  He kept in constant contact with me and offered me guidance on how to get to the apartment from the airport.  Additionally, James recommended restaurants that would be open when I got there...which was difficult since I came in late at night and it was christmas eve.  That was very much appreciated.

Overall, James was available immediately and answered all questions promptly.  Additionally, the apartment is in a great location and within walking distance to anything a tourist would want."
35560	7735282	10.0	10.0	58612561	"We had a wonderful stay at James' apartment in Capitol Hill.  It's a cosy and well-appointed studio with all the amenities we needed.  James was incredibly helpful and friendly, offering us great suggestions of local bars and restaurants - all of which are only a short walk from the apartment. 3 nights wasn't long enough!
Thanks again James!"

The apartment itself was amazing, and the rooftop lounge was great as well."
35949	7699096	10.0	10.0	42955652	Fantastic space, very convenient to Seattle tourist locations - Waterfront, Pike Place, Space Needle, etc . . .  Owners left some goodies; we felt very welcome.  Highly recommended!
35950	7699096	10.0	10.0	44010481	From the moment I made the booking to the moment I left the apartment the host, Andric Jackson was wonderful to work with! The apartment itself is wonderful and a delight to stay in. I had an event at the Washington Conference Center which was a short 4 min walk away. Wonderful restaurants within walking distance including a sushi restaurant directly across the street and a coffee bistro/shop on the ground floor. We had a wonderful stay and looking forward to returning back soon. Thank you for a wonderful and memorable experience.  
35951	7699096	10.0	10.0	44501090	Andric and Drea have a fantastic unit in the First Hill section of Downtown Seattle. The location was is very convenient if you plan on doing a lot in the city center, highlighted by the bus line being just a mere half block away. The unit itself is a simple yet upscale layout in a mixed development building. When I arrived late in the evening, I was greeted to a space that had soothing music playing from a local 24-hour jazz station and a bottle of merlot on the dining area table. The bathroom was fantastic with very comfortable water temperature and pressure, plenty of linens, and even some toiletries for use. The bedroom, while small in overall size, served it's purpose well with an extremely comfortable bed and an open layout facing the patio that provided a great sunrise effect. I didn't use the kitchen too much but plenty of dishes and utensils were provided and they even had fresh milk in the refrigerator. There is also parking available in the garage underneath the building. This was a fantastic stay. From here on out, I will look to book with Andric and Drea for my Seattle visits.
35952	7699096	10.0	10.0	44962243	"Fantastic stay, highly recommend! 

From the moment we booked to check out, communication was flawless. Not only were all questions answered within an hour but Andric checked in mid-stay to make sure we had everything we needed. It was amazing to walk into a unit that was just as clean/pretty as the pictures and a very nice welcome basket + wine bottle waiting on the table. Pair that with the jazz music that was lightly playing as we walked in and we were blown away at the attention to details! There's lots too- a french press, shampoo/conditioner/body wash/laundry detergent, recommended restaurant lists printed out, playing cards/dominos, small table + chairs on the balcony and more. 

When I go back, I'll for sure check to see if the unit is available (might be difficult as it really is the the perfect home away from home).

Great location- close to many tourist spots (pike market, needle, emp museum, waterfront, japantown, etc) and restaurants nearby. "
35953	7699096	10.0	10.0	45843681	This place was fantastic. Great spot, you are able to walk anywhere and everywhere. They had all the essentials and it couldn't have been more relaxing!
35954	7699096	10.0	10.0	46611920	This was a great apartment.  Exceeded our expectations.  Clean, comfortable, and convenient First Hill location.  Easy walk to downtown and to the convention center.  Nice sized smart TV with several channels and Netflix, which we used in the evenings.  We used the nicely appointed kitchen daily for breakfast.  Gas stove, full size fridge, dishwasher, french press.  Bathroom has a washer and dryer.  Iron and ironing board.  No hair dryer for the ladies, though.  Balcony facing the street is nice.  It was a warm week, so we had the door open most of the time with a fan, since the windows do not open.  Secure access building in a safe neighborhood!  Coffee shop on the ground floor.  Several small grocery stores within walking distance, re-usable bags available in the apartment.
35955	7699096	10.0	10.0	47075334	"We were very impressed by the location and how lovely and clean the apartment was. 
Andric and Drea left us lists of places and things to do in the area.  The patio was nice to set and have your morning coffee to start your day or a drink to rewind the end of the day.  The view was wonderful.  There is a roof top patio that is also nice to sit and have a drink.  Thank you Andric and Drea this was a wonderful trip
"
35956	7699096	10.0	10.0	48002388	Excellent location and well setup apartment for 2. Clean, bright and close to everything we needed, good coffee downstairs was also very welcome. Parking was good - though most locations including waterfront, museums, galleries, restaurants and city were easily walkable. Andric and Drea were a pleasure to work with - great responsiveness on communication before and during our stay, would definitely stay here again.
35957	7699096	10.0	10.0	48910159	Awesome place with everything you need in a location that is very accessible to all the main Seattle attractions.  We walked everywhere from the stadiums to The waterfront and up to Belltown.  I would highly recommend.  Andric and Drea were fantastic hosts and easily accessible for any help or questions we had.  Perfect spot for a Seattle vacation. 
35958	7699096	10.0	10.0	49907392	"My husband and I had a wonderful stay. The place condo was very clean and well kept. Would definitely recommend.
"
35959	7699096	10.0	10.0	51949500	"Everything was as described and it was an awesome week spent in this flat. The furnish is really new and modern, and the flat itself is really spacious.

I was looking for a flat where I can work during the days and relax during the evenings and that's exactly what I got. Would definitely recommend.

I've received a check-in instructions through a message and I didn't need to meet with Andric and Drea as I check in. They're there when you need something but you're left alone the rest. That's the perfect combination for me.

When you arrive, there was a special welcome package, you have a wine and some candies on the table and some music welcoming you to the house. The wine isn't super-nice quality but the gesture is. There's also a bunch of where to eat/where to visit in Seattle guides on the desk.

The flat is close to pretty much anything here, it's in First Hill so it's walking distance to Capitol Hill and Downtown and many other places. I can't speak of public transportation as I had a car.

Nevertheless, if you're coming to Seattle for a few, check this out."
35960	7699096	10.0	10.0	52552930	Gorgeous apartment, great layout! Convenient to the convention center and all the surrounding nightlife.
35961	7699096	10.0	10.0	53250178	The place was great. Due to the location, we were able to get by without a rental car during our week-long stay. 
35962	7699096	10.0	10.0	54153974	Wow this place was great. Super easy check in, near the main Seattle area (we didn't walk due to rain), LOVED the secure parking garage. Very nice and clean place.  We were exploring the city too much to check out the rooftop terrace.  The hair dryer and iron were nice touches too. We would definitely stay here again. 
35963	7699096	10.0	10.0	54792131	Andric and Drea were great! There was a slight mixup in the beginning and they were quick to help us which was most appreciated. The home is beautiful and great for 2! It was the perfect spot to stay for the Seahawks game as its great walking distance to most places. The rooftop view is gorgeous and the balcony to the home is great for morning coffee. We are so happy we stayed! 
36038	5315169	9.0	10.0	29211447	Barbara's place was greatly located with breakfast and food options in walking distance. Cozy and clean, had a great time!
36039	5315169	9.0	10.0	29780201	Barbara's apartment was adorable (exactly as photographed). She was also very helpful and suggested some nice local bars, restaurants and other attractions for us. The place was super clean and comfortable and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. The location was only a short walk to downtown which made our trip very convenient. 
36040	5315169	9.0	10.0	30882978	"I was traveling with a group of friends. Very grateful that Barbara was willing to accommodate all of us even though the listing said 4 max. 

We arrived at the apartment around noon on the day of check in. It was all our first time in Seattle and didn't know that parking was going to be such an issue. Called Barbara a couple of times with no answer so one of us ran in and found a guest parking pass. Long story short we got a parking ticket even with the parking pass. Be very careful to go online and research which streets you can park on. Even after looking on the city of Seattle website it was not very clear so we ended up paying for parking our entire stay just in case. Be warned that parking around the area is $4/hr so that added up. 

Other than that and a somewhat slow draining tub, it was a nice place to stay. Only my second time using airbnb, a little weird seeing her personal belongings at first. 

All in all I would rate it 3.5-4 stars. "
36041	5315169	9.0	10.0	33363773	The experience was awesome. My friends and I had a great time in Seattle. Barbara's place was already set up by the time we got there and she was super flexible in letting us leave our stuff at her place past check out. I would definitely stay at her place again. 
36042	5315169	9.0	10.0	34422227	"Barbara made us feel so comfortable and welcomed. The place felt like home, I loved the fresh flowers touch! (Sunflowers are my favorite!) The place is in great location! It was everything and then some of what I expected. 

Thank you Barbara for being an amazing host! "
36043	5315169	9.0	10.0	35916871	Barbara's place was just as seen in the posted images and in a great location for visiting Seattle. She was sweet enough to leave us a note that explained everything that we needed to know for our stay and we had a great time thanks to her hospitality. Would love to stay at her  place again if I were to ever visit Seattle again. 
36044	5315169	9.0	10.0	36577290	Barbara's place was so fun and adorable. There were three of us in her place and it worked out great! We cooked our meals instead of eating out in Seattle and she had everything we needed in her kitchen. Definitely recommend her place! She even gave us chocolate 
36045	5315169	9.0	10.0	37339338	Barbara made us feel welcome and had a nice welcome treat for us when arrived. It was a nice personal touch. Great space, great neighborhood within walking distance to capital hill and downtown. We had a fantastic stay and is perfect for 2 - 4 people. 
36046	5315169	9.0	10.0	37966315	The nice condo is in a very good neighborhood with lots of trees and I felt quite safe there. The #2 bus stops two blocks away and can stop one block away. There's also another bus almost as close. Parking privileges were available. The host was friendly and had magazines and DVD's available. I enjoyed Seattle and my stay at the condo.
36047	5315169	9.0	10.0	39915479	My family and I went to Seattle for a baseball game. Barbara was a great host. Very responsive and friendly. The apartment was is in a really convenient spot and super easy to access. Everything we needed. Had a great time. 
36048	5315169	9.0	10.0	41080184	"The Appartement was as described. As it is in the Souterrain it's quite dark. But you're here to visit Seattle not to stay in the Appartement. 

Barbara gave us a very warm welcome. With four people and a few days stay the Appartement is the right choice. Downtown is within walking distance. The neighborhood makes a real save impression. 

We would make the same choice with Barbara's Appartement next time. 

Thanks for everything. "
36049	5315169	9.0	10.0	45243463	Easy check-in, great location, really nice and large space. Barbara was a great host and let us know everything we needed to know and left us some snacks which were a pleasant surprise. Had no issues with the suite, though it can be a bit noisy in the morning when people walk around upstairs or talk loudly outside - but we were getting up pretty early anyways so it wasn't a big deal at all.
36050	5315169	9.0	10.0	46153942	The second we walked in, we were very pleased with our stay; the apartment was clean, and we had everything we needed to have a great stay. If you are staying in Seattle, there is no greater place to spend your nights. 
36051	5315169	9.0	10.0	47045098	A great apartment in a great location. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed for my stay. Thank you
36052	5315169	9.0	10.0	48869402	Host was great, and was able to accommodate for us when we landed a bit earlier than expected. The house is exactly as listed: comfortable and very sweet. For travelers and tourists to the city, the location is absolutely prime. It's a 15 minute walk to downtown/Pikes Place, and a very short Uber to anywhere else. Highly recommended!
36053	5315169	9.0	10.0	49775231	We had an amazing experience staying at Barbara's apartment. It is walkable to all of the great neighborhoods. We never waited more than 3-4 minutes for an uber driver.  She was prompt in the communication department and let us keep our bags there after check out. The snacks and fresh flowers were an added bonus! We will definitely book with her again!
36054	5315169	9.0	10.0	50440630	The location was great for where we needed to be and instructions were clear on entry and use of the apartment.  We enjoyed our stay and the place was the perfect size for our small group.  
36055	5315169	9.0	10.0	50759714	Barbara was not available to greet us in person but had made sure we could gain access easily and had sent welcoming messages in advance and information about the accommodation in the flat for when we arrived.
36056	5315169	9.0	10.0	52076331	Barbara's place was in a great location and the perfect size for the two of us.  She was very accommodating to our early check-in and late check-out request.  We would definitely consider staying here again the next time we are in Seattle.
36057	5315169	9.0	10.0	52833350	We stayed in Barbara's apartment for a weekend. We were welcomed with instructions, fresh flowers, and local Washington snacks! It was well maintained and the perfect size the two of us. Barbara was great in communicating with check-in and recommendations of nearby bars; she was always available by phone or text. The apartment's neighborhood felt safe and was perfect - walking distance to great restaurants and bars. At times parking was difficult to find after 5pm, but it was Halloween weekend and we walked most places anyways! Thank you Barbara! I would definitely book with you again. :)  
36058	5315169	9.0	10.0	54249670	"Barbara had local snacks (chocolate and chips) waiting for us on the table.  She shared a few of her favorite local spots as well.  She responded to emails quickly.  I received a parking ticket even though I had the parking pass on rear view mirror.  I believe the parking agent only looked at my expired meter ticket on the passenger side window so make sure you don't have expired tickets in view.

The neighborhood is convenient to coffee, food, groceries (QFC and drug stores).  We didn't use the car once in three days but we did use Uber a lot as even though apartment is walkable to Pike Place (12 blocks), it was raining and my daughter's back was sore.  Washer n dryer are a few steps away outside the door.

The apartment is basement level so expect some noise but it didn't bother us.   "
36059	5315169	9.0	10.0	54700384	Barbara was great! Place was clean and in the perfect location. Nothing super fancy but exactly what we needed. Check in and out could not have been easier 
36060	5315169	9.0	10.0	55379482	We felt very welcom from the beginning on as Barbara left us a detailed description of the environment including some insider tips. The neighbourhood is nice and calm with some shops nearby (Starbucks and Supermarket).
36061	5315169	9.0	10.0	56600141	Arrived to a very clean and welcoming apartment. Barbara left us some local snacks which was great. Easy access to the building and a safe neighborhood. Barbara responded to questions very quickly and even offered local advice. Apartment was well located near bars, restaurants and cafe's. Only small hangup was finding street parking with the guest pass after arriving in the evening on a Friday night. Parking was easy the rest of the weekend. 
36062	5315169	9.0	10.0	57124185	Barbara did a great job making our first moments in the apartment feel welcome as we were greeted with some local goodies and a guide on her favourite restaurants and nearby grocery store (which was a lifesaver!) Great location - cots under $10 with Uber to get to where we wanted to go, which was mostly the downtown area. The apartment was the perfect size for the four of us who stayed there and it was easy to get in to the apartment, as well as clean and lock up when it was time to check out. Will definitely be staying in this place again when we return to Seattle!
36063	5315169	9.0	10.0	57518641	Barbara was awesome! She was very responsive and welcoming. We arrived a little early but she was accommodating and helped us move in the luggage to the flat while we explored the city. Her apartment is also very very clean and cute and cozy! the best we've stayed at during this 10 day trip in US :) safe and clean neighborhood. Her little touch on the snacks were also very heartwarming, pity we only had 2 days in town, would love to come back!
36206	6494181	10.0	10.0	35949040	Our stay with Rebecca was wonderful! We were met promptly at our desired check-in time and were given a complete tour of the Penthouse and it's amenities. The Penthouse was very clean and homey.  The location was perfect, close to the Convention Center area, restaurants and bars and a nice walk to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market.  This Penthouse was perfect for our stay. Rebecca, and Doug, who checked us in, were helpful and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks!
36207	6494181	10.0	10.0	39013115	Doug is an amiable person.  We all admire his great personality.  We arrived a little bit early than we expected but he quickly finished his other things and showed up right away.  Doug spent quite some time explaining the entire environment and transportation details.  He walked me through thoroughly the usage of all major facilities in the room as well as in the garage (we even got a free parking lot!) When we had problems with the curtains Doug responded immediately and made our stay a real pleasant one.  The building is conveniently located at East Pike street, next to the Convention Center and just walking distance from major shopping centers such as Nordsdrom and Pacific Place.  Way too many good restaurants and grocery stores around making it really convenient to stay there.  Light rail and Mono-rail are just a few blocks away and will take you to major tourism places like the Space Needle or the fisherman market or the Stadiums.  If you drive, you will find it really easy to merge on I-90 or I-5.  The room is really spacious with a lovely full functional kitchen.  It is big enough to host 4-5 people so perfect for a family on vacation in Seattle.
36208	6494181	10.0	10.0	39420931	Our apartment was very comfortable, clean and spaciuos. The neighborhood is great with and easy walk to all the tourist attractions. 
36209	6494181	10.0	10.0	39761257	Was a great stay at a downtown Seattle penthouse.  Place was very spacious, clean, hosts were excellent to deal with.  Lots within walking distance, including light rail station.
36210	6494181	10.0	10.0	41210338	The location of the condo could not have been more perfect.  Everything that we visited during our stay was within walking distance and very easy to get to.  The condo was a great size and had a in-unit laundry and a rooftop deck that we could use, which really added to the comfort of our stay.  We really appreciated the AC units and the extra fans in the unit, since during our stay the weather was around 90 degrees. Overall, we really enjoyed our trip to Seattle and hope to be back soon! 
36211	6494181	10.0	10.0	41752128	Great place! Fantastic, very walk-able location-- easy access to Pike Place Mkt, the Space Needle, the wonders of Capitol Hill, and Safeco Field. The apartment is nicely furnished and has a nice view of downtown. We all enjoyed our stay and would recommend this apartment for families, couples, a small group of friends, or a long-term work stay.
36212	6494181	10.0	10.0	43234993	Doug was friendly, had a very well planned orientation for the apartment with good mix of advice on things to do while in Seattle. The place was clean and appeared as expected from the pictures and description. We had a wonderful time exploring the city from this extremely convenient location. 
36213	6494181	10.0	10.0	45292823	The apartment was very tidy and clean and were pleasantly greeted by Doug who ran through everything we needed to know. The apartment was exactly as described amd was very convenient for our time at the convention centre. Very glad we found this place and would recommend highly.
36214	6494181	10.0	10.0	51429025	This place was amazing! We loved the space. The pictures did it justice and its location was so convenient. We were able to walk to several places in the downtown area. Only disappointment was the second bathroom; It was extremely small. We would definitely come back again! 
36215	6494181	10.0	10.0	52044057	The condo was great, very clean and centrally located. Very easy to work with Becki and would definitely stay here again. 
36216	6494181	10.0	10.0	52835867	Doug was very welcoming upon arrival. Spacious apartment for 6 people for 4 nights. Would stay here again. Had everything we needed. And we were able to walk to almost everything we did. Gorgeous! 
36217	6494181	10.0	10.0	57631698	We loved our stay at this Penthouse Condo.  The location is wonderful and perfectly situated for shopping, sightseeing and close to so many diverse restaurants.  My husband was recovering from hip surgery and the condo was only a mile from the hospital.  The open floor plan was perfect as he was able to easily walk about.  The nicely appointed kitchen, washer & dryer and parking made this Condo the perfect choice.  Next time we stay there,  I hope it will be just for fun! 
39349	3403858	10.0	10.0	15841182	Lauren & Matt accommodated our every need, made us feel welcome and at home. The house is nested into a great location in West Seattle.  You can walk up to California street and have great coffee or food at Admiral Bird or stroll down through the park ending up at Alki Beach for food, drinks and people watching. The warmth and charm of this older craftsman house seduces you, relax and enjoy.
39350	3403858	10.0	10.0	16123306	"We can't wait to come back! Lauren was such a great host! She went out of her way to accommodate our family, even leaving special touches for us upon our arrival.  

The house is very well appointed for a family of four but could also accommodate four adults fairly easily. We have two young children (8 and 3) and the second bedroom was perfect for them with a twin bed and toddler bed. Although, I think Lauren mentioned being able to switch the toddler bed out for a twin if it isn't wanted.   

The bathroom is amazing and the large tub made bath time with the kids really easy. The kitchen is also very well stocked and we had everything we needed to feel like we were at home - which was really a major upside for us versus staying in a hotel. Our stay at Lauren's place was also the second leg of a two-week trip to the Northwest so we really appreciated having access to a high-end washer and dryer. 

The eclectic northwest decor makes the home feel posh but comfortable and there was plenty of space for us to all spread out. The home is located close to both Alki and Alaska Junction so walking on the beach or going to some of the great shops on California were a very short drive (less than a mile) away.  The water taxi to downtown Seattle was also a short drive. The neighborhood is safe and has a great family feel. The house also sits above the street so letting the kids play in the front yard without being concerned about traffic was really nice. 

Our family frequently rents vacation homes  on VRBO or Airbnb and I have to say this was by far one of our favorite places-to-date! The home was as it was listed and our host, Lauren, couldn't have been nicer.  You really cannot go wrong renting this home and we cannot wait for our next stay in West Seattle! "
39351	3403858	10.0	10.0	16323009	"We stayed at the curtis's House for 3 days and had a really Great Time. The Mixture of cosy and calm-down area in West seattle in combination with the opportunity to Access downtown by Public transportation so fast was the ideal Solution to experience seattle within three days.
The House is very well equipped and gives a very cosy feeling.
We definitly recommend Taking the Chance to Stay a view days at this lovely Place."
39352	3403858	10.0	10.0	16487747	"This beautiful, comfortable home was an absolutely ideal experience during my recent trip to Seattle for my brother's wedding. 

The owners were quick to respond and accommodating. The home itself was spotlessly clean and was decorated in a relaxed though classy style. In other words, everything is very nice, but in a way that allows you to put your guard down and your feet up. There were plenty of pleasant spots to relax. 

All the amenities were exactly as advertised. This home was ideal for our party of four, but could easily host at least a couple more guests. My mom, who has a handicap, had no difficulty getting around. She appreciated having her own half-bath off of the master bedroom. The main bathroom is spacious, with a large tub and shower. The kitchen is perfectly functional, which is really what you want from a kitchen. It was great having a washer and dryer right on the main floor. The patio is a marvelous sanctuary. 

We loved the quiet neighborhood, with its charming northwest bungalows set among the hills of West Seattle. The house is ideally located next to a city park that has one of the only remaining old growth forests in Seattle. A 20 minute walk through the park takes you just a couple blocks from Alki Beach, a super-cool spot that reminds me of Santa Cruz, CA. And West Seattle is a really cool place to explore. Among other things, there is a Trader Joe's just minutes away. Aside from that, though, there are lots of interesting spots that get little tourist traffic compared to other places in the city. It felt like the ideal urban neighborhood experience.

I only have positive things to say about our experience at this wonderful home. I think it's ideal for anyone with a family. I highly recommend it for your next trip to Seattle."
39353	3403858	10.0	10.0	16671523	We had a fabulous time at this cozy West Seattle home!!  Lauren did an amazing job of communicating with us and making us feel at home during our first Airbnb experience.  We loved hanging on the wooden deck that stretches along the house.  In addition to the home being beautiful, spacious, and cozy, it's in a great part of West Seattle.  We hiked from the house through the woods of Schmitz park on to Alki Beach within about 20-30 minutes.  It was a perfect fit for our family of four with two small children!!
39354	3403858	10.0	10.0	17105657	Our stay in Seattle was wonderful. Coming back each evening to the Curtis's home was so relaxing. We felt welcomed by the homey feel of their adorable bungalow. Sitting on the patio sipping coffee and tea at the end of an exhausting day or before a new day's set of adventures was such a pleasure! If we ever return to Seattle, we will definitely look for this home away from home again! 
39355	3403858	10.0	10.0	18724346	Lauren did a great job communicating about her home and we felt welcome when we arrived .  She had plenty of nice touches for travelers, including maps and a coupon for local ice cream   Her home was exactly as listed and pictured, prepared well and very clean.  The West Seattle neighborhood is quiet and was nice for our small family.       
39356	3403858	10.0	10.0	38304205	We had an amazing time!  The house is lovely. We especially enjoyed the deck patio.  All was spotless clean, quiet at night, beautiful walk to the back via an old-growth patch of original forest.  We highly recommend this place for visiting Seattle!
40910	4910140	9.0	10.0	32736673	The host canceled this reservation 59 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
40911	4910140	9.0	10.0	34264119	Betsy's home is both beautiful and comfortable. She is a thoughtful and delightful hostess. I felt very welcomed during my stay. I would definitely love to stay again!
40912	4910140	9.0	10.0	40254024	Betsy made me feel immediately welcome. We had some things in common that made conversation easy.  She offered fresh eggs from her chickens, zucchini from her garden & tea from her Shaklee business (though I wasn't able to partake in the first two). She also made great recommendations on things to do & shared in conversations about my daily exploits.  
40913	4910140	9.0	10.0	40651241	Betsy was a great woman that really did have so much to offer. She was organized and helped me to get settled. She offered a lot of stories and it was fascinating to talk with her. The house was very private and was in a very quiet and beautiful part of town. As far as transportation, it was about a 10 min walk to the bus which lead downtown. I was extremely appreciative and hope I can go back soon. Thanks Betsy and Happy Birthday again!
40914	4910140	9.0	10.0	40993140	"I had a very pleasant stay at Betsy's place. Perfect for one person; great sense of privacy, clear communication, etc, everything you'd expect! The house is located on a quiet residential street about a 10-15 minute walk from the main commercial stretch along California Ave (where you can pick up the express C bus to Downtown Seattle), so do plan on walking a little if you don't arrive by car. 
 "
40915	4910140	9.0	10.0	43393742	"Betsy is an excellent host. She was very welcoming and invited me along on some excursions during my stay. I enjoyed getting to know her when I wasn't out exploring the Seattle.
The area is out of the bustle of the city, which I enjoyed. There is a 10-15 minute walk to a bus that goes directly downtown. I managed to see a lot of the city using only public transport. Don't let the location put you off. 
I would stay with Betsy again without hesitation. "
40916	4910140	9.0	10.0	44106141	Betsy was a great host.  Her property is very nice and clean.  I only stayed for one night but I would definitely recommend her accommodations. 
40917	4910140	9.0	10.0	44850040	"My stay at Betsy's home was relaxing and provided the quiet I was looking for.  Betsy offer much-welcomed advice on how to get around easily and with little cost.  The back yard of the property is spacious and verdant and offered me time to recharge as I sat surrounded by varieties of trees, plants and flowers.  
The walk from the bus to the house is a bit of a healthy hike up a hill. But the neighborhood in West Seattle is quiet and safe, and has some amazing views.    This is my first time as an Airbnb user and I am glad to report it was overall successful.

Sincerely,
Sharda

40919	4910140	9.0	10.0	46030425	"Can I just say that I have the best time in Seattle. Betsy is a wonderful host. She is helpful in so may ways, so just ask her! And she definitely makes the best suggestions for 'things to do in Seattle.'  She was a pleasure to talk to. 
In terms of the location, do not be put off by the distance from the house to the bus stop. It is only 10 minutes walking distance. The bus takes you right into downtown which makes your trip planning a lot easier. 
The neighborhood itself is called Alaska Junction. There are many cute shops, restaurants and a 24 hour grocery store within walking distance(by the bus stop).
The room is shown as the picture, cozy and sweet. It is quite spacious. You have a lot room to put your personal belongings. 
I personally enjoyed my stay at Betsy's very much.  "
40920	4910140	9.0	10.0	46257117	Betsy was one of the best hosts I have ever had. She responded to my late request very quickly. She was friendly and warm during my stay and I had amazing time chatting with her.

for single person visiting Washington state for the first time or just to get  away from the noise of the city. There is even a Trader Joe's 
close by. With all that said, the best part of my stay was meeting Betsy. It felt like coming home.........thank you Betsy.  "
40923	4910140	9.0	10.0	49553501	My room was exactly as described, and the bed and linens were exceptional. Betsy made me feel very welcome, and I enjoyed every aspect of my stay. She also has quite possibly the cutest cat I've ever met! 
40924	4910140	9.0	10.0	49749699	It was great although I never got to meet her everything was there for me to come and go as I please. She made sure I had clean sheets and t although I was only there for one night I would def go back to stay in the lovely neighborhood for a longer stay...
40925	4910140	9.0	10.0	49920025	This was my first experience using Airbnb and I am glad it was so positive!  Betsy is an excellent host and was very welcoming.  The bathroom is shared but was not an issue.  Staying with Betsy was like staying with a friend or relative.  I would stay here again.

40927	4910140	9.0	10.0	55425938	"As my first Airbnb host, Betsy has really set the bar high. When we first got in contact, she was as responsive as one could be. She is incredibly warm, welcoming and caring. Expect enjoyable conversations and stories too! 

Her house is on a quiet street, perfectly located between Alki Beach, West Seattle Junction and Admiral. It means amazing views and walking routes and also close to shopping, grocery stores, cafes...

The bedroom has plenty of space and lots of character. There's a huge closet, a bureau and a space heater. And is generally very comfortable.

Staying with Betsy has been a wonderful experience that I would absolutely do again!"
40928	4910140	9.0	10.0	58098597	Betsy is a very nice host, my flight was delayed and she still waited up for me and even offered me a nice warmed welcome dinner. The room was comfortable and it's located in a nice quiet neighborhood. I will highly recommend her to everyone.
40934	6762958	10.0	10.0	34759522	Great stay in a great house.  1 mile to the beach and 15 minutes to downtown.  Backyard was perfect for enjoying my morning coffee.  Matt was outgoing and made me feel welcome.  I plan on staying here for future trips.
40935	6762958	10.0	10.0	55511142	Matt's place was perfect. He's in the process of a remodel, but its only cosmetic. He provided ample coffee options which is great for those caffeine addicts among us. I will note there was no TV, but that was frankly refreshing. This place is going down as one of my favorites for the next time I have family in town. Thanks Matt!
40936	6762958	10.0	10.0	55979794	"We unfortunately had to cancel at the last minute due to an illness, so I can't write a review of the home. But working with Matt was excellent. He quickly responds, is thorough in his communication & was very sweet and refunded us part of the trip. 
We'll try to stay here next visit since he was great! 
"
40937	6762958	10.0	10.0	58197485	Loved the place. Modern and updated. Had complimentary root beer and beer. Nice bath with heated floors. Nice back yard that could be cool if it wasn't the winter time. Only one complaint is that the bed was too small for two people. Unless your a couple who doesn't move at all at night it was just to hard for us.
44695	8605841	10.0	10.0	53518497	Collin is a wonderful host. He was there to check us in and show us around the place. He was readily available to contact and responded promptly to requests, and he gave us our space/was not intrusive. The space is very comfortable and roomy, and he has very nicely decorated it. The bed was comfortable. It's very conveniently located, and there's a park right near by. I would definitely stay here again.

Joe and Theresa are both very kind and friendly. Joe welcomed me at the door, and gave me a tour of the property and the apartment. They had everything ready when I arrived (including a fruit, cheese and wine). They gave great recommendations about places to dine, sightsee, and hike, and there is a trail leading to a park right behind the property, which makes it feel like you are in the country, even though you’re right in the city. 

The apartment is fully furnished, with every amenity available (laundry, cable, internet, dishes, pots/pans, etc.), and it has one of the most comfortable beds that I have slept on in a long time. They were very respectful of privacy, and yet readily available to answer any questions (Joe can give directions to just about anyplace in Washington). Overall, I couldn’t have wished for a better experience, and I would definitely recommend their place to fellow travelers. Thank you Joe and Theresa for such a great time!"
47620	4526737	10.0	10.0	34792653	Joe and Theresa are very warm and helpful hosts.  It was really a very homely experience.  It was like a home away from home.  Joe is extremely helpful and friendly.  Great experience

This newly furnished apt was like a an art gallery with all the wall space filled with paintings. The neighborhood was very quiet. There was no access to lake.
47622	4526737	10.0	10.0	35406661	This is a great place to stay !! We were welcomed by our host ( Joe) who went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable. The place was better than described and with more amenities. The scenery, nearby park was fantastic. 
47623	4526737	10.0	10.0	36391316	"We were in Seattle, a place we visit often, for a family wedding, and the the hotels we usually stay in were very expensive due to a PGA tour in the area.  This was the first time we used Airbnb so we were a little nervous, but it was all for nought.  The apt was truly as advertised and the photos were spot-on; however, it was so much more than the description or the photos.  It really had everything and the most amazing thing was, if something was missing, Joe went out and bought it!  The funniest thing we saw was when we got ""home"" one day, there was a potato peeler on the patio table.  Someone before us was looking for one, so Joe went out and got it!  One thing not mentioned much in the description is the patio area.  It was truly wonderful!  Joe does an amazing job landscaping and the property was gorgeous.  I always had my morning coffee on the patio and it was great!  
As for the hosts, Joe & Theresa were great!  They were there to welcome us with wine and beer.  Joe showed us around the apt.  They were very friendly and went out of their way to provide anything we needed from places to visit, restaurants, directions and general area information.  We're always interested in the day-to-day lives of the locals and Joe was a great source of information and never seemed bothered by all the questions.  In fact, I probably talked his ears off while he was busy working around the yard, yet he always took the time to explain.  
There was a heat wave while we were there and Joe was very concerned we would be too warm.  He brought in fans to make us more comfortable.  In fact, the whole time we were there, he was always asking if we needed anything.
My husband says it best:  it was perfect!"
47624	4526737	10.0	10.0	37054693	We loved staying with Theresa and Joe in Seattle! The apartment is immaculate, very well-appointed, in a lovely neighborhood -- everything we were looking for. Both hosts are very friendly and knowledgeable about the area, having grown up in Seattle. We had great conversations and they were very attentive to our needs, while also being respectful of our privacy. The kitchen was perfect for making meals, which saved a lot of money. The nearby PCC coop has great fresh produce and everything we needed. We would return to Theresa and Joe's place in a heartbeat!
47625	4526737	10.0	10.0	45923386	"Joe & Theresa are the absolutely BEST hosts on Airbnb!! Couldn't do any more to make me feel welcome, almost family! Always smiling Joe is there to do anything for you! 
I'd pick this place to stay anytime I'm in Seattle! But I bought a small condo and now get to come visit as a friend. 
Beautiful furnishings, everything you could need for a short or long term stay like mine. Really nice to have a washer & dryer and now (thanks Joe) a full length mirror. Lovely private patio, art on walls and gorgeous oriental rugs, makes you just stay home! 
I'm sure you'll find Joe & Theresa sharing a glass of wine or homemade latte and helping you navigate wherever your travels take you! Super place, super people, now my friends!
Hugs, Jana"
47626	4526737	10.0	10.0	46450526	Joe and Theresa were so nice. The location was wonderful and the Airbnb was one of the best I have ever used. Highly recomended
47627	4526737	10.0	10.0	48278912	We couldn't have asked for better hosts. From the moment we got there, Theresa and Joe were very welcoming and informative on where everything was. Joe had awesome recommendations for restaurants, places to visit/sight see, and provided an excellent home for us for the week that included pretty much anything we needed. They made our first time in Seattle a memorable one. When my boyfriend and I come back to visit Washington, we'll be sure to stay with Theresa and Joe again! :)
47628	4526737	10.0	10.0	48760955	Our experience at Joe and Theresa's house was beyond expectation! The space was absolutely beautiful and fully stocked with everything we could ever need or want. The garden was stellar, the path to Pritchard Beach was great to walk in the morning, and the location was perfect. I would definitely stay with Theresa and Joe again. They were magnificent hosts!
47629	4526737	10.0	10.0	50360619	It was great. Joe and Theresa were very helpful with getting to know the area. I was up there for a job interview and it couldn't have been a better experience. 
47630	4526737	10.0	10.0	51360243	"Joe was very nice and accomidating. The space was imaculate and had everything you might possibly want for a nice quiet weekend. The apartment and the yard were filled with art and beauty and everything just makes you want to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and read a book. Joe supplied whole coffee beans/grinder/coffee pot and they served up fantaitic coffee each morning. Thanks Joe!!

I would recommend this location to anyone that has a car and does not mind driving. This location is back behind neighborhoods tucked away on a quiet street, therefore there are not really any businesses within walking distance. If you have transportation, this is a wonderful place to stay."
47631	4526737	10.0	10.0	52926417	We had a great stay at Joe and Theresa's. Its just as described: quiet, peaceful and extremely comfortable. Check in & out was super easy.. Joe was very kind in showing us around and making sure we had everything we needed. We had our car so getting around was easy, but the light rail isn't that far away if you happen to be visiting without a car. All in all we had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend!
47632	4526737	10.0	10.0	54630450	Upon arrival, Joe already chilled beer and a bottle of wine in the fridge waiting for us! He was very welcoming and made himself available if we needed anything at all. The apartment is beautifully decorated with various art pieces and an acute attention to detail. Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to enjoy the outdoor patio area due to the weather however it would be an ideal way to enjoy breakfast in the morning. The apartment is also conveniently located near parks and grocery stores. I would high recommend staying here if you are looking for a nice quiet retreat in the southend of Seattle!
47633	4526737	10.0	10.0	55929814	This is a great place to stay at! Was able to meet Joe and Theresa first thing upon my arrival. Joe gave me a quick tour of the place and they provided 2 Bottles of wine along with some beers in the fridge. Made the transition from moving from one coast to the other coast pretty easy.  The neighborhood is nice, quiet and safe. Restaurants and grocery stores are 5-8 minutes away (by car).  This location is right outside the city of Seattle so you will need to drive but not that far.  There are malls and additional restaurants 15 minutes south of this place.  SEATAC airport is 15-20 minutes away (depending on traffic, could take longer).  
48479	3022564	10.0	10.0	14102049	My wife and I stayed at Marcus & Lara's for 3 nights and had a fantastic stay at their studio. Marcus was super easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The studio is exactly how the pictures look and is perfect for a travelling couple. The place was super clean and has a very comfortable bed. Parking is right beside the unit. We found the location to be excellent with many restaurants, pubs and coffee shops a block and a half away. It is only about a 10 minute drive into the city or there is a train station only 4 blocks away which takes you right into downtown Seattle. Also a 2 minute drive takes you down to beautiful parks along Lake Washington. We are looking forward to our next stay at their studio the next time we are in Seattle. Thanks again Marcus and Lara!
48480	3022564	10.0	10.0	14175636	"My wife and I were in Seattle the past couple of days and looking for place between the airport and downtown. We found this place and booked right away. Everything was BRAND NEW, clean and we couldn't have asked for a better location. It was a 20 minute light rail north to Sea-Tac and a 30 minute ride downtown. 

There are great restaurants, bars and shopping all around Columbia City and we ended up spending more time in the neighborhood than downtown in Seattle. 

IF I COULD LEAVE 6 STARS I WOULD!"
48481	3022564	10.0	10.0	14457468	My boyfriend and I happened upon this delightful little place at the very last minute... what a find! The room was spotless, the pillows comfortable, the hosts warm and welcoming. Columbia City offered a bevy of lively bars, restaurants, shops, and very friendly locals, all within three blocks; the train to downtown was just a five-minute walk away. We will definitely be back to stay with Marcus and Lara on our next trip to Seattle.  Thanks again for having us!
48482	3022564	10.0	10.0	14574947	After staying at the studio, my boyfriend and I didn't want to leave! Not only was it squeaky clean but it was also in such a convenient location. There are great bars and restaurants practically right down the street and the light rail, which took us all over city, was a five-minute walk. Marcus and Lara made our stay in Seattle so comfortable. Thank you, we'll definitely be returning! 
48483	3022564	10.0	10.0	14710270	The studio is the perfect size. We stayed for two nights and absolutely loved it. Great spot. We would stay again.

The place was impeccable, really well located, 2 blocks away from all the fun that Columbia city has to offer.  I'm glad we found this place for our stay. 
Thanks,
Lizbeth "
48485	3022564	10.0	10.0	14934113	Marcus was able to accommodate all of our needs with our stay in columbia city. The house is nicely placed behind the duplex, not attached, everything is private. Just a 15 min drive to downtown. Great place to stay while visiting Seattle.
48486	3022564	10.0	10.0	15058754	Very nice, new place! My parents stayed here on a recent visit. Hosts have thought about little details to make guests comfortable. Wonderful location, near the heart of Columbia City. 
48487	3022564	10.0	10.0	15336949	"This was a wonderful place to stay.  Quaint and comfortable.  Marcus (our host) was very accommodating with our requests.  My wife and I happened to visit during the first week of July and the weather was unusually warm for that area.  Since there is no air conditioning, Marcus offered us, and then brought over, a box fan for us to use.  Everything in the apartment was very clean and serviceable.

Be advised that the windows at the top of the front wall catch the morning sun.  I was awoken promptly at 6:30 each morning from the sunshine.  If you want to sleep later you may want to bring a sleeping mask."
48488	3022564	10.0	10.0	15511752	We had a great stay at Marcus & Lara's studio. Even though there were difficulties meeting up at the same time for check-in Marcus was able to talk is through everything. The place was very welcoming and clean, and we appreciated the snacks and beverages available. There were even little chocolates by the bed! A soft place to land after a busy day adventuring.  I do suggest packing a sleeping mask to block out light. All around good experience!
48489	3022564	10.0	10.0	15831023	Great place in a really nice neighborhood. We really enjoyed running around the lake and visiting your restaurants. We like your studio. Very clean and great location. Thank you. 
48490	3022564	10.0	10.0	15926028	Marcus was great -- quick responses and always helpful.  He even brought over extra coffee when we needed it.  The studio itself was perfect -- everything designed with comfort and convenience in mind.  We also loved that we were a block away from a really interesting neighborhood with great restaurants and shops and an amazing farmer's market on Wednesday afternoon/evening.  The parking provided in back came in very handy.  This was our first Airbnb and I'm just hoping it doesn't spoil us for future ones.
48491	3022564	10.0	10.0	16093763	Great place that perfectly met our needs.  Marcus was a helpful host who made sure that we knew our way around.  He was easy to get in touch with and quick to answer any question.  The space is very private, clean, well-furnished, and perfect for one or two people who are looking for a space to sleep or have the occasional light meal.  The location is also quite good.  The light rail is a short walk and we really enjoyed the Columbia City neighborhood. 
48492	3022564	10.0	10.0	16351740	"Marcus met us at the studio when we arrived, showed us the space, and gave us suggestions for food, coffee, and getting around Seattle. The studio was plenty of space for my husband and I, especially since we were spending most of our time out and about in Seattle anyway. It was clean, cute, and cozy. Plus, it's only a short walk to the light rail which took us straight into downtown. We didn't really interact with Marcus or Lara while we stayed, which was fine since we were doing our own thing anyway; and it made it feel like the studio was ""our place."" Overall, we really enjoyed our stay!"
48493	3022564	10.0	10.0	16558659	Had a great stay in Seattle, place was clean and well stocked. Area was nice and trendy, easy transit into downtown Seattle as well.

It was in a really cute and safe neighborhood and walking distance to coffee shops, bakeries, and the light rail. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle. Our host, Marcus was very nice and welcoming. The room had some tourist info brochures and a booklet of restaurant & public transportation information.  I enjoyed my first experience in Seattle!
48499	3022564	10.0	10.0	18059431	Nice and lovely place of a friendly and cool host Marcus. We would definitely come back again! Rebecca + Fabian

48501	3022564	10.0	10.0	18654324	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the studio over PAX weekend- it was adorable, comfortable, and convenient! Marcus and Lara are very accommodating and quick to respond- I will definitely remember this place when I think of a location to stay in Seattle. Thank you!
48502	3022564	10.0	10.0	18959029	We had a great night at your cute little place in the city. Worked out perfect for our stay in Seattle, never got to the Chihuly exhibit as the weather decided to change just as we were about to go, so I am sure we will be back. Thanks so much.
48503	3022564	10.0	10.0	19123179	Marcus was very friendly and helpful. He answered our questions and was available if we needed anything!

The studio has everything you need, including a lot of info and brochures to check out the city!

We definitely loved it.  Thanks again!"
48508	3022564	10.0	10.0	20335658	Great little place in the perfect little neighborhood of Columbia City. So easy to get around from here and yet comfortably outside the bustle. 
48509	3022564	10.0	10.0	20508859	Great bungalow located just outside the city but with easy access to the lightrail that runs between downtown and the airport. There are a few shops and cafes within a short walk of the bungalow.  Marcus was great host,  quick reply to email and texts and able to accommodate our late arrival.  The space is beautiful and modern.
48510	3022564	10.0	10.0	20816796	The studio was just as described and we had a great stay. Marcus was very accommodating and the check in/check out process could not have been simpler. The studio is about a 10 min walk to the light rail and from the light rail about 20 minutes to downtown. We enjoyed the unique restaurants right down the street from the studio. 
48511	3022564	10.0	10.0	20996148	Marcus checked in with us when we arrived to make sure we had everything we needed.  The space was exactly as described- clean and tidy, with nice decor and thoughtful extras like mints on the pillow and a nice selection of single brew coffee.  Really appreciated the handy off street parking, easy access to the light rail and the nice dining options just blocks away on the main drag of Columbia City.  Highly recommended!
48512	3022564	10.0	10.0	21578644	My husband and I had a lovely stay. The studio had everything we needed for our 5-day stay. Clean and well organized and great communication w/ our host, Marcus. It was in a terrific location with walking distance to restaurants & coffee shops...and an ice cream parlor/arcade! Perfect if you have a car, w/ a parking spot. Close to public transportation if you don't. Intimate, modern, and quiet. The only thing missing is a kitchen, but who needs that when you have a mini-fridge, microwave, & a street full of eateries?! Great stay & we'd do it again. Thanks for a lovely stay in Seattle!
48513	3022564	10.0	10.0	21711174	This was a fairly unique situation as I'm actually a local to Seattle and was staying here for a couple of days while some relatives occupied my own apartment. It was a very pleasant stay. Marcus was very hospitable, and ensured that he was available to meet me when I check-in. The studio itself is very new, nicely constructed, and comfortable. The on-site parking space was also a nice bonus. Overall,  very happy with my stay, and my first Airbnb experience!
48514	3022564	10.0	10.0	21942347	This backyard bungalow was the absolute perfect home for our stay in Seattle. Marcus did a fantastic job of stocking the studio with everything we could possibly need during our stay. Check-in was a breeze and there was everything from a mini kitchen to mints on our bed and even a hair dryer! Having our own parking spot was an amazing perk and right outside our front door. It was only a 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle which was so convenient. It was so nice to wind down in a quiet neighborhood after a long day of site seeing and enjoying city life. In short, we felt so comfortable staying here and we will definitely book again if/when we return to Seattle! 
48515	3022564	10.0	10.0	22700006	This was a great stay, super clean and comfortable! Marcus was very easy to work with and check-in was simple.

48517	3022564	10.0	10.0	23432576	Marcus' studio was a very comfortable and convenient place to stay, especially if you're looking for a hotel alternative. Easy arrival and departure, excellent location with great coffee and food in walking distance, and a superb host. Thank you Marcus! We hope to be back soon!
48518	3022564	10.0	10.0	23622051	Great little cabin all that you need for a few nights away! Fantastic location close to restaurants and shops and only a light rail tram ride away from the city of Seattle itself.
48519	3022564	10.0	10.0	24022300	Five stars! My wife and I spent two nights in this studio and it was better than staying at a hotel. The host thought of every detail from coffee to wifi to shampoo in the shower to even a pick up from the light rail station. The location is PERFECT just two blocks from the mains trip with some of Seattle's top rated restaurants and bars. We'll always stay here when we visit Seattle. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
48520	3022564	10.0	10.0	24096281	"This was my first Airbnb experience and my friend as well who arrived from Yemen the day we checked in, and I'm HAPPY we spent it here! Marcus checked us in, great and helpful person. 
Backyard bungalow is a 5-star hotel experience. Marcus & Lara thought of everything, there's even a hair dryer!
The studio has everything you can think of, and the location is near everything! I highly recommend this studio, perfect in every way.
Thank you Marcus & Lara =)"
48521	3022564	10.0	10.0	24137830	Decided to stay in a different part of Seattle this past weekend, and came across this awesome little place for only $80/night.  Tucked in off the street, it's only a short walk to a great coffee place and lots of interesting restaurants and bars in the down town area on Ranier.  Comfy bed, nice amenities...would highly recommend this place to anyone.
48522	3022564	10.0	10.0	24357881	My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Marcus and Lara’s studio.  The studio was clean and modern and every detail was provided in a very organized manner.  It was also very private and quiet.  Our favorite aspect of the stay was the neighborhood.  The studio is located in a cute quaint neighborhood and is just up the hill from several little places to grab good coffee and a bite to eat.  There was even a mini theatre if the mood strikes to see a movie.  The neighborhood was also just a short drive to anywhere we visited in Seattle.  Would definitely recommend staying here!    
48523	3022564	10.0	10.0	24733232	Great location and we found the studio was just as described. Wonderfully clean and perfect for our two day stay in Seattle. Marcus was very responsive and helpful. Thanks for a great stay.

48527	3022564	10.0	10.0	25537854	This was our first visit to Seattle and we had an amazing experience! Great neighborhood consisting of various coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc. Only a 15 minute drive from downtown. Great accommodations, we can't wait to come back!  
48528	3022564	10.0	10.0	25778270	It is a nice, clean place. 
48529	3022564	10.0	10.0	26000517	Great little studio! Marcus greeted us and gave us a brief rundown of a few things.  Studio was quite comfortable and perfect for our stay.  We were in the neighborhood for an event and found the location to be perfect.  We were able to walk to coffee and dinner and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood.  
48530	3022564	10.0	10.0	26168467	"I absolutely loved staying here! The location is very convenient to downtown Seattle, yet still feels ""secluded"" with its own structure and private parking off the alley. I will be staying here again in a couple weeks and I genuinely look forward to it!"
48531	3022564	10.0	10.0	26735588	"The rental suite and the location were fantastic. There is a reason the Columbia City neighbourhood has a walkability score of 98%. There are a ton of great restaurants just 2 blocks away on Rainier Ave. Don't miss the Columbia City Bakery, Medusa or the Flying Lion microbrewery just a few blocks to the south. And it's only a 20 minute commute to downtown via the Link Light Rail (so easy to get to). There's even an organic grocery store coming in 3 blocks away in the summer of 2015. And there are a few arts hotspots nearby like The Royal Room and Columbia City Theatre.

The space itself is clean and well appointed. The bed is comfortable. The wifi worked perfectly. The suite even has its own hot water tank so you don't have to worry about competing for hot water. An in suite fridge, microwave, coffee maker and dishes were a great touch. The icing on the cake is the brochure rack of Seattle attractions!

Marcus and Lara are so friendly, helpful and approachable. They met me at the appointed time and then left me undisturbed (unless I needed something) for the 10 days I stayed. It really does feel like a home away from home.

Note, the house beside it is home to renters, so don't ring the doorbell and expect Marcus or Lara to answer. Make arrangements to meet with them ahead of time."
48532	3022564	10.0	10.0	26874791	This little bungalow was a very enjoyable place to stay during my trip to Seattle. Marcus was a phenomenal host who was very accommodating and helpful at all hours of the day. This was one of my first Airbnb experiences and I could not have been happier. I absolutely recommend this spot to anyone visiting this city!

48535	3022564	10.0	10.0	28248849	Marcus and Lara were wonderful hosts and provided everything possible to make our stay comfortable. The studio was cozy and modern, and they had HBO on their TV. This is a good place to stay in if you're looking for privacy since its nice and quiet, and next to a street with local restaurants and shops. If you want to go downtown, you can take public transportation that's about a 5-10 minute walk away, and take a bus or light rail (which takes ~40 minutes). Overall, I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a relaxing and private place to stay at.
48536	3022564	10.0	10.0	28872049	I absolutely loved this little studio. The area is so cute and quiet and my boyfriend and I felt quite comfortable and at home here. We had several delays on our flight out and Marcus was so understanding and helpful despite the inconvenience. Once we got here, he happily talked us through everything and explained the area. I was a little nervous about using this app as I had never personally used it before but Marcus really made a great impression and I am so happy I chose to stay here. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting seattle! 
48537	3022564	10.0	10.0	29099492	This great studio unit was perfect for my girlfriend and I during our short stay in Seattle. Just a few blocks away from the light rail which will take you in the heart of downtown in about 15 minutes. Cute restaurants and shops right down the street in Columbia City. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!
48538	3022564	10.0	10.0	29855586	Marcus met us at the studio, and he was extremely helpful. The studio was better than he and Lara described in the listing and pictures don't it justice. This was our first airbnb experience and it set a high bar for our lodging expectations.
48539	3022564	10.0	10.0	30285435	Marcus was a great host. He went above and beyond to pick up flowers and champagne for my wife and coordinate a nice surprise for her upon our arrival. He also provided great neighborhood recommendations and places to check out while in Seattle. The place was very nicely remodeled, had everything we needed and more. Very comfortable and much better than a hotel. We got a lovely sense of community staying in Columbia City. Would definitely recommend this studio to anyone visiting Seattle. In walking distance to the light rail or a quick Uber from any part of the city. 
48540	3022564	10.0	10.0	30654773	Marcus and Lara were such wonderful hosts.  I had contacted them (very) last minute and they welcomed me warmly.  I can't thank them for their hospitality.  The studio is perfect - very thoughtfully planned and in a GREAT location.  Will recommend to friends and family!
48541	3022564	10.0	10.0	30869902	I loved this studio! It was perfect for my first trip to Seattle. Marcus was such a wonderful host, he was very responsive, helpful and very accommodating. This was my first AirBnB experience and it definitely set the bar high for my future lodging expectations. I would definitely recommend this studio, it was very convenient to get to and from downtown being that it was so close to the light rail! I am looking forward to staying here again in the future! 
48542	3022564	10.0	10.0	31033785	What a wonderful little place in a great neighborhood!  So many cool little restaurants and bars within walking distance.  Marcus was always just a text or phone call away to answer any questions.  Place was better in person!  Super clean, modern, and very quiet.  Definitely will stay again the next time back in Seattle!
48543	3022564	10.0	10.0	31170428	Very comfortable.  Great place to explore Seattle from.  Great neighborhood to explore.  Great hosts.  We will definitely be back!

"
48545	3022564	10.0	10.0	31870904	What a great stay in Seattle and the studio was perfect for our needs.  It was immaculately kept and exactly like the photos.  Although we only saw them the once Marcus and Lara felt like close friends to deal with, wonderful hosts and a wonderful studio.  Neighborhood is great with some excellent restaurants and bars.  Thank you ! 
48546	3022564	10.0	10.0	32498332	Marcus was a great host! We got in early and he was able to work with our schedule and meet us as soon as possible. We were welcomed with fresh linens, clean towels, a fully stocked keurig and dishes that came in handy. He had a book with things to do, places to eat, pamphlets to look at and made it really easy to decide what to do! The parking was great right in front of the studio. I would highly recommend staying here if you are ever in Seattle! 
48547	3022564	10.0	10.0	32813947	This was a great first time using AirBNB. Marcus was very nice and provided great recommendations for places to eat. The bungalow was very nice and clean. We were very pleased. 
48548	3022564	10.0	10.0	33059432	This studio was better than described...super clean, comfortable and convenient. The perfect place for us, staying a weekend in Seattle. Access to the lite rail was great, rode to the city center both days, and then took it to the airport very early, with no problem.  Great variety of restaurants in the neighborhood, all within walking distance. We never got to meet our hosts, as we came in early, but got all the info we needed via texts. Marcus checked that we had arrived safely, and to see if we needed anything additional.  Coffee, water and snacks were provided, as well as a ton of travel/tourist info. A great help in deciding what to see and do.  This is a very cool place to stay in Seattle. Would highly recommend.
48549	3022564	10.0	10.0	33892137	"The studio was very nice. It was well equipped, clean and cosy.
The neighborhood is nice and quiet and we felt very comfortable.
Checking in was kind of difficult, since Marcus made it quite complicated for us (to text, to get the key-code, to find the driveway to the backyard - or to meet). He wasn't unfriendly, he just gave us very little information - and only little by little.
In the end we didn't meet him at all, but it was alright and we enjoyed being there anyways."
48550	3022564	10.0	10.0	34187472	The studio was clean, bright, and comfortable. It was the perfect space for the two of us as we came up to Seattle on a long road trip from Austin. We met Marcus upon arriving and he was incredibly nice and helpful, giving us the run down on the space and some tips/recommendations for nearby coffee shops and public transportation for getting around downtown. Information about Seattle along with things to do were also provided in the studio along with detailed instructions on how to do everything, like closing the windows and turning on the TV. They really thought of everything - our stay couldn't have gone more smoothly. The parking space in back made it easy for us to pull in and unload our stuff, and the neighborhood felt very safe and friendly. Overall, the space really made our Seattle trip perfect. We only wish we could have stayed longer, but we know that we'll be back very soon! I would recommend this space to anyone traveling to Seattle. 
48551	3022564	10.0	10.0	34629859	We absolutely loved the Columbia City neighborhood and the studio was so close to both the bus (just a block and a half!) and the light rail (a few more blocks!). Definitely recommended for travelers on a budget who still want to see all the sights!
48552	3022564	10.0	10.0	34932686	Marcus was very welcoming from day 1 meeting us at the studio earlier than planned and showed us the space and offered some good insights on some things we wanted to check out while in town. The studio was what we anticipated, clean and cozy. The studio was also located in a great location, easy to get downtown and a great area around the studio in Columbia City to walk to get food and drinks. It was a great first experience with Airbnb and both the stay and hosts! I would recommend staying with Marcus and Laura to anyone checking out Seattle.
48553	3022564	10.0	10.0	35230437	Marcus and Lara were wonderful hosts. They met us upon arrival and gave suggestions on places to go that evening.  One thing they suggested was an event called Beatwalk which was occurring the night we arrived. As we hopped to each restaurant there were local live bands and artists playing.  The locals were out having a good time and it gave us an opportunity to truly experience being part of the community there.  The studio was quiet, secure, and fit our needs.  It was very clean and I enjoyed the decor (especially the keypad entry so I didn't have to worry about losing any keys!).  The studio was just a block away from downtown Columbia City, good restaurants, and Empire coffee were we enjoyed a fabulous latte.  Since we wanted to go into the city there was a short walk to the light rail which took us everywhere we wanted to visit. Overall I would recommend to those who are looking for a home base to move about the city.
48554	3022564	10.0	10.0	35411776	Great studio in a Great Neighborhood. Marcus is a great host and his studio is the best place to stay in Seattle hands down. Just a block away there is such a big variety of restaurants and bars. We felt in love in Seattle thanks to our stay here. Will recommend to all of our friends and family. Thank you. 
48555	3022564	10.0	10.0	35762539	What a fantastic experience. We felt at home in this wonderfully decorated studio. Everything you need is within walking distance and the Hosts only a text away. Great restaurants and bars. We would certainly visit again. Thank you.

Marcus was very helpful and accommodating, even when we were late arriving to the Studio after issues at the airport.  He walked us through, gave us suggestions on where to go, what to eat, etc.  He was very friendly.

The studio had a nice, comfortable bed, a TV, wifi, bathroom and shower and Keurig for coffee!  

My girlfriend and I would definitely stay again."

48563	3022564	10.0	10.0	39429264	It could not get better than this. Conveniently located to public transit. Private keyless entry. Parking right in front of the unit. Everything that could have been thought of was (website hidden) Listing, local attractions, Frequently Asked Questions, recommendations. They did it all. This Suite felt like it was in a high end hotel Really Really Happy with the stay. 
48564	3022564	10.0	10.0	39728963	What a great little hideaway for our trip to Seattle! Marcus and Lara were gracious enough to accommodate us during our stay and their hospitality was top notch.

48565	3022564	10.0	10.0	40312048	Marcus was great! He accommodated our late arrival time and then gave us all kinds of suggesting on where to eat and visit during our time in Seattle. He was always really responsive if we had a question. The studio is exactly as it appears on the listing: clean, modern, and comfortable. It is about a ten minute walk to the light rail, and a five minute walk to the bus stop. Columbia city is small but there are some cool places. Mainly the location is good because you can get to downtown easily. We would definitely stay here again!

48569	3022564	10.0	10.0	41918572	"We absolutely loved our stay here! Marcus was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The airbnb really is set up like a hotel room but with the charm of being in a cute neighborhood. The space is exactly as shown in the photos, with the added bonus of tourist attraction pamphlets just like you would find in a hotel. We loved walking the neighborhood in the morning to get coffee, pastries, and even a haircut. 
Even though there is plenty of street parking, you do get a dedicated off street parking spot in the alley behind the house to make coming home worry free.  
We would definitely return here again!"
48570	3022564	10.0	10.0	42507034	Adorable place with everything you could need. Very close to the light rail and even closer to buses. Marcus was a great communicator and an awesome host. Highly recommended.

48572	3022564	10.0	10.0	43849858	Perfect little studio in the center of Columbia City. Comfortable, private, and quiet. Literally a 3 minute walk from bars, restaurants and  buses and 8 minutes from the LINK rail to downtown/airport.
48573	3022564	10.0	10.0	44285773	The neighborhood was so great. Still very much a Seattle-feel to it mixed with a friendlier small town environment. Marcus and Lara were great: understanding and accommodating to a few small, special requests we had to make. Likely we'll stay here again!
48574	3022564	10.0	10.0	44884628	Marcus was very welcoming and the studio wad just as described.   It was very clean and had all of the amenities one would want.

He took the time to answer all of our questions and gave us great recommendations from sites, places to eat, and everything in between.  From a fabulous brunch spot to the local sports watering hole, everything around us had a homely feel, which made us feel right at home.  Our experience with Marcus as well as our time in Seattle made it extremely difficult for us to leave.  When the time comes for our return to this wonderful city, you know who we will be checking in with! 
48580	3022564	10.0	10.0	47330882	Great experience for my first Airbnb. Really enjoyed the accommodation and the neighborhood. Contact with the hosts was very fast and Marcus attended to the requests I had. Will be booking again next time I am in Seattle.

The studio is located on a very quiet street, yet only one block from trendy Columbia City. There were lots of cafes and restaurants and an incredible supermarket, all 5 minutes walk from the studio. There is also a light rail which was about 3 blocks away. We used it every day to get into the city. The ride took about 15minutes.Very user friendly. 
I would thoroughly recommend this studio for your stay in Seattle.

48584	3022564	10.0	10.0	49440150	This was such a lovely sweet studio! Marcus was super nice, provided as much information as possible, he even helped me find a laundry. This was also my mom's first time trying airbnb, she liked this studio and especially the neighborhood, highly recommended!

48586	3022564	10.0	10.0	50072426	The studio was wonderful! Perfect location and very neat upon arrival. Marcus and Lara checked in on us a few times to make sure we got into the studio okay. They were 100% on communication and hospitality!

48588	3022564	10.0	10.0	50864841	Great studio in a great location. The studio was very well equipped. Marcus and Lara were wonderful and provided a lot of great tips for traveling exploring the city.
48589	3022564	10.0	10.0	51021173	This place was exactly as described and as pictured. Marcus was very prompt in communication and Lara met us to give us a welcome tour and explain the door. They had snacks and all sorts of info about Seattle in general and the Columbia City area as well. The train was a bit of a walk but extremely easy to navigate (similar to DART if you've ever ridden Dallas's light rail). It got us down and back. There was also an off-street parking space if we had rented a car. It's a nice quiet neighborhood, very safe seeming. Just a couple blocks away is Rainier street with all sorts of restaurants and a small movie theater. Very lovely place and would definitely stay again if we are in the area!
48590	3022564	10.0	10.0	51434505	Marcus and Lara were great hosts, the home was perfect for our needs and the area was very quaint and quiet. There are a lot of great restaurants in the area; our favorites were Geraldine's counter and Rookies to watch games. Overall, a perfect experience!!!

Will definitely return. 
48593	3022564	10.0	10.0	52405520	Wonderful area.  So easy to get downtown using the train.  Also easy to reach from Airport and Amtrak so you don't need a car.  Columbia City was very nice.  Geraldine's for breakfast, Columbia City Ale House for lunch and La Medusa for dinner.  We had a beer from Spinnaker which is close but was not open the days we were there.  I would check it out.  Oh and Salted Sea for oyster Happy Hour!  Great location.  Easy walking even though a bit hilly if you aren't used to hills.  Check out CrossFit RE on Rainer (walking distance) to work off good eating.

48595	3022564	10.0	10.0	53055853	I met Marcus as planned. The studio was just as described. The neighborhood was safe and had plenty of places to eat and drink. I went to the movie theatre right around the corner and saw a great first run movie. The light rail was an easy walk and a good alternative to driving into Seatle's waterfront district. Marcus was a patient and knowledgable host. 
48596	3022564	10.0	10.0	53287055	Great place. Great location. Great host, Marcus was full of information and suggestions. Everything was as mentioned in the posting, I hope to return in the future.
48597	3022564	10.0	10.0	53704549	This was our first time in Seattle and definitely not our last! Marcus and Lara's place is a gem and a great find. Location is amazing! It was walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops to name a few. Their place was very cozy and filled with endless guides to tour Seattle. Marcus was a great host. He was easy to communicate with and was very helpful in giving us suggestions on places to go and eat. Would definitely come back and rent their place when we return to Seattle. Thanks again! 
48598	3022564	10.0	10.0	54496624	We had a great time at the studio. It was super cute, clean, and in a really lovely neighborhood. It was especially convenient for taking public transportation (which is far preferable to driving in Seattle, in our opinion.) Marcus was quick to respond to any questions we had and was a very gracious host. We would definitely stay here again!

48600	3022564	10.0	10.0	55817124	What a cozy little place. Perfect stay for a couple. The place is clean, warm, and Marcus was really friendly and helpful. Hope to stay again!

48604	3022564	10.0	10.0	57432275	The host made us feel very welcome. The description was accurate. The accommodation is very well located, quiet, elegant, pleasant. We will definitely seek to use this accommodation again when we return to Seattle.
48605	3022564	10.0	10.0	57625364	The owners did a great job renovating this former detached garage into a self-enclosed studio suite that is on par or better than a standard hotel room. The suite was well-stocked with amenities, including snacks, bottled water, a mini-fridge and a Keurig coffee maker. Check-in was simple thanks to a keypad entry - we didn't even need to coordinate a meeting with the host. The location of the studio is fantastic for visiting Seattle. The immediate Columbia City neighborhood is bustling with a wide variety of restaurants and a great market, and the studio's proximity to the LINK (Seattle's light rail system) makes it super easy to head north into the downtown core or south to Sea-Tac airport (if you flew into town), with trains every 10 mins. We'd definitely stay here again in the future.
52644	9477539	10.0	10.0	55993619	Staying with Charlie was great.  It was a comfortable room with towels laid out, nice bed, and I am buying myself one of those great pillows.  Bathroom next to the room was also lovely with extra toiletries (to which I had to avail myself since I forgot my toothbrush).  Exactly as advertised.  He was a great.  Thanks for the room!
52645	9477539	10.0	10.0	56691165	"Charlie's place is great. Very clean and a great location. Having a private bathroom next to the bedroom is a real plus for me. 
Charlie had coffee ready to go in the mornings!

Thanks again for everything.

55685	6543683	10.0	10.0	35883550	"Our hosts were very polite and friendly without being intrusive. The neighborhood is gorgeous and in a very convenient location. The house was beautiful and very clean. The sheets were super soft. It felt like they thought of everything! They provided bathrobes in our room and stocked the mini-fridge with drinks, yogurt, etc. Breakfast was simple and delicious.

The only thing to note is that sometimes there are other guests, and (at least of this writing) the sunporch off this room is a shared space. It wasn't an issue for us, but it's worth mentioning.

Saturday night, my bf and I made the mistake of parking in a garage that closed at 10 p.m. :( We took a cab back to the house, and the next morning our host was gracious enough to drive us downtown so we could fetch our car. We thought that was very generous of them, and we very much appreciated it!

I would absolutely recommend staying here. Cody was fantastic about providing quick, clear communication throughout the entire experience from pre-booking to checkout."
55686	6543683	10.0	10.0	37427692	"This house is very beautiful, and has a very nice ambiance. The hospitality was excellent, and parking was easily found nearby.

Top notch accomodation - thank you!"
55687	6543683	10.0	10.0	38202227	"I booked Cody's place for my friend who visited Seattle this summer during a weekend. Here is what he has to say about his stay at Cody's :-

It was really nice to stay at Cody's place. The place has nice feeling of old British days. Rooms are  full of nice and comfy furniture. It was very easy to get to the place and parking was easy. The dead end on the side of the apartment makes it a safe and convenient place to park a car!  Cody and his mother were gracious hosts with welcoming smile. The bed room was nice and well kept.

58319	557126	10.0	10.0	2061740	"Chad & Ruben were amazing hosts. My brother and I were stuck in Seattle--all hotel rooms in the city were booked. Literally last minute we found Chad and Ruben's place. It was perfectly located in funky Capitol Hill. It was an excellent homebase for exploring the city. 

C&R's place was clean and the bathroom was big. They were very accommodating. They changed the front door lock code to the last four digits in my phone number so it would be easy for us to enter. We also cooked a tasty breakfast in their stocked kitchen. 

Overall our experience was amazing. We were from being screwed to an ideal situation. Great house, great location, great hosts. Chad and Ruben even left of travel goodie bags for the road! I'll definitely be back."
58320	557126	10.0	10.0	2129933	Chad and Ruben were great hosts for our stay in Seattle! Their apartment is convenient in a hip part of town, clean and spacious - with a great private bathroom!  They were very accomodating to a change in my travel plans and had even offered me a ride from the airport the day I landed!  I would highly recommend this stay and thank you both so much for a great experience!

They were easy to contact and offered lots of suggestions and insights into the Seattle area. The location is just a short 10 min walk down to the Convention Center.

The room is a spacious den area with a twin size bed and a full bathroom. A bottle of water, an iPhone charger, maps of Seattle and ear plugs were conveniently provided for use in the room.

This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience. The room was nice and hosts were great. I would stay stay here again in the future. "
58322	557126	10.0	10.0	2257058	Chad and Ruben (and their adorable pup)'s place in Capitol Hill was perfect for my quick stay in Seattle! They were both welcoming and communicative before and during my stay. They were very helpful when I was trying to figure out where to go and the best way to get there. They even took me on a quick driving tour and graciously offered me rides when they were out and about! The location is great! Getting to and from major attractions was easy by foot and by bus. Their property is also close to lots of places to eat and hang out in the Capitol Hill area. The room itself is inviting and comfortable with a good wifi connection if you need it. I would totally stay here again if I'm back in the area! Highly recommended!
58323	557126	10.0	10.0	2341300	I had a perfect stay at Chad and Ruben's listing! My time in Seattle was brief, but thanks to Chad and Ruben's tips, I ended up having memorable experiences I wouldn't have had otherwise (I highly suggest checking out the Public Library and taking a ferry). Their listing is in a perfect location for exploring Downtown, but the neighborhood itself is worth checking out as well. The room is incredibly cozy, quiet, and serene, with an attached bathroom that is generous in size. The room has the type of ambiance that beckons you to hit the snooze button. If you're traveling solo, I highly suggest Chad and Ruben's quiet Seattle sanctuary. 
58324	557126	10.0	10.0	2387045	Chad and Ruben were delightful hosts. They were super friendly and eager to accomodate. Their house is conveniently located in Capitol Hill and is a short walk from amazing cafes, eateries and pubs. My girlfriend, and I felt right at home. We would stay here again--and so should you!

58326	557126	10.0	10.0	3589622	Chad and Ruben were great hosts and we really had an enjoyable experience staying with them in their lovely home.  Our room was cozy and very clean and they made sure we had everything we needed during our stay-- towels, shampoo, water, etc. The bathroom is huge and has a really nice luxurious rain-like shower head and the bed was buried in fluffy down comforters and loads of pillows. They kept the house nicely heated, which was a great comfort to return to after being outside in the cold all day. Their dog, Rush, is also the cutest, sweetest little hotdog I've ever seen. He was wagging his tail so hard when we met him, we thought his butt was going to fall off. :) Overall, it was a great stay and we would highly recommend Chad and Ruben's home to anyone.
58327	557126	10.0	10.0	3609986	"Chad & Ruben's room is not only charming, it is peaceful and comfortable and well-appointed, and was exactly what I needed. I came to Seattle (my home-town) for a job interview. This location is so easy for public transit, and anything else you could need can readily be had within a 3-block radius. The room is beautiful, the bathroom is enormous, the wi-fi is solid, and coming and going was easy and quiet. There is even an impressive supply of high-end hotel toiletries, and a hair dryer. There is a little bit of normal urban neighborhood street noise at night, but your hosts provide a white-noise fan and ear plugs if you need them (I was fine).

Best of all, you will have the best hosts here. Chad was very friendly and a pleasure to talk with, and communications were wonderfully smooth. With flexible check-in and check-out, we arranged for me to let myself in when I got there a little before 1pm, and I had to get going early on the day I left. I didn't get to meet Ruben this time, but even so he sent me a text wishing me luck for the interview! Chad took very good care of me, and it was a delight to meet their mini dachshund Rash (such a welcoming little gentleman). 

I had everything I needed staying in Chad & Ruben's charming room on Capitol Hill. Come and have your own perfect stay!"

58330	557126	10.0	10.0	3851050	I moved to Seattle looking for a home, work, and school, and was fortunate enough to have AirBNB assist me in my transition. Chad and Ruben were great hosts, courteous, considerate people with a wonderful home. This is a great deal! I would definitely stay here again, if I was just visiting.
58331	557126	10.0	10.0	3929226	Wonderful hosts and a great location! It was so easy to walk from the apartment to great restaurants and cafes. Chad and Ruben created a cute bedroom/bathroom set up that made us feel like we had our own private space. It was perfect! 
58332	557126	10.0	10.0	4058223	One word: Beautiful! Chad and Rueben have done an amazing job of creating a soft and very welcoming room near the entrance of their super cool home so you feel comfortable as either the daytime busy body or social night owl. LOVE their sweet little puppy, and as hosts they are fun and easy going. The room is in the perfect spot for the city, and we will definitely be coming back. Thanks for everything guys!! (Becky and Joel)
58333	557126	10.0	10.0	4104148	This was my first Air BnB adventure. I loved staying with Chad and Ruben (and Rash!) I will definitely repeat the experience when I'm next in Seattle. My room was beautiful and tranquil. My hosts were friendly and easy-going. I only hope that all my future Air BnB experiences are as delightful.
58334	557126	10.0	10.0	4228872	Perfect first air bnb  experience! The place was clean and adorable and a great location!
58335	557126	10.0	10.0	4253021	Wonderful location within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, clubs, and other attractions in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. Convenient to downtown, Space Needle, transit and other attractions. Chad and Ruben were very sweet and down to earth. We'll definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle. 
58336	557126	10.0	10.0	4318215	This room is awesome. It's basically like your own private apartment but Chad and Ruben are there if you need help or have questions. The shower is also fantastic. 
58337	557126	10.0	10.0	4352305	"Well-kept, modern, and welcoming, the room you find behind charming french doors was absolutely wonderful. Their home is in an ideal location, within easy walking distance to a main drag of Broadway. 

Chad was very gracious, friendly, and helpful, and Rash the dachshund was adorable. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our one-night stay and will definitely look to stay here again!"
58338	557126	10.0	10.0	4454178	Chad and Ruben offer ideal accommodations with privacy and a location close to everything.  We had a car but walked nearly everywhere, including downtown to the Opera.  Street parking is very difficult and public garages are scarce in this area.  Still, the location and friendly hosts make this an excellent choice.
58339	557126	10.0	10.0	4524289	Our stay at Chad and Ruben's place was wonderful. We felt very comfortable and it's a beautiful apartment and vicinity. The room was clean and had everything we needed and more. I would definitely stay there again.
58340	557126	10.0	10.0	4540770	I've paid twice as much for hotel rooms that could not hold a candle to this space. It's not only clean and beautiful, but they really paid attention to little details like a bottle of water next to the bed. And the shower head in the guest bathroom... oh boy, words fail. A great experience. 
58341	557126	10.0	10.0	4580119	Chad & Ruben are wonderful hosts.  The room was great and we received wonderful hospitality.  The location was perfect for us and the parking is available but you may have to park a block away but no big deal.  We look forward to staying again!
58342	557126	10.0	10.0	4648979	"For our first airbnb experience we had found the ideal place at Chad and Rubens house.
The room is very cozy, the private bathroom very convenient and clean! The whole 
Going to town was in walking distance (about 15-20 min.) but there is also a busstation close by with a starbucks at the corner ;)
The whole ""booking-process"" was very easy and also the access to their house.

Thanks Chad and Ruben, we had a great stay.

58343	557126	10.0	10.0	4687172	This room was perfect! Chad and Ruben really went above and beyond - from lovely decor to upscale sheets, bedding and lots of pillows, to water bottles and mints beside the bed! The attached bathroom was also very clean and luxuriously outfitted with cushy rugs and a fancy shower head! I felt very comfortable coming and going and I never felt like I was disturbing anyone, regardless of the time. The location is amazing, with a bus stop into town just a block away, and Capitol Hill nightlife an easy walk down Broadway. I felt safe walking alone in the area, even late at night. I really have only glowingly positive things to say about this place and my hosts! Hope I get to stay with them again!
58344	557126	10.0	10.0	4747039	"I was looking for a convenient and clean place to crash and shower.  I was running around Seattle like a crazy person so this worked out beautifully.

Chad and Ruben made it so easy for me to come in at my own time with no hassle with keys, etc...

the bathroom is 100x better than my own bathroom, so I appreciated that - and the bed was super comfy - i wanted to sleep in.

great place - i recommend!

Thanks C&R!

Best,

58345	557126	10.0	10.0	4839726	Chad & Ruben were wonderful hosts!  The room was clean and spacious with an adjoined, private bathroom.  While our schedules didn't give us an opportunity to meet in-person, they were polite and communicative via email and very instructive on how to access the house and its location.  I'd highly recommend their place and it was a wonderful introduction to AirBnB for a first timer.  Thanks!
58346	557126	10.0	10.0	4954081	Great room, bed, location and shower. 
58347	557126	10.0	10.0	5014339	This place was beautiful! Great neighborhood, safe and quiet location, easy access to Capitol Hill's Broadway and downtown. I only stayed here 2 nights, but would love to stay again the next time I am in town. The room was very cozy and the bathroom was equipped with any necessities in case you forgot them. The booking and check-in process were really easy with Chad and he was very quick to respond to my messages. Chad was very friendly and he was polite to give me some space after a very long day at work. Highly recommended.
58348	557126	10.0	10.0	5089101	"Chad and Ruben were wonderful hosts! Chad was very quick to respond, making check-in and check-out run very smoothly. The private room and bathroom were nicely decorated, and they even provided water bottles and some toiletries. We hardly ever saw Chad and Ruben, but they were incredibly friendly during our brief interactions. Ruben even suggested a few food places to check out nearby. The location is walking distance to night life in Capitol Hill and about a 25-minute walk to Downtown and Pike but coming back is quite the uphill trek. Great place to stay if location and privacy are key priorities. I would definitely recommend this place!

Thanks Chad and Ruben! :)"
58349	557126	10.0	10.0	5123513	These guys are friendly and easy-going. I barely saw them, but their place is very convenient, clean, and comfortable. 
58350	557126	10.0	10.0	5162339	Chad and Ruben are exemplary hosts.  The accommodations are top notch.  Their home is lovely.  Light and beautiful.  Room is super clean, roomy, private and had everything we needed.  Comfy bed.  Perfect location.  The neighborhood has wonderful places to eat, walk and shop.  All our Seattle sights were within walking distance or near transit. Street parking is available, but certain times or days of the week can be a challenge. Lots of construction around the house at the time we stayed, but our schedule was up and out early, return late, so not a problem.  Ruben offers friendly and helpful suggestions, maps, your wish is his desire.  If you need a place to stay in Seattle, stay with them!
58351	557126	10.0	10.0	5350955	Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts. They have a very lovely and clean home and our room was perfect -- even included a private bathroom. Located in a cool area of town so we were able to walk around and explore the neighborhood. Would absolutely recommend!

58353	557126	10.0	10.0	5514662	Chad and Ruben's place in Capitol Hill is the best!  The location couldn't be better if you are looking to experience the best social scene in Seattle.  We were just a few minutes walk from upper Pine and Pike streets with great bars and breweries (like The Elysian).  Also just a short walk down to Melrose Market where I would recommend Taylor Shellfish for the freshest seafood I've ever experienced.  Chad and Ruben were incredibly friendly and accommodating.  Their guest room was conveniently located at the front of the house and both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless.  Parking can be a bit challenging but that's Seattle for you.  I'd give my highest rating to Chad and Ruben.  Definitely check them out if you are planning a trip to Seattle.

Staying with Chad & Ruben was my first Airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been more perfect! Communication, accommodation, hospitality, convenience, and location were all top notch. It really was an amazingly comfortable experience...especially coming from a single female traveler. Chad & Ruben were really great people and hosts....but the leader of the welcoming committee was their adorable dachshund Rash! He was the best! I highly recommend staying with C&R if you are in the Seattle area...as I will not hesitate to book with them again if I am in town. Thanks guys!!"
58355	557126	10.0	10.0	5703009	Chad and Ruben were very welcoming. They let us know in advance that they would not  be home when we arrived, but had everything organized a couple days before so that we could get into the house. The house was clean, quiet and safe. I liked their personal touch of leaving mini dachshund soap in the bathroom to welcome you.  
58356	557126	10.0	10.0	5738749	Our first Air BnB experience and certainly not our last now that we stayed at Chad and Ruben's place.

58358	557126	10.0	10.0	5913407	Chad and Ruben's place was everything you could ask for from an Airbnb listing -- extremely clean, quiet, private, and comfortable. The shower head in the bathroom is amazing! Checking-in/out is very convenient; we didn't have to wake them to accomodate our late check-in/early check-out. We would definitely stay with them again on our next Seattle trip!

58360	557126	10.0	10.0	6107086	Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts and they communicate really well when making arrangements and while you are staying there. I barely saw them because they rarely use the first floor where the room is located, but the two times I ran into them they were really pleasant and informative. They room itself was super clean, cozy, and quiet. In addition, I really like the coded entry system into the home because I didn't have to wait to be let in or worry about carrying a key with me my entire trip. The location is pretty perfect too. It's right in the heart of Capitol Hill. There's plenty of cafes, bars, and restaurants within walking distance from their home. All in all a great experience!

58366	557126	10.0	10.0	6619042	Spent five nights here during a very active August trip to Seattle. Tasteful, very clean and comfortable bed and bath with a nice sense of privacy.  Loved the location -- quiet but a short walk to either the Broadway or Pike/Pine corridors for nightlife and restaurants.  Spacious and quiet. Had a bit of trouble staying connected to the WiFi, but otherwise everything was great!  
58367	557126	10.0	10.0	6710540	We had a very short stay at Chad and Ruben's place but it was exactly what we had hoped for.

Hope we can come back again one day, would recommend to anyone to stay here. Catch the 49 or 43 bus not the 60 as Metro Trans told us, it's easy to get to and from town on. Room is great and heaps of space and lovely bathroom, excellent value.

58372	557126	10.0	10.0	7234662	My girlfriend and I got stuck in Seattle and needed a place last minute. Even though they had someone check out early that day, Chad & Ruben got the room turned around for us so we could stay that night. The room was really nice. The bed was comfortable. It was quiet and the shower is amazing :) After a stressful day, this was exactly what we needed. We even went out to get a bottle and when we got back, Chad has placed two wine glasses and a bottle opener next to our bed on a silver platter. That was really cool! Thanks guys! If we're ever in Seattle again this is where we'll be staying.
58373	557126	10.0	10.0	7415708	Last time I was in Seattle. I stayed at Chad's & Ruben's place and I really enjoyed. Perfect location near Broadway with good restaurants and I also like pretty much the fancy Capitol Hill area. Also the room and bathroom was perfect for me. So five stars and thank you very much!:-))
58374	557126	10.0	10.0	7752941	Chad and Ruben were warm and welcoming. I had no trouble coming and going as needed. The bed was incredibly comfortable. Two thumbs up from me!
58375	557126	10.0	10.0	8111505	Chad and Ruben were fabulous hosts.  The room was clean and neat and everything about the stay was easy.  Honestly, the place was so quiet, we hardly knew we were sharing with Chad and Ruben.  When we did bump into them they were warm and genuine.  Their house is walking distance (less than 10 min) from two to-die-for coffee shops: Top Pot (damn fine donuts) and Vivace's Brix location (other-worldly caramel macchiato).  We were without a car and the central location was appreciated; the International district is about a 30 minute walk and Pike Place Market is about 25.  My husband had a meeting in the convention district and that was only a 15 minute walk (or $6 cab).  Would totally stay here again on a return trip!   
58376	557126	10.0	10.0	8213687	What a beautiful house! We were in Seattle for less than 30 hours and I wish we'd had more time to explore Capitol Hill because we had such a great place to stay. Our room was cozy, comfy and was much better appointed than our own house (and most hotels). I love the keyless entry as well, which makes things super convenient. Chad and Ruben were extremely responsive via text and I was disappointed to not had a chance to meet them and their little doggy. The dachshund soaps had to make do. :) Thanks, guys!
58377	557126	10.0	10.0	8533767	Chad and Ruben were great hosts. Their place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Location was ideal for easy access downtown.  Would definitely stay there again if we're in Seattle. Excellent choice!
58378	557126	10.0	10.0	8631358	Chad and Ruben's place was great!  They were really helpful and immediately responded to all of our emails.  We were only there overnight and didn't get to meet, but their messages were friendly and their place was really comfortable.  Its in a great location (right off of Broadway), but its still really quiet.  It ended up we were coming down with colds when we got there and the bed was so comfy and the room was so quiet that we were able to fall asleep by 8:45!  Also, they have a great shower/tub and in general we couldn't have asked for anything more!  
58379	557126	10.0	10.0	8753906	We had a great stay in Seattle, and the room was very comfortable with a large private bathroom. Convenient location, easy to find, and communicative hosts. Thank you again!
58380	557126	10.0	10.0	9140558	Quiet, cozy room in a great location.  Very communicative and gracious hosts.
58381	557126	10.0	10.0	9725467	My boyfriend and I were in Seattle for a weekend in Jan and stayed with Chad & Ruben. We got in pretty late on a Friday, but their house was very easily accessible because of the key pad. The room was very comfortable and we had the bathroom to ourselves. You really can't beat the location - we walked everywhere and really enjoyed the coffee, restaurants, and nightlife of Capitol Hill. 
58382	557126	10.0	10.0	9790544	"It is a creepy experience to be watched by someone you have never met, through hidden cameras and surveillance videos.  During my stay with Chad and Ruben, I was never able to meet them face to face, but I know for certain that they were watching my every move while I stay in the room in their house.

Some feel Edward Snowden is a hero and other feel he is a traitor.  If you feel Snowden is a traitor, then you will feel right at home with Chad and Ruben.

But if you feel that Edward Snowden is a hero, and you like your privacy (even if you are not doing anything wrong), do not stay with Chad and Ruben.

Although I would hope they did not have cameras pointed at the bed or in the bathroom, I would not be surprised if they did."
58383	557126	10.0	10.0	9847100	We had a wonderful night at Chad and Ruben's place. Very clean, exactly as described and in an ideal location. Chad and Ruben were very friendly and communication was very easy. Thank you so much, we hope to visit again soon!
58384	557126	10.0	10.0	9999718	Excellent location and cute room. Getting in and out of the flat is a breeze with the keypad system. Was a perfect place for a short business trip. Very friendly hosts and an adorable dog!
58385	557126	10.0	10.0	10198414	"Chad and Rubin are great hosts. I haven't met them until the third day. Everything was set up for me when I arrived and it was perfect. The room looked exactly the same in the picture. I just met Chad for a few minutes but I knew he is a really nice guy. Great location and I could walk to downtown and space needle within 20 minutes. I will definitely recommend the house to people who travel to SEATTLE. 
"
58386	557126	10.0	10.0	10426017	Chad and Ruben were wonderful hosts. Their home is warm and lovely and in an ideal location. We were within a half mile of dozens of amazing restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bookstores, and local boutiques and markets. We would highly recommend staying with Chad and Ruben, the accommodations were excellent. Thanks for a great weekend, Chad and Ruben!
58387	557126	10.0	10.0	10532324	Chad and Reuben were great! The room was comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. I loved the neighborhood and the convenience to downtown.  
58388	557126	10.0	10.0	10755768	This was my first experience with Airbnb and I can't think of any way it could have been better - well, except for the weather.  The room is great and both Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts.  We did not see much of each other (I was out and about), but they managed to communicate welcomeness, and I knew that if I had truly needed anything they were there.  They had thought already of everything that might make a traveler/visitor comfortable.  If I get back to Seattle, I will book this one again.
58389	557126	10.0	10.0	10867105	"I decided to make a last minute trip up to Seattle from Portland to visit some friends and contacted Ruben and chad. They accepted my reservation openly and were very happy to have me. The room was beautiful and just as depicted in the pictures. Huge bathroom! Parking was difficult being in the Capitol Hill neighborhood but I was able to find a spot a couple blocks away. 

Because I was gone virtually the entire time except to sleep, I didn't get to meet Ruben or chad but I had a very nice time staying at their place!"
58390	557126	10.0	10.0	10972506	Chad and Ruben's room is clean, simple, and tastefully decorated. The location is quiet, but very close to the heart of Capitol Hill restaurants and shops. Chad was very responsive to our room request and very accommodating.  
58391	557126	10.0	10.0	11035179	Although I have known about Airbnb for a while, it wasn't until this stay that my partner and I actually used the service. Chad and Ruben's home was the perfect choice for our first Airbnb experience and we couldn't be happier. From now on, every one of my trips will include an Airbnb reservation. If you are coming to Seattle, we highly recommend staying with Chad and Ruben. The location is perfect. So much so that one of their windows frames the Space Needle as if a picture of it was hanging on the wall. The home is beautiful, comfortable, intimate and private. There are lots of restaurants, bars, fun spots and stores at walking distance. And of course, the hosts were excellent! I'm sure I will reserve with Chad and Ruben in our future trips to Seattle. We loved it! 
58392	557126	10.0	10.0	11213911	We cannot recommend Chad & Ruben highly enough.  They were terrific, sweet hosts and the room was comfy.  Super sweet bathroom too.  The location is perfect, close to where you really want to be.  Thanks, dudes!
58393	557126	10.0	10.0	11418042	Ruben is a great host! Made me feel right at home and worked very hard to accommodate my special needs. Very clean room and convenient to downtown. Made the trip very easy. I am an older person, they were great with me!  Would do so again. Loved staying here! 
58394	557126	10.0	10.0	11458367	Chad and Ruben were wonderful hosts and the apartment was charming. The location was great. It had very easy access to capitol hill which has a lot of wonderful restaurants and stores. Chad and Ruben both gave me excellent suggestions on my apartment searching in Seattle. Thanks guys! I would recommend staying at Chad and Ruben's home to anyone. 
58395	557126	10.0	10.0	11549063	Great hosts, beautiful home. They didn't mention the super comfortable bed, awesome shower, and a view of the Space Needle from the living room! Chad was very cool (we didn't meet Ruben, but I'm sure he's cool, too). They gave us the perfect safe-haven for our honeymoon. Much appreciated. 
58396	557126	10.0	10.0	11803379	Great place and great hosts.
58397	557126	10.0	10.0	11963208	Lovely place right in the centre of Capitol Hill, perfect for the bars and restaurants. Also on several bus routes from downtown, great for everywhere. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay, the place was perfect.
58398	557126	10.0	10.0	12288156	This was my best Airbnb experience yet! Chad and Ruben are super considerate hosts with a charming, clean, and conveniently-located house. They even helped us out with restaurant recommendations and directions around the city! I highly recommend this one. 
58399	557126	10.0	10.0	12546808	I had such an enjoyable stay! Great location for coffee and brews. The room was charming, very clean, and the private bathroom was much appreciated. I had the chance to meet Chad and Ruben on my last night in Seattle, and both were very friendly and welcoming. If I am ever in town again, I will definitely be staying with them!
58400	557126	10.0	10.0	12806741	My stay was Brits, 2 nights only and limited, I was out at a seminar for 2 days returning with only enough time to wind down and go to sleep.  My needs on this trip were simple, to have quiet comfortable private space with no interruptions:  this is exactly what I got. I would rate this b'nb very highly, right in the heart of the city, making inner city transit very easy...I will never stay in another hotel chain again!  Chad and Rubin know what they are doing!!
58401	557126	10.0	10.0	12881936	We had a great stay with Chad and Ruben in Seattle - we stayed two nights but wish we had longer! The place is centrally located and tidy and their dog is gorgeous. We also got lots of tips on local restaurants and sights for our next few cities. We loved our stay and would definitely stay with Chad and Ruben again. 
58402	557126	10.0	10.0	12988561	"Chad and Ruben were great hosts! The bedroom and bathroom were both  beautiful and clean. 
My flight was canceled so I missed an entire evening with them. I was super bummed! But they were so sweet. To make up for the lost day they gave me a gift certificate to a great restaurant (poppy. Check it out!) 
What nice guys! 
I would definitely recommend staying with them "
58403	557126	10.0	10.0	13150749	The location and room we were provided was PERFECT. We flew and took the light rail from the airport to find our room ready and in impeccable condition. Chad and Ruben's home is nestled in Capitol Hill on a quiet street. Less then a 5 minute walk from the night life Cap Hill is known for. We walked everywhere. It took us about 15 minutes to walk to the space needle and from there maybe 10 more minutes to walk to pike place market. Coming and going couldn't have been more convenient. They are very friendly and their dog is the sweetest! I only wish we could have stayed longer! 
58404	557126	10.0	10.0	13293170	Very comfortable stay with very nice hosts! Could not have been more pleasant.
58405	557126	10.0	10.0	13515060	"An amazing getaway vacation!  The room had ample space for my boyfriend and I, and the house was extremely clean!  Very straightforward instructions on how to get into the house.

For any travelers who plan to bring a car, be prepared to spend anywhere from five to twenty minutes looking for street parking!  There is a lot of construction going on around the Capitol Hill district, and many streets have sections blocked off.

Other than that, great stay, comfortable bed, nice fresh sheets, well working shower!  I had the chance to meet Chad and Ruben and they were extremely welcoming and kind!  I would love to stay here again!"
58406	557126	10.0	10.0	13886018	Chad and Ruben's place is really cute.  I had my own really quiet room with a nice closet, comfortable bed and all of the sitting, electricity and privacy accommodations I could have needed.  I never met either of them because I was there for a busy convention and gone all day but it was so easy to get in and out of the house and I had use of the kitchen if I need it (I didn't!).  The bathroom is spacious and lovely.  The location is convenient and I was able to get what I needed at all of the local establishments right in the area.  DEFINITELY would stay again! (tip: if you need total darkness for good sleep bring an eye mask)
58407	557126	10.0	10.0	13978928	This was my first AirBnB experience and it was great! I would highly recommend Chad & Ruben's Charming Capitol Hill Room. It was a clean, welcoming room with a bathroom, which was super convenient. The location was prime as well. It was a 15 minute walk to downtown and it had tons of restaurants/bars around. Awesome stay!
58408	557126	10.0	10.0	14165116	Chad and Ruben were great hosts. Our room was as described with a direct connection to a large bathroom that had everything we needed. Very happy with our stay thank you!
58409	557126	10.0	10.0	14557476	This was the first time my boyfriend and I used Airbnb. We were incredibly happy with the experience. Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts. The room and bathroom space was more than enough, and everything was exceptionally clean. Their place is located near all the sites, making it easy to explore the city. Plus, they were great at communicating before and during our stay. We highly recommend their place.  
58410	557126	10.0	10.0	15089816	We had a wonderful time at Chad & Ruben's place. The room was as described and the location even better. Very central, close to many nice shops and restaurants, you could walk everywhere or take a quick bus at a nearby stop. I would book it again without hesitation. Thanks guys!
58411	557126	10.0	10.0	15490111	Worked great with door code. Everything was clean and easy. Bed comfy and location was close to restaurants and public transportation. Very nice hosts!
58412	557126	10.0	10.0	15675730	Just returned from a great stay with Chad & Ruben. The room was stellar. Our hosts were very thoughtful and took care to ensure our comfort during the recent heat wave. We were delighted with the neighbourhood and were able find an overnight parking garage right around the corner (a little pricey but convenient). Highly recommended. 
58413	557126	10.0	10.0	15952378	"If you are looking for a great room to stay in Seattle, then look no further. Chad and Ruben were fantastic hosts with a wonderful room available. The room was clean, the bathroom was spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. They welcomed me to their home and were available if I needed anything, but generally left me to my own devices. A door code allowed me to not need to worry with a key so I could come and go as I please. 
I would absolutely stay here again and fully recommend the room for anyone looking for a great place near downtown Seattle. "
58414	557126	10.0	10.0	16132868	This location is perfect to everything and everywhere I have planned for my Seattle trip as I used to lived on Capitol Hill and their house is close to public transportation and close to coffee shops I wanna go. The hosts are very quiet and they were nice and very accommodating when I asked for leaving my luggage early in the morning. They were super patient with my messages and tried to work out the room for me as soon as possible. The room and bathroom itself is very clean as well! It's a nice and safe neighborhood as well. I definitely recommend this host and this bnb. 
58415	557126	10.0	10.0	16344186	We had a lovely stay at Chad & Ruben's room. Their house is in a perfect location, quiet and comfortable.

58416	557126	10.0	10.0	16549450	Chad and Ruben's room was perfect for what we needed in Seattle's cool Capitol Hill neighborhood.

The bathroom was spacious and private. Plus a very cute dog!
58417	557126	10.0	10.0	16782226	This room was wonderful! Comfortable and clean. The location is  unbelievable - close to great restaurants, bars, and shopping. Sadly I didn't get to meet Chad or Ruben, but will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!
58418	557126	10.0	10.0	17097560	Great place to stay - covenient & comfortable.  Only complaint was street parking is difficult to find in the area.  Better off not having a car and using cabs to get around.
58419	557126	10.0	10.0	17372319	This was the perfect room for a weekend in Seattle! Great, quiet location, just steps away from coffee shops/restaurants/bars. Chad and Ruben (+ cutest wiener dog) were super hospitable hosts: clean and comfy, our bedroom was prepared nicely, and the best part is that they have an electronic lock system. No keys, no fuss. Just a special code you need to know. Would definitely recommend to any solo/couple travellers. Oh, and did I mention the big bathroom? 
58420	557126	10.0	10.0	17517382	Chad & Ruben's place was great. Very conveniently located with some great restaurants around. The room was very neat, with a comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. Our schedule's were such that we only crossed paths with them once, but they were helpful and responsive over email, and very accommodating of our arrival / departure schedule. In all, a great place to stay. 
58421	557126	10.0	10.0	17621806	What a beautiful home in a perfect location! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and will come back on our next trip to Seattle!

58424	557126	10.0	10.0	18309614	"Chad and Ruben's beautiful home was a delight to stay at. They made it super convenient and I felt extremely welcomed into their home. The room itself was wonderful and exactly as described. I especially appreciated that it felt very much separate with its own bathroom so I never felt like I was intruding during my stay.

The location was also perfect, right in the best part of Capitol Hill within easy walking distance to anything you might want. From the cafe with excellent coffee around the corner to the diner-esque breakfast place just a few blocks away.

Both of the hosts were welcoming, friendly, and very attentive throughout my stay. I can't recommend staying here enough. Thanks so much Chad and Ruben!"
58425	557126	10.0	10.0	18478403	"Highest recommendations for this lovely room, it exceeded all expectations. The room was welcoming, beautifully furnished, and extremely clean. It also has an enormous private bathroom attached. The bed was giant and also extremely comfortable, and the room was full of thoughtful touches like an AC fan, guides to Seattle, extra blanket and pillows, and reading lamps. Honestly, it felt like staying in a nice hotel. I did not have much contact with Chad & Ruben as I was out of the house most of the time, but they were swift, helpful and friendly over email.
The neighborhood was walking distance to cute shopping, food and cafes, and I actually easily walked to downtown as well (about 1.5 miles)."

58428	557126	10.0	10.0	19321428	We enjoyed our stay at Chad and Ruben's. The room was nice and clean as depicted. Chad and Ruben where not home during our stay, but where nice enough to allow us to stay there regardless. The Capital Hill area is pretty cool and very walkable.  We enjoyed Poppy, Native, and Sun Liquor. The only challenge for us was finding street parking.  It's possible, but one day it took 30 minutes.
58429	557126	10.0	10.0	19521053	Everything about our stay was great. The room was exactly as pictured/described. We had no trouble getting in, everything was super clean and the bathroom was HUGE!

58430	557126	10.0	10.0	19671658	we couldnt see much each other but i bet they are more kind and wonderful than i experience them. the house was nice and clean also was the bathroom. they prepared some supplies that we may need such as shampoo, soap, towels, and etc. (we prepared our own tho) And, other thing we love about is the transportation. All the bus stops are near around the house, easy to get to downtown.
58431	557126	10.0	10.0	20082124	It was a brilliant experience. Chad and Ruben are so kind and at the same time they have given space and freedom to us. We have felt confortable all the time.

We met Ruben just 5 minutes but he was a very kind person and carefull. They also have a lovely pet named Rash . Even if we didn't have many contact with our hosts ( they were working and we were on vacation ), it was very easy to get in touch with them by e-mail. 
We recommand Chad and Ruben at 100 %.

They gave detailed instructions regarding access to their home well in advance, and were very respectful of our space. Whenever we did cross paths, they were both very friendly and hospitable (and their dog was a complete sweetie). Their home is in a fantastic neighborhood, and we were able to wander all over Capitol Hill and downtown on foot without any problems. This was our first AirBnB experience, and we can only hope that all of our future stays are as positive as this one. We loved it, and definitely recommend them as hosts to other prospective guests.

The house is very sweet and warm, just like the picture, more than clean and comfortable; the location of their house is very centre-located, 15 mins to downtown by walking and also have convenient public transportation nearby.

58436	557126	10.0	10.0	21130963	We had a lovely time with Chad and Ruben. They were so welcoming to us, giving us lots of great suggestions of restaurants and bars around their home. We also really appreciated how they let us keep our bags in their living room after we checked out so that we could explore the full day without lugging suitcases around. Their home is beautiful, and our room and bathroom were warm and comfortable. Their home was a great place to come back to at night after traveling all around. We would definitely stay there again! 
58437	557126	10.0	10.0	21665963	Such a great stay! Chad and Ruben were so kind, helpful, and accommodating. Ruben generously chatted with us about Seattle even though he was sick during our stay. The room's location is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, so it's walkable or quickly uber-able to just about everywhere we wanted to go. Also, that shower is luxurious. Definitely recommend staying with these guys if you find yourself in Seattle.

Great haven in the noise and bustle of Capital Hill and downtown.

58445	557126	10.0	10.0	23079143	"I had a really comfortable time at Chad & Ruben's. Everything was super clean, neat, and spacious. The location couldn't have been better (try Glo's for breakfast and In the Bowl for every other meal).

I never actually met my hosts as our schedules didn't line up, but check-in was incredibly convenient and Chad & Ruben were very communicative. All told, a great stay. "
58446	557126	10.0	10.0	23658863	"Chad and Reuben were very welcoming in their lovely home.

Facilities were excellent and the code key access meant I could come and go as I pleased.

I'd certainly recommend this to anyone visiting the city"
58447	557126	10.0	10.0	24146308	"Great location and awesome hosts. Really nice neighborhood. The room was really nice and felt like our own private suite. Didn't spend lots of time in the listing but it was really nice to feel at home after a busy day on the city. 

Only met Chad who was really nice and let us know if we needed anything they were there. Really helpful in recommendations of things to do before we even got there. Highly recommend this place if you are in Seattle."
58448	557126	10.0	10.0	24938651	Chad & Ruben have a lovely home in the hip neighbourhood Capitol Hill. The room is fantastic - lovely spacious bathroom, closet space, cozy atmosphere & great bed - although a bit darker than the picture suggests. They are warm hosts and we'll definitely be back. 
58449	557126	10.0	10.0	25267693	What a cozy home! The bedroom is big and has it's own, also large, private full bathroom. Very clean, lovingly clean actually. So important. And I can't say enough about how comfortable the mattress is. Good night's sleep every night. Plus the neighborhood is very quiet even though it's a hip, lively neighborhood. I easily walked to and explored downtown one day, but on another day just stayed and explored the Capitol Hill area. Plenty to do but the best is eating. Ask the hosts for recommendations. You will not be disappointed.
58450	557126	10.0	10.0	25550447	"Chad and Ruben get all the little details right, right down to setting the entry code to the last four digits of my phone number so that I could remember it easily. The room felt plenty spacious for two people and our luggage. The bathroom was roomy enough to do some post-flight yoga in, and everything was clean, well-lit, and comfortable. We only met them on our last morning there, shortly before leaving, but felt completely welcomed even in their absence. As for the neighborhood: it's delightful. Right off of the main road through Capitol Hill"" A few blocks in another direction from Top Pot donuts (worth a visit), and in another direction from a fabulous coffeeshop that seems to be a favorite weekday morning stop for many people in the neighborhood. "
58451	557126	10.0	10.0	26268290	"Chad and Ruben were amazing! Super friendly and helpful. They were flexible with our check in time and the place was very clean. We had everything we needed there. The location was perfect as well, everything was in walking distance. Even when we took uber to downtown it was only $5 - $7.
Great experience. Definitely would wanna stay with them again if we make a trip there. "
58452	557126	10.0	10.0	26451159	The listing and pictures portray perfectly what you can expect, which is an amazing value for a private room.  Chad and Reuben were extremely friendly and willing to offer suggestions about the area - food, transportation, things to do, etc.

The space was clean, private, and comfortable and couldn't be more perfectly located to explore/experience the city. Chad and Ruben provided great recommendations and were extremely welcoming. When we visit again, we will definitely see if their place is available. Thanks guys!"
58455	557126	10.0	10.0	27594704	This experience was the absolute BEST. The house was easy to find, the room was so easy to navigate and the overall feel was just so relaxing. The door code system made coming and going a breeze. I ran into Chad and Ruben twice, and they were just great! The location was super convenient to everything I wanted to do in Capital Hill. I look forward to staying here again in the future. 
58456	557126	10.0	10.0	27935288	There was a nice little 'hello' note on my bedside table.  Everything was clean and the furnishings and bathroom were well-appointed.  There was an extra blanket at the  food of the bed for this thin-blooded Californian for coziness during a rainy, cold Seattle night.  Very quiet and a nice counter-point to the busyness of my visit.  I had several questions about the proximity to my workshop and restaurant recommendations. They were generous and forthcoming.
58457	557126	10.0	10.0	28368269	The best location - easy to access to route 5 and walking distance to everywhere including all the coffee shops, local restaurants (Crumble and Flake is the best), super nice bed (high end mattress), very clean house with high ceiling, big and nice bathroom with a nice shower head, and the most, your own privacy (you will feel like you rent the whole house).  Chad and Ruben are very friendly and professional.  Highly recommended.
58458	557126	10.0	10.0	28558953	My friend and I had a very nice stay at Chad and Ruben's. We only met them for a few minutes, but the room was lovely and clean, just as pictured and with very nice touches. Thank you for a lovely stay!
58459	557126	10.0	10.0	28722027	Great host and cozy room. The location is perfect and the price is reasonable! 
58460	557126	10.0	10.0	28913332	"First of all, let me tell you how amazing this location was for my trip. It's literally within easy walking distance to nearly every Capitol Hill destination that you could imagine. Top notch.

But with the amazing location comes difficult parking—something that was explicitly said in the listing. One night I drove around for 45 minutes looking for a spot. You probably shouldn't bring a car anyway, but I had one, and it was tough.

Chad and Ruben are excellent hosts. I only met Chad, but he was kind, helpful, and welcoming. He knew the right balance of talking but also allowing me to rest.

The room itself is exactly as described, tastefully colorful but dark for sleeping, and quiet. I had a great time and felt extremely comfortable."
58461	557126	10.0	10.0	29841847	"The room is nice and comfortable and so is the private bath. It is a 15 min walk to downtown Seattle (or 2 min to the bus stop). Chad and Ruben were very good hosts and I will definitively stay again should I return to Seattle.
"
58462	557126	10.0	10.0	30444422	Great place, awesome location in Capital Hill. Close to everything and it worked out really well for my conference within walking distance at the Convention Center. Chad and Ruben are very nice hosts.
58463	557126	10.0	10.0	30780320	This was a fantastic introduction to Seattle. Chad & Ruben's house is very lovely and is certainly in a fantastic location. They were very welcoming and we would certainly recommend staying there to anyone. Thanks guys. 
58464	557126	10.0	10.0	31033767	I did not meet hosts. They have a lovely quiet home. Great location. Clean and tasteful decorated place and lovely bathroom with tub. Plan to stay again.
58465	557126	10.0	10.0	31782294	The home was amazing, and the room was better than we could have imagined. It was very well decorated with lots of helpful brochures and pamphlets for things to do around the city. Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Chad or Ruben during our stay, but after this experience, we look forward to staying with them again in the future! 
58466	557126	10.0	10.0	32973606	We had an awesome time with chad and Ruben. Great house in a great location and they were super friendly. A++
58467	557126	10.0	10.0	33452093	All was just as described in the listing. Chad and Ruben were very good about providing the necessary information for the stay. This was our first Airbnb stay, and in our view a total success! The neighborhood was quite 'European' in character (we spend a lot of time in Germany), close to downtown, and well-stocked with coffee/bakery/meal options. 
58468	557126	10.0	10.0	34052955	The room was very comfortable and location was convenient to walk or bus to many sites.  We stayed here while attending a conference and unfortunately our schedule didn't line up to meet the hosts, but it was very accessible and felt welcome.  We loved having the suggestions for local businesses/restaurants on the bookshelf.  Definitely recommend!
58469	557126	10.0	10.0	34625174	The stay with Chad and Ruben was outstanding. They provide a great quiet room with an adjacent bathroom. The room feels completely separated from the main living areas in the house which gives it a fantastically quiet  and private experience. Everything was clean and tidy. Ruben and Chad were so very welcoming and sweet. They made our stay feel very warm as if we were staying with very close friends. At one point I pointed out something in the house I really liked (a food sign) and by the end of the day Ruben got me one from the market. So very sweet! The house is at the best location in town - a quiet part of Capitol Hill. We walked everywhere and felt so close to home. Bottom line - great experience and I highly recommend this fantastically charming room in Capitol Hill.  
58470	557126	10.0	10.0	35065503	We met Chad who was very friendly and welcoming. Our flight was delayed but that was no problem because we had our own security code to enter the house. The room and neighbourhood were exactly as described. Even though we were in an area with lots of foot traffic, the bedroom and the house were quiet and we slept well.  The house is close to cafes, pubs and shops and we could walk to downtown. Buses were easy to access. We definitely would stay again. 
58471	557126	10.0	10.0	36267254	Chad and Ruben's private room in Capitol Hill was perfect for a weekend getaway. It was clean, comfortable, and impeccably decorated. The location was perfect for a nightcap, some bar crawling, or a nice walk to many of Seattle's attractions. All in all a wonderful place to stay.
58472	557126	10.0	10.0	36952854	The listing was very accurate.  Chad and Ruben made everything straight forward and comfortable.  The neighborhood was very walkable.  
58473	557126	10.0	10.0	37478634	"Jackie and I had a wonderful stay at Chad and Ruben's lovely apartment. Though our interactions were brief, I could tell that both Chad and Ruben have put considerable thought and care into their apartment and making sure that their guests feel welcome and accommodated.

The neighborhood is great -- with restaurants, parks, bars, and a large grocery store all within easy walking distance. It's also a quick 30 minute walk or $7 uber ride to downtown/belltown.

Thanks, again, Chad and Ruben for your hospitality! All the best to you both."
58474	557126	10.0	10.0	38429728	We spent two days at Chad and Ruben's place on Capitol Hill. The area is very lively with lost of place to eat, supermarket around the corner and a 20min walk downhill downtown. Chad and Ruben made us feel very welcome and right at home. The room is quiet and comfortable, clean and nicely decorated (as is their house). Warmly recommended!
58475	557126	10.0	10.0	38834154	"Our stay in the house was great, and although we only saw Chad and Ruben on our last day, they were incredibly helpful and responsive. Also, the keyless entry was a major plus - really simplified things and allowed for flexibility!

The location is perfect, steps away from tons of restaurants and the energy of Capitol Hill. From the house, we also easily walked to downtown, Pike Place, Union Lake, and many other locations. The room itself was lovely with everything that we needed. Weather was hot (90 degrees!) but the room came with a fan that helped cool it down. I would recommend this to anyone hoping to stay near Capitol Hill!"
58476	557126	10.0	10.0	39336413	"Quiet, cosy, and comfortable this was the perfect place to stay on Capitol Hill.

Everything was great, the location, the room, the bed and the private bathroom.  I hope I can stay here next time I come to Seattle.

Also the way they handle entry is perfect. No key to receive, return or lose.

My schedule was pretty busy so I didn't get to see Chad and Ruben much, but when I did they were great. I hope to get to spend more time with them next time. "
58477	557126	10.0	10.0	40319199	"Due to our schedules, and as much as I was hoping to, I was never able to connect personally with my hosts.  The house and room was lovely and easy to get to.  As I was on a budget, I took the train from the airport and then walked from downtown.  

It was also an easy 20 minute walk to the Space Needle and downtown from the house.  The room was large, very comfortable and in very good condition.  The bathroom is also quite large and roomy and the shower head was so good, I loved taking a shower.  If I had any complaint, I would have like some brighter light in the bedroom.  The overhead light was dim.  Overall, no real complaints.  I highly recommend it!"
58478	557126	10.0	10.0	42331394	What may have otherwise been a decent experience was marred by the horrendous parking situation.  There is NO street parking within blocks at any time of the day or night.  I wish the hosts had noted this prominently on their website, or provided some potential solutions (my flight was late -- I got in around 3:00 am, dealt with parking until 5:00 am, had to wake up again before 8:00 am to re-park my car.  The room itself is decent -- the pictures show it to look brighter and bigger, and more sophisticated than it is.  Overused bedding and towels, and the carpet covering the wood flooring seems a bit grimy. However, the bed and pillow are comfortable, and the bathroom is nice and roomy.  Room colors are great ... Did not see (but did hear) the hosts although they responded promptly to my couple of messages about the area via email.  
58479	557126	10.0	10.0	43034432	Chad and Ruben were welcoming hosts. They were friendly and helpful. The place and neighborhood met most expectations. The room and bathroom were clean, which was huge for us. The bed was comfortable. The room was darker and smaller than what the picture shows. A good experience overall.
58480	557126	10.0	10.0	44755937	Chad and Ruben offer an excellent clean, private, and quiet room in a great neighborhood which offers something for everyone, and just a short walk from downtown. Unfortunately we did not meet Chad and Ruben directly, but that speaks to the respect and privacy they provide with the separate room and bathroom, as well as the tailor made house access provided via your own key code. 
58481	557126	10.0	10.0	45484545	"What a great first-time Airbnb experience! A lovely home and comfortable surroundings. Chad and Ruben anticipated every need; even had bottled water out for us, with a ""hello"" note. The neighborhood was wonderful for walking, dining, people-watching, house-looking, and some shopping. My first trip to Seattle and I felt like I experienced it the way I was hoping to. Easy bus riding from their home, as well. They even have reading lights by the bed, which we did not find in our subsequent lodging!"
58482	557126	10.0	10.0	46127086	We had a good visit and stay. Everything was as advertised. Chad and Ruben were available for any questions. Clean neat. Recommended for a Capitol Hill stay in Seattle. 
58483	557126	10.0	10.0	46736564	The space is excellent, it is very clean and private. The bathroom is especially huge and clean for two people. The neighborhood is also quite nice and is in a great location. Chad and Ruben are super nice and helpful but respect our private time.  Everything is accurate as described. Would strongly recommend to stay in Seattle!
58484	557126	10.0	10.0	47139080	Chad and Ruben provided everything that is good about the AirBNB experience. They have a lovely stylish home and the guest room is of the highest standards, the check in procedures the best we have encountered so far, and Chad and Ruben were able to answer any questions that we had. The neighborhood is good and not too far from Downtown Seattle for either walking or buses. We would certainly use this residence again for future stays
58485	557126	10.0	10.0	48533621	"We really enjoyed this spot in Cap Hill. Just a 1/2 block off the main drag with many a spot an easy walk. Also an easy walk to downtown and even the Space Needle if your feeling frisky. The Starbucks Reserve store is maybe 10 min away. A must see on my list!!! Unreal dedication to Coffee.

This was my very 1st Air BnB experience.

The key less entry is brilliant. The room and bed are super comfy and the bath ROOM! is huge. Nice to have that a few steps away. A full bath tub for soaking. Shelves for your ""stuff"" and a small down comforter for chilly nites. 

Used the kitchen very little, mostly to microwave my coffee.

Needed to add a 3rd night and they accomadated that with little hassle.

Only met the pooch once, he's adorable. Didn't really see our hosts much either. 

The best thing was their recommendation for Taylor Shellfish Farms. OMG!! Do Not miss it. 1/2 block from the Starbucks Reserve. 2 other locations but I think this is the orig.

I could rattle off numerous more fun spots we found.

Thank you both."
58486	557126	10.0	10.0	50444185	The house and are room very nice. Excellent shower, great bed, and nice decor. I would highly recommend. 
58487	557126	10.0	10.0	51080053	Chad & Ruben were wonderful hosts. Their room was nice and had everything you would need for a few nights including a lot of leaflets, maps and some guidebooks about Seattle. The new queen bed offered the best sleep I had on my whole trip. The neighborhood was also nice, quite calm in their street but with more life (bars and restaurants) only some steps away. I would absolutely recommend to stay with them and also would so again.
58488	557126	10.0	10.0	51975530	The room was really cute and cozy and so was the whole house. We really liked having our own bathroom connected to the room and felt like we had our own private corner in the house. The whole process was really easy and smooth. Chad and Reuben were super accommodating with the times we arrived and left. They even left us an extra little heater for the more chilly nights. The location is great and walking distance to all the great places in Capitol Hill. We met Chad and Reuben on our way out and enjoyed the small interaction that we got to have with them. 
58489	557126	10.0	10.0	53493681	"Chad and Ruben were fantastic! Didn't get to meet them unfortunately, however, the home and the room is fantastic! No issues with anything and the water pressure is awesome! 

Tons of Car2Gos around as well :)"

58491	557126	10.0	10.0	56987790	We really enjoyed our stay at Chad&Ruben's place. It was very cozy and we loved the color of the room. Great location. There's a great place for breakfast just across from the street on Olive Way. We hope to stay there again during our next visit. 
60640	387078	10.0	10.0	3141962	The property was fantastic - just as described.  Nick was very helpful upon our arrival and referred some great spots nearby for food and drinks.  Would definitely stay again.

60643	387078	10.0	10.0	4839876	Great apartment in a great neighborhood. The host was very accommodating and quick to respond. Just 2 blocks from Analog Coffee.

60645	387078	10.0	10.0	7032658	We had a great time at this location and Autumn was a very helpful host. There was a lot of room for all four of us to move around and not get in each other's way. The bed was comfortable and easy to sleep in and the various chairs in the living room allowed us to sit where ever we wanted whenever we wanted to. Highly recommended.
60646	387078	10.0	10.0	8996606	"We had a great experience! This was our first visit to Seattle, and we were particularly worried about finding a place that was kid-friendly yet still in a fun neighborhood, central to a lot of things. This was perfect. 

First, it's a very nice, clean, well-managed place. The place is just furnished and stocked very nicely. Think high end hotel. Not only are there the usual plates, glasses, pans, pots, etc., there are also kids cups, plates, and utensils, which is a very nice touch. 

Second, the location is phenomenal. You really can't ask for better as a tourist. Capitol Hill itself is a great neighborhood. Lots of walkable restaurants. With kids, it was great to have Volunteer Park at walking distance. We made lots of use of that. Pike Place Market was a bit of a further walk, but we did actually walk there. And Autumn, the property manager, is great--very responsive and down to earth. We had one minor issue that was taken care of very promptly so if anything it makes me more likely to stay here. "
60647	387078	10.0	10.0	9402399	"Autumn was pleasant, cooperative and extremely knowledgeable, which was a great benefit to us as we were new comers to Seattle.
All I can say is this is the place we will stay on our next visit."
60648	387078	10.0	10.0	9806157	We had a great stay..! Convenient location. Nice Clean cozy apartment..! Analog coffee was close, Glo's cafe for breakfast.. Mmmm..  There was no Nintendo Wii as described but the place more than provided everything you could need for a pleasant stay in Capitol Hill... I'd recommend it ;)
60649	387078	10.0	10.0	10504337	Great location. Nice decoration and easy experience!
60650	387078	10.0	10.0	10570495	A clean, spacious, and comfortable apartment in a great location. You wont find a better host. Autumn was flexible with our travel hours, quick to communicate, and made great recommendations. I would absolutely stay there again!!
60651	387078	10.0	10.0	11041387	Beautiful apartment in a good location. Downtown is not on the doorstep but in easy walking distance. There are many good places to eat & drink close by. We had a great weekend here! 
60652	387078	10.0	10.0	11508975	We had a great stay in Seattle. It was a good location from where we could walk almost anywhere. Autumn was a great host, she recommended us places and restaurants, (Glo's was the perfect breakfastjoint!) which was a good place to start at. The bed was really comfy (!). We didn't use everything in the apartment (ate out etc) but I figure you had almost everything you have at home if you wan't to spend less money eating out everyday (the QFC 5 minutes away was also a perfect located). All over a good experience.

60654	387078	10.0	10.0	13471021	Great place! Clean and tidy, spacious, lots of storage space, fully equiped kitchen, comfy beds – all we could ask for. The location in Capitol Hill is perfect, quiet and friendly, but still close to downtown.

60656	387078	10.0	10.0	15697085	"Thanks Amber and Lori for an amazing stay. The location and apartment was perfect for our 4 day mini-vacay. The apartment was very clean and very accessible to the rest of Seattle. We can't wait to come back again :) 
"
60657	387078	10.0	10.0	15974500	"This was my first AirBnB experience and it was better than expected. Highlights are below, but overall I would absolutely recommend this listing (especially if you are new to AirBnb). I gave it a 5 because I was completely satisfied after being a little hesitant to do an AirBnb, but as this was my first stay, I don't have much to compare it to.

Positives:
-Seamless/easy check in
-Clean (specifically the sheets smelled great and it was apparent that they were freshly laundered. Oddly enough, the bed was my biggest concern with an AirBnB as I was afraid it wouldn't have the same treatment as hotel sanitation. exceeded expectations)
-Very comfortable bed
-A welcome tray was laid out for our arrival and included a book with recommendations of things to do, wine bottle opener, complimentary snacks, wine glasses, and list of wifi access and other rental needs.
-Great location (we walked everywhere)

Negatives (BUT NOT DEAL BREAKERS!! just as FYI's):
-Air conditioner is a window unit and only in the living room. bedroom has a fan and was perfectly fine for me. My boyfriend, however, was a bit warm. We also had two abnormally hot Seattle days.
-We were unable to use the bathroom faucet as it was broken. To Autumn's defense, we did not ask for it to be fixed during our stay, but instead just used the kitchen sink for bathroom faucet needs.
-Sunlight in apartment was not as bright as the pictures portray, (wondering if it's because the construction is blocking a lot of it). 
-The green apples on the kitchen table are FAKE! Both my boyfriend and I were duped on separate occasions. They even have bruises on them like real apples! I'm not even mad, I'm impressed."
60658	387078	10.0	10.0	17141400	"The apartment was equipped with everything we needed and was very clean upon arrival. The newly designed interior was very nice as well. One note: the big windows on the front of the apartments face west, which causes the place to heat up quiet a bit in the afternoon. Fortunately the air conditioning fights hard against this, so you'll be happy you have it.

There was construction on the building next door that started each morning at 7:30. It would have been nice to be notified of this beforehand, even though there was nothing the property manager could do. Nevertheless, early mornings weren't too big of an issue since Top Pot was just a 3 minute walk away. 

You really couldn't ask for a better location: plenty of coffee, food, and entertainment options within a 5 - 30 minute walk in any direction. We did rent a car to leave the Capitol Hill and Downtown area, and to take a day trip to Friday Harbor. 

Seattle is a great city, and this apartment certainly helped us unwind after enjoying all it has to offer. "
60659	387078	10.0	10.0	18145785	Autumn was great& helpful host!  She met me there as soon as i arrived to give me all the access i needed as well as a review of the space & guidelines.  i really enjoyed the space & the neighborhood location made it even better. i enjoyed the laid back neighborhood, close to many stores and a vibrant street.  definitely a great stay.
60660	387078	10.0	10.0	18589968	Autumn was a great host! She was very friendly and accommodating, and communicated well with me throughout the stay! The apartment itself was very nice. Totally renovated and very spacious. I stayed by myself, but it would be perfect for a couple! There was a bottle of wine in the fridge and snacks left. They also had a book with directions and things to do in the area. I would definitely recommend staying here! Great experience.
60661	387078	10.0	10.0	19357393	My partner and I were in Seattle to be married and wanted a convenient location with access to cool sights, great restaurants and bars.  Our condo on Summit Avenue did not disappoint.  Everything was fresh and clean and the fully equipped kitchen was very nice. Autumn made check-in quite easy and gave lots of good recommendations.  Would stay here again.....I highly recommend this condo!
60662	387078	10.0	10.0	20620223	Host was incredibly warm and professional. Apartment was exactly as photographed / described and immaculately clean. Perfect location. 
60663	387078	10.0	10.0	20815941	Excellent space. Fantastic location. Highly recommended 
60664	387078	10.0	10.0	21768925	This is an awesome listing. Autumn was responsive and attentive when contacted prior to the trip. On check in she was friendly and helpful. The listing itself is great, all the amenities you could conceivably want. It was clean, comfortable, and homey.  There are great shops in the area, and accessibility to the city is fantastic.  There is construction going on next door. It wasn't an issue for me as I was gone a lot during the day, I was made aware of this prior to my booking so I appreciated that as well. All in all, a great listing, I will be back. 
60665	387078	10.0	10.0	22118772	My stay at Autumn's place on Capital Hill was just perfect.  Autumn met me at check in to go over the logistics, but everything was so well laid out that it was easy.  The apt. is modern, clean, well lit and has all the amenities one would hope to find in a hotel.  Located right in the heart of the Capital Hill neighborhood, with shops & cafes within a few blocks, I could not have asked for more.
60666	387078	10.0	10.0	23798908	"The listing description was accurate, in a good residential location overlooking the city of Seattle (west side of the building), near Broadway, with lots of excellent places to eat, and a busy Starbucks down the street.  (the Space Needle view was blocked by another building across the street).  We were able to get two parking places.

The interior was exactly as advertised; bed was very good and couch bed acceptable.  Nice, new.  We had to move from one unit to another during our stay and they were comparable.

The only downside is that we didn't know there was a building under construction right next door.  We were gone to work every day, leaving early and returning late, so it didn't bother us, but beware, the construction noises start early.  You should check on the status of this if you plan to be there during the day."
60667	387078	10.0	10.0	24941528	"It's a nice place to stay in Capital Hill. The apartment is super close to core area in Capital Hill. Within a walkable distance, you can visit Broadway, downtown.
The listing itself is accurate. I really like the interior design.
However, there is one thing worth mentioning.  As mentioned by Alan, the construction site right next to the apartment is really causing lots of noise during the workdays..."
60668	387078	10.0	10.0	25254545	"Great place.  Warm and clean. 
Great location.  Central to almost everything. Easy transportation everywhere. 
Great hosts. Very attentive. Offered places to go. Will definitely stay here again. "
60669	387078	10.0	10.0	25675581	Great neighborhood and great apartment.  Autumn did everything to make the check in process and stay enjoyable.  Great apartment.
60670	387078	10.0	10.0	26427310	"Autumn and Robyn were both super helpful and friendly. The apartment is exactly as pictured. The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils, pots, pans, bake ware, etc. There was even a spice rack, umbrella and an HDMI cable! They really did think of everything! This place was perfect for my two-week stay.

Just a note though that this is not an elevator building and this particular unit is located on the third floor. 

It's a great location and very close to great restaurants. "
60671	387078	10.0	10.0	26604214	My boyfriend and I spent 4 wonderful days at this property and loved it! It is centrally located, close to everything you would need or want, clean, updated, and in a great, safe neighborhood. Autumn made the check in process very easy and we both felt so welcome at the property. We will definitely be back!
60672	387078	10.0	10.0	27004445	Seattle was absolutely incredible! This location was perfect, and we truly enjoyed our stay. I would highly recommend visiting Seattle, and utilizing this location. 
60673	387078	10.0	10.0	28218447	The place was perfect.  I would love to live in capital hill.  It was more then perfect, couldn't ask for more. I love walking on Broadway so many place to eat and see. So close to downtown too :)  I would definitely stay there again
60674	387078	10.0	10.0	29275269	Wonderful updated apartment and location, close to many places, bars, coffee shops, supermarket and restaurants. It will not be the last time we visit and a wonderful welcome
60675	387078	10.0	10.0	31523621	"The purpose of our trip was to visit family living in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. The apartment was very comfortable and contemporary. Nicely furnished. Plenty of drawer and closet space. Kitchen was fully-equipped... including the coffee and also some refreshments (thank-you Autumn!).  The Capitol Hill street where the apartment is located is primarily residential /apartments; yet, it was an easy walk to stores, restaurants and bus stop(s). For most in-town exploring, we were fine without a car. (Did a lot of walking, and bus-ing. Cab fare from airport is about $50.00.) Autumn met us on our arrival, welcomed us, and made us feel ""at home.""   "
60676	387078	10.0	10.0	32058307	Place is in a great location. Went to Seattle with three friends and the space fit us comfortably.
60677	387078	10.0	10.0	33272535	I loved my stay! The place is very clean and comfortable. The location is excellent. Walking distance to restaurants, stores and coffee!! Autumn was very helpful and responded to any request I had immediately. I will definitely be back!
60678	387078	10.0	10.0	33892123	"Beautiful, easy to access apartment! We found some great eating spots nearby and the location to the bus routes was amazing! 

Felt very well welcomed and enjoyed our time in this part of Seattle!"
60679	387078	10.0	10.0	34225940	When we first arrived Autumn was stuck in traffic so she gave us the directions to get into the apartment and we had no problems.  When she did arrive later that evening, she gave us some great ideas on what to see in Seattle.  We took several of her ideas and had a wonderful time.  The apartment was just as seen and described on the airbnb website.  We loved the amenities and the apartment worked great for our family of 4 with the kids sleeping on the pullout blowup bed in the sofa.  The neighborhood was very nice.  We were 4 blocks from the QFC which had pretty much anything you could ever want and it was open 24/7.  While it was about a 25-30 minute walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Center it was definitely doable and we enjoyed the walk.  There were also many different restaurants on Broadway near the QFC for when we didn't want to eat in downtown Seattle.  We rented a car at the airport but ended up using taxis and Uber most of the time to save on parking and fighting the traffic.  Most fares for going downtown were very reasonable.  We would definitely stay here again.
60680	387078	10.0	10.0	37540917	The space was clean and stylish and had everything I needed. I will definitely be back next time I'm through Seattle!
60681	387078	10.0	10.0	38363426	My husband and I had to book a last minute 1 night stay while in seattle. Autumn was super responsive and ararnged the stay within just a few hours notice. We were met by someone with the keys who was also friendly explaining anything we had questions about. The condo was in a great location. We were able to walk everywhere. The condo was just like it looks in the pictures, very clean, spacious and comfortable. We only had 1 night however if you are wanting to explore Seattle by foot and get a taste of Capitol Hill this is a perfect place! Thank you!
60682	387078	10.0	10.0	40472346	Apartment was great-exactly as described on the site!  Apartment Manager Rueben was friendly and efficient and was able to check us in and get us keys when we arrived. Location was central.  Had a great stay in Seattle.
60683	387078	10.0	10.0	41732311	We absolutely LOVED staying in this wonderful unit. The photos posted are 100% accurate, the folks managing the rental unit were helpful, responsive and attentive to us and they were very clear in regards to the rules and regulations of the property. We ended up staying for over a week and enjoyed every moment. One thing to note is that the walk to downtown is honestly a trek! There's a monster hill to undertake on the way back, so we ended up using the bus system and also Lyft quite a bit. Broadway St is so close and is honestly my favorite part of Seattle! 
60684	387078	10.0	10.0	43701800	It was very nice to meet Autumn in person, she was very amenable and informative.
60685	387078	10.0	10.0	44926377	Beautiful place. Beautiful city. Everything went according to plan. Would love to stay there again.
60686	387078	10.0	10.0	46606754	Autumn did a great job of reaching out ahead of time and staying in touch throughout the stay. Check-in was a breeze, and the apartment was just as advertised! It's in a great location in Capitol Hill. There are a bunch of neat restaurants and bars nearby, but we hardly heard any noise the entire week we were here. Overall, a great experience!
60687	387078	10.0	10.0	47699445	Location, cleanliness, parking and nightly rate were all great!  Very comfortable and well appointed unit, as represented.  No let downs or surprises upon arrival.  Autumn was very personable and completely responsive; a pleasure to deal with.
60688	387078	10.0	10.0	49778020	Rooms are exactly like pictures, spacious, lots of light and clean.  Perfect location.  Would def stay again.
60689	387078	10.0	10.0	50749198	Excellent apartment, great location, plenty of space
60690	387078	10.0	10.0	52732742	"Autumn was extremely helpful, so personable and she answered all my questions. The place was in tip top shape and we enjoyed our stay very much! Such a great location and I would recommend to anyone coming to area! 

Thanks Autumn!

60882	3626497	10.0	10.0	16190337	"Both Elyse's cozy condo and Elyse were great. I would book with her again.

This classic condo is clean, comfortably furnished, and well maintained. The bed was cozy, soft and comfortable in its own bed-sized ""nook"". The window blinds were great for letting in light and maintaining privacy. WiFi was strong and fast. The kitchen had everything needed for two people to cook comfortably. The simple tiled bathroom was tidy and cozy. There's a mirror just outside the bathroom and with good lighting to help 2 people get ready at the same time.

The building is an older (1930's?), brick and wood construction walk-up building on a hill. The condo is on the ground floor at the rear of the building, protected by a fence and a railing. I lived in this type of building before and was used to it, but if you expect not to hear any sounds from other building occupants, that's just not realistic. But the most we heard were light footsteps. The building and the area was actually very quiet during our visit- it seems that most residents and neighbors aren't party people, or loud TV watchers, either.

The location was perfect for our wanderings of Capitol Hill, and sampling of shops, parks, bars, and restaurants. It's a few, steep blocks uphill to Broadway, and a few level blocks over to Olive Way's bar/resto zone. Let's not forget Top Pot, either, and it's very tempting hill-climbing fuel.

Elyse was very responsive and helpful, promptly responding via email and text, and checking in with us by text mid-rental. She was also was very accommodating to our schedule, and sympathetic to some challenges with the AirBnB site.

We had no trouble parking, because we found a spot on the street as we arrived, and just walked around the remainder of the time. I noticed a few open spots nearby as we walked around, so parking shouldn't be too bad, but rock star might be hard to get. Load-in/out from the alley access would be very easy once you get the key.

Would happily rent from Elyse again.
"
60883	3626497	10.0	10.0	16234911	Elyse was a great host! She responded promptly to my messages and was an absolute pleasure to interact with during my stay.  Her condo is conveniently located near all of the downtown attractions and the bars/restaurants on Capitol Hill and Queen Anne.  Additionally, the size of the condo is perfect for one or two people, which the pictures accurately depict.  I highly recommend her place to maximize your stay in Seattle!
60884	3626497	10.0	10.0	16382861	Elyse's place is very nice, and Elyse herself was great and helpful with insider tips about what to do and how to get around Seattle. The apartment is serene and comfortable, with an older charm and some really cool details. I liked the sleeping nook a lot - cozy! The apartment is on the ground floor and I did hear some upstairs neighbours walking around, but it wasn't loud or bothersome. The location is sweet, equidistant to Broadway, Pike/Pine Corridor, and Downtown. Thanks!
60885	3626497	10.0	10.0	16514235	Elyse and her fiance were welcoming when we arrived and quickly showed us the condo. She was very accommodating with our arrival time and communicated very quickly about any questions we had and checked in with us throughout the stay to make sure we were comfortable. The location is great, quiet but close to the excitement of the city. 
60886	3626497	10.0	10.0	16635564	"Elyse was a great host. She made us feel welcome and even left us blueberries in the fridge. She also left little sticky notes for things that may have been unclear.

The apartment looks as good as it does in the listing and is nicely decorated. We found the apartment to feel clean and spacious.

Two standout features of this listing are:
1) The neighborhood - from talking to some locals, apparently the neighborhood around Broadway is not ""touristy"". Things didn't feel ""touristy"" and everyone I spoke with was really nice. I thought being able to go walk up and down Broadway from the apartment was pretty cool. Elyse's neighborhood also feels safe.
2) The bed - one of the comfiest beds I've ever slept on! Also, nice sheets.

Overall, we had a great experience staying here."
60887	3626497	10.0	10.0	17175400	Our stay in the condo was fantastic. It was a perfect amount of space and the neighborhood was great as well. We walked to breakfast each morning and one afternoon walked to the downtown shopping & Pike Place Market. Everything in the apt was so clean and neat & we felt very welcomed by note reminders around the house. Also I loved the piano! I could only play chopsticks and my 6th grade recital piece but I loved pretending I could play nonetheless. 
60888	3626497	10.0	10.0	17377267	"Elyse was great with communication and gave us some advice on getting to her condo from the airport that ended up being extremely useful.  The location was easy to find and the neighborhood was very cool.  It was evidently an up and coming neighborhood, which resulted in quite a bit of contrast between the old and new.  We loved it.  The pictures and description of the condo were spot on, so we knew what to expect.  However, we were pleasantly surprised that Elyse took the time to leave out area maps for us, leave notes in places to help us out (like finding ""hidden"" light switches), and be super friendly, offering up suggestions and giving directions.  The price we paid was on point, and we would highly recommend both Elyse and this condo to Seattle visitors wishing to stay in the Capitol Hill area.  "
60889	3626497	10.0	10.0	17634964	"This was a great apt in a quiet yet central neighborhood.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  The kitchen was equipped with everything needed to cook if you like, but the plethora of wonderful restaurants nearby made it unnecessary for me.  

Elyse was very pleasant and made check in very easy.  She also was kind enough to share with me some recommendations for nearby food and drink options.  

The apt is just a short walk to downtown and is in what appeared to be a very safe neighborhood.  This would be a perfect place to stay for a couple looking to explore the city, or someone on business that just needs a place to sleep and work.  "
60890	3626497	10.0	10.0	17709862	What a lovely apartment! And in a great location. Elyse left helpful notes and essentials (coffee, plenty of towels and blankets) that helped us have a seamless stay. 
60891	3626497	10.0	10.0	18071683	"The stay was great. Elyse met us the day we arrived and was flexible on our arrival time which helped a lot. She also provided a map which shows some of the local attractions and helped get us oriented.

The place is nicely located in Capitol Hill in walking distance of all Cap Hill has to offer as well as just a bit over a mile from tourist attractions such as Pike's Place Market. Her space is nicely put together and comfortable with nice furnishings. We did spend most of our time out of the condo as there was a lot to explore.

I would definitely stay here again!

60892	3626497	10.0	10.0	18183988	Elyse is a great host & went out of her way to make sure we knew where her place was. The apartment is just how it looks - cute, clean & close to everything in Cap Hill. It's just off the beaten path enough to be quiet.  The sleeping nook is adorable. 
60893	3626497	10.0	10.0	18330442	Elyse's apartment is really wonderful. Clean, thoughtfully decorated, and really peaceful. We instantly felt at home. The location is great and we really felt like locals immersing ourselves in the vibes of Capitol Hill. Great  walking distance from bars, downtown, and Volunteer Park. Overall, wonderful experience, thank you so much Elyse!
60894	3626497	10.0	10.0	18491805	We had such a fun time in Seattle.  Elyse was very welcoming and gave us suggestions as to what to do and helpful maps.  The apartment was very nice and in a great location.  We essentially only used it to sleep as Seattle has a lot to do and lot to eat.  We walked everywhere from there and if we were too tired it was close to some bus lines.  We would definitely stay there again!
60895	3626497	10.0	10.0	18570612	This place was lovely! Elyse made it incredibly easy to check in, despite her not being available in person to show us around. She was very communicative and the space was immaculate. It was very centrally located for where we needed to be. We'll definitely be staying here again!
60896	3626497	10.0	10.0	18806915	The host was great. She was clear in her communication, easy to get ahold of and on time to meet us. Her place was perfect for us. It was exactly as she described. She also had coffee and tea for us and the kitchen was easy to use. The location was stellar. Easy walk to downtown, easy walk to Capitol hill stores .  Elyse also stored our luggage for us on the last day because we had a late flight. Super helpful. I would return to this place in a heartbeat. Also loved loved loved Seattle. What a great city!  Oh yeah, Elyse left us maps too, and explained the basic directions. Really helpful. Five stars for sure!

61266	1790020	9.0	10.0	8515222	My daughter stayed just 1 night with Cc, but said the room & apartment were scrupulously clean, very nicely appointed and comfortable. Also he was so accommodating about the arrangements so everything was settled without a single problem & my daughter was ready to relax & watch a movie instead of worrying about where she would lay her head that evening.

61268	1790020	9.0	10.0	8707265	"Apartment is comfortable and well-(website hidden) Powell was very responsive.  Views from the apartment are indeed stunning.

Our one qualm was that host could have been a little more up-front about the fact that he would be renting multiple rooms to multiple air bnb'ers at the same time.  We did not realize this until after we had confirmed the rental.  It did not end up being a problem, but it would have been nice to have full information."
61269	1790020	9.0	10.0	8749207	Very nice and comfortable, and certainly a stunning view off the balcony of Seattle.  Though he stayed elsewhere, Calen was super nice and responsive.  Recommended. 
61270	1790020	9.0	10.0	8796580	We spent two nights at Calen's place while visiting Seattle. He made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed, which was much appreciated. The apartment has great views and is extremely clean. It is also conveniently located and there are a ton of things to do in the neighbourhood. We had a wonderful time!
61271	1790020	9.0	10.0	8918639	Very clean house. Great view. Close to everything. Would stay here again

61278	1790020	9.0	10.0	9933624	Calen's place was amazing and in a very convenient location. It was pleasure staying at his place and hope to stay again in the future whenever I visit Seattle.

The place itself is cozy and comfortable. I lived there for 12 nights. I did enjoy sitting on the high chair to see the beautiful sunset and space needle. And the room is comfortable. 
Calan is friendly and really responsive. He also gave me advice when I was finding a place to live in Seattle. BTW, I do like Lucky. She is so cute."
61280	1790020	9.0	10.0	10142659	My boyfriend and I stayed in the flat in Seattle and had a great time! The location is very convenient and the flat is super nice. We had everything we needed and were quite comfortable with our stay. I would highly recommend this place for any guests wanting to visit Seattle!
61281	1790020	9.0	10.0	10311875	Our time at the apartment of Calen was great! The communication with Calen was very smooth and the room was all set up when we arrived. Especially the breakfast place is great, with a nice view. We also enjoyed the location a lot, a great neighborhood where you wouldn't end up if you'd book a hostel/hotel. The only thing that didn't worked out for us was that the hot water wasn't working. However, Calen was on top of it to fix and it was probably an incidental thing.
61282	1790020	9.0	10.0	10423589	Great location and accommodation. Accommodation was comfortable. Apt is centrally located near great restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. Highly recommend!
61283	1790020	9.0	10.0	10539567	Cc's  house was clean, comfortable, and very well located.  The view IS great, I wish the weather had been nicer so we could have used to patio more!  My only (small) complaint is that we did not realize that there would be other guests staying in the apartment, and in the morning they got up early and were a little noisy while we were trying to sleep (I don't think they knew we were there either).  Overall it was a great way to experience Seattle on a budget!  
61284	1790020	9.0	10.0	10613681	Calen was a lifesaver during a recent business trip to Seattle. When my travel arrangements were abruptly changed I was left without a room for the evening. Calen responded to my lodging request with lighting speed and within a matter of minutes I was on my way over to his Capitol Hill apartment. location location location. This apartment was mere blocks from so many of the shops, bars and restaurants that make Capitol Hill. The room was warm, comfortable and smelled of fresh laundry.  Having the bathroom next to the bedroom was very convenient as well. I slept soundly and awoke the next morning re-energized. The view from the balcony was to die for. The ease of booking last minute, the comfortable and well appointed room and excellent location turned my stay in Seattle from a business trip to one of pleasure. I will be giving Calen a heads up next time I am in Seattle and I recommend you do too.
61285	1790020	9.0	10.0	10675813	Great view! Great host! Very helpful and nice guy.

61287	1790020	9.0	10.0	10911079	Thank you so much for allowing us to stay! We had a great time in Seattle and the location of your place was just perfect. Hope to stay with you again :)
61288	1790020	9.0	10.0	10938702	Calen was responsive when I had questions and he allowed me to stay till whenever my ride could get me during the day of check out which was like 5pm and I was so grateful as I had so many bags and not much of anywhere else to go. I'm really grateful for that. The location was PERFECT. I would maybe suggest putting individual locks on the outside of the bedroom doors considering there's usually two separate bookings in the apartment. My bed and sleep were quite cozy.
61289	1790020	9.0	10.0	11101271	As like the last time, CC's place was warm and inviting. With a Perfect location and beautiful balcony view on a nice day, his place is a jewel of the emerald city! I will definitely stay there again! 
61290	1790020	9.0	10.0	11170893	Calen's spot was ideally situated.  Once we figured out the Seattle public transit system, it was a snap getting to different neighborhoods in the city.  Capitol Hill itself has some great restaurants.  And Calen's tourist guide resources (maps and guidebooks) made discovering Seattle lots of fun.
61291	1790020	9.0	10.0	11238006	His place is very clean and has a very stunning view !!! I love that it is very quiet and very close to Volunteer park and broadway! Will definately come back here !! 
61292	1790020	9.0	10.0	11267239	"Calen was very responsive when I texted or called. He always replied in a timely and helpful manner. He also had bus maps available and made lots of recommendations of places to eat and hang out. 

His balcony is awesome! It's covered and has a cozy sofa with an amazing view!"
61293	1790020	9.0	10.0	11287859	Apartment was in a great location, very close to Capitol Hill! Host was very quick to respond to questions, very helpful! There were a lot of stairs, heads up to folks with mobility issues (my partner has nerve damage in her legs, so it was a little rough for her, but then again, all of Seattle is a little rough for people with mobility issues). Parking in this location was difficult (all restricted with 2-4 hr limits 7am-6pm m-f), but cabs/lyft/uber are great in this area so if you're not driving it's a fantastic spot. 
61294	1790020	9.0	10.0	11503265	"Calen was an amazing host!! Even before I arrived, he contacted me to confirm the arrangements and give sine good suggestions and advice. He also checked in during my stay to make sure everything was going well.  He was very available and knew the city well.
The apartment was a cozy place with all the amenities of home.  You cannot beat the location; there was a ton to do and see in the immediate area.  Getting downtown or to other neighborhoods did not take long at all.  
If you are going to Seattle, stay here."
61295	1790020	9.0	10.0	11583910	My host was gracious and kind in the face of my inability to travel. Caught the flu, and he was sincerely disappointed we wouldn't meet. I will visit him on my next trip. His location is great, the heart of Seattle and near by daughter. I recommend him highly. 
61296	1790020	9.0	10.0	11678193	Cc is a great host. The location is the best! Lots of places to go for food and entertainment. A bus ride or a cheap cab away from downtown Seattle. The other house guests were very friendly.
61297	1790020	9.0	10.0	11834831	i really had a pleasant stay at cc's place.  the view of the seattle skyline from the balcony is fantastic!  the condo is located in the capitol hill neighbourhood and was (for me) a good walking distance to all of the tourist spots and things i wanted to see: the monorail and space needle campus, pike place market, and the ferry terminal to bainbridge (website hidden) was very easy to communicate with and very likeable and accommodating; when i arrived at the condo, he was there to meet me and chat for a while, even though he had someplace to be at that time.  his place is tidy and comfortable.  i only wished i had more time to spend in the city... one day isn't nearly enough... thanks, calin!
61298	1790020	9.0	10.0	11904318	Calen was a great host and his place was perfect.  He went out of his way to make it ideal for AirBnBers.  You won't regret staying there!
61299	1790020	9.0	10.0	11941008	Calen is a lovely guy. We left our wallet in the room accidentally and travelled back to Los Angeles which could have been a disaster but Calen was so helpful and fedexed it for us. He is really cool and welcoming. Great flat in the best part of town surrounded by bars, shops, great coffee shops..There are 2 rooms. One looked really inviting and well furnished. Our room was still being decorated and basically just a bed and a lamp so we felt the price was perhaps a little high considering but Im sure itll be worth it when its turned into a nice room.
61300	1790020	9.0	10.0	12096091	Calen was a very pleasant host. He was very respectful and made the experience that much better. He answered all of our texts and gave advice to the best of his ability. I would definitely recommend staying with him. 
61301	1790020	9.0	10.0	12263227	Had a great time staying here. Calen is a wonderful and considerate host. The place looked great. The view was amazing. 
61302	1790020	9.0	10.0	12359544	The apartment was clean and had all the necessities. Our host welcomes us at the door and showed us around. The room is quiet and comfy. The bathroom is clean. There is a well equipped kitchen and refrigerator for our use. There is a nice balcony with a couch to lounge on a warm sunny day. I would happily stay again. 
61303	1790020	9.0	10.0	12519635	Very comfortable and cozy, and a great location for exploring the city. Would stay there again. Calen was also very hospitable. The apartment has a balcony with a couch & a view of the city and mountains, a bright living room, and some helpful books and walking tour cards for visitors.
61304	1790020	9.0	10.0	12818312	Our first experience in Seattle was wonderfull, thanks to Calen's house !! Capitol Hill is the best district : calm, very nice view, proximity to parks and streets full of life (pike street and brodway). The appartment was clean and comfortable. And Calen was here to welcome us, he was very kindly with us. Thanks and hope to see you another time !! Candice and Jérôme.

This was a great location, with cool views of the downtown, lucky to find since we booked so last minute! The room and kitchen had all you needed and were well equipped."
61306	1790020	9.0	10.0	13314318	Nice room and well accommodated. Close to a lot of places too :)
61307	1790020	9.0	10.0	13465965	Nice appartment. Located on a silent street. Beautifull view. Comfortable and very clean. Calen is a very friendly host. He support us during the stay and looked that everything was ok. You can reach the center very easy. A lot oft Cafés and Restaurants arround. Perfect!
61308	1790020	9.0	10.0	13707942	We had a great stay. The apartment is clean, has a great view and a very comfortable bed. Wonderful location that is within easy walking distance to Key Arena, Pikes and some delicious seafood.
61309	1790020	9.0	10.0	14169662	We had a great stay! The room and bathroom were clean with enough extras (blankets, pillows, towels) for me and my mom. The location was wonderful and it was very convenient to walk to restaurants and coffee shops. Definitely recommend staying here!
61310	1790020	9.0	10.0	14282157	Great experience!  Very nice apartment...clean,  extremely convenient, no hassle.  I usually stay in hotels but this was really great. Thank you, Calen!
61311	1790020	9.0	10.0	14712324	A friend and I stayed in both private rooms which were both comfy and clean. The location was perfect for walking to downtown and to areas with great night life and restaurants. I would highly recommend Calen's apartment for anyone looking to stay in Capitol Hill or the surrounding area. Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to meet Calen during our short stay, but he was very nice and always sent quick correspondence. 
61312	1790020	9.0	10.0	14804118	Calen' s has a very nice apartment, we love to stay there, the view from the balcony is quite beautiful. Calen is a nice person, he help us to carry the heavy luggage to the cab.thank you Calen and we will come back to your place next time when we come to Seattle.
61313	1790020	9.0	10.0	14847146	"Nice place on short notice for first timers using air bnb 

Calen was very patient with us and we appreciated the lock on the bedroom door. 

Calen got back to is quickly and explained how everything worked. 

Great views and very close to downtown.  

It was our first time using this service due to the convention on town but it will not be the last. "
61314	1790020	9.0	10.0	14979658	Calen wasn't there when we visited, but his house was great for our weekend in Seattle. Such a convenient location, walking distance to so many bars and restaurants. We especially loved sitting on the balcony in the morning, relaxing on the comfortable couch, taking in the amazing view. 
61315	1790020	9.0	10.0	15242017	Calen's place was amazing, especially for my first airbnb experience :) location was great, the house was comfortable and has a beautiful view, and all the little things Calen did to make me feel comfortable really made my stay amazing. Thanks so much Calen!
61316	1790020	9.0	10.0	15271670	I never got to meet Calen in person, but he was very responsive to any questions we had and super flexible with our schedule (thank you again!).  The place was perfect for us - it was just like we expected, and the location was great for walking to Pine Pike and downtown.  We were really happy and would absolutely stay with Calen again!
61317	1790020	9.0	10.0	15414278	"This is a great location to check out the city from -- right in the heart of Capitol Hill with lots of good coffee, shops, etc, nearby.
Easy to book, easy to find, everything went smoothly. Thank you!"
61318	1790020	9.0	10.0	15543887	The place was (website hidden) is very accomadating, shampoo dispensers, water in the rooms, really above and beyond. Great location, walking distance to bars and resturants. Great view of the city. Would most def come back. 
61319	1790020	9.0	10.0	15818275	I was only in Seattle for a few days, but Calen made sure I had everything I needed, the apartment was clean, centrally located, and had amazing views of the city, I would recommend staying here for anyone
61320	1790020	9.0	10.0	15898400	The host was very on the ball. Made sure we had clear communication and regular updates to meet, even after I moved up my arrival time.  The place is very clean and has everything you need + more. Love the projection screen & comfy couch and room.  Was great to have a bit of time to chat and hang out with him.  The area is great if you love the Capital Hill area.  Will surely look to see if this is available again next time!
61321	1790020	9.0	10.0	15962620	Great spot in Capital Hill. Easy communication with host and simple check in process. I would definitely stay here again. 
61322	1790020	9.0	10.0	16108152	The apartment was in a great location, and on a quiet street. The bed was comfy and the balcony was an awesome place to watch the sunset over the city! We had a short stay and didn't have a chance to meet Calen, but he had a convenient key-system that made the check-in and check-out completely simple. thanks for sharing your space!
61323	1790020	9.0	10.0	16248088	Calen was an amiable host and gave me the lay of the land and points of interest in the neighborhood.  The bedroom I had was adequate but a little worn.  The space was definitely no frills but in general served my needs.  The condo is three flights up with no elevator.  The view from the condo is a nice lookout over most of the city.  It is conveniently located to all parts of Capitol Hill.  The bathroom and shower housekeeping could have been better in my opinion.  Communication between the hosts and the others sharing the condo with me was severely lacking.  They had no idea I was there and stumbled upon me in the bathroom and were rather vociferous in their disappointed surprise.  I feel better care could have been taken with this.  Also worth mentioning - my bedroom had a leak in the ceiling over the bed.  Luckily this presented itself on my last morning there.  All in all, an okay experience but I wouldn't book here again.  I would prefer a place with no others sharing.  Live and learn on my part.  I feel the pricing could have been better for what it was.  It is my hope that Calen will improve his offering based upon this listing.  Live and Learn on both our parts.          
61324	1790020	9.0	10.0	16570338	Close to downtown 
61325	1790020	9.0	10.0	16675834	Amazing set up by Calen. The place was very well cleaned and stocked. Great views and the balcony set up was perfect for watching the sunset with a beer.
61326	1790020	9.0	10.0	17166839	I have a lot of fun during my visit in Seattle, the place is strategically located only several blocks from Broadway St, 12th and Pike St, and 15th Ave where great restos and cafes, bookshops, records stores are. So in terms of location this place is ideal. Calen as the host is very easy to communicate with and very responsive. He provides clear direction and description of the building (sends pictures, nice!) and also makes sure that guests needs are accommodated. A very nice host. The place is as described by the owner, the view is nice especially to watch the sunset. The projector and Roku was a lot of fun, I watched a bit of movie while waiting for my taxi. The place has the feel of a bachelor pad, and it reminds me a lot of a graduate student apartment, which is not bad as it gives the instant welcome feeling but it yes I agree with some comments that say it could use some vacuuming.   
61327	1790020	9.0	10.0	17441566	I had a delightful time at Calen's. The room was clean and comfortable. The apartment is very nicely situated in Seattle and is a great launching pad to explore Capitol Hill. Calen was friendly and always promptly answered any questions. I would be very happy to stay with Calen again.
61328	1790020	9.0	10.0	17547152	"Calen was very helpful in our last minute booking, made it really simple to check in and always remained in contact with us. We only stayed for a short night but the apartment/mini two-room hotel is well run, very clean with everything you would need for a longer stay.  The balcony is quite a nice spot.

Residential neighborhood, parking wasn't easy to find later in the evening but it was just a short walk to the Broadway or the other busier streets of Capitol Hill.
I would recommend this place to others
"
61329	1790020	9.0	10.0	17590408	Calen was the best host we have ever had.  He knew when to email and when to let us be, the place was spotless, had ALL the amenities (blow dryer, water, shampoo, conditioner, maps of Seattle, brochures) - everything was thoughtful. The room stayed cool the way he had the windows and fan set up. The balcony was my favorite part. I fell asleep watching the downtown view of Seattle and listening to the sound of light traffic in the cool breeze. It was wonderful!
61330	1790020	9.0	10.0	17661165	I had a wonderful stay and really enjoyed the experience. The location was perfect in Capital Hill and the accommodations were as described. The view from the balcony was beautiful. I would definitely make a return visit!
61331	1790020	9.0	10.0	17775981	Calen was a very hospitable host- friendly and informative! The apartment was quite nice and in a pretty convenient location. We walked downtown from the apartment on both days, taking in lots of sights and coffee, and it only took about 30 minutes or so... The private room we stayed in was nice and clean... Yes, there is a lovely view from the terrace, and it was nice to sit out there, particularly at night with the city lit up... This was my first Airbnb experience, and I must say it was a positive one! I definitely would recommend Calen and his digs any time.
61332	1790020	9.0	10.0	18196140	Calen was a wonderful and engaging host. The space was awesome and it was great meeting so many interesting guests. The space was very clean and welcoming and OH MAN that view! I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Seattle. The neighborhood is fantastic as well, theres a ton to do and its all in easy walking distance. 
61333	1790020	9.0	10.0	18342624	"This was truly a great place to stay, a beautiful and safe neighborhood. Totally walkable and close to many gems in the city. 

Calen is a seasoned and respectable host. The room was a nice size and well ventilated. Great balcony view too; would come back! Thanks so much. "
61334	1790020	9.0	10.0	18410252	Calen was a good communicator and very nice. The place was Clean, comfortable and convenient.  Plenty of towels. The bed and sheets were comfortable. The fans were nice to have in the bedroom. I would describe it as a bachelor pad experience. Shared hallway bathroom with another guest.  He provided toiletries and blow dryer. 2 waters, but no coffee or tea. The apt was walking distance to a hip area. We easily found free parking. You have to walk up a lot of steps to get to the apt. He had a key box outside which made checking in easy. Calen provided a key to the bedroom which was good because another stranger is sharing the space.  The kitchen is good if you want to cook and there is a nice view. There is a great grocery store in walking distance.  No tv but he had a projector for netflix. Internet worked well.  Thanks for having us! 
61335	1790020	9.0	10.0	18631283	This is my second time staying with Calen and everything went well just like the first time. 
61336	1790020	9.0	10.0	18666530	The neighborhood had a lot of great places within walking distance.  We spent a lot of time down by the water which was a short, easy cab ride from his place.
61337	1790020	9.0	10.0	18992256	"Although we never met Calen in person, he was a wonderful host and easy to get in touch with! The space is exactly how it is shown here. There was another guest in the other room who we saw once or twice, but to be honest we were out of the apartment and exploring the city for the majority of our stay. 

The apartment was clean and cozy, hot water, room to unpack, a cute balcony and kitchen area. The area was great. Only a block or two from a grocery store. Less than a 10 minute walk to a ton of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and only a $6 Uber/Lyft ride downtown to the heart of the city.  

We had a rental car for one night and had no trouble with street parking right out front, although it may be a bit more difficult during a weekend. All and all, the bus system was easy, Captiol Hill area was safe, and Calen did a great job hosting my boyfriend and I in his apartment. Thanks!"
61338	1790020	9.0	10.0	19101412	Calen was great with checking in on us when we flew in, and making sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. Our stay was wonderful, and we had a great time there. The location was wonderful, and we just had an overall excellent time. 
61339	1790020	9.0	10.0	19565959	Our experience in Seattle at Calen 's place was really nice. Communication was clear and the apartment is located in a very nice area! We could walk to bars and restaurants easily.
61340	1790020	9.0	10.0	19662413	Although I did not get to meet Calen, he was very communicative regarding keys & check-in. The location of the place is great- it was walking distance to Pike St and Capitol Hill attractions. 
61341	1790020	9.0	10.0	19849254	"Calen was professional and responsive throughout my entire stay.  As other reviewers stated, he is also a nice guy and possesses lots of interesting information about Seattle.  

I definitely recommend him to other travelers.   "
61342	1790020	9.0	10.0	20297198	Calen was a fantastic host! He was very friendly, helpful, and easy to contact even when he wasn't at the apartment. The place was comfortable, clean, and in a really great location. I would definitely stay here again!
61343	1790020	9.0	10.0	20521795	Calen's place was great to stay at while in Seattle.  The place was tidy and the room was comfortable.  I walked to downtown twice, but there's also a bus only a few blocks away.  Plenty of food and bars also within walking distance.
61344	1790020	9.0	10.0	20638097	The apartment was clean. Calen was reachable via email, and quick to respond. The attached balcony had a great view of downtown. Capitol hill is by far my favorite neighborhood in Seattle, and his apt. Is within walking distance to it all. Was thoroughly impressed and would stay again.
61345	1790020	9.0	10.0	21108403	Good location in Capitol Hill, quiet and comfy bed ! 
61346	1790020	9.0	10.0	21360939	"Everything went smoothly with my stay at Calen's place. Apartment was as advertised, and while I did not get a chance to catch up with Calen in person, he responded well to my emails and texts in the lead-up to my stay.

Instructions on picking up the key from the key box and a map of street parking proved helpful as well. The room is fairly non-descript, nothing fancy, but it gets the job done if you are just in need of a bed for the evenings. Bathroom and rest of the apartment were clean, and the balcony has a nice chair to enjoy a sweet view of the city.

The location of the apartment is its most stellar plus. Calen's place is a good deal to be able to park yourself in a great spot in the city. Bars, coffee shops, etc. all within a short walk within Capitol Hill, and getting to other neighborhoods for further exploration is totally doable by foot or bus. 

Overall, a solid, successful stay. "
61347	1790020	9.0	10.0	21499818	Had a good stay at Calen's apartment. On the evening there was another guest, there was ample escape routes for my inner introvert  (deck couch, private room). And on the evenings there wasn't, I had the view of the city all to myself. The fridge was stocked with a surprising diversity of beer. Centrally located near Broadway, the beating heart of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. So plenty of good coffee in reach.
61348	1790020	9.0	10.0	21648389	We arrived late and left early. However, were able to enjoy the conveniently located apartment. Furthermore, Calen was able to seamlessly accommodate us last minute, which ended up working perfect for our roadtrip. 
61349	1790020	9.0	10.0	21817543	Calen was Johnny on the spot for welcoming us and showing me where everything was. His place is all it is cracked up to be location, location, location!! Straight shot to the waterfront, great walking around neighborhood and gorgeous view of the Olympic Mountains with breakfast. My husband and I were only there one night and wish it could have been longer!! We will definitely be back to Calen's!
61350	1790020	9.0	10.0	21920630	"After reading glowing reviews, was actually not that happy with my stay at Calen's apartment. Calen was friendly and my room was clean enough. The bathroom wasn't super fresh and I wish there had been a floor mat that wasn't already soaking and covered with dog hair. Didn't think it was worth $100/night.  But MOST IMPORTANTLY, Calen gave my room key to the other couple staying in the apartment for the weekend by accident and when we couldn't open the locked door because he had given them his only key (all my stuff was inside) he made NO effort to retrieve the key or rectify the situation. He only sent them a text asking when they would be back. Hours later I asked if he had gotten they key or heard from the other Airbnb guests, and he said they had texted ""oops"" and that he ""assumed they [would] be back later tonight."" So there I was alone in Seattle, all of my things locked in a strange apartment, and I wasn't even sure I would be able to sleep in the bed I had rented for the weekend. Not impressed. Luckily the other guests left my room key for me before they went out for dinner. "
61351	1790020	9.0	10.0	22268509	Calen was awesome! He was very informative, answered all my questions promptly, and the place was clean and organized when we arrived. He gave us clear instructions regarding parking and the check-in process. I would definitely book with Calen again!
61352	1790020	9.0	10.0	22391481	Awesome location, comfortable apartment, and very easy to communicate with Calen.  I recommend. 
61353	1790020	9.0	10.0	22449898	This is best place for the best value that you will find in Capital Hill Seattle. Hands down. It is in a central location, just a short walk to the Capital Hill scene. It's equipped for a quick stay, or a longer stay. It has an awesome deck with a view of the city skyline. The bedrooms are comfortable. The TV projector with Netflix is great. The place is thoughtfully arranged and equipped to make guests comfortable and efficient. 
61354	1790020	9.0	10.0	22474465	I was in late and out early, but the place was clean and well-located.  Calen was kind and easy to get in touch with.  
61355	1790020	9.0	10.0	22516738	Calen's deck is located in a quiet, pleasant neighborhood, 15 mins to the Seattle night life by walking (rests and clubs). Although we didn't get to meet, it was really easy to follow his instructions and access to the apto. Thank you Calen! Travelers'd better keep in mind that the bathroom is shared.
61356	1790020	9.0	10.0	22994863	Calen was a great host and was very helpful at helping me get my bearings of Seattle at large; as well as the Capitol Hill neighborhood. His place was exactly as described—very centrally located and with fast wifi.  
61357	1790020	9.0	10.0	23084773	Very responsive to messages and left clear instructions/pictures of the building including how to get in.  The room was clean and bed comfortable.
61358	1790020	9.0	10.0	23375135	Initially I was delighted with my choice of accomodations due to the four block proximity to my daughter. The bed was great, all seemed good, and the view was terrific. But life went downhill fast. thanksgiving night we returned to find the bathroom toilet was nonfunctional. After a large meal I found it necessary for a flushing toilet and we had to go out at 11:30 pm. But, hey, it was a holiday so I let it pass as things that happen. The next day though we returned to find it was still non functioning. I calmed Tim down and we decided to stay and just walked to my daughters that night. The third day we returned to an apartment that not only STILL did not have a functioning toilet, but now the heater was no functioning in the bedroom and it was 18 degrees outside, no electrical plugs worked in the bedroom(s) or bathroom, and Calen did not text me back until Sunday about where the electrical panel was. Too late. I have medical equipment that needed electricity so I slept on the couch because we found one in the living room that worked and I could plug to. There were not enough blankets and the German girl from the next bedroom came out, freezing, and slept sitting beside me. We left the bathroom door open Sunday to get enough light to shower and packed up. My partner, Tim, was furious and haranged me for the whole fifteen hour drive back home Sunday about the fact that he feels we should be reimbursed for the last two days. I had held him back from calling the city about sanitation laws when the toilet never got fixed!  It was disappointing as I love the location. Calen needs a property manager to attend to items of that sort!
61359	1790020	9.0	10.0	23517718	Had another comfortable stay on Capitol Hill at Calen's place. Coming in from Chicago for business this was an easy place to walk to everything on the hill. 
61360	1790020	9.0	10.0	23665435	Super convenient location, clean room, great communication from the host. Highly recommended.
61361	1790020	9.0	10.0	23851162	Calen has a very nice apartment located in an easily accessible part of Capitol Hill. Everything about the apartment was as advertised and I didn't have any trouble finding it or following Calen's instructions for how to get in. The bed is comfortable and there is a space heater in the bedroom so you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level. I didn't actually have a chance to meet Calen in person, but he was very responsive and helpful in providing information about his place.
61362	1790020	9.0	10.0	24156055	Calen communicated everything clearly in regard to the reservation and throughout the stay.  The room was clean and only walking distance from downtown.  I enjoyed my stay and would definitely return to Calen's Capitol Hill home. 
61363	1790020	9.0	10.0	24397484	Clean, simple, straightforward experience. Calen's communications made for a smooth transition in and out. Great neighborhood, lovely views. My first choice Seattle spot.
61364	1790020	9.0	10.0	24488162	Calen and his Capitol Hill apartment were awesome.  This place couldn't have been more walkable to everything I wanted to do in Seattle.  Calen was extremely helpful via txt message, he was kind and welcoming, and the instructions about the apartment were very clear.  I am definitely renting Calen's place on my next Seattle trip!
61365	1790020	9.0	10.0	24670372	It is as advertised with a great 4th floor patio view.  The bedroom as roomy and there are local transportation and travel guides provided.  Soaps and hair products are made available.  Heating throughout seems to be by only portable mini electric heaters.  Therefore, when, for example, the bathroom door is closed that room can get quite chilly because there are only heaters in bedrooms and the living room.  Overall, the place is clean, reasonably tidy, roomy, and very well located.
61366	1790020	9.0	10.0	24979559	We thoroughly enjoyed our Seattle experience at Calen's. This quaint apartment is not only close to awesome restaurants and bars, it is also just a short walk to downtown. Also, Calen offers several gracious amenities, including mini shampoos, and access to relevant literature to occupy cozy downtime. 2 thumbs up. This one gets the game ball.
61367	1790020	9.0	10.0	25244368	"The apartment was easy to locate, the directions were clear with photos. Calen provided prompt responses to questions throughout our trip. It was a wonderful experience to stay here. We were not only seeing the hotspots for tourists, but we were also able to explore Capitol Hill like a local. Easy access to nearby (3-4 blocks) bars, restaurants, pizza joints, super markets. Neighborhood was very pretty. Nice houses and nice people also.

The apartment was very laid back and chill. We were able to wake up warm, cook our own food, enjoy a great view, and just sit back and watch Netflix after a long day. Transportation to the rest of the city was spectacular and easy. It was a pleasure to meet and chat with Calen when he came by to clean up. "
61368	1790020	9.0	10.0	25304004	Two thumbs up. Calen is quick to respond and very organized. He had the room ready for my arrival and instructions in my inbox immediately. The house is very clean and comfortable. Calen had even left me a couple of bottles of water, which was a nice personal touch, especially if you've arrived thirsty from traveling.  The apartment couldn't be in a better location, just a few minute's walk from Capital Hill shopping, dining and nightlife. I'll definitely book the next time I'm in Seattle.
61369	1790020	9.0	10.0	25519546	Calen was an exceptional host, though we never met, he was very responsive to text messages and air bnb messages whenever we needed a question answered. He was very flexible and easy going by allowing us to sleep in a little over the check out time and was generous and gracious. 
61370	1790020	9.0	10.0	25588269	Calen was great and in constant communication. It was my first airbnb and I would recommend it. No complaints!
61371	1790020	9.0	10.0	25731429	Calen was a great host. Flexible with check in and check out times. The location is incredible, with great views from the apartment and lots of cools things to do nearby. I liked the neighborhood and was a better experience than when I stayed at a hostel in downtown Seattle. The room was clean and spacious. I liked that he had a desk where I could work when I needed to.
61372	1790020	9.0	10.0	25783204	Really great place, even better in person. Bed was comfortable, heating blanket and small heater in the room (not that it needed it). The apartment is on a somewhat busy street, but the bedroom was quiet. Parking was the only downside, but I can't argue with the location: within a 10 minute walk to about everything you would want to do. Calen was super quick to respond, even though I booked last minute. 
61373	1790020	9.0	10.0	25819017	Calen is a terrific host with a really great space. I had unusually warm January weather and having coffee on the balcony with a view of downtown and the Cascade Mountains was terrific. I walked everywhere and getting downtown was a snap. Thanks, Calen.
61374	1790020	9.0	10.0	26122673	We had an excellent stay at Calen's place, it is well recommended. Calen provides plenty information about the local area, the room and apartment is great and is located in a fun area. Would definitely recommend this place to others.

61376	1790020	9.0	10.0	26547916	We had a great stay at Calen's. The room is small but cozy. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The living room has a projector that was fun to use during down time. The location is great! Close to everything we needed: pharmacy, supermarket, coffee shops, restaurants, and public transportation. I downloaded Lyft and got 10 free rides of $20 (try using ELISA233843 to see if you can get the same) and that was very helpful. We never met Calen but he was always very helpful and easy to contact. I wouldn't mind staying there again. Thanks Calen. 
61377	1790020	9.0	10.0	26668507	Very comfortable stay, nice guy. He accommodated us with very short notice and we were very happy!! Would recommend 
61378	1790020	9.0	10.0	27000869	"Calen is the man! His apartment was clean and conveniently located, he had a very generous set-up, and went well out of his way to make sure I had a great time in Seattle. You really can't go wrong with the host or the space. Thanks again, Calen!

10/10 Would Stay Again"
61379	1790020	9.0	10.0	27084476	Comfortable, convenient and affordable. Exactly what I was looking for. 
61380	1790020	9.0	10.0	27257100	Great location and easy to access the city. I really enjoyed my stay. A very relaxed and friendly environment.
61381	1790020	9.0	10.0	27898752	I stayed a little under two weeks while apartment-hunting and this place served as a great home-base. After getting a quick response for booking the room, check-in was explained clearly in a text message, so even though no-one was around when I arrived, I was able to get access to the place quickly and easily. Calen's knowledge of the city proved insightful when he was at the the apartment a couple days later. He has a bulletin board with loads of thank-you notes from previous guests, so I felt I wasn't the only one who enjoyed my stay. It was a positive AirBnB stay overall. 
61382	1790020	9.0	10.0	28188835	Two thums up! I deeply appreciate a very warm welcome from Calen. Few days prior to arriving his place, he already provided many details enough in clear ways, so I didn't get confused and didn't have any problem with enjoyng the place at all. I liked clean bedroom, fast wifi. The place is located in he Capito Hill area where you can enjoy nightlife.
61383	1790020	9.0	10.0	28278762	Good place. Calen was very helpful and easily reachable. He made check in and check out easy. The apartment is cool and good location. Thank you! 
61384	1790020	9.0	10.0	28421954	Calen was an awesome host- very friendly, genuine, and accommodating. He is very approachable and responds quickly to messages/concerns. More than anything, he made us feel very welcome &  at home, and I was happy to have an awesome first airbnb experience thanks to him. 
61385	1790020	9.0	10.0	28659550	Calen was very helpful and responsive when checking in. The view from the deck was amazing! I wasn't in the apartment much, but it had everything I needed and the heated bed was awesome. Thanks for letting me stay!
61386	1790020	9.0	10.0	28751327	Calen was a great host. The place is in a very convenient location, close to lots of great food and shops.

61388	1790020	9.0	10.0	29708833	We very much enjoyed our stay here. Calen was a great host and really helped the whole process run smoothly. It is very conveniently located and just what we were looking for during our few days in Seattle. Much recommended! :)
61389	1790020	9.0	10.0	30055671	I booked last
61390	1790020	9.0	10.0	30323600	Everything was great. The apartment is in a very nice part of Capitol Hill with all the amenities including a yoga and barre studio nearby. There were basic things including towels and shampoo included.
61391	1790020	9.0	10.0	30539550	Comfortable stay in a great location. The view from the deck is incredible.
61392	1790020	9.0	10.0	30720983	Perfect location! The place was close to the bus line and the city was a 15 minute walk away. The apartment was clean and has a balcony with a view of the city. Calen was personable and helpful. He gave us some suggestions of things to see based on our interests and even got us in touch with another guest staying the same weekend to see if we wanted to include him. Capitol Hill is a beautiful neighborhood with friendly people. I would definitely recommend this place to a fellow adventurer. 
61393	1790020	9.0	10.0	31019734	"Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood with wonderful restaurants and bars just up the hill from 12th Ave East on 15th Ave East - extremely accessible to Calen's place. I had a great late night meal on arrival at Hopvine, a pub, plus dinner with friends that I met on my trip at Jamjuree and amazing Thai place next door to Hopvine. We finished the evening with an amazing drink, ""Point of No Return"" at Liberty on the other side of Jamjuree. Try the drink if you dare:)

Calen was an excellent host. He communicated with me in advance when I asked questions. For the most part I didn't see him until my last evening because I was in Seattle working on a project at Creative Live and had to be in the studio by 8 AM and for the most part came back to Calen's place late.

BTW, there is excellent bus service to other parts of town just 2 blocks away. I chose not to hassle a car in Seattle on this trip."
61394	1790020	9.0	10.0	31861557	We had a great time staying in Seattle at Calen's place unfortunately we never got a chance to meet him but don't have a bad thing to say about the experience. This was our first airb&b experience and Calen was organized and made the process very easy for us.
61395	1790020	9.0	10.0	32042930	"Great, no fuss host. I tried to book at 9pm for same night stay and response within minutes, and clean sheets by 10pm on arrival. Great communicator for host, and super capitol hill location.

Would recommend for any guest."
61396	1790020	9.0	10.0	32210228	I from china and traveling in USA.calen is very nice people,I am no more English ,but Calen is very patience for (website hidden) is so close board way  .just 5miu by walk and here is very (website hidden) downtown just 13miu by bus.
61397	1790020	9.0	10.0	32404427	Calen was great!! Very easy going and accommodating. I was mainly just looking for any easy place to crash, leave my stuff, and take a shower. Worked great and he was far enough from the fun for quiet but not so far it wasn't walk-able to all the best Capitol Hill spots.
61398	1790020	9.0	10.0	33289748	"Calen was a very hospitable host. He was very professional  and experienced...he knows what he is doing. He was prompt in contacting me regarding the details of the booking sending pictures of the place and special instructions. He was generous in sharing tips on getting around the city, places to see and places to eat. I think he is pretty flexible in how much interaction you can get from him depending on how you prefer.

Location of his place was pretty convenient. Probably a 10 min walk to Pine/Pike St in Capitol hill which is a pretty happening place in Seattle. Pretty safe neighborhood. Lot’s of great food around the area without having to go all the way down to 1st Street. Definitely stumbling distance when you had too many Rainier Beers and Seattle dogs. And less than a 10 min walk to Volunteer park if you want to get some jogging done. 

The room was basic but sufficient. He has a nice Patio overlooking Seattle. Perfect for just hanging out with a cold brew. He has a nice comfy couch with a projector and a roku. Internet connection is decent and he even offers a guest computer. Just remember though that his place is on the 4th floor so you have 3 flights of stairs to go through if you have lots of luggage.

I would definitely stay with Calen again when I go back to Seattle.

61399	1790020	9.0	10.0	33718587	"Calen's apartment is a great spot to explore Seattle, very nice and lively neighborhood, we liked it a lot. 
Calen is a great host - easy to communicate with, gave us helpful tips for our visit, and keeps the apartment all clean & cosy! 
It was really fun staying there, thank you."
61400	1790020	9.0	10.0	33873327	I didn't get a chance to meet Calen in person, but he did an excellent job of getting everything arranged with me and was a fantastic host.  The room was clean and comfortable, and the location of his apartment (especially the view!).  Overall a great place to stay. 
61401	1790020	9.0	10.0	34028293	I had a great stay at Calen's apartment. The location is phenomenal...i was in walking distance from a great coffee shop, a yoga studio and great restaurants/bars. Calen was super accommodating-I arrived early and had a late flight out--and very nice/approachable. I highly recommend this stay!  
61402	1790020	9.0	10.0	34179799	Calen has a very nice place in Capital Hill and I enjoyed my stay. I had the place to myself for most of my trip and just briefly met Calen. 
61403	1790020	9.0	10.0	34567126	"My friend and I had a great stay at Calen's place!  We didn't get to meet Calen due to our hectic schedule (there is so much to explore in Seattle!) but he responded promptly to my reservation request and the questions I had along the way.  The location is great--it's close to tons of restaurants and the bus stop, so transportation was easy to figure out from there to other parts of the city.  I thoroughly enjoyed the view of downtown Seattle and the distant mountains from the balcony--it's absolutely gorgeous at sunset!  I would definitely recommend staying here if you're headed to the Emerald City for a trip!

"
61404	1790020	9.0	10.0	34879858	"We didn't get the chance to meet Calen until we were leaving but upon arrival, everything was clean and in order. His directions were very clear and easy to follow. Calen was also great at letting us know when other guests were checking-in to the second bedroom.
The neighborhood was great! There are tons of restaurants to eat at and places to explore. It was also nicely located between downtown Seattle (Pike's Market) and Seattle Center.   Overall, this was a really good Air BnB experience.   "
61405	1790020	9.0	10.0	35241840	"Calen was an absolutely amazing host! We had an amazing experience that was made easy for us from beginning to end.

Calen was even super understanding when we were late due to getting lost in public transit. I would recommend this Air BnB time and time again.

As my first time using Air BnB I can say that this has made me want to use it again."
61406	1790020	9.0	10.0	35487435	"Calen was great, as was the apartment.  Everything was as advertised, no surprises.  Bed was comfy and sheets were SOFT - must be a high thread count.  Also, the location is fantastic.  Just be careful of getting stuck on the wrong side of the 5 during rush hour - Seattle traffic is no joke!  

I would definitely stay at Calen's again."
61407	1790020	9.0	10.0	35663778	great place in a great area, exactly as advertised, easy check in and out...Calen was great and accommodating and easy to get in touch with, room and apartment was perfect for us...great deck.

61409	1790020	9.0	10.0	36562724	Calen was a great host! The place was great and the location was awesome. Right in the center of everything you want to get to in Capitol Hill and not a far walk from downtown. I enjoyed getting to know Calen and the other guests too. I'll stay here again and again when I'm in Seattle!
61410	1790020	9.0	10.0	36751755	My stay was simple and seamless - exactly what I was looking for. I needed a quick comfortable place to crash for a relatively-last minute work trip, and the Calen's place delivered. His communication was flawless, entry was easy, the neighborhood is full of interesting places, and the bed was comfortable. I didn't get a chance to check out much of his house. It was hot and humid, but water and a well positioned fan helped keep discomfort low. A great stay all around.
61411	1790020	9.0	10.0	36870826	Calen was a nice guy and easy to coordinate with. The location was great. The common areas, especially the bathroom was in need of a good cleaning though.
61412	1790020	9.0	10.0	37094219	This place was great! Easy, flexible check-in, very comfortable, and awesome location. Will definitely check it out for future stays in Capitol Hill. 
61413	1790020	9.0	10.0	37372586	Great view of the Seattle skyline, especially at night.  Didn't actually meet Calen, but he gave us excellent thorough instructions on the apartment.
61414	1790020	9.0	10.0	37824660	Great place in a great location.  I had to book last minute and Calen was quick to respond and his directions were perfect and easy to follow.  The place was clean and comfy; I'd definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle! 
61415	1790020	9.0	10.0	39471467	Calen was extremely helpful finding parking and was very easy work with.  The place was nice, with an excellent location.  
61416	1790020	9.0	10.0	39556829	Apartment was in a great location.  It is nothing fancy but it gets the job done and as said the location was perfect.  Calen was very welcoming and made us feel like we were at our own home
61417	1790020	9.0	10.0	39650591	Calen was a great host! He was quick at responding to my questions and ensure that my friend and I felt welcome. The place was clean and well-organized. I am also very glad that the place is also close to everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle, making our stay that much more enjoyable. Thank you for having us, Calen!
61418	1790020	9.0	10.0	39798307	We were only here for one night. Place was fine. We had what we needed. Apartment wasn't super clean, but not too bad. 
61419	1790020	9.0	10.0	40405093	Yes, I felt welcomed.  Good communication despite hosts busy schedule. We connected several times with good results.
61420	1790020	9.0	10.0	41225912	 I came to Seattle with my sister for a little R & R. Our stay with at Calen's place was exactly what we wanted and needed.The apartment is smack dab right in the middle of great restaurants, bars, bookstores, cafes, etc., the balcony has a great view of downtown and the Space Needle, room and bathroom were clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. I would recommend staying here, most definitely. 
61421	1790020	9.0	10.0	41394171	Calen was incredibly responsive and accommodating.  Our flight got in 2 hours before our check in and Calen coordinated with the previous guests to see if we could check in earlier. The unit was as described, clean and functional. The only downside is that there was construction in the neighboring unit that was quite loud at times. The neighborhood is fantastic and fun to eat and go out in. I recommend this place.
61422	1790020	9.0	10.0	41466628	 Calen was an excellent Host.  The flat was everything that is advertised. Would Recommend this to everyone.
61423	1790020	9.0	10.0	41963383	While we did not get to meet Calen in person, my fiancé and I had a great stay at his place. Calen was really easy to get in touch with despite being out of town for the weekend and was very accommodating in arranging for a late check out since we had a late flight out of Seattle. His apartment is very conveniently located within walking distance to a lot of the attractions in the city and is close to great restaurants and bars. I'd definitely recommend Calen's apartment as an easy, convenient place to stay.
61424	1790020	9.0	10.0	42572706	Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this listing. While the host was very responsive in the beginning providing info and access to the property, he was completely unresponsive once issues arose that required resolution. MAIN ISSUE: the property was very dirty -- hair and grime in bathtub, toothpaste residue in sink, and enough dust everywhere to write in. We alerted the host, who came over to address this, but cleaning had been neglected for so long that it really required a professional deep cleaning. So even after host attempted to clean, it was still not OK. We left before our reservation expired and booked at a local hotel, which was very expensive on short notice in high season, but conditions at host's property were intolerable.
61425	1790020	9.0	10.0	43078770	The room was exactly as described in the listing; and location was great.  It was easy to get to and a great place for a weekend visit.  Thanks for the room!
61426	1790020	9.0	10.0	43468187	Calen was great. This was my first time on Airbnb. He was very helpful. The sign-in went flawlessly. A very clean, well equipped apartment. Nice view. I'd stay there again in a heart beat.
61427	1790020	9.0	10.0	43725239	"Smooth check in check out.
The shower is very good and the bed decent.
Nice location, walking distance to bars and restaurants. Also an enjoyable walk downtown.
I appreciate that Calen was able to place the sleeping bag that I forgot by accident at his place, in the outside for me to pick it up 2 days later.

"
61428	1790020	9.0	10.0	44621801	Our stay at Calen's was restful and casual. He sent us all of the info about the apartment in advance by email. That way, we were able to get the keys and leave our luggage even though he wasn't there. The bedroom was comfortable, and we were told to help ourselves to anything in the kitchen. Calen responded very quickly to our inquiries both beforehand and when we arrived at the apartment, which was extremely helpful for the stressful situation that brought us to Seattle. He was also very flexible about our check-in and check-out. We enjoyed the outdoor patio very much. There are comfy cushions and blankets everywhere. The location is also great for accessing Capitol Hill and bus routes. Thanks, Calen!
61429	1790020	9.0	10.0	45115116	Calen was a great host. He gave very clear directions and was also very welcoming.

61432	1790020	9.0	10.0	46988694	"I stayed at Calens for 5 nights, it's in a great location within walking distance to a ton of great places in the neighborhood.  It is on a pretty quiet street as well, I slept with the windows open and even on the weekends I didn't hear much traffic or people.  The balcony was also amazing, great view with a comfy place to sit and enjoy the evening air.

There were alot of thoughtful little things for guests like power strip near the bed, a desk, hangers and open closet space, lots of guides and maps, a shopping bag and grocery store card on the keys.  You can tell he takes pride in being a good host and put effort into making the place even more accommodating than a hotel."
61433	1790020	9.0	10.0	47677019	Calen was a congenial host.

61437	1790020	9.0	10.0	49539726	Great calm spot in the middle of Capitol Hill! Though i never got to meet Calen,  he made sure everything went fine.  Clean, cosy bed, cool flat. Recommended 
61438	1790020	9.0	10.0	50153810	The apartment was fabulous. Without Calen present, we were able to check-in and check-out with ease. Calen was very helpful and we'd certainly stay there again!
61439	1790020	9.0	10.0	50339877	Great location, amiable host, easy check-in and checkout.
61440	1790020	9.0	10.0	50609597	It was very easy to work with Calen and the room is in a great location with easy walking access to everything around Capital Hill. 
61441	1790020	9.0	10.0	51206433	The location is perfect. The place and bathroom were very clean and welcoming. It was easy and comfortable, the way you hope for with an AirBnB. Thank you for a great stay. 
61442	1790020	9.0	10.0	51518302	First of all, staying at Calen's place was my first AirBnB experience and so thankful my plans fell through and I was able to stay at Calen's Capital Hill apartment. My original housing cancelled and I submitted to Calen and within twenty minutes I had a place to stay...for the very same night as I was pulled over at a rest stop in Portland on my way to Seattle. I had three interviews in two days and coincidentally Calen's spot was in the middle of all three so I was able to walk to all of them making the experience that much more enjoyable. I even lost (deleted) his e-mail laying out the finer points of entering the building and keybox information between walking from my car to the building and texted Calen. He responded within a few minutes with a call back. Extremely helpful! The place was tidy and quaint...a living, breathing apartment. Towels were left out and a couple bottles of water. I even pulled out the ironing board from a closet to iron my shirts. Great location...few blocks east and you're own 15th avenue with anything you might need. Walk down 12th and you're in the hustle and bustle of the downtown. Stay in and you've a nice little living room and fully functioning kitchen with a spectacular view of the skyline. Parking was a breeze. Again, I haven't had any other experience to compare it to, but I would highly recommend Calen Capital Hill spot...and would more than likely stay there again if I needed. 
61443	1790020	9.0	10.0	51865421	Calen was super attentive and everything was great, just what I was hoping for. Would definitely stay again.
61444	1790020	9.0	10.0	52064462	Capitol Hill was a lovely neighborhood; most things accessible by foot with adaptable transportation.
61445	1790020	9.0	10.0	52783461	Calen has set the bar high for my first Airbnb experience.  He was very friendly and very fun to talk to.  His house was well maintained and the location couldn't be beat.  I loved staying in and watching Netflix on his wall projector, and the views were gorgeous.  Plus Lucky was a real sweetheart and very cute. 
61446	1790020	9.0	10.0	53437710	I really enjoyed my stay at Calen's place in Capitol Hill. He was very accommodating and has a very nice dog. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here myself a second time.
61447	1790020	9.0	10.0	53738324	Host was so kind to take a very last minute request in the middle of the commute hours in the evening. He quickly went home and prepped my room for me. He was so gracious as to invite me to use his tv in the living room. Bed was comfy and for the price the accommodations were perfect! I would highly recommend Caleb as your host!
61448	1790020	9.0	10.0	53870762	Calen was wonderful, easy to coordinate with and really helpful and knowledgeable about the area. The place was clean and cozy -- we felt right at home!
61449	1790020	9.0	10.0	54187319	Calen's place was great! A perfect location to live like a local but with easy access to Seattle's best coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and parks. Calen may or may not be there but he's always available to answer any questions. 
61450	1790020	9.0	10.0	54364549	Calen was a blessing. When my flight got into Seattle at midnight (two hours late), I used the Instant Book feature and he helped me get adjusted—even way past check in time! Great place too, comfortable bed, and a great place to view Capitol Hill/dwtn Seattle on the balcony...I'll definitely stay here again :)
61451	1790020	9.0	10.0	54949437	Calen was extremely friendly and accessible. He was a great host! The location and view of the city was great. The walk to broadway was about ten minutes. Parking is always kind of an issue in Seattle but we managed to find a few spots pretty close by. Theres a lot to do in this area which is awesome. great deal for the price.
61452	1790020	9.0	10.0	55034565	Calens place is in an ideal location, has great views, and is very comfortable. Calen himself is a warm and welcoming host, clear communicator and available for anything that may arise. Single female travellers should be aware that Calen rents out both his rooms, so you might be sharing with someone who is not the host and whom you've never met. This was a surprise to me as I arrived home late one night to find a man I didn't know in the house. There are locks on the bedroom doors but only from the inside, so there is some element of trust needed if you choose to leave your things during the day (like a hostel). Everything was fine with my stay - most people are good people - and I had no incident. Just something to note. I walked everywhere and had a great time. Thanks! 
61453	1790020	9.0	10.0	55089226	Calen's place was easy to check into, very central location and at a good price. Calen was also accomodating and communicative, I Would come back. 
61454	1790020	9.0	10.0	55336238	The place was great. Spacious and convenient. 
61455	1790020	9.0	10.0	55506179	Calen was extremely helpful and responsive. His place was very clean and had an amazing view!
61456	1790020	9.0	10.0	57736229	Calen was very easy to work with, and his place was very accommodating and centrally located. I would stay here again.
63065	3570691	10.0	10.0	18829923	Beautiful home, ideally located in Seattle on a quiet street but within walking distance of coffee shops, bars and a straight shot to downtown. Ekko is a thoughtful host - the place is spotless and there were muffins and fruit and cereals provided for breakfast- and fresh coffee beans with a grinder and brewer. Oh- and a Nintendo Wii U with Mario! 
63066	3570691	10.0	10.0	19469361	Perfect Location and perfect stay in Seattle!!!!
63067	3570691	10.0	10.0	19684848	Everything was great, especially the welcome basket and the generosity of the host. It really felt like staying at a home away from home. 
63068	3570691	10.0	10.0	19939371	Ekko's home was perfectly spacious for our group of 8. It is exactly how it looks in pictures - very clean and comfortable. We didn't meet Ekko but he was quick in responding to all his emails and went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed. His front door is coded so there is no need to worry about carrying a key - very convenient! He warned us the garage space is small so a small sedan would've been perfect. Street parking is a bit tough to find in this area. Very very close to downtown area - we walked it - about 1.5 miles. As a plus, his fridge is stocked w/ drinks and snacks that you're welcome to. Loved our experience would definitely recommend it. 
63069	3570691	10.0	10.0	20459807	"Ekko was an amazing host. A couple a friends and I were trying to plan an affordable weekend getaway last minute to no avail. After so much looking around, I finally found Ekko's amazing townhouse. He was very accommodating to my last minute request and he readily communicated back and forth with me to give us a spectacular deal.

In terms of his amazing townhouse, we couldn't have asked for anything more. It had more than enough space for us to lounge around in and a kitchen big enough to actually do some real cooking in! There also is so much sleeping room including the living room couches, that a total of 7-8 people could comfortably enjoy their stay at this spot, especially with three bathrooms, two showers, and a jacuzzi bathtub. The location was also a big plus. It's only two blocks away from a park, three blocks away from a grocery store, and a 5-10 minute walk to the crazy night life of Capitol Hill. Last but not the least, the house door is opened with a code, which makes it easy for everyone to do their own thing, because no one has to worry about having to need a copy of the key.

Other than all this, I don't know what else to say. If you have 3 or more people, you should definitely stay here!
"
63070	3570691	10.0	10.0	21513787	"I stayed here over a weekend in October with 5 other people (3 couples total) and we all had an amazing time. We never got to meet Ekko but he was so responsive with all my emails and calls, and even came by a few days before to set up an airbed for the extra couple. His townhome is so gorgeous and immaculate, and reasonably priced too! Very comfortable with everything you need and more.

The location is fabulous, walkable to really great restaurants (which Ekko leaves recommendations for) and bars etc. We were all so pleased that we picked the best place in Seattle to stay. Thank you for your kind hospitality Ekko!"
63071	3570691	10.0	10.0	21909361	Ekko was a very gracious host! Left a lot of drinks and snacks for is which is great! We had plenty of room and the location was perfect for Capitol Hill use and a quick cab ride downtown.

63073	3570691	10.0	10.0	24676718	Ekko's house was amazing. Centrally located, walking distance to everything. The house was well stocked, and Ekko also went the extra mile by leaving some goodies out for us. I will definitely be staying here again when I'm in Seattle. Thank you Ekko!
63074	3570691	10.0	10.0	25192260	What a professional host! Ekko has really thought of every little thing to make his guests comfortable (batteries and scissors available in labeled drawers, drinks stocked for arrival, etc.), and we loved staying at his place so much that we extended our time there. The townhouse is in a fantastic central Cap Hill location, in the middle of everything but tucked away on a residential block and very quiet. Ekko is also a great communicator and responds to messages instantly. Just awesome!
63075	3570691	10.0	10.0	25519414	"The house was located right near all of the fun neighborhood stuff in Capitol Hill, and is exactly as listed in the directory. It was clean, safe, and well-appointed. It was also really nice to have a parking spot and a guest parking pass in this neighborhood.

Ekko communicated really well the whole time, responding quickly to a few quick questions we had.  "
63076	3570691	10.0	10.0	37215842	This was a great place to stay in Seattle.  The location was perfect and the apartment was exactly as described.  I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Capitol Hill area. 
63077	3570691	10.0	10.0	38428285	Ekko was a phenomenal host with A+ accommodations to back it up. What a fantastic townhouse. It was big and and bright and comfortable. I brought my parents on the trip and they absolutely loved their first Airbnb experience. The place is located at the pinnacle of Capitol Hill, right in the middle of a great bar scene, but nestled away on a quiet street. Also, Ekko was super easy to communicate with via e-mail. Responded promptly to all to my questions. I will definitely stay here again.
63078	3570691	10.0	10.0	39032504	"The place in Capitol Hill was fantastic. The townhouse itself was very clean and well kept and the proximity to restaurants and bars was perfect.

63080	3570691	10.0	10.0	40353423	Thanks Ekko! As a host, you spent a lot of time answering our questions and were accessible. Well equipped with everything we needed. We had a car, but easy Uber ride into the City. 
63081	3570691	10.0	10.0	40602469	Our stay was absolutely perfect. The location was great and communications with Ekko was incredibly easy. He was very responsive and quick to answer any questions I had. I would highly recommend this spot for anyone and stay here again!

Also, very clean.  We loved the huge kitchen, and really nice appliances as we cooked in a few times.  Very positive experience, and would suggest a stay here if you are visiting Seattle.

63084	3570691	10.0	10.0	42685456	Absolutely delightful, beautiful, comfortable, quiet and well equipped townhouse in Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle, with easy access to all points of interest. Enjoyed our stay tremendously!!
63085	3570691	10.0	10.0	44254785	Great house and great host- highly recommended.
63086	3570691	10.0	10.0	44907131	Ekko was a very gracious host and easy to communicate with the entire time. The townhouse is very clean and well kept. If you're looking to be in the Capital Hill area this is the perfect location. We had a blast in Seattle and would do it all over again!
63087	3570691	10.0	10.0	45615706	Ekko was a great host, very quick and clear when it came down to the details and questions. His spot was a great launching pad for our week with a small group of friends.
63088	3570691	10.0	10.0	45984573	Ekko was great from the beginning - very flexible and smart with the plan.  We had a different amount of people staying at the place each night for 3 nights and he handled it perfectly and even left us an air mattress for the night with the most people!  His place was wonderful - within walking distance of everything.  We were able to explore Seattle thoroughly and walk 5 minutes to the wedding we attended.  Beautiful condo, well kept.  He is also very quick to answer questions and reached out to see if we got in okay on our arrival date.
63089	3570691	10.0	10.0	46745959	I reserved this home for my daughter's wedding party for the weekend of 9/11/15.  The home was perfect, just as described!  Dealing with the owner, Ekko, was wonderful! He was both extremely responsive and most kind.  This home is in easy walking distance to everything in Capitol Hill.  I would highly recommend this property.  Debbie P.

Not complaining -- but the living room photo isn't completely accurate. There's the futon and the windowsill bed (both of which are comfortable). But the extra couch you see in the photo is no longer there. In total: there are two double beds, a twin bed, a twin windowsill bed, and a double futon. 
"
63091	3570691	10.0	10.0	49468709	Ekko was a perfect host! So responsive and accommodating. Let us check in early and leave late. Check in was a breeze and the appt is in a perfect location. 5 stars all the way around!

64089	8684315	10.0	10.0	51518238	"Mike, Paulina and Barksdale (their awesome Goldendoodle) gave us one of our most enjoyable experiences with an AirBNB host. 

We loved the neighborhood as it was conveniently close to just about everything including the Downtown area. The accommodations were immaculate, the bed was comfortable, and it was everything we needed for an overnight stay. Although we weren't expecting it, Mike and Paulina invited us to join them for a delicious home cooked meal.

We ended up spending several hours talking with Mike and Paulina about their work and world travels, and our one year old really enjoyed playing with Barksdale who was surprisingly gentle for being a large, younger dog. 

All in all, we loved it and hope the place is available the next time we visit Seattle! Highly recommended."
64090	8684315	10.0	10.0	52148345	Mike was a fantastic host. He and Paulina made my friend and I feel right at home on my first trip to Seattle. We were warmly greeted by his dog Barksdale who is such a sweetheart. The location is in a great area and a very short uber ride to everything we wanted to see. His house itself is beautiful with photos and artifacts of his travels displayed throughout. Mike had welcomed us with great suggestions on places to go/eat and things to do.  I would definitely recommend him as a host to anyone looking to spend some time in Seattle.
64091	8684315	10.0	10.0	52652917	MIke's house is even better than described. The room is clean and comfortable, and the location is absolutely outstanding. We find it even safe to walk at nights. Also Mike is a very nice man, easy and open for communication. We love the house and thank you for giving us such a good Airbnb experience!
64092	8684315	10.0	10.0	53077804	Mike was a great host! His home was beautiful, and we enjoyed Seattle very much and felt right at home. It was nice to see the pictures and mementos from all the places he's traveled to. My biggest regret was not being able to talk more with Mike about his experiences and travels (and to take him up on his offer of lasagna and wine). The living space was comfortable, and we made sure to take advantage of the bluetooth speaker in the showerhead. We also really appreciated all of the recommendations! (The views from Kerry park were amazing and everyone at Storyville was so warm and welcoming!) We also loved Barksdale. I have a Golden Retriever, so it was very fun to meet a dog with similar mannerisms. Thanks for hosting us!
64093	8684315	10.0	10.0	54325290	"Mike was great. His policy is to live by the ""golden rule"" which he does. We arrived with no one there and let ourselves in. There were a set of clear instructions on our bed with information about the house and the surrounding area. The house is wired really well for sound... including in the shower head! Being that our son happens to live on the same street we are very familiar with Capitol Hill. Mike was away for the weekend but we met up with he and Barksdale when he returned. Barksdale is absolutely adorable and we wanted to play with him all night, but had to go to bed to catch an early flight. Although we were not in Seattle to see Mike, it would have been nice to spend more time getting to know him. He is just the kind of person you want to add to your friends list :)"
64094	8684315	10.0	10.0	55958692	Mike was awesome! The places was beautiful and he was very inviting. I had dinner with them and helped decorate their tree. An amazing place to stay and really close to a lot of fun places to eat and shop. It's super easy to get around the city from that area as well. Totally recommend staying here!
64095	8684315	10.0	10.0	56194008	Enjoyed a great stay at Mike's place. I was made to feel right at home. The townhome is in an excellent location and the room, bed and bathroom were comfortable and well appointed. I would definitely stay here again.
64096	8684315	10.0	10.0	58022795	Mike was a very friendly host.  We entered the house using the code Mike gave us, and were quickly greeted by Barksdale the labradoodle!  Barksdale is an extremely friendly and well-behaved dog.  Mike was also very welcoming (although not quite as rambunctious as Barksdale!).  Mike's house is very nice and is on a quiet street with not too much traffic.  The room and bathroom were really nice and very clean and tidy.  I loved the bluetooth built into the shower unit!  I was able to brew up some Early Grey tea for myself in the kitchen for breakfast before we had to leave to catch a flight.
64097	8684315	10.0	10.0	58556005	"We had the pleasure of meeting Mike, Paulina and, of course, Barksdale, the friendly Golden-Doodle.  The home is lovely and is convenient to coffee shops, restaurants and nice views of the city.  We used UBER to get around which worked great.

We felt very welcome in this home and enjoyed spending time in Seattle.

We would definitely refer this property and are happy to have met both Mike and Paulina."
65247	2386589	9.0	10.0	10694341	Kabir and his house are amazing as everyone else here says. The apartment is in a great location close to everything and quiet. There is also a great view of the space needle from the living room. I woudl highly recommend this house and its host to anyone that is wanting to check out Seattle. 
65248	2386589	9.0	10.0	10867349	Had a great time staying at Kabir's place in Capital Hill. The apartment is very clean and comfortable, and he was very easy to work with on checking in late in the day. Capital Hill can be a very busy, party going place from what we saw on other streets on friday and saturday nights, but Kabir's place was exceptionally quiet! There are plenty of great restaurants, bars and coffee shops within a short walk. I would suggest to anybody.
65249	2386589	9.0	10.0	10990473	We absolutely loved our stay at Kabir's place!  We loved the location as it was so close to many nearby restaurants and bars.  Also, it is only 1.6 miles from the space needle and about a mile from downtown/the market.  We literally walked everywhere our whole trip.  Kabir's place was also very clean and well kept.  He has travel magazines and breakfast for the morning!  Overall, a great space!  We would definitely stay there again in the future.  Thanks so much Kabir!
65250	2386589	9.0	10.0	12314962	"Kabir's apartment was terrific!  Great spot to hang my hat for a quick trip into Seattle.  Great location and comfortable.

Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. "
65251	2386589	9.0	10.0	12443446	The place is neat and cozy, near bars coffee shops and restaurants and a close walk to downtown. Kabir is very logistically competent, and every little detail is taken care of before you step foot inside. Stay here!
65252	2386589	9.0	10.0	12629888	Kabir's place was great, really close to a lot of bars, shops. and a great breakfast spot!! It's about a 1-1 1/2 miles to pike's place, 1 mile to space needle, and 2-3 miles from kerry park, so that was nice! The place was overall pretty clean and similar to the pics which was nice to see. I would recommend staying at Kabir's if you're visiting seattle for a couple of days and need a place to stay!
65253	2386589	9.0	10.0	13426630	Kabir's apartment was awesome. Functional, near everything, close to a cool neighbourhood. It was a good sized apartment. And fit 3 people comfortably. I didn't get to meet Kabir but he seemed like a good guy. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Kabir!
65254	2386589	9.0	10.0	14982204	I've found that there are two main types of airbnb's: those that feel like impeccably curated spaces that rival the nicest hotel suites, and those that feel like you're crashing with a friend for the weekend who just stepped out. Kabir's space is the latter type. There's nothing wrong with that- the location is great and it was easy to contact Kabir to get the keys and find our way around. The park is a block away and all of Capitol Hill's bars and restaurants are a short walk.
65255	2386589	9.0	10.0	15335452	Kabir's place was in a fantastic location! We could walk to countless restaurants and shops! The space needle and waterfront was a tad of a longer walk but totally do-able. Kabir was a gracious host and very responsive in all his communication regarding our stay and logistics for getting the keys etc. I would definitely recommend Kabir's place to anyone visiting Seattle and wanting to be in a hip and trendy neighborhood. The only drawback is he parking in the neighborhood is pretty tough, but if you don't have a car it's perfect! (There is a public lot nearby to park but it has weird hours so we needed to move our car a few times). 
65256	2386589	9.0	10.0	16096479	Kabir was a great host. He wanted to get to know us a little and even met us to give us his keys. His tv remote had broken a few days before  and he had ordered a new one. He checked in with us to make sure that it was working properly. We stayed in 3 different airbnb places during our trip, but we felt most at home at Kabir's! He even left us some chips, salsa, and beer! The neighborhood was really cool. Analog coffee and Annapurna (Nepalese food) were so close. There are also some great bars within walking distance. 
65257	2386589	9.0	10.0	16312297	"Kabir was a very welcoming host.  He even left a bowl of assorted beverages as well as local maps and magazines to help us orient ourselves in Seattle.

65258	2386589	9.0	10.0	16729506	Kabir was a great host, very communicative. He provided an extra air mattress and sheets and had a stack of things to do around Capitol Hill, Seattle, etc. I will stay here again.

The apartment is exactly as shown and had everything we needed.  A pleasant surprise was the awesome view of the Space Needle!

We attended PAX Prime at the Convention Center and the walk was easy both ways.  I was worried about walking back up the hill, but it was a breeze.

Overall, Great Experience!"
65261	2386589	9.0	10.0	21627049	"Kabir's apartment is perfectly situated for a visit to Seattle. We walked everywhere we needed to go in the Capitol Hill area and Downtown. 

Although we didn't meet Kabir, as he was out of town, his directions for picking up keys and finding the apartment was easy to follow. It was well appointed and had everything we needed. A car isn't really needed if you stay at Kabir's, at least not for us. Thank you and we hope to visit Seattle again soon!"
65262	2386589	9.0	10.0	24004796	Such a great location!!! Kabir was very organized and helpful in making my first Airbnb experience a great one. The apartment was very charming (I loved the brick walls!). Although most of my visit in Seattle was spent out and about, I greatly appreciated how amazingly quiet the apartment was. Wonderful experience overall! Merci Kabir  =)
65263	2386589	9.0	10.0	24092915	Excellent location and comfy apartment with all the amenities. Loved the used bookstore right next door. 
65264	2386589	9.0	10.0	24480517	The place was very cozy in an amazing location! It was very easy to go to the Capitol Hill bars from this address, and there is plenty of food nearby too. The apartment itself is clean and friendly, we had a great stay.
65265	2386589	9.0	10.0	25331022	My friends and I planned a short girls trip to Seattle and was very lucky to have come across this place! Kabir was extremely helpful and worked with me on times which made things a lot easier for us getting in and out of the place. His place was exactly like it was described and we would love to visit again. This place was at a fabulous location. Very close to great food places, coffee places, and bars. In addition, it was a hot spot for Uber!! We came at a pretty cold time of year, and the place was pretty cold, however, Kabir did provide lots of blankets and we got over it! We are from Texas... so 40 degrees was not ideal for us =p Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely come back again! Thank you Kabir for the great advice and providing such a great home for us. It was great meeting you and if you ever need a place in LA, Austin, Houston, or Corpus Christi please let us know :-)
65266	2386589	9.0	10.0	25819186	Kabir was a great host! I didn't get to meet him because he was out of town, but he was great with communication and very accommodating with getting us the key and checking in and checking out. Along with some brochures for the city, he even left us a cute welcome basket telling us to enjoy our stay! His apartment was in a great location too! A close enough walk to some pretty great bars and restaurants but on a pretty quiet street. Overall, my friends and I loved his place!! I would definitely recommend staying here! 
65267	2386589	9.0	10.0	26091375	Our stay at Kabir's place couldn't have gone more smoothly. He was very helpful and readily available via email to answer any questions. Great location and a very cozy apartment!
65268	2386589	9.0	10.0	27109782	Kabir's place was lovely. The location was great, very close to shops and restaurants we could walk to. The bedroom is on an inner wall so it was nice and quiet in comparison. He left us with a nice welcome bottle of wine and maps and guidebooks for our first trip to Seattle. Check-in was a breeze and communication was prompt via e-mail and text.
65269	2386589	9.0	10.0	27353467	Kabir was very attentive and communicative from the start. He got in touch right away to coordinate logistics and answer any questions, and stayed available throughout our stay. The apartment itself was in a prime location, with lots of light and an impressive view of Seattle and the space needle. We had room to spread out and relax. The building was quiet and removed, so it was easy to sleep there. The kitchen was pretty well stocked, except no kettle and no way to make coffee. Overall, we had a great stay and would stay at Kabir's again in the future. 
65270	2386589	9.0	10.0	27483896	Kabir's apartment is located in the heart of Capitol Hill, convenient to great restaurants and bars. It was a perfect match for us (rural Alaskans on a short vacation in the city). The place itself is warm and functional, with a surprisingly large living space. We enjoyed soaking up the afternoon sun and listening to music on the couch. The bedroom's got exposed brick and a cozy bed, but we were missing a top sheet and overheated a little. Worth bringing your own. The towels and other linens that Kabir provided were excellent. We never saw him during our stay, but his instructions on accessing the apartment - and little signs posted throughout the place - were perfectly clear. Kabir was easy to reach on messenger and overall, a fantastic host. 
65271	2386589	9.0	10.0	27664924	Kabir's apartment was perfect! Great location and he was incredibly helpful during the whole process. I highly recommend a stay here. Thanks, Kabir! 
65272	2386589	9.0	10.0	27963605	Kabir was a great host! Very attentive and communicative. The place was lovely!
65273	2386589	9.0	10.0	28589315	Great host, nice apartment, fantastic location! Check in was a breeze and we had everything we needed for a great stay in Seattle! Thanks again Kabir! 
65274	2386589	9.0	10.0	28669765	Kabir was an excellent host! It was easy to communicate with him during our stay. He left us snacks and drinks which was appreciated after a long road trip. His apartment is walking distance from coffee shops, restaurants, and bars. Overall, my friends and I enjoyed the stay. Highly recommend his apartment!  
65275	2386589	9.0	10.0	29053645	Kabir was a wonderful host! He left us a nice note with snacks and wine upon our arrival, and everything about this stay was perfect. Kabir's place was within walking distance to everything, checking in/out was a breeze, and he was so quick to communicate and share any info that we needed. Looking forward to renting with him again for future Seattle visits!
65276	2386589	9.0	10.0	29342558	Kabir was a great host! Great communication and detailed instructions. The place was neat and tidy, in a great location. 
65277	2386589	9.0	10.0	29925503	Kabir made us feel very welcome and checked in with us to make sure that we had everything we needed. The apartment was comfortable and clean and the location was right in the middle of where we wanted to be.
65278	2386589	9.0	10.0	33375816	We had a great stay in Kabir's apartment! It was perfectly located in a fun neighborhood with a quick and easy walk to downtown. He was incredibly accommodating and welcoming, and if I ever go back to Seattle I would love to stay here again. Thanks Kabir! 
65279	2386589	9.0	10.0	33825326	Kabir was a great host. Upon reservation, his response was very timely and friendly. He did not make me second guess my decision at all. Kabir left great checking in/out instructions and spot on about his complex/neighborhood. I flew into Seattle about 11pm and arrived at his home near midnight and he was out of town so we were unable to meet. Despite this, he provided me instructions that were very thorough. His home was a great place to stay and was in the heart of Capitol Hill - only walking distances from every major tourist hot spot. I highly recommend doing business with Kabir as he has done a great job being a host.
65280	2386589	9.0	10.0	34499175	Kabir was very hospitable and friendly.  He responded very quickly to any questions that we had, and made us feel very welcome.  It was a very good first impression of Airbnb.
65281	2386589	9.0	10.0	35295043	Great, cozy apartment. Perfect for a shot or long stay in Seattle. Amazing walkability in the neighborhood, especially for first timers to the city. Would gladly stay again next time I am in Seattle. Kabir was super flexible to our arrival time and accessibility to him and to the apartment was easy. And just as a general rule or principle, any apartment adjoining a used bookstore is worth a visit.
65282	2386589	9.0	10.0	35660613	A great apartment in a great location. We were able to walk to everything and have a comfortable space to return to after a long day. Kabir was extremely helpful and accommodating. 
65283	2386589	9.0	10.0	35819242	Kabir's place was great! As described, in a solid location in easy walking distance to everything you need, and comfortable. The bed was comfy and the shower had good water pressure (I like these things!). Kabir couldn't have been more welcoming or responsive to messages. He was out of town so we didn't get to meet him, but his instructions were clear and getting in and out was a piece of cake. Would definitely recommend renting from him!
65284	2386589	9.0	10.0	37357846	My boyfriend and I greatly enjoyed our stay at Kabir's for the 4th. The apartment was in a great neighborhood & in reasonable walking distance from all the main sights in Seattle.  Key pick-up and communication was a breeze, and the apartment has a charming character.
65285	2386589	9.0	10.0	39979955	Great place!! Walking distance to pike place and to a lot of great restaurants and bars. Kabir also communicated well and made sure everything was good with us! If I'm back in Seattle I will definitely try to airbnb here again!
65286	2386589	9.0	10.0	45952298	Kabir's place was great for me and my girlfriend for a long weekend in Seattle. Neighborhood was great and a nice walk into downtown. Kabir's apartment is nice, clean, and had everything we needed for a great trip. We would definitely consider staying here again! 
65287	2386589	9.0	10.0	50481649	Really nice flat in an awesome location.  Kabir is an excellent host - great communicator and extremely accommodating.  I'd definitely stay here again - highly recommended!  
65288	2386589	9.0	10.0	54898467	Great apartment in a great location. View of the space needle from the window. Quick replies and no issues whatsoever. Highly recommended.
65289	2386589	9.0	10.0	55215941	Kabir's apartment is very comfortable. It was a great place to kick back  between our visits to family and friends, and it is in a good location for exploring Capital Hill.
65290	2386589	9.0	10.0	56005907	Kabir's place was perfect. It was clean and very comfortable. Great neighbourhood!!! Would definitely stay here again. Thanks for the hospitality Kabir! 
65291	2386589	9.0	10.0	57810426	Kabir's place was warm, welcoming, and everything we could need for the three of us. The location can't be beat - near all of the bars, groceries, and restaurants. And there's even a view of the Space Needle! Worked perfectly for us. Bonus: parking is free on Sundays on the street. 
66447	4127196	10.0	10.0	37657345	"It is a lovely home with a nice outdoor area to sit and enjoy the fresh air. There is plenty of street parking available around the home. The location is convenient to get downtown or to Shilshole or the north end. Lots of great hole-in-the-wall restaurants in the area as well as larger establishments. 

The basement area has 1 bedroom with a soft queen bed with a curtain dividing it from the living area. There is a fun air hockey table, a daybed, couch, table, 3/4 bathroom (shower, toilet, sink) and a washer and dryer. There is also a microwave and small refrigerator. 

Corbin and her family are very friendly and accommodating to their guests. They pretty much gave us keys and left us alone.  We were there at the height of an unusually hot and humid summer leaving the basement on the damp side. A de-humidifier would help the basement in general.  There are ultrasonic pest units plugged into the walls, but Seattle has a lot of bugs and being a basement space, you can expect to find spiders and pillbugs. Nothing horrifying, but just keep that in mind if you are not used to that. 

Our stay was quiet, comfortable and convenient. We would definitely stay there again if we returned to the same area. "
66448	4127196	10.0	10.0	38728337	"Corbin (and family) made us feel very welcome and made arrival easy. Very helpful and generous with easy access to all facilities listed in the description. The place was very comfortable and certainly lived up to expectation. The outdoor decking was a fine spot for a quiet drink and a read. Location was excellent, Ballard is a great neighbourhood to explore and access to Seattle centre was straight forward.
"
66449	4127196	10.0	10.0	41082964	Corbin made us feel very welcome! She was warm, easy going and gave us good advice about what to do in Seattle. Although Ballard is not in the center of the city, it is a great neighborhood to explore. 
66450	4127196	10.0	10.0	44351222	This was my first AirBnB experience and all went very smoothly. Corbin was a kind and welcoming host, and very responsive in our communication. The space was comfortable, had everything we needed and was in a prime location for exploring Ballard/North Seattle.
67104	6690388	10.0	10.0	36591956	I enjoyed my time at the cottage very much! It was super cozy and private and had everything we needed including a good array of books and movies to keep you entertained in the evenings. Having a parking space right out front was very convenient. Diann was so helpful and checked in on our first day via text to make sure we were happy but otherwise let us see to ourselves. My boyfriend left his nalgene on the counter and she graciously offered to mail it back to him!  So kind. I would definitely recommend this space to anyone visiting Seattle. I was worried not having an air conditioner would be problematic as it was a very warm weekend while we were visiting but the cottage got a very nice cool breeze with the windows open and it wasn't an issue at all. Excellent space!
67105	6690388	10.0	10.0	37680049	I loved the cozy cottage and the great backyard. Diann provided everything we needed like soap, shampoo, towels and even great coffee beans. The location is central to everything and you even get a private parking space. Highly recommend!
67106	6690388	10.0	10.0	39044007	"The cottage was so nice! Diann knew we were coming in late after a day of hiking and told us where we could go to get beer and wine nearby. She made it very easy to arrive late as well, since there is keyless entry we didn't have to bother her at all arriving so late, she simply gave us the entry code by email. And when we arrived, she left us a little note hoping we had a great day of hiking! 

Many places in Seattle don't have air conditioning, but this cottage had a fantastic unit that was perfect for the hot weekend in Seattle! "
67107	6690388	10.0	10.0	42857945	"I spent almost a month at Diann’s place, and I really enjoyed my stay.  Diann was a great host and was really responsive and helpful.  The cottage was very clean, quiet and well-stocked, and it felt like home.  It was hot several days during my stay, but the air conditioner kept the place cool and comfortable, and it was nice sitting on the patio in the evenings.  The cottage is within walking distance of a bus line to downtown Seattle and is a short drive to shops and restaurants and the Burke-Gilman trail.  I would definitely stay here again.  
"
67108	6690388	10.0	10.0	45101172	My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay at this pleasant cottage. It was a convenient bus trip from downtown, and its separation allowed us to enjoy comfort and quiet in the evenings. Diann was very welcoming and was very helpful. The cottage was beautiful and had all of the amenities that we needed, and the neighborhood seemed very pleasant. Overall, we had a great vacation!
67109	6690388	10.0	10.0	46134695	"Indeed a very cheerfel, quiet cottage.   A very warm and inviting cabin in a neighborhood, but had a feeling of being in a cabin in the woods.  Beautiful landscaping and peaceful, quiet surroundings.  The cabin was very clean, charming and cozy inside, stocked with  essentials and amenities.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  My host was very helpful in helping me plan my trip and was available for any questions if need be.   It was a very nice retreat in a safe neighborhood and I hope to return next year.
Thank you Diann for all your help !!
"
67110	6690388	10.0	10.0	47172765	Great quite place to stay in Seattle, only a 10-15 minute drive to the city center. Diann is helpful and even left her personal iron and iron board for us to use. We also really enjoyed the little back patio. 
67111	6690388	10.0	10.0	47586817	I LOVED STAYING IN THIS COTTAGE!  I actually live in Seattle, and have been experiencing neighborly problems, so I came to this private oasis for several days.  SOO COMFY!  Everything one could need is right there for you!  I have chronic pain and fibromyalgia; I found the pillows, bed, chairs and even carpet to be so delightfully healing!  The outside is adorable.  It is easy and close to get to wherever you may need to in Seattle.  I definitely recommend it, for those interested in an all-in-one home,  for a stay. I hope to have the opportunity to stay here again.  :)
67112	6690388	10.0	10.0	48331457	We were a little nervous with our late arrival so we were relieved Diann has such a great plan for key access!  She has hosting down to an intuitive science.  As a fellow Airbnb host, I never thought I would say this but I have Host envy!!  Not only was this cottage as cute as can be, it also has the fresh clean feeling of a brand new hotel.  It’s exactly as described but even better Diann gets AAA score for taking her hosting responsibilities to a new level.  So many wonderful touches made the stay comfortable and the process effortless before, during and after the stay.  She knew what we needed before we had to ask.  Details on the driving instructions, where to park, wifi info, code to the key access, why my phone didn’t charge in the outlet (note to self, flip the switch;) everything.  If you have a question, chances are you have the answer already.  We were perfectly informed and never had to bother Diann for anything!  Will definitely stay here for our next Seattle visit.
67113	6690388	10.0	10.0	48796708	Diann's cottage and communication were both fantastic. My husband and I were completely comfortable in this cute and well-decorated space. Full kitchen and even coffee and tea provided- they definitely thought of everything.
67114	6690388	10.0	10.0	52286790	Great tiny home!   Perfectly comfortable, welcoming and really stylish and charming.  The  was well stocked with everything you could think of and the entire place was incredibly comfortable.   I really enjoyed my stay, it was sublime!
67115	6690388	10.0	10.0	52995502	Everything in the description and directions was very accurate. The cottage is super cozy and very well located for us as we were in between Edmonds and Seattle a lot. About a 10 minute drive to Pikes Place Market. Very easy to get in when checking in. My husband and I found it perfect and had a lovely weekend away! 
67116	6690388	10.0	10.0	53693388	Just as described.  Great location great host and great value.  Will stay here again if in the Seattle area.  Thanks Diann.
67117	6690388	10.0	10.0	54135560	This little cottage was perfect for a long weekend getaway. My parents and I arrived pretty late but the pass code entrance made this super easy and convenient. Especially since we did not have to share a key!  This was a good amount of space for three people. Any more would have been too crowded. But the three of us fit very comfortably. Diann was extremely accommodating and was available to help with whatever we needed. The neighborhood was awesome. I was able to run and hike on wooded trails between houses. Very cool area overall. I definitely recommend this cottage!
67118	6690388	10.0	10.0	55123420	"Staying in this cottage was a lovely experience! My parents were very comfortable, and loved the fully stocked kitchen and easy access to everywhere they needed to be while in town. Everything was comfortable, and the host was really sweet and very responsive any time questions came up.

Thank you for a great experience, we'll be calling again!"
67119	6690388	10.0	10.0	56856385	"We felt at home as soon as we walked in the cottage. The neighborhood was quiet just as described in the listing. It felt like a small lake or beach community. We were impressed with the attention to detail provided both the interior and exterior of this cottage. 
Diann and Cathy were  very polite, kind and helpful. As in any relationship communication is key. "
67411	3861673	10.0	10.0	18603364	"Debbie is a great host! She and her son greeted me and showed me to the separate room behind the house. Their place was easy to find and in a nice, quiet neighborhood. This detached room rental was a great option for me as I knew I would be returning late and did not want to disturb anyone. I could easily go around back at the end of the night with the handy flash light key chain that held the room key. 

I could tell right away that Debbie put a lot of thought into the room making sure that her guests had everything they could possibly need. The bed and pillows were very comfortable providing the good night's sleep I needed for the next day. 

Also, I was able to park right in front of the house on the street which is always a plus in Seattle.

I appreciate the time and thought Debbie put into this rental to make it a comfortable respite from your busy day in the city. I will certainly check with Debbie first the next time I need accommodations in Seattle."
67412	3861673	10.0	10.0	18611926	"Debbie has gone the extra long miles to make us feel comfortable and at ease. This was my first experience with air B and B and I must say, I did not expect such exceptional professionalism and personal care. With hosts like this, there is no point looking at hotels. 
I will be back here again and encourage anyone to try this brilliant spot!!! 
A+++ "
67413	3861673	10.0	10.0	18691796	My daughter and I loved your detached room.  We felt like that we stayed at star 5 hotel. Debbie (host) is so friendly with my girl.  She described in Airbnb is EXACT.  She is very honesty.
67414	3861673	10.0	10.0	18847010	"The stay here was absolutely perfect and far exceeded expectations. Debbie was very friendly and helpful suggesting local places to visit. The area was quiet and safe, while easy to get to downtown by car.

The room was exceptionally clean and well stocked with towels, soaps, and snacks. The fresh ground coffee for the French press was especially a nice touch.

Would highly recommend for staying in the Seattle area."
67415	3861673	10.0	10.0	18966449	"Debbie has converted a backyard flat into a great little Airbnb space that has all the amenities you would expect to find in a hotel room. The flat has nice, new fittings, space to unpack and my partner and I also appreciated the privacy that the flat offered.

Debbie was a great host -- very warm and welcoming, and interested in making our stay as comfortable as possible. She also makes amazing muffins!"
67416	3861673	10.0	10.0	19166673	"The location was perfect for us -- a nice quiet neighborhood near the family member we were in town to visit.
Debbie, our hostess, was a delight. She was friendly, helpful and well organized. We were provided with great instructions for locating the place and it was exactly as described, a private bedroom and bath cottage in the rear of Debbie's home. The room was cosy, spotlessly clean and comfortable.
We hope to find Debbie's accommodations available when we make a return visit to Ballard."
67417	3861673	10.0	10.0	19246663	My husband and I stayed in Debbie's detached guest suite for our anniversary weekend. The room is fantastic. It's even better than it looks from the pictures, and it's immaculately clean. There were several sweet, homey touches (homemade muffins, mints on the nightstand, shower supplies included, etc.). The weekend was hot, but the room stayed cool. The location is perfect - close to everything delightful in Ballard, including fabulous food (Eat at Delancey and Essex). I will stay in this guest suite next time I'm in Seattle, for sure.
67418	3861673	10.0	10.0	19632237	"It is Suitable room that comfortably fit 2 people. Everything are super clean as ""Five Star Hotels"" The bed was comfortable. Debbie was very kind and friendly.

67419	3861673	10.0	10.0	20039901	"Debbie's space is amazing. It is inviting, comfortable, stylish, and perfectly located. We were just a few minutes from UW, a short walk from downtown Ballard (my favorite neighborhood in Seattle!), and a short drive from Downtown/City Center. 
Debbie provided everything and more we could have needed to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Homemade muffins, everything we needed for coffee & tea in the morning, toiletries, and an incredibly comfortable bed. 
The room was beautiful as well... Plenty of natural light, roomy bathroom, and closet! I loves that the room was separate from the house which gave us as much privacy as we wanted, but still allowed us to interact with our host - who is so sweet and welcoming! 
I hope to stay here again and highly HIGHLY recommend it!"
67420	3861673	10.0	10.0	20434886	" I thoroughly enjoyed my weekend stay at Debbie's private guest studio. The room was beautiful, immaculately clean, very private (with its own entrance) and located in a lovely and quiet neighbourhood. The bed was comfy and everything needed was provided. Debbie was a very attentive host and even gave me a car ride to my workshop on Sunday morning. Highly recommended! 
"
67421	3861673	10.0	10.0	20593762	"Debbie was a truly wonderful host! I needed a last minute place to sleep before starting my long road trip back to Florida and I found her place and contacted her, and even though I contacted her in the late evening, she got back to me super fast and was able to accommodate me. She was extremely friendly and very helpful with directions and whatnot. When I arrived she showed me the place behind hee house - it was super clean & welcoming and she had a little binder with information & the internet code, dishware/utensils, a little fridge and everything one could possibly need for a comfortable, short stay. The place is quiet and cozy. She was so sweet, even made blueberry muffins to take with me for my trip - and they were yum! :)

Definitely recommend this place to anyone! 5 stars for sure."

The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom was perfect, and the extras (flat screen tv with cable, coffee, tea, snacks) made the stay even better. I only wish I had more time in Seattle to stay in the room. I will definitely stay here again. Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Debbie, but she made me feel very welcome and provided everything I needed for my time in Seattle. 
67424	3861673	10.0	10.0	20867586	This was my first time doing Airbnb and it was a great experience. Debbie's house is gorgeous and the guest house is perfect! The location is also great.

67428	3861673	10.0	10.0	21359658	Debbie was super helpful and gracious, I needed to print out my boarding pass and luggage receipts and she did everything to make that happen. I had to leave fairly early and Debbie was so sweet about wanting to make sure that I had something for breakfast. The Neighborhood was very quaint, house is located just across from a school which was very quiet from the private room in the backyard. Wish I had more time in Seattle, I'll be back with my husband next time. :) Thank you Debbie your private room is just perfect, super clean and inviting. 
67429	3861673	10.0	10.0	21667803	Debbie's guest room was awesome. She is friendly and greeted us with a warm smile often. The bed was very comfortable. The coffee was delicious. The bathroom was clean. The neighborhood was adorable and there was plenty of parking in front of the house. She made muffins for us the first morning and left a few snacks in the fridge. With the guest room being detached, we had plenty of privacy and slept wonderfully. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you, Debbie!

very clean, with plenty of room.  we will be back."
67431	3861673	10.0	10.0	21758603	Debbie's guestroom was the perfect place to stay on my trip to Seattle. The detached studio had everything I needed -- from shampoo to coffee and half n' half for the morning -- and even chocolates on the bedside table with a hand-written note. Debbie was a fabulous host with excellent communication and super-organized directions. These little details make all the difference. I highly recommend staying at her studio in Ballard. 
67432	3861673	10.0	10.0	21965764	"Debbie was an amazing and thoughtful host! You can tell she is an experienced AirBnB host through the communication before and during your stay. 

Her description of the place was as promised and we were extremely satisfied with our stay at Debbie's. It was relatively easy to navigate into downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods. Don't forget to try Paseo :]

I would definitely recommend Debbie to others and would rebook in the future!"
67433	3861673	10.0	10.0	22090623	I was very blessed to find such an oasis. So much personal touch meant all the world. From homemade sweets to individualized messages and clarifies, I could not have asked for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience. I hope to cross paths with Debbie again, and I think this kind of legendary hosting should be the standard. 
67434	3861673	10.0	10.0	22695493	"Staying at Debbie's was a fantastic experience! She was very helpful in the planning of our trip (our first to Seattle) and checking in on us occasionally to see if we needed anything. The room was as pictured, super clean and inviting. The fridge was stocked with a few snacks, and she provided scones for us the morning after we arrived (plus fresh half-n-half and warm muffins a few days into our trip!).  Personalized notes, baked goods and a genuineness about her showed that she truly enjoyed hosting us. She has set the bar high for other Airbnb hosts!

Her immediate neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant. We used the buses and rented a car from the rental place a few blocks down the street. No problems with either!

I would highly recommend staying with Debbie. If/when I return to Seattle, I plan to stay with her again!"
67435	3861673	10.0	10.0	22746078	Clean, comfortable, warm with amenities like homemade scones on doorstep in the morning. Bathroom is spotless with a tub for soaking away travel soreness. We felt very welcomed. The room is small, so great for 1 person or 2 who get along well. I recommend.
67436	3861673	10.0	10.0	22785895	Debbie was amazing! Her guest room was the perfect space, we honestly didn't want to leave. Debbie's attention to detail is honestly unmatched in our experience. She gave us great recommendations on where to eat and hang out. We hope we get the chance to go to Seattle again, and if we do we'll try our hardest to stay with her. She even had some baked goods for us in the morning! Do yourself a favor and stay here, it might be your best airbnb experience, it was ours. 
67437	3861673	10.0	10.0	22819733	The cottage was clean, comfortable, and had everything you need including shampoo and conditioner. It felt as if the floors were heated and it was amazing.
67438	3861673	10.0	10.0	22910899	Debbie was promptly communicative, welcoming, and accommodating.  Her space is lovely, well-built, cozy, comfortable, private, and spotless.  Her personal touches, like in-room french-press coffee and muffins in the fridge, were much-appreciated!  The neighborhood is quiet with easy access to restaurants and waterfront fun.  We loved it.  Highly recommended!    
67439	3861673	10.0	10.0	23320515	"Debbie was a fabulous host from the very first interaction.  Her warmth was evident even by email!  She made check-in a breeze, and her guest book made getting settled into the space and connected to the WiFi really easy.  She respected my privacy, but was always a text away if I needed anything.  The brief chats that we had were nice.  She's obviously a caring person who is interested in meeting new people and having new experiences.

The space was exactly as shown and described, and very comfortable.  Debbie has obviously put a lot of thought into making her guests comfortable.  Everything was clean and tidy, the hair dryer had umpf, the water pressure was good, etc.  The bamboo linens were so soft I'm considering buying some for home.  She brought generous (double) portions of fresh baked breakfast items (scones, muffins, quick bread) every other day, with generous pats of butter.  The coffee from Stump Town was delicious (half and half in the fridge).  The system for having her clean the dishes in the main house worked smoothly.  

I was in town to visit family, and couldn't stay with them due to my cat allergy.  This was the perfect set up!  I was close to my family, and had a comfy cozy retreat to return to after being out and about all day.  I would definitely stay with Debbie again, and my family is looking forward to recommending her space to other visitors."
67440	3861673	10.0	10.0	23407464	We had a fantastic stay here! The room was clean and inviting and stocked with snacks, coffee, and baked goods. In a cute area of Ballard. Our interaction with Debbie was brief since we were not at the room much, but she was extremely friendly and welcoming. We would definitely stay here again! 
67441	3861673	10.0	10.0	23507740	Debbie's location in Ballard was fantastic!  Clean, high-quality, and cozy. The radiant heating floors are a nice touch in the cold months. A great spot that I'd try to stay at again if I'm back in Seattle. 
67442	3861673	10.0	10.0	23595200	We felt completely at home at Debbie's space. It was warm, clean, comfortable and perfect for what we needed. I had just had hip replacement surgery and wasn't able to go up the stairs in my own home. We checked in the day I was released from the hospital. I instantly fell asleep in the cozy bed and I am certain it was helpful on my road to recovery. The delicious scones made us feel pampered. Thank you. We will recommend your spot for family members who are visiting. It will be perfect for my dad when he comes to town. 
67443	3861673	10.0	10.0	23790489	Debbie's detached room was amazing! She was a great host, super thoughtful, and a plus that she made really good baked goods in advance that lasted us for every morning. Her communication was always timely and professional. I loved how thoughtful she was around hospitality. There was a binder filled with information that really helped my Husband and I navigate our way through suggested restaurants, coffee, and other hangout spots in Ballard. Her place is super clean and she stocks snacks such as: delicious coffee, french press, directions on how to use french press, an electric kettle, dishes, mugs, utensils, half in half in her mini fridge, orange juice, cliff bars, mandarin cuties, tea, an umbrella, books, beach towels, extra towels… All these personal touches made the stay that much more welcoming. The space was just right for two people. This was my first experience in an Airbnb and she's set the bar pretty high. My Husband and I plan on coming back to Seattle on a yearly basis and we would definitely stay here again! Thanks for being a blessing to our trip in Seattle.
67444	3861673	10.0	10.0	23870703	"Debbie was very thorough in communicating about directions, contact information and everything we needed. She was a wonderful host. We couldn't have asked for anyone nicer/accomodating.
For some reason, the directions stated put us off course a bit, but we did find our way easy enough. Thanks for the delicious scones!! Also your kindness in sending back my iPhone charger..sorry about that!"
67445	3861673	10.0	10.0	23945497	Debbie was an amazing host! She was extremely approachable, welcoming, and friendly. Her warm muffins in the morning were delicious!

I would highly recommend staying at Debbie's place!
67446	3861673	10.0	10.0	24103227	The room was very nice and as advertised. Very quiet neighborhood. Easy access and no hassles at all. Close to downtown. Debbie greeted me and texted almost daily to see if everything was OK. Baked goods (Muffins) on arrival and cookies mid-week were a treat.
67447	3861673	10.0	10.0	24263962	We absolutely loved staying at Debbie's Airbnb in Ballard. The unit was perfect for our needs. It's new, modern, very clean and cute. Not to mention, she provided the makings for fresh french press coffee, which went well with the incredible baked items that she left on our front doorstep two of the mornings we were there. Debbie was really great, friendly, helpful. She provided suggestions for places to eat and things to see. Ballard is a great Seattle neighborhood and her place was the perfect location to visit our relatives in Ballard and also take in other nearby neighborhoods, such as Fremont as well as downtown Seattle. We just can't say enough how much we enjoyed our experience. We'll stay there again if it's available the next time we're in town.
67448	3861673	10.0	10.0	24365152	This place was great!  DELICIOUS baked goods in the mornings, awesome coffee, a super comfy bed and everything else we could have wanted.  Thanks Debbie!
67449	3861673	10.0	10.0	24564693	It was a perfect stay at Debbie's guest suite. It is located in a beautiful neighbourhood, and close to a lovely area to shop/dine/explore. Debbie was so accommodating, with many tips on how to enjoy our suite, as well as information on what to see during our stay in Ballard/Seattle. The suite itself is beautiful- very comfortable bed, great amenities, and a very functional space. The in-floor heating and the freshly baked morning scones were a treat. We look forward to staying here again!
67450	3861673	10.0	10.0	25027387	"We absolutely LOVED our stay at Debbie's. The room itself is just gorgeous! It is immaculate, cozy and very welcoming - you feel right at home immediately. 

We could not recommend staying at Debbie's more highly. She is such a lovely host who takes great care of her guests. The coffee, hot chocolate plus home baked goods, are the little extras that make you feel at home. 

The neighbourhood is fantastic. So quiet yet only a short walk away there is so much to discover including amazing restaurants/cafés, coffee (which we loved!) local breweries, boutiques and so much more. 

Debbie provided so many great hints on what to see in Seattle and the local neighbourhood of Ballard. We wish we could have stayed longer. It's hosts like Debbie that make the air bnb experience that much more enjoyable. We will be back! "
67451	3861673	10.0	10.0	25170120	"Debbie was such a kind and generous host. I can't imagine having a better BNB experience in Seattle.

Her home in Ballard is situated in a very nice, quiet neighborhood right across a small school - which made the area feel a lot safer. Her home is complete with everything you will need for a short stay: clean bedding, sets of towels, toiletries, mini fridge, kettle, coffee press, plates and bowls, utensils and more. We had privacy, felt extremely comfortable and right at home. The place was impeccably clean and tidy too!

Debbie baked the most delicious homemade scones I have ever had in my life, and her blueberry muffins are divine. We love Debbie and would definitely stay at her home again when we go back to Seattle."
67452	3861673	10.0	10.0	25353880	*Disclaimer* - we didn't stay here, we rented the room for my sister who was in town visiting. However, we spent time in the room and met Debbie as well. The room was spotless, the bed very comfortable, the scones and other treats delicious and the radiant heat floors a nice touch. Debbie was kind and super easy to communicate with and even took extra care to make sure her dogs weren't around the yard when my sister was at the room (she's allergic). The neighborhood is adorable, safe, and close to some fantastic restaurants. We'll definitely be renting the room again for future visiting guests!
67453	3861673	10.0	10.0	25482266	There is so much goodness to Debbie.  In her cottage she has created an experience that you just don't get in a hotel: warm blueberry muffins delivered to your door, a floor that is warm to the foot makes the space even more cozy, a fridge with apples, juice, granola bars, and fresh cream, plus a bookcase of interesting books and magazines, a bathroom full of provisions, hand cream by the bedside, an umbrella and a flashlight. Debbie directed us to places of interest in Seattle and was such a kind person. Our stay at her place really  added to our Seattle experience. 
67454	3861673	10.0	10.0	25542533	We really liked staying in this room. It is just as described, and we really enjoyed the privacy and little added touches, like fresh tea and coffee with cream and scones in the refrigerator. Debbie welcomed us after we had arrived, and was very nice. The room is clean, the bed is comfy, and it is just the right amount of space for two people. The neighborhood is so beautiful, I wish we could have spent more time in Ballard!
67455	3861673	10.0	10.0	25644596	Really nice clean space with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Debbie was an excellent host.
67456	3861673	10.0	10.0	25719586	I am not sure if my trip was for business or a vacation !  Debbie's detached room in Ballard is more like your own private bungalow !!  It was spotless, well appointed and really comfortable.  The bed was fantastic, the towels were luxurious and the French press let me make my coffee just the way I like it.  The neighborhood was just as advertised...quiet, safe and plenty of parking.  Debbie's suggestions for local restaurants were outstanding.  Can't wait to visit again.
67457	3861673	10.0	10.0	25874521	Debbie was the perfect hostess.  Her scones are awesome and the space was just perfect for us.  We were nearby our children/grandchildren and we were in a great neighborhood.  Debbie's recommendations about places for coffee, food, etc, were spot on and we really enjoyed walking to several places.  We will definitely recommend Debbie's air b&b to others traveling up this way and we hope to stay here again too.
67458	3861673	10.0	10.0	26300157	"We had a most pleasant stay at Debbie's guest suite located in a nice family neighborhood at the Ballard area. We particularly appreciated Debbie's warm welcome and her sunny personality. The room which is separate from the main house is very private and well appointed with many quality and thoughtful touches. It is rare to find a ""real"" hair dryer that will actually dry and style your hair in a hotel room but you will find one here :) along with big fluffy towels, shampoo/conditioner/liquid shower soap. The mini fridge was well stocked with apples, granola bars, juices and even cream for a relaxing cup of tea or coffee with a French press all provided. My husband and I both had a restful sleep on a very comfortable bed and woke up to some delicious home made scones. Thank you Debbie for making our first airbnb experience such a positive one. "
67459	3861673	10.0	10.0	26420007	Our stay with Debbie was wonderful! We felt right at home, almost as if we were staying with a relative. We arrived late on our first night and Debbie drove us down to 65th Ave so we could get some dinner and even offered to pick us up when we were done. When we got back she had left us cookies as well as muffins in the morning. Her place was so nice and clean we really enjoyed the Guest House. It is also in a great location since we wanted to see many breweries and visit Chuck's Hop Shop. We were able to walk to Ballard and Fremont easily, both places have great restaurants. I would definitely recommend staying at Debbie's place when you visit Seattle, it was also super easy to get to from downtown.  Debbie recommended The Dray to us which is a small tap house with excellent flat breads, we enjoyed it so much that we went back both nights while we were there. 
67460	3861673	10.0	10.0	26465688	Debbie was a sweetheart! I got lot trying to find the place and she was kind enough to help me locate the place over the phone. The cottage is tucked away in the backyard and the neighborhood is absolutely charming. Great place to go for a morning walk and take in all the beautiful craftsman era homes built in the early 1900's.  Would definitely recommend for that authentic Seattle experience with a private space to (website hidden) Debbie's Magdalena's are the type of dessert that you want to keep to yourself and not share (:
67461	3861673	10.0	10.0	26531208	"Best AirbnB stay ever. Ever.
Debbie was a perfect host- provided all pertinent info ahead of time, responded quickly to our questions and was willing to accommodate our schedule.
Once we arrived, we were blown away how clean, comfortable and private the guest was. Debbie thought of every detail- down to a lovely welcome note. 
We will definitely stay here any one we're in Seattle."
67462	3861673	10.0	10.0	26691869	Eric and I both loved Ballard! It was a great place to stay in Seattle. Debbie had great suggestions on things to do and where to eat. We stopped by Golden Gardens and ate pizza at Dulancey, both of which we would recommend. Debbie was a great communicator and we loved the muffins. Thank you again for having us! Hopefully we will be back in Seattle sooner than later.
67463	3861673	10.0	10.0	26746955	Debbie's place is amazing! It looks and feels just like the photos.

67464	3861673	10.0	10.0	26863738	"Debbie's guest house was the nicest room we've ever stayed in- airbnb, hotel, or otherwise. Absolutely recommended for anyone staying in the area. It's a quick drive to central Seattle, located in a beautiful neighborhood, and provided all the qualities of the ""ideal"" place to stay. Debbie provided a binder full of answers to every question we could've had and recommendations of places to go nearby. Coffee and snacks were included, along with the perfect balance of privacy and accessibility. Thank you so much for letting us stay in your fantastic home Debbie, couldn't have asked for a nicer visit anywhere. I would pay money to be able to give her 6 stars."

I notice the room looked much better in person than the pictures. She left notes for everything you could ever wonder. Sweet welcome notes. I loved that! She stocked the fridge with yummy goodies, the place was fresh clean and airy, color scheme perfect! Her homemade scones in the morning. Where to die for!!! It was nice not to have to leave the room for breakfast. The lace has great energy! I highly recommend it!!
67467	3861673	10.0	10.0	27485948	Debbie is an awesome host and we had a wonderful experience at her place. As a fellow Airbnb host, I truly appreciated all of the little things that made it a great experience. 
67468	3861673	10.0	10.0	27534888	Debbie's place was great. Could not have asked for a more welcoming host. Located really close to the hip Ballard strip where there are lots of great places to eat, drink and shop. If I'm back in Seattle I definitely would like to stay with Debbie :) 
67469	3861673	10.0	10.0	27752170	Our stay with Debbie was a very short one but it was certainly memorable. The room is located behind Debbie's beautiful Ballard home in a very nice back yard. The room was impeccable, the mattress was incredibly comfy and the bathroom was very clean. Debbie left out snacks and coffee, which we definitely enjoyed. We had to leave very early the next morning and unfortunately missed out on her famous scones. We will definitely stay with her again on our next visit to Seattle.
67470	3861673	10.0	10.0	27831372	Debbie made us feel welcome even prior to our arrival. She consistently communicated with us and provided suggestions before we even made it to Seattle.

67472	3861673	10.0	10.0	28100183	It was an amazing experience! Matthew and I both loved the location. It was quite and relaxing, so many personal touches to the room. It felt like it was our own private apt! From personal note left for us and treats, to scones in the morning, and everything was as seen in the photos too! Easy access to downtown and meeting up with friends. We will stay here anytime it's open while in Seattle! So welcoming, it felt seeing friend! Having wifi and being able to work as needed also was great. I have not enough praise for the hospitality!
67473	3861673	10.0	10.0	28141688	This was my first time using air bnb and what a wonderful first time experience!

67477	3861673	10.0	10.0	29095480	Debbie made me, my husband and 10 month-old son feel welcome as soon as we arrived. She baked us scones from scratch for our first morning there, suggested lots of ideas for places to visit and neighborhoods to explore, and was happy to answer any questions we had. The rental is in a lovely neighborhood that was a couple blocks away from the busier streets and was very quiet. We loved staying here and would gladly stay here again. The rental is small, very clean, and nicely decorated. It's the perfect space for one or two travelers, but also worked out great for us having our baby with us. 
67478	3861673	10.0	10.0	29179668	This was a great location to our daughter, a very private room, clean and comfortable. We will definitely try to stay here again, Great coffee and scones in the morning. Debbie was friendly and communicated well. Thanks for a great experience.

67481	3861673	10.0	10.0	29648282	Loved our stay at Debbie's, it was our first time using Airbnb and my first time to Seattle. We wanted to stay somewhere close to UW and this was about 15-20 minutes away which worked great. The neighborhood was sweet, the room is a seperate little getaway behind the house sitting in the gorgeous backyard. We appreciated the clean, modern cute room and all the necessary amenities you need, including coffee & tea, and lots of other things. Wish we could of stayed longer than just one night and enjoy a meal in the backyard or seen more of the area, but had a tight schedule. Thank you for a great first experience!
67482	3861673	10.0	10.0	29735890	Debbie greeted us personally and made sure that we had everything we needed. The description of the 'cottage' was very accurate.

Our flight  later than expected, and Debbie was very flexible for us to arrive when we were ready. The private entrance was convenient and didn't make us feel like we were intruding. Debbie also sent us a well rounded instructions list, so there wasn't any guess work getting situated. 

The place is awesome, its a small converted room, but the bed was awesomely comfortable. There's a TV, plenty of lighting, fantastically smelling amenities in the bathroom, and a mini-fridge with snacks, and coffee. Seriously? This is the best of a BnB and a hotel room, she even has that little luggage holder in there.

In the morning, she greeted me and gave me a good tip on where to go on a morning run in the neighborhood, and she had handmade scones for us in the morning. No joke, these are better than I get in more breakfast joints. She was also very nice and we got a chat for a moment on our way out in the early afternoon. 

Our only issue? We didn't stay longer with her! If all our experiences were like staying with Debbie, I would be okay with never staying in a hotel for the rest of my life. "

It is easy to access the rest of the city via public transport, though this was a problem for me for me because I had hurt my back."
67490	3861673	10.0	10.0	32897090	Debbie was a wonderful host! This was a fantastic first Airbnb experience for me. The room was lovely and very true to the photos and descriptions, but even more charming in person! Debbie's scones, coffee, suggestions on where to explore in Ballard, and overall hospitality was absolutely perfect. I'm sad I couldn't stay longer!

67496	3861673	10.0	10.0	34673232	We had a fabulous stay at Debbie's cute garden house - the place is in a great location, clean, and very comfortable. Debbie had lots of little snacks for us in the house, and even brought us home-made scones in the morning, which were delicious. Highly recommend to stay at Debbie's if you are planing a Seattle trip!
67497	3861673	10.0	10.0	34714481	Debbie did a great job of communicating -- emails, welcome letter, and greeting me at the door when I arrived. She also accommodated my request to have the room ready a little early. The room itself was perfect for my needs--and incredibly, impeccably clean. I had an amazing night of rest with the black out shades! Thank you Debbie! I would love to return on my next trip to Seattle.
67498	3861673	10.0	10.0	34833421	Everything was wonderful. Host, space and vibe were all awesome... The small things count and there were plenty, clean and inviting, well stocked and highly enjoyable place to spend the night. Thank you Debbie

67500	3861673	10.0	10.0	35060228	We had such a fabulous time in Seattle! Debbie was a fabulous host and the room is so much better than any hotel. Comfortable and has everything you could need! Such a great location (Ballard is fab!) and easy access to the city! Thank you for having us! 
67501	3861673	10.0	10.0	35217077	We really enjoyed Debbie's place! It was very clean, current, and comfortable. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, with updated homes and mature growth trees. Debbie stocked the room with lots of wonderful extras for comfort, and delivered yummy fresh baked scones in the morning to enjoy with our coffee (excellent too!). Everything we needed was there. We appreciated her friendly, brief greeting! We've stayed other places where the host camps out to gab on the doorstep when you're tired and want to settle in. She made sure everything was ready and cooled the room for us prior to arrival. :-) We will be back!
67502	3861673	10.0	10.0	35394231	This is a great, quiet neighborhood to have a rest after you're out running around Seattle like me! Perfect for one person or a couple, and being separated from the main house means you get a bit of privacy. The bed is so comfortable, and Debbie has thoughtfully provided everything that I thought I would need and more. Her scones were ridiculously good too. One of the best Airbnb places I've stayed at, and I would stay here again! 
67503	3861673	10.0	10.0	35507426	Debbie was so sweet! And her scones were delicious! The room was perfect. Private entrance with a bathroom and just enough space. There were little notes all around the room to let me know anything I should know. I will definitely be using her services again! 
67504	3861673	10.0	10.0	35666212	Debbie is a wonderful host. She was very reactive on emails/texts. We missed our flight and arrived at 4am, she was very comprehensive and reassuring. The room is just perfect and the private entrance very convenient. We parked easily in front of the house and reached Seattle downtown in 15min. We had a perfect stay.
67505	3861673	10.0	10.0	35909088	Debbie's place is wonderful and she was a great host! The room is cozy, spacious, super clean and quiet and had everything we needed- including yummy homemade scones! Debbie was very accommodating, even providing us with an iron and ironing board so we wouldn't have to wear wrinkly clothes to a wedding. The neighborhood is really close to both Green Lake and Ballard and is easy to navigate around- especially if you have a car. Highly recommend. 
67506	3861673	10.0	10.0	36205695	"The room was exactly as it appeared in Airbnb. What a gem of a place in a nice neighborhood in North Ballard. Less than 5 minutes to the D bus stop that would get you to downtown Ballard or downtown Seattle. A great place from which to explore.

And Debbie was a great host. She was very welcoming, and she even made scones for me for breakfast! All in all, it was exactly as I hoped and a great trip to Seattle."
67507	3861673	10.0	10.0	36649525	We had an enjoyable stay at Debbie's place and everything was as Debbie described.  The treat on the first morning was very welcome.  The neighbourhood was quiet and public transport was close by.
67508	3861673	10.0	10.0	36882575	Debbie was wonderful. Very accommodating and helpful. The room was clean and made us feel at home.

67513	3861673	10.0	10.0	37716698	Debbie was a phenomenal host! She left detailed notes about the room and the area which made our stay very convenient. She had even installed a portable A/C because of the unseasonably hot weather. The room felt like a hotel and was completely separated from the house. It was also located just a couple blocks to a bus line downtown.
67514	3861673	10.0	10.0	38467789	"It was awesome to have a Welcome Packet (with a chocolate) waiting for me when I checked in. I didn't get to meet Debbie but the room was very comfortable, bathroom was REALLY nice, and there was even oatmeal packets for the morning. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood is safe.

The only thing that was not superb was the A/C unit. It was very kind of Debbie to buy given the hot summer this year but it's loud and not very effective. But hey, it's better than nothing (even though it was too loud for light sleeper like me so I left it off). That being said, next time I come to Seattle to visit friends, I will DEFINITELY be asking Debbie if I can stay again."
67515	3861673	10.0	10.0	38809956	Debbie was very helpful and friendly, and the room was very private and comfortable!
67516	3861673	10.0	10.0	39032428	The room was charming, clean and notes from the host were helpful.  The host was welcoming and made the experience easy and restful.  The bed is extremely comfortable.  The location is perfect as it is close to public transportation, and yet quiet and peaceful.  The touches provided by the host were thoughtful and made the room feel very welcoming.  I highly recommend this site.  
67517	3861673	10.0	10.0	39265578	"We had a wonderful stay at Debbie’s guest bungalow! First off, my impression of Debbie began many months before arriving. I truly felt we chose the right host and home. She was always quick to respond and stay in communication with us, beginning at booking right through our stay, then through our departure.  

Debbie's home was our last stop on our PNW vacation and it was definitely the cherry on our vacation ""sundae"". We had been visiting family in Wenatchee and didn't leave their home as early as we hoped ~ then we stopped to take a hike in the mountains, which took longer than anticipated. That being said, I felt badly because we ended up arriving at Debbie's home a few hours later than anticipated. When I sent her a message to let her know, she was super easy going and still ensured we felt quite welcomed upon our arrival, despite not being home when we arrived. 

The private detached guest house is located in an adorably quaint, safe and hip neighborhood which is also a comfortable distance to Seattle and, of course, very near local and surrounding neighborhood restaurants and sights. Parking at her home was a breeze, which is hard to say about “the city”. 

The space itself was bright, modern, extremely efficient and impeccably clean…which made this neat-freak very happy. The bed was comfy and all the linens she provides are soft, smelled nice and high quality. 

Debbie has great taste in décor and we could see she also values quality and comfort. Everything you need is provided by her, from natural bathroom toiletries to wine glasses & wine opener. She even created a much appreciated, spot-on handbook of local restaurants and directions for your stay in her home! We were fortunate enough to be able to try several places on her lists and they did not disappoint. (We are a bit obsessed with The Walrus and The Carpenter now. Morsel and The Fat Hen are also a must!) 

Debbie also makes sure you have a nice cup of coffee or tea with some breakfast in your belly by providing breakfast items in the room to fix at your leisure, along with all the dishes and cups you need. One of our mornings, she baked amazing blueberry scones for us. Who knew scones could be so light and fluffy? I usually don’t eat breakfast pastries, and if I do, I only nibble a portion...but this one I devoured, much to my Hubby's shock and dismay! 

I can't say enough about how nice she is and her home is, but I'm running out of characters. I'll end with ~ it was lovely to be able to chat with her, while petting her cute doggies, the morning of our departure. We were very sad to leave but will be sure to see if we can stay with her again next time we visit. Thank you, Debbie, for an amazing experience!!!"
67518	3861673	10.0	10.0	39612253	"Oh my goodness...we cannot say enough nice things about our stay with Debbie. We arrived in the late afternoon and everything was ready and waiting for us. Everything from the shampoo to the coffee provided was top shelf. The bed was comfortable. The room was quiet and Debbie's neighborhood was charming. We ran to a Crossfit gym about 5 minutes away from the house and when we got back Debbie had freshly baked blueberry scones waiting for us. They were amazing. 

Her area of Ballard is a little bit out of the way from Seattle but easily accessible by bus or Uber. The D Line bus runs all the way up and down 15th street from basically Debbie's front door to the heart of Seattle. There are also lots of fun things to do in Ballard. The Brouwer's Cafe, a Belgian beer bar, was one of our favorite stops on our trip and was a about 7 minutes by bus or Uber. "
67519	3861673	10.0	10.0	39733291	Debby's room is private, peaceful, beautifully designed and decorated with a very comfortable bed. We will definitely try to stay here again the next time we come to Ballard. Thank you Debby!
67520	3861673	10.0	10.0	40004236	This airbnb is in a lovely residential neighborhood in Ballard. Our host Debbie was great at communicating in the days leading up to our stay. The suite is exactly what it looks like and is the perfect spot for a couple or single traveler. Debbie has thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible from shampoo, air con, luggage stands, and she graciously made us scones in the morning (which were too delicious). We will definitely stay here again!
67521	3861673	10.0	10.0	40075117	"Debbie was immediately a very warm and welcome hostess. She guided us around her property, answering a few questions and showing us the essentials we needed to come back and clean up from a long week of camping in the Pacific Northwest. Her guest house is immaculate and cozy, with lots of literature - including her own - on things to do and see around Ballard and Seattle.

Speaking of Ballard: It is a fantastic area, one that reminded us greatly of our home back in Minneapolis. Friendly people with many unique and tasty restaurants to sample. We are looking forward to a return trip in the future.

Thanks Debbie!"

Deb, our host was very welcoming and met us in person. She checked to make sure we were settled and had all expectations clearly stated for food, cleaning, and arrival/departures. She also was of great assistance when we needed ice for a medical issue. We would highly recommend this airbnb site!"
67523	3861673	10.0	10.0	41073976	This stay was just as wonderful as the other two times we've stayed here. Debbie is a super hostess and the room is very quiet, comfortable and peaceful.

67525	3861673	10.0	10.0	41924264	Debbie was very welcoming. She left notes around the house that were good reminders for us, which is helpful when traveling can be a whirlwind. She had a great booklet of information on local tourist attractions, shops, restaurants, and things to see. The room was accurately described and quite private, which was perfect for my sister and I. We would definitely recommend staying at Debbie's if you are ever in the mood to visit Seattle or surrounding areas. Thanks, Debbie!!
67526	3861673	10.0	10.0	42259280	This little cottage is consistently peaceful, relaxing, and comfortable. We've stayed here several times.  It's in a very quiet neighborhood that is convenient to public transportation.  Debbie is an excellent hostess!
67527	3861673	10.0	10.0	42654610	I had a wonderful stay at the Air B&B, hosted by Debbie.  My place was cozy, clean & very comfortable.  My host, Debbie was very sweet and kind.  My husband celebrated a birthday, while at the B&B and she made homemade scones with a candle.  Very thoughtful.  The location was very convenient to both downtown Ballard and my son's home.  A great stay... Thank you for the great hospitality.
67528	3861673	10.0	10.0	43214086	Cheerful, sweet place in a terrific location with easy parking and access- and a very friendly and accommodating hostess who clearly enjoys that role.  Concise for sure, but we like that kind of coziness.  Couldn't wish for anything more.  The privacy is such a bonus- my husband could play his ukulele first thing in the morning without worries of disturbing the household!  Like like like!!!    
67529	3861673	10.0	10.0	43395761	Debbie was very easy to communicate with and the description was very accurate. The neighborhood was a nice quite neighborhood and was just a quick drive to downtown Ballard (maybe 1.5 miles if you're walking). Debbie was in the backyard when we arrived and gave us a very welcoming greeting and even offered to make us fresh scones the next morning. The detached bedroom was private, had an a/c unit in it, full bathroom, TV, books, wi-fi, and even a handy book that Debbie made filled with nearby restaurants and things to do. 10/10 would stay here again. 
67530	3861673	10.0	10.0	43497568	Splendid little room and great value! This was perfect for our one-night stopover in Seattle. It was tastefully designed, immaculate, and stocked with high-quality essentials (such soft and plush towels!).

67534	3861673	10.0	10.0	45089274	Debbie was very organized and easy-going. She sent us email/text way in advance with all the information to keep us in the loops. The night we arrived she was out but sent us a text to let us know. Love the privacy of the detached room. Things were clean and neat. It was very simple yet very accommodating. The brochure she prepared was very detailed with recommendations from local eateries to things to see/do complete with hand-drawn directions. Debbie even offered to bake us some scones in the morning. We were very comfortable staying with Debbie and she was a nice host. I'd stay at Debbie's again when we visit Ballard/Seattle.

I enjoyed the peacefulness as it is a very quiet neighborhood.  I asked her to provide de-caf coffee as there was none, and she agreed that she would.   I would definitely rent Debbie's little house again when in Seattle, close to bus stop and walk to breakfast café.
Thank you Debbie!    Mary"
67536	3861673	10.0	10.0	45599519	Debbie was a great Host. Her cottage provides comfot and privacy. The location ideal because it is near the Sound with great views and restaurants. I would definitely recommend it!

67538	3861673	10.0	10.0	46262853	"We stayed with Deb twice since we had a ""trip within a trip"" to a wedding outside of town.  Deb was gracious about our strange schedule and when we arrived for Our Stay, Part II - we received the royal treatment all over again!  The room is a perfect for a couple and is so convenient to all things Seattle - and if you need some suggestions, Deb provides a great book for fun local places to please all types of visitors.  And bonus for us - we got homemade scones for both of our stays!!  Truly above and beyond!  "
67539	3861673	10.0	10.0	46440078	Our host, Debbie, did an excellent job of making us feel welcome, from answering all my questions quickly, to preparing warm, tasty scones the morning after our arrival!

67542	3861673	10.0	10.0	47712069	Debbie was a great host! She contacted me very promptly while I was making arrangements and sent an email prior to arriving to give directions and general information regarding our stay. My boyfriend and I were visiting for my sister's wedding and were seeking a more private stay since we were going to be busy running around. The location was near the venue (golden gardens) and in a great area! Close to many restaurants and fun things to check out. We only saw Debbie a few times but she was very friendly each time :) we had the privacy and quiet we wanted and it felt like a small home away from home. She also let us come a bit earlier than stated since we needed to change and get ready before the rehearsal dinner and didn't put pressure for us to be out at exactly 11. Thank you so much Debbie! We had a great stay!
67543	3861673	10.0	10.0	48136527	We spent a great night at Debbie's. Ballard is a very quiet and nice  district. Notice that you need to take the bus or your car to go downtown as it's a long way to go by foot. The room is lovely and we tasted delicious fresh scones in the  morning.  Debbie is really careful: she  gave us some very useful traffic information as Chinese President Xi was visiting Seattle. We recommend  her room for a trip in Seattle.
67544	3861673	10.0	10.0	48175887	"Perfect room, VERY CLEAN, great location in Ballard and easy parking. Debbie is a great host, her dogs are wonderful and we had a fantastic time. We stayed on two different days and the second day Debbie really helped us by allowing to check in a little earlier. Yes, it is a small room but enough space for luggage and clothing.
Debbie, thank you for making us welcome!"
67545	3861673	10.0	10.0	48403600	"Debbie was great: alert, accommodating and attentive without being intrusive. Her place was comfortable, quiet and private, with plenty of street parking out front. Instructions and directions were complete and fully comprehensible, and there were lots of nice little touches--including (but not limited to) the home-made muffins provided without fanfare. She even thoughtfully covered the bicycle I'd locked in the yard when it started to rain overnight. Sweet!

I'd caution that although comfortable and complete, the lodging might have fallen short if I'd intended to cook for myself or if I'd wanted to spend time outside. This was not a drawback for me, but might have been if I'd needed space to work or if I'd not been alone. This is not intended as a criticism, but rather as a caution to be realistic about what's included. Considering the price, location, and amenities this was definitely a good deal. I'll be back!"
67546	3861673	10.0	10.0	48552255	"Wow!  Our stay at Debbie's place was great!! She was the perfect hostess.  The neighborhood was super cute!  We walked to several bars & restaurants.  Her house was adorable!  The guest house looked exactly like it does in the pictures.  
Debbie was so nice and accommodating.  We thought we needed an early check-in so she made arrangements to make that happen for us.  She even had a list of ""To-Do's"" for both the area of Ballard & all of Seattle.

Thank you so much Debbie!  We would most definitely recommend your place to anybody looking for a great place to stay in Seattle!  Hopefully we'll be back soon!"
67547	3861673	10.0	10.0	48879745	We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 night stay.  Our private room exceeded our expectations-Debbie goes above & beyond making sure that every ammenity is available to you. Her homemade breakfast scones will seal the deal!  We were able to store our bikes in her garage & enjoyed the backyard patio area.  Her location is perfect if you want to visit Seattle Center-by car or public bus. We were able to enjoy the Ballard neighborhood too!  We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle.

67550	3861673	10.0	10.0	50247445	Our stay at Debbie's private detached room was great! From the beginning of booking, Debbie was prompt in her replies and sent great detailed information about everything we could expect which only complimented the already detailed listing she has for her AirBnB. The neighborhood is quiet, but only a short walk to a charming street filled with great bars and restaurants. Downtown Ballard is a short drive or bus ride away. The room was very charming, clean and contained everything we needed for our mini-staycation. Debbie even left blueberry scones outside the door for us in the morning. I highly recommend her private room and Debbie, herself, as a great host.

The room was beautiful and clean. Debbie was the perfect host, kind and helpful but respected our privacy. Anything you could ever need, she has ready at your fingertips. There are fantastic spots to eat within a mile. The cherry on top was definitely the yummy homemade scones! Couldn't have asked for a better host, we will be back!

When I got in there was snacks and a few drinks in the mini fridge and a hot tea kettle top of fridge. I will definitely stay here again because it was private and quiet and just overall very pleasant. 
67561	3861673	10.0	10.0	53461415	What a lovely room, and a wonderful host! Debbie made our first Air BnB experience a great one. The room was spacious and well furnished with a great selection of hot teas, coffee and a few other snacks. The location in Ballard is awesome and within walking distance to several local eateries and coffee shops, and only a few blocks from the bus stop that goes downtown Seattle.   Debbie has put together a wonderful travel guide of the area and local restaurant and hot spots. I can't say enough how pleased we were with our choice to stay at Debbies. From the first communication to the time we left she made us feel welcome and like family.
67562	3861673	10.0	10.0	53799085	Debbie is a great host. I have visited twice and will return. The place is clean, quiet and comfortable. I love the location.
67563	3861673	10.0	10.0	53829889	Debbie met us upon arrival and was warm and welcoming. She made us feel comfortable to be staying at her place. The neighbourhood was very easy to find, directions were very accurate and close to Ballard, what a great neighbourhood. The detached place was exactly what was listed. It was very clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and all the little extras made us feel right at home. Would definitely stay there again ! thanks Debbie.
67564	3861673	10.0	10.0	53961588	The place was very cozy and in a quiet neighbourhood.  There as a comfy bed, clean bathroom with showering necessities provided, a walk-in closet for extra storage and some extras to make us feel at home (tea, coffee, homemade scones, juice, instant oatmeal, magazines and books, tv). We would definitely come back again the next time we're in Seattle.  
67565	3861673	10.0	10.0	54097045	Debbie is a great host, she bakes delicious muffins. The room is in a quiet neighborhood and is well maintained. Overall a very pleasurable first night in Seattle.
67566	3861673	10.0	10.0	54337016	This was our first time using AirBnB.  We had a great experience! Debbie's place was just as described; very clean, quiet and filled with lots of extras that made our stay more enjoyable. She really pays attention to the details. The homemade muffins were greatly appreciated. We're afraid she may have spoiled us for future rentals. Thank you Debbie!
67567	3861673	10.0	10.0	54714621	Debbie was great. We had a great time staying here for a wedding that we were going to in Seattle. It was nice to have a private entrance and Debbie was respectful of our privacy. She was so great when we had a few different situation that come up that were less than ideal. She was accommodating and kind. The scones that she made were delicious as well. It was a great stay and I would stay here again. It was a little out of the way of where we had to go for the wedding but it was worth it. 
67568	3861673	10.0	10.0	54822367	Great space and experience. The room is very cozy and private. Hope to stay with Debbie again.
67569	3861673	10.0	10.0	54962703	This visit was great. Debbie is wonderful. So kind and courteous. My wife and I felt very safe and comfortable with her. The room was more than we needed or even imagined. All the extra hospitalities were great! Definitely recommended!!
67570	3861673	10.0	10.0	55119620	The guest room is very cozy and private！Debbie is super nice and thoughtful, and she provides some pumpkin breads for the first morning. Hope to stay with Debbie again!
67571	3861673	10.0	10.0	55370235	"We had a great time during our stay! The detached garage room felt like we were in nice hotel- and the heated floors were an added bonus. 
Debbie brought us delicious scones the second morning, and waking up to see dogs in the back yard made it feel more like home. It was a great neighborhood, with a lovely little spot called the Fat Hen, where we discovered our new favorite coffee drink- a cortado. "
67572	3861673	10.0	10.0	55581082	Debbie is awesome! She went out of her way to help us celebrate my partner's birthday, she made us some homemade scones and gave us a candle to boot! For me this kind of service is rare nowadays, so to have a host that's this thoughtful is a breath of fresh air. The detached bedroom space is great, we were free to move in and out without disturbing our host. It was also so easy to catch the D train going to the city so we saw a lot of what Seattle has to offer without having to drive and pay $$$$ in parking fees. I will definitely recommend Debbie and would stay with her again. Thank you Debbie! 
67573	3861673	10.0	10.0	55680587	Perfect, quiet and private space that feels like an oasis in the city.  Debbie's space is warmly welcoming, easily accessible, and comfortable.  Thank you!
67574	3861673	10.0	10.0	55828759	We were planning a week-end in Seattle, but wanted to avoid the busy downtown. We found this perfect spot in Ballard, which was an great opportunity to discover a very friendly neighborhood with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. The place was very cozy, clean, quiet and warm. We haven't had the chance to meet Debbie but she provides very great advice on where to go and what to see.  We definitely recommend this place.
67575	3861673	10.0	10.0	55896038	"I very much enjoyed staying at Deb's place. I was very impressed with the care she took to make sure I felt welcome. She had many little touches that made me feel at home, such as the French press, the items in the mini-fridge and the wonderful products in the bathroom. I liked the inclusion of a ""manual"" which answered all my questions.

The room is lovely, warm, and tastefully appointed. The bed is very comfortable, and that’s saying a lot for me because I always have pain in my back. I loved the comforter, sheets and pillows. It was like a four-star hotel. My night’s sleep was great."
67576	3861673	10.0	10.0	56134239	Fresh homemade bread in frig and mints on bedside table with a small note saying 'welcome'.

67578	3861673	10.0	10.0	56665416	"Debbie greeted us when we arrived. She was friendly and inviting. The suite was even more cozy than expected -- would stay again! It was a short drive to downtown Ballard, which is highly recommended.

Scones were delicious and unexpectedly served as our only breakfast as we rushed to the airport -- what a life saver! Great set up and quiet 'hood. Thanks!"
67579	3861673	10.0	10.0	56935057	We thoroughly enjoyed our experience in Ballard.  Debbie's very quiet detached unit was an oasis for us after a long haul from Shanghai.  She met us and made us feel welcome immediately and was in contact with us on an as-needed basis before and during our stay.  The room was clean as a whistle and the radiant heat in the floor was a real bonus.  We both felt the bed was one of best we'd ever had! Good coffee, oatmeal packs and scones put the finishing touches on our lovely stay.  Yep, we'd love to re-book. The listings of neighborhood sights, restaurants, etc was well organized and most helpful.  The Brunswick & Hunt Restaurant a couple of blocks away was superb!  Well done, Debbie.
67580	3861673	10.0	10.0	57029478	Debbie was a wonderful host, she left instructions and a very detailed suggestion list that proved to be very helpful. She made our stay very comfortable and even left us homemade scones! I'm a sucker for baked goods and they were fantastic! We had a great stay!
67581	3861673	10.0	10.0	57434664	My son and grandson stayed at Debbie's place. I never met her, but my son met her only briefly and said they had a pleasant conversation. My son was very happy with the room, especially the location, which was very quiet and only a few minutes away from where we were staying.
67582	3861673	10.0	10.0	57635764	We had a great experience staying here!  The host was warm and welcoming, even though we never actually interacted in person.  The room was perfectly appointed with everything you could want.  It was very clean and just as described.
67583	3861673	10.0	10.0	57977542	"Debbie's bnb is ""the best"" just because of Debbie herself. She knows what it takes to make a house a home....even for a visitor.   Careful planning has created a welcoming little oasis independent living suite in her backyard garden. The details of her thouggtfulness are msny, many, many!!! The essentials....a very private, safe, warm, quiet place to rest. It is definitely not an extra bedroom in a basement sort of space. The entire place was absolutely spotlessly clean.  The bed is VERY comfortable and we'll made. Beyond the essentials. I very much enjoyed her efforts to add many touches of hospitality and.....as a single example.... I enjoyed her offer of a yummy blueberry scone in the morning  with a pot of green tea. As I  sat reading a couple ""Seattle"" magazines from her book shelf, I reminisced about my former life in Seattle and thought about how nice her comfy chair and good reading lamp would allow a Seattle ""Tourist visitor"" to get a sense of the town and relax. The little fridge provided a proper storage place for a few meal items. She even provided a mini eating area. 

The location is ideal for bus travelers, as the main bus for this part of town is only a block away. For people with a vehicle  there is very adequate parking. The shopping and night life of new Ballard is 5 minutes away, the natural environment Golden Gardens 10 minutes, as are the fish ladder, fisherman's terminal and Shilshole Marina and the most interesting Hiram Crittenden Locks.

Debbie always communicates efficiently and in a very timely manner. Her book of house info is helpful. She is not a lady who leaves things  to chance.... thoughtful, intelligent, commited. It shows!!"
67584	3861673	10.0	10.0	58028796	Debbie is Super nice and she prepared everything you need with a high quality! The room is warm and very clean. Cute dogs!

68988	7069080	10.0	10.0	38089059	Experience: A very positive one! It was a really great stay with an excellent host. Very quiet room with a comfy bed. It was good to relax and sleep in peace. Private and trustworthy. I had the pleasure of meeting the whole family, very nice people and also welcoming. I will definitely stay here if I have the chance. Thank you Siri :)
68989	7069080	10.0	10.0	38649500	Wonderful experience. The room is exactly as described and is very comfortable. Delightful multi-cultural family is friendly and made me feel very welcome. Great for an overnight or extended stay with easy access to public transit. Neighborhood is quiet and clean. Thank you Siri!
68990	7069080	10.0	10.0	44715931	Cozy room with great backyard deck made for a lovely stay. I especially appreciated having a full kitchen available, and a bicycle to use for grocery shopping nearby. It's an active household with lots of comings and goings -- in other words, it feels just like home!
69030	3208667	10.0	10.0	17537740	"The hosts went way beyond the call of duty preparing the rental space for our visit. They had recently installed a kitchenette, stocked it with care, refreshed bananas and coffee as we used them, offered prepared coffee in the mornings, and otherwise made their space feel like a second home. They shared with us that they frequented Airbnb as guests and know full well what it's like to be on both sides of the arrangement. These are natural hosts  sensitive to privacy and enthusiastic to engage or leave alone as directed by the guest.

The room is spacious, the bed comfortable, the private entrance nice for those late Seattle nights (so as not to disturb the host), and the space well managed. This experience was like staying with close family. Although the hosts have cats, they take care to minimize the dander and cat odor in the rented space. That said, my only non-glowing comment is that this space, like any home with cats, was not free of cat dander - my guest and I are both allergic to cats, but we were still able to sleep ok.

They have a peaceful backyard area with that Seattle array of greenery and life, private and shaded.

Although this is my first Airbnb, this host inspired to use Airbnb more frequently. I hope that my future experiences are even a shadow of how pleasant Joe made this stay. A note on the hosts themselves: wonderful people - if you can, plan an extra day to spend with them."
69031	3208667	10.0	10.0	17663153	"I would definitely recommend this flat. It's the best airbnb I've been to so far. 
The room is so cosy and quiet and there is everything you need. You immediately feel comfortable. Heather and Joe even provided some really good food for breakfast and few nice local beers. 
And above all, the hosts were really nice. Really welcoming (even if we arrived few hours later than the planned hour) and helpful without being intrusive. They gave us lot of informations to go around and recommended good places to eat. They really want you to feel at home! 
Thank you Heather and Joe. 
"
69032	3208667	10.0	10.0	18045908	We had a wonderful stay at this comfortable and sweet B&B. The hosts were very warm and gracious, and the space is better than it looks in pictures. We enjoyed staying, and would go out of our way to stay again in the future. Lots of little details make this such a cozy and memorable place to stay!
69033	3208667	10.0	10.0	18370376	Had a great stay here. Joe and Heather are wonderful hosts. The room is spacious, private and the daily replenishment of snacks and drinks was a nice touch. I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks!
69034	3208667	10.0	10.0	18824933	Heather and Joe were amazing hosts who made our Seattle experience a memorable one. Their guest space was peaceful and quiet and had everything we needed (minus the shower, but that was expected). I would definitely recommend staying with them to anyone looking for a convenient location, but who would rather not be in the heart of the city.
69035	3208667	10.0	10.0	19229991	Joe and Heather are a lovely young couple and charming hosts. As we drove to Seattle, they called us by cell phone to warn of traffic problems and suggest an alternate route, and later to check to be sure everything was okay. We stayed at their home for three nights and had a large, lower-level living room/bedroom (with a very comfy bed!) and half bath to ourselves, as well as a full guest bathroom upstairs and use of the kitchen and living room. We really didn’t need the kitchen, as our room had its own microwave, toaster, dishes, and refrigerator—stocked with good things for breakfast, and even a couple of local micro-brewery beers. Their house is just a few blocks from I-5, making it easy to get around the Seattle area. It is quiet and peaceful, and our room had a sliding door opening onto a small wooded backyard area. Then there is Little Dude, their friendly 19-pound mostly outdoor cat (who is banned from the guest room for the sake of anyone who may have allergies). Ours was a most enjoyable mini-vacation and an excellent Airbnb experience.
69036	3208667	10.0	10.0	20172924	"A had a pleasant stay in Joe and Heather's sweet little mini apartment with a nice view and patio door to the garden. I enjoyed watching the birds and squirrels feeding outside in the morning. The snack area was thoughtfully arranged with mini fridge and toaster and hot water kettle. Very artistic
touches, the upstairs with guest bath is lovely modern home which they kindly share is you wish."
69037	3208667	10.0	10.0	21248384	Nice, quiet place. My hosts were very friendly. Clean and comfy and quite roomy.
69038	3208667	10.0	10.0	21669465	"Not an experience we would choose to repeat.  The listing was not accurate and it was not a bed and breakfast, as breakfast was not provided for three of the five days.  Technically, there is a fireplace in the room, but it is covered by a set of bookcases.  ""Clean dishes, fresh towels, and food refills"" did not occur.  There was a critter of some sort (likely a rodent) in the room that we heard on two different nights.  The basement was damp and had an unpleasant odor.  Dishes were not removed from our room the last two nights.  The people were pleasant enough, just not the accomodations.  On a positive note, it was very quiet there and the bed was comfortable."
69039	3208667	10.0	10.0	22122173	"Joe and Heather were on top of things from before my arrival and did everything I could have asked to make the stay comfortable. 

They are in a pleasant northeast Seattle neighborhood of private homes on a quiet street.

The listing description was impeccably accurate. It is hard to realize from the pictures but the room is very large, much bigger than a typical guest bedroom in a home."
69040	3208667	10.0	10.0	22710541	5 stars across the board! I had a great time, the place was clean, quiet, and very friendly I am definitely staying here again
69041	3208667	10.0	10.0	24799270	It is a wonderful experience living there in this house with the owner, we are appreciate the owner's warm welcome. Definitely will introduce it to other Airbnb friends.
69042	3208667	10.0	10.0	25326497	As when I stayed here before, they are exceptionally gracious hosts. When my Saturday plans fell through they invited me for brunch and we had a lovely hour of omelets and chat.
69043	3208667	10.0	10.0	27746346	Joe and Heather were great hosts. Joe was out of town while we stayed with them, but he was very helpful as this was our first airbnb experience. Heather was very interactive and engaged with our experience. She provided a ton of suggestions of what to see and do in both Seattle and Portland while also respecting our personal boundaries. Would definitely stay with Joe and Heather again! 
69044	3208667	10.0	10.0	27805940	This location was really clean and organized, my host was pleasant and very helpful. Wifi worked great. Looking forward to staying there again when up in north Seattle
69045	3208667	10.0	10.0	28429312	This was a great place to stay at in a lovely neighborhood.  The host Joe & Heather were amazing, they had great pointers of where to go and best breweries to visit.  The room is downstairs where my two friends and I slept for two nights.  It is a nice cozy room with plenty of space for the three of us.  The sliding door to the back yard is also a bonus.  I would stay here again for sure and recommend people to stay here.  Also they do have cats but I have mild allergies and had no problems staying there for two nights.  
69046	3208667	10.0	10.0	28841955	Joe and Heather are bright, welcoming people with wonderful accommodations. Their hospitality went above and beyond. 
69047	3208667	10.0	10.0	30562551	The house is very well situated in Seattle. It is also set back from the street. The neighborhood is peaceful. The room is very comfortable and spacious. A glass door looks onto the yard and its trees and birds. I really enjoyed my stay. Moreover hosts are very warm welcome. They always insure you need anything. We had good discussions around a beer or a brunch. I highly recommend this place.
69048	3208667	10.0	10.0	31117409	Had a nice stay once again thank you! It was nice meeting you Joe and talking football. 
69049	3208667	10.0	10.0	33825005	Joe and Heather were great hosts for my son and I.  They provided us great information about local tourist locations that allowed us to have a great day being tourist in the Seattle area.  The room was exactly what we were looking for, and there home was very comfortable.
69050	3208667	10.0	10.0	34583314	My girlfriend and I stayed 6 nights at Joe & Heather's place and never once felt cramped or short of any accommodations. The room is very comfortable, spacious, and private. Despite being a basement, there are plenty of windows. All the advertised applicances were fully functional and Joe & Heather were very available and responsive. There are good restaurants, supermarkets, and transit options closeby too. This is a great place for both short or extended stays.
69051	3208667	10.0	10.0	34989182	Me and my friends stayed 2nights at Joe & Heather's place, the room was very comfortable for all of us. They have personally gave us their airbed for our extra person.  Despite being a basement, the room was very big and Joe & Heather were really responsible and easy to reach. We brought our own car and the parking space was very big. Would go to their place again! thanks again for the great stay!
69052	3208667	10.0	10.0	35316286	Joe and Heather were fantastic! They provides a clean and inviting place and continental breakfast. They knew the town and gave us great places to eat, told us how to get to the farmer's market in town and Pike Place Market among other things. Would go to their place again! Thanks again!
69053	3208667	10.0	10.0	35603945	As soon as we arrived, Joe was outside waiting for us. He introduced himself and offered to carry some stuff in, and gave us a tour of our room. The room itself was decorated adorably and the beds were super comfy. In the mini-fridge and on the mini-counter there was plenty of food already there for us and plenty of space to out our own as well. Before we even went to bed that night we were informed of the bus routes that would be best to take us downtown and around the other areas we wanted to check out. (Some of which sounded interesting based on Joe & Heather's recommendations alone!!) We were also introduced to their adorable kitten (and her pipe cleaner toys) and invited to coffee in the morning, as Joe makes it fresh every day. We did get to sit down and chat with Heather one morning and talk, so I feel that we really got to connect with her and that made me feel ultimately more comfortable invading their home for a few days. As per Heather's recommendation, we stopped in Portland on the drive back to SLC and got ice cream...and she didn't lie about the greatness of it! Super-awesome hosts made for a super-awesome visit to Seattle. I would most definitely like to come back and see/stay with them again :)

69056	3208667	10.0	10.0	37204551	The space is really nice, clean, and airy. There were breakfast snacks, coffee, and a beer waiting for us when we arrived. Beds are pretty comfy, sofa is big enough to sleep on. Plenty of privacy. Wooded back yard was a nice place to relax. Heather and Joe were helpful and down to earth. They were easy to reach when needed, made coffee for us on most mornings, and even left fresh flowers for us one day. The area is quiet but close enough to highways, and express lanes helped us bypass downtown traffic when we traveled south. There are restaurants, breweries, and dispensaries in the neighborhood as well. I highly recommend Cabin Meets Urban to anyone visiting the Seattle area. 
69057	3208667	10.0	10.0	38627188	"Joe and Heather were terrific hosts. Their listing was accurate and it was even better in person. We loved how quiet and secluded the neighborhood is and the local establishments were enjoyable to attend. 

They gave us some ideas of how to get to where we wanted to go so that we did not have to worry about travel and parking. That really made our vacation much more enjoyable, especially concerning the difficulties of parking in the downtown area.  They also gave us some suggestions of where to go.  

We want to spend more time in this area in the future and would very happily stay with this host, again."

69066	3208667	10.0	10.0	45418341	I loved this place.  The bed was very comfortable, amenities were provided, it is indeed cabin-y with a great location which is close to I-5 yet very quiet.  Joe and Heather were great hosts and I enjoyed meeting them.  I hope to stay here again next time I'm in town!
69067	3208667	10.0	10.0	46398832	We loved our stay. We had everything we needed.  Joe and Heather checked multiple times to see if we needed anything.  The beds were very comfortable.  The room was spacious for the 3 of us. Very quiet and peaceful.  We would definitely stay again
69068	3208667	10.0	10.0	47168514	The listing did not make this space its justice. The room was so spacious and comfortable. The whole set up makes you almost not want to go out to explore because it's so nice to stay in. Heather and Joe were very helpful in giving us suggestions and their feedback about things to do around Seattle. They provided us with fresh coffee every morning, goodies and wine to have in our room and all the ammenties you would get at any five start hotel. I would really recommend staying in this space not just because it's great, but because Joe and Heather really make you feel like part of their family.

69140	5397134	10.0	10.0	28429049	"We stayed for 3 nights and felt right at home. The place was spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and bright for a basement apartment. The bed was super comfortable, wifi connection was excellent, and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare a meal when eating out became expensive. The hosts live above so light footsteps can be heard, but it was minimal. We hardly noticed the traffic noise despite being next to the I-5 freeway. 

Proximity to popular Seattle attractions in Ballard, Fremont, and Downtown is 15 minutes or less by car. When we didn't want to drive, it was short walk from the apartment to local eateries, businesses, and Green Lake (great place to go for a run or stroll).

Scott was a great host and quick to respond to any questions we had prior to our arrival and during our stay. The jar of cookies was a welcome treat."
69141	5397134	10.0	10.0	28911862	Great little apartment in a quiet residential neighborhood. The apartment was super-clean and everything worked. Check-in process was very smooth. Scott provided excellent instructions and neighborhood map. Should you have a car, there's ample street parking, but there are also supermarkets and restaurants within walking distance.
69142	5397134	10.0	10.0	30256464	"This flat was the perfect base camp for our weekend trip to Seattle. Scott was incredibly responsive from the start and he and his wife were great hosts. The space is surprisingly large, and if the spot wasn't as close as it is to some amazing neighborhoods, we would have taken advantage of the full sized kitchen.
The house is a stone's throw from Green Lake Village, and a short drive to Ballard, Fremont, and Downtown Seattle. Even better, though it's close to the freeway, the actual house is kind of tucked away and quiet.
If you couldn't tell, we had an amazing experience and would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a fun weekend in the city!"
69143	5397134	10.0	10.0	32083933	"The host is waiting for us in his house when we arrive the house. Actually the host is living above the room we rented, so it is very convenient to contact with him. After giving me the key, the host spend some time introducing the neighborhood and give good suggestions on some places to go and eat. Also they have maps and tour guides in the room so don't need to feel nervous if you have no plan. The house is built in a quite and convenient neighborhood very suitable for residential using. There is a supermarket called PCC very closed to the house. We went there every night during our four days trip. 
The house is decorated with a careful and beautiful heart. It can be a good place to live if you want to feel the happiness being a residence here. "
69144	5397134	10.0	10.0	32575644	We had a great stay. Place was nicely decorated, very clean and recently renovated. Double bed was very comfortable. The location was perfect for our 3 days of looking around Seattle, only about 10 minutes to downtown. Lots of good communication and we met Scott and his family when we arrived. They offered lots of help and they had lots of books, brochures etc in the flat. We would highly recommend making this your base for a trip to Seattle. Thanks Scott and family.
69145	5397134	10.0	10.0	33123577	"With us having a 1 yr old baby we were looking for a place that was comfortable, safe and convenient.   
Place was super comfortable and clean.  Scott was even kind enough and provided us a pack&play crib and toys for our baby. 
Which saved us a hassle of bringing those along. 
Location was perfect.  In one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle.  Very close to restaurant, shops, lake, playground and park. Short drive to Pike market and other attractions. Parking was super easy and right in front of the house.  

Scott and his wife were perfect host. He provided many recommendations for the weekend activities and for eating out, which were very helpful.
He provided excellent and detailed communication throughout our stay. We also enjoyed meeting their little girl.  
I highly recommend staying here when you are visiting Seattle.  "
69146	5397134	10.0	10.0	33840230	Everything about this stay was fabulous. Loved the space. Our host communicated clearly and promptly. We walked to Green Lake every morning. It was a great home base for our busy weekend of interviewing for a job.
69147	5397134	10.0	10.0	37294025	I rented Scott's place for my aunt and uncle to stay for two months as his apartment is close to my house. Check-in was super easy and flexible. Scott was a great host...he even provided my aunt and uncle with fresh vegetables from their garden. The apartment is perfect for an extended stay. Everything you need is available. My aunt and uncle loved walking everywhere to three grocery stores and especially strolls around Green Lake. I highly recommend Scott's place if you need a place to stay. As I mentioned, I'm Scott's neighbor and IMHO it's a great central location to explore Seattle or stay like a local.
69148	5397134	10.0	10.0	40716479	I booked Scott's place for two months for my aunt and uncle while they stayed here. The place was a wonderful place for a short-term or weekend stay. Scott made sure everything you need is available, even olive oil for cooking! I will definitely book Scott's place again for other family who come.
69149	5397134	10.0	10.0	41584211	We greatly enjoyed our stay at this apartment. It was beautifully decorated, clean, and well-appointed. The neighborhood had many places to shop, eat, and walk, and the bus to Seattle was in easy reach. Highly recommended!
69150	5397134	10.0	10.0	42661186	The space was fantastic and Greenlake is a beautiful location!  Close to great shops, restaurants and just minutes from the park.   Scott and his family were excellent hosts.  Now that we have family living in Seattle, we will definitely book again!
69151	5397134	10.0	10.0	43449925	Wonderful Airbnb experience! Very nice host and great location.
69152	5397134	10.0	10.0	43944587	My partner and I stayed at the Green Lake Suite for three nights while we visited Seattle. It was wonderful! Scott's description of the place is very accurate and the pics show the place well, but it's even better in person. It's clean and cozy and has everything you need. The location is also incredibly convenient. Scott was very helpful and communicative from initial contact through checkout. And we were grateful for the bonus item: a bowl of tomatoes picked from from Scott's family's garden! I recommend this place highly. It will be my first choice for future visits to Seattle. 
69153	5397134	10.0	10.0	45086280	The space was exactly as described.  Very clean and accessible.   Contact with the host was super easy and he always replied in a timely manner.  The Green Lake area was nice and we felt very safe walking to a from places, esp in the evenings.  As well as, an easy commute to the downtown areas.  We would def look here first the next time we visit the Seattle area and would most def recommend this location to a friend.  
69154	5397134	10.0	10.0	46600142	My partner and I stayed here for 9 nights with our 6 month old, and it was absolutely perfect for our visit!  We used it as our home base for visiting family all over town and taking day trips to the mountains and islands.  The space is very comfortable and has a fully functional kitchen and nice spacious bathroom.  It is easy walking distance to Greenlake as well as grocery stores, coffee shops and restaurants.  The hosts provided us with extras for the baby like toys and a pack-and-play, which was especially appreciated.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a home away from home in a great Seattle neighborhood!
69155	5397134	10.0	10.0	48284791	Our stay at Scott's spacious Green Lake Suite was wonderful. Scott's communication was consistently quick, and the entry was easy as there is a lock box with key inside. I loved the neighborhood...being so close to Green Lake, and two major health food stores just down the street. I know Seattle well, and many major main routes---bus lines included----can take you anywhere without having to be on I-5. Which is a big plus for me! And although the Suite is located close to I-5....it is amazingly quiet. We highly recommend Scott's place, and will stay there on future Seattle visits.
69156	5397134	10.0	10.0	49037099	We really enjoyed our stay at Scott's suite. It was extremely convenient and easy walking distance to both Green lake and Roosevelt neighborhoods. Although it was near the freeway, the noise was not noticeable. The hosts were gracious and responded to us immediately. We would definitely stay there again.
69157	5397134	10.0	10.0	49835391	The location of the house is very nice, close to the UW and green lake, the room is very clean, the owner is very careful is also very friendly! Let me had a pleasant holiday！
69158	5397134	10.0	10.0	50518039	No complaints really. The room was as expected. Had no interactions with the hosts.
69159	5397134	10.0	10.0	51211922	Scott was extremely accommodating and welcoming. While we didn't get a chance to meet, he made sure we had everything we needed and our stay went smoothly. The apartment was just as described and the easily walkable to Greenlake.
69160	5397134	10.0	10.0	51965144	Wow, what an amazing experience! You can tell Scott and his wife put a lot of love into this space which made our stay extremely comfortable and worthwhile. Scott was excellent in terms of communication and even went out of his way to recommend his favorite spots. We arrived to Seattle very late on a weekday but Scott made key access very easy so we were able to settle in as soon as we arrived. The apartment was exactly what we were looking for in terms of location and space. Very clean and cozy, which made us feel right at home (not to mention the bed was SUPER comfortable!) 5 steps away from the freeway made commuting so easy! Awesome cafes, bars and restaurants in close proximity. Will definitely stay here again!
69161	5397134	10.0	10.0	55371872	"Perfect spot for out needs. Clean, very clean, nicely laid out/ and decorated. Host was probably around less than usual based on previous reviews due to the holidays but was easily accessible at all times through the Air BnB app whenever we had questions. None of this came a huge surprise to us given the history of positive feedback, was just as good as advertised. The most unexpected thign about our stay was how much we liked the area. Stayed in the aprtment out first month in Seattle while looking for a permanent place. Didn't think we were going to live in the Green lake area long term but it grew on us quickly and we preferred it to the downtown area and others. everything was still easily accessed through public transportation and the lake and less congested feel of the area really appealed. Ended up getting  spot on the other side of the lake.

"
69162	5397134	10.0	10.0	57810832	This was a really neat place to stay. Although we only used it to sleep, it had everything you'd want if you were spending more of the day there. There was a laundry area, closet space, as well as a private kitchen, and books about exploring Seattle. Loved the attention to detail and the little things just as much. The heater was on when we first got there and so were the lights. Definitely felt welcomed and the love they put into this place. Looked exactly like the pictures.

Maya was incredibly helpful and accommodating through our booking process and stay. We will definitely stay again on our next visit!"
70782	8690491	10.0	10.0	50382293	We struck gold with this little gem:) Maya was a wonderful host, greeting us with a thoughtful card and full run-through of the super funky neighbourhood we were lucky to land in. We never would have explored this area otherwise. She also too the time to write out tons of great local restaurants and drink spots to check out and gave us a good feel for the hood and surrounding areas. Her apartment had amazing views, was immaculate and she even left us a basket of toiletries, in case we were caught out. Always easy to reach, she answered all our questions immediately. She even brought us apples from her family farm when we said goodbye. Highly recommend and we would definitely stay again!
70783	8690491	10.0	10.0	51356486	For my first Airbnb experience I think Maya was exceptional. My fiancé and I fell in love with her cozy studio! It had everything we needed and was very comfortable for our stay! Maya is very friendly and even gave us plenty of pointers for transportation as well as places to eat or go drink which was extremely helpful. We loved pesos! Waking up to that incredible view every morning was lovely. We would definitely stay here again if we ever come back to Seattle! 
70784	8690491	10.0	10.0	52117552	Clean, cozy, centrally located apartment. Love staying here!
70785	8690491	10.0	10.0	53067250	We had a great time staying at Maya's. The apartment was clean and comfortable. It was within walking distance to many attractions and restaurants. And we loved the view from her apartment! Would definitely recommend.
70786	8690491	10.0	10.0	53984325	"Maya is an incredible host! Upon arrival, she met me at the apartment, and showed me where to find parking, as well as start giving me some advice on cool local spots. She was very thorough, even writing down the wifi password, parking spot # as well as helpful reminders. 

Maya is an incredibly thoughtful person, and even left us a personalized card, with a chocolate bar welcoming us to her place. Fresh flowers were placed around the studio, and the apartment was immaculate. She ensures you have your own personal space for your clothes as well as toiletries, and even left us a box of travel toiletries just in case we had forgotten something. 

Some advice to future guests: Don't be intimidated to have a drink with maya upon arrival. I had a cocktail with her after check in, and we had a wonderful conversation! Really helped ease the tension of staying in a stranger's place for 4 days. Maya is very easy to get along with, strike conversation, and is a treasure box of ideas for good places to eat, as well as fun things to do in Seattle. The whole point of this website is to meet new people, network, and secondly to find cheaper alternatives to hotels.... 

This was my first airbnb experience, and I don't think I could have had a better experience! This apartment has the most breathtaking views you will ever see in Seattle, and the view from the rooftop is to die for!

We have never been happier to not stay in a hotel on vacation as we were during this trip to Seattle. "
70787	8690491	10.0	10.0	55041299	Maya was wonderful. She let us check in early, secured a parking spot for us, and made sure we had everything we needed. Her apartment is great, too. It's clean and cozy and in a good location in Lower Queen Anne. If you don't mind walking, it's not that far to downtown and Pike Place Market (maybe 1.5 miles). If you do, it's just a short $7 Uber ride away.
70788	8690491	10.0	10.0	55387153	Maya was very welcoming and personable! She was easily accessible throughout my stay and provided me with a wonderful temporary home. Her apartment has a gorgeous view of the water and the sunsets I watched from her couch were breathtaking. I've fallen in love with Queen Anne and all that it has to offer. I'm so excited to visit Seattle again! Thank you for all of your hospitality and kindness Maya! 
70789	8690491	10.0	10.0	55904538	"Maya was fantastic! She’s a very thoughtful host and her apartment was perfect. It was calming, homey and gave a great view of the water/sunset. It really is perfect location to relax but be close to all the things that anyone would want to visit in Seattle. Queen Anne is a wonderful neighborhood where you can explore and feel like a local. Everything is in walking distance. I would recommend walking to the Seattle Center and taking the monorail downtown to WestLake. After a full day of adventuring, it was great to settle into this wonderful home away from home. Thank you Maya – it was a great experience!  
"
70790	8690491	10.0	10.0	57437461	Maya was absolutely fantastic to work with! Communicated well before, during, and after our stay. Her place was perfect for my boyfriend and I, and she truly went out of her way to make it extra special. She even got a small tree since we were staying over Christmas! Her apartment was exactly like the pictures and extremely clean, but everything felt usable. We would love to stay at Maya's again!
71453	9094836	10.0	10.0	52804803	"Alex met us to get us oriented and suggest parking so that went smoothly. The condo was very clean and neat, made us feel  like we were welcome and in for a special stay.  Condowas very comfortable to just sit and relax, but we eventually had to go to our show.  The views are outstanding, as is the location. Can see the Space Needle framed in a window outside the door and the bay and ships out the main windows. Also outstanding was the rooftop terrace which is very large and offers views in any direction.
 We walked to a New Orleans style restaurant just a few blocks away that I can't wait to try again.
We waited only a minute or two for Uber drivers to arrive when we did venture away from condo. Very convenient location.  
To sum up we had an outstanding trip and would stay in this condo again. "
71877	6239108	10.0	10.0	33331447	Kanjin the host was great. He's a Buddhist monk and the money helps raise money for the monks, so that was cool, too. Kanjin made me feel welcome. The place was comfortable and nicer than I expected, much better than what it appears in the pictures. We had a great time. 
71878	6239108	10.0	10.0	33865374	This was a nice, quiet place to stay - very picturesque and comfortable. Kanjin was very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend.

71880	6239108	10.0	10.0	35599946	"A nice one bedroom apartment with all the amenities in a quiet neighborhood.  The location was a short drive to downtown Ballard where there were many interesting places to eat and drink.  I thought that the host was very friendly in our communications during my stay and the price was a good bargain.
I rated the stay a five star due the fact that nothing else could have been done to improve my stay and that the apartment was as advertised."
71881	6239108	10.0	10.0	35827186	Great 1 bedroom apartment near good stuff in Ballard. Kanji and Mike were very relaxed and accommodating. 
71882	6239108	10.0	10.0	36584615	Beautiful location. The apartment was clean and inviting. Not far from the bus stop, and close to Golden Gardens park. Flexible check in / check out. Reasonably priced. Looking forward to coming back. Thanks Kanjin!

Great at communicating throughout the process.  We were able to get the keys without any issues.  The apartment matched the description as advertised.  

The neighborhood is definitely safe.  We had a car, and they provided us with room to park it.  I can't comment on public transport in that area, though we were told there's a bus that picks up within a few blocks of the house.

Highly recommended as hosts and a great place to stay!"
71884	6239108	10.0	10.0	38173376	The apartment was great. Great location in a nice safe neighborhood, very clean, simple check in. It was an easy place to stay for the weekend, exactly what we were looking for!

The place  was immaculate, perfect for our small family. Surprisingly Quiet  for being near a busy part of Seattle. Downtown Ballard is adorable.
Parking is right downstairs. 
Be sure and visit Golden Gardens park on the sound while you're there."
71886	6239108	10.0	10.0	39640465	I was having some traffic delay issues that Kanjin was incredibly understanding and helpful with.  When I finally arrived, getting into the apartment was a breeze and everything was incredibly clean with plenty of extra blankets for my nephew and niece.  I would certainly recommend staying here again.
71887	6239108	10.0	10.0	40278146	This was a peaceful place with lovely views.  The bed is comfortable, the shower is great, and the kitchen is nicely laid out.  I liked the overall design of the apartment a lot.  The neighborhood is private, and almost rural in flavor, but Market Street in Old Ballard is just a few minutes away by car down 28th Avenue.  There are also bus lines nearby.  It's very easy to get to.
71888	6239108	10.0	10.0	42269895	Kanjin was great at making us feel welcome. The day we got in it was a little chilly and and personally came with more sheets and blankets as well as helped us turn on the heat. Very easy to reach through phone and message as well. The place is as described and has a comfortable sofa bed as well. Our week stay involved some cooking and all necessary utensils were provided. The Ballard neighborhood is lovely and peaceful but very short and easy drive into Seattle's center. Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle. 
71889	6239108	10.0	10.0	42633363	Great apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Easy access, very comfortable, spacious!
71890	6239108	10.0	10.0	43794906	Kanjin has a lovely home in the Ballard district in Seattle. It's very close to nearly everything but is in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood providing a nice private ambiance in contrast to any hotel experience. All amenities are provided for. I'd recommend visiting the local fish market and bakery on 24th and fixing a good home-cooked meal if you have time. Do yourself a favor and avoid hotels if you're able to and book this lovely townhouse for your next stay in Seattle. You won't be disappointed. Thanks again Kanjin!
71891	6239108	10.0	10.0	45405936	We had a wonderful stay at this airbnb. There was plenty of space and it was very nice and quite. Kanjin was very accommodating to all our needs. I would highly recommend this place.
71892	6239108	10.0	10.0	46426556	Kanjin's apartment was perfect for my parent's weekend stay in Seattle! It was stocked with everything they could have needed for the weekend and was warm and welcoming. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and close to downtown Ballard and Golden Gardens.  Kanjin was very accommodating and made our first Aribnb experience a good one. 
71893	6239108	10.0	10.0	47584191	The Ballard apartment was the perfect place to stay for my needs.  It is in a very quiet neighborhood north of Ballard, near the water, in easy reach of anywhere in North Seattle.  It is much nicer and better priced than a hotel suite.  Kanjin was very responsive.  For example, I had a problem with the furnace.  Kanjin immediately arranged to have the furnace serviced and brought over a space heater to use in the interim.  Any place can have the occasional problem - what makes the difference is how the problem is addressed and Kanjin passed the test with flying colors!  I fully expect to go back the next time I need to stay in that part of town.
71894	6239108	10.0	10.0	48838318	Kanjins place was an excellent first Airbnb experience for me. The host was very courteous, helpful, and made us feel welcome. He gave advice about the area, gave us his cell number to contact for any needs we had, and even filled up my car tires which had gone flat. The place itself was very cozy, clean, and very comfortable. All around great experience, I would highly recommend it.

73506	2471731	10.0	10.0	18445095	What shall I say, the girls are great. Amelia & marisa combined a professional claim with a very welcoming friendlyness. I also met jordan a very nice feller. To stay in the big house with 10 ohters - who you might rarely see but sometimes here - is a very special and interessting expierence.  You should meet the girls and the people in the house. Special hint: the also have a beautyful houseboot. :)
73507	2471731	10.0	10.0	19091686	I had a great stay at Amelia's place in Ballard. I stayed there for a week and a half and it was perfect for that amount of time. The kitchen was huge and had everything I needed. The room itself and the shared bathroom were big and clean as well. For a house with that many people, it was surprisingly quiet. The location was very convenient, only a block and a half to the bus stop to go downtown where I was working. Central Ballard and Green Lake park were easily accessible too. The neighborhood was cute, with a pocket of a few restaurants only a block or so away. Overall I had a really good experience.
73508	2471731	10.0	10.0	24825070	This is a wonderful home in a great area! My roommates were very friendly and I couldn't be happier with the whole experience. My room had a great TV with Netflix and Amazon built in, which was a huge plus!
73509	2471731	10.0	10.0	46526490	Amelia met me on the porch with her adorable little Pomeranian, Foxy. She had everything labeled and organized in her b n b, and shared lots of valuable information about the area.  I knew exactly where things belonged and the best most respectful way to cohabitate and respect other renters privacy and space. Very clean and very comfortable. Her bike borrowing system was invaluable for commuting to town for yoga, food and parks. Pikes place was just a 40 minute pleasant bike ride away. Ballard is a nice, safe neighborhood. Loved it!

 Phinney Ridge neighborhood is adorable .Their place is very convenient to other charming  neighborhoods like Fremont and Ballard.Just a block to bus stop and great coffee places and restaurants and groceries.
  The bed and pillows were very comfortable and Brittany makes a mean espresso."
74049	2858482	10.0	10.0	15635152	Our stay (me and two friends) at Jeanette's and Brittany's place was amazing! Though they couldn't be at home at the time when we planed to move in, they prepared everything well so that it was possible for us, to move into the house, what was perfect for us! Further the neighborhood as well as their house is very nice! We felt very comfortable and well received!
74050	2858482	10.0	10.0	15980365	"This was a great place to stay, really enjoyed my time here. Jeanette and Brittany were super welcoming. They really do offer you their home for your stay, are hospitable, easy-going and relaxed. The room is perfect, big and well presented, as is the rest of the home, which you can use. 

The location was perfect for me for the work I was doing, but I'd definitely recommend the area anyway for somewhere to stay. Loads of great coffee houses, a 5 minute walk to the wonderful Green Lake, and an easy bus ride to downtown on the Number 5. Was a great place to stay, definitely would come back here."
74051	2858482	10.0	10.0	16121356	We loved staying at Jeannette and Brittany's place. The neighborhood is great, the house is colorfully and beautifully decorated, and both our hosts were warm and welcoming. They really encouraged us to feel at home, and went above and beyond to provide us not only with detailed info on Seattle but also on the San Juan islands where we were going before meeting them.  Amazing fruit salad, granola and coffee for breakfast. Everything was really a treat. Thanks for everything to you both!
74052	2858482	10.0	10.0	17374859	Jet and Brittany were very welcoming and thorough. The information packet they provided was really helpful. We felt welcomed into the space and felt comfortable in their home. The house is in a cute neighborhood and it's just a quick bus ride to downtown Seattle. I wish the bathroom were a little closer to our room, but other than our stay here was great! 
74053	2858482	10.0	10.0	18757126	"Our hosts were very flexible with the check in time! We even had a fresh scone on arrival. Such a ""homey"" and friendly atmosphere! "

The listing description was very accurate and the neighborhood very calm and nice. Their house is lovely.
If I have to go back to Seattle, I will definitely stay there again."
74055	2858482	10.0	10.0	19106722	"I'm a frequent Airbnb'er and this was my favorite stay ever. 

Jet is fantastic. We made a somewhat last-minute booking and arrived late at night to boot. She was completely laid back about it and left the light on for us with instructions on how to get into the house. I even accidentally wandered into her bedroom instead of the bathroom that first night and she just laughed about it with me. 

Just like the rest of the house, our room was cozy and comfortable. Our room was spacious and had plenty of blankets, sheets, and pillows along with water and glasses (important since the room is upstairs and on the opposite side of the house from the kitchen and bathroom) and a lovely flower from her garden. There is a monkey puzzle tree outside the window that gives the room a treehouse feel and a blue jay would come visit in the mornings just outside the window about 2 feet away.

We stayed four nights and it felt like living with old friends. Jet's housemate, Brittany, was gone most of the time, but when she arrived home the final night, it was like meeting an old friend. 

I highly recommend staying with Jet and Brittany.

74056	2858482	10.0	10.0	19968450	Jeanette and Brittany's house is located in a beautiful and quite neighborhood. The small green house makes us feel like we are at home! It is really cozy. The room we stay is big and there is a huuuuge and super comfy bed in the room. My friends and I love it to the max! Not only the room, we are extremely satisfied with the internet speed. There was one day that we didn't go out, just staying at home watching drama. I know it sounds a bit u productive =P Definitely worth the money we pay. The house is only 5 minutes walk to the bus station and it is only 30 minutes away from downtown. I will definitely recommend those who plan to visit Seattle to stay there!

74058	2858482	10.0	10.0	23803720	"This was by far our favourite Air BnB! The house was comfortable and warm, it made us feel like we were home. Jet and Brit were amazing hosts they helped us find all the local spots and Seattle attractions. 

Their house is located in a safe neighbourhood close to local coffee, shops and market place. If you are staying in Seattle this is where you should stay. Cannot thank both of them enough."
74059	2858482	10.0	10.0	24974430	Jet and Brittany are both easygoing and friendly. Their house gives us a homey feeling, cozy and comfortable, there were days we just stayed in and lazed around. Thank you Jet and Brit for having us and were such wonderful hosts!

When we first checked in there was a basket of snacks, tea, and cold water waiting for us in the room. They have a big, well-equipped kitchen, and several great places to get groceries nearby, so it's a great place if stay if you intend to cook. There are also several great restaurants and bars within an easy walk from there as well. Both hosts are quite knowledgeable about food and they make some great recommendations. 

This was easily the nicest place we've stayed with Air B n B so far!"

74067	2858482	10.0	10.0	36535382	The location is good and safe. It takes only 10 minutes to Seattle downtown. The room is clean. Jeannette and Britney are friendly. We spend most time outside and wish we have had more time in the house.
74068	2858482	10.0	10.0	38158888	Jeanette was very welcoming and made us feel right at home. She was helpful with giving us ideas to best take advantage of Seattle in the limited time that we had to spend there. The house was clean, bed was comfy, nothing more you could really ask for!

74197	254340	10.0	10.0	780157	Waaay better than hoped for.  Felt like a new, cozy, fully furnished apt. Not to mention spotless. Surprising treats and all the amenities and a few extras.  Hosts went out of their way to be helpful and accomodating.  3 minute walk to restaurants and pubs.  I'll be staying here in the future.  Perfect access for Ballard and Fremont. 
74198	254340	10.0	10.0	804180	This was very comfortable, clean, and modern.  The hosts were very nice, and wanted to make sure that everything was ok.  The neighborhood was nice and the parking was good in front of the house.
74199	254340	10.0	10.0	809868	The apartment is wonderful - beautifully decorated and so roomy and comfortable! This was the perfect place for my parents to stay over the holidays. The owners were incredibly thoughtful and their attention to detail with the amenities was outstanding. Will recommend it to all my friends visiting from out of town as the perfect oasis for guests!
74200	254340	10.0	10.0	852386	"With the Phinney Oasis, Kim has created a most comfortable place to stay in Seattle. My partner and I were in town for the MLA conference, which took place at the Convention Center downtown. The commute was a piece of cake, and it was a real delight for us to be able to escape the conference and enjoy the many excellent eateries, etc. on Phinney Ridge and nearby Ballard and Fremont. Kim is a great host: she provided us with delicious artisan bread, etc. for breakfast, and she and her husband were readily available to answer any questions. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and hope to be back soon. "
74201	254340	10.0	10.0	863565	We had an amazing time in this lovely, clean, convenient apartment. The place was sparkling clean and we immediately felt at home with the new appliances, heated bathroom floor and comfy mattress. Kim checked in on us to make sure we were OK and had wonderful suggestions about things to do in Seattle during our stay. I would recommend this place to everyone!
74202	254340	10.0	10.0	953654	Wonderful place.  Had everything I could have possibly needed.  Excellent location too.
74203	254340	10.0	10.0	977265	Kim and Steven were great hosts. The place was well stocked for food supplies, even some delicious fresh bread. Recommendations for places in the area were great and they were always reachable if we had any questions. The bed was very comfortable and cozy. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends. 
74204	254340	10.0	10.0	987809	"Wonderful, newly renovated flat on the basement level. Great location to Phinney-Ballard-Greenlake neighborhoods. Apartment had everything - sitting area, dining area, full kitchen, shower stall bathroom, plenty of closets, own entrance, etc.

Hosts Kim and Stewart were very organized and communicated prior to arrival and went out of their way for a special request. They also have a lot of local information available in the apt. We only saw them briefly as we were out and about most of the days. They were available with tips about the area when asked.

"
74205	254340	10.0	10.0	1036229	Kim and Stewart are gorgeous hosts. The apartment is really great and you will find everything you need. When I arrived the fridge was already filled up with some basics so that I didn’t have to go to the grocery on the day of arrival. They were always happy to help and gave me a lot of recommendations for activities in the surrounding neighborhoods. It is a great place to stay in Seattle and much more familiar than staying in a hotel. I definitely recommend this place!
74206	254340	10.0	10.0	1268225	Stewart and Kim were very friendly and made sure we had all that we needed for a comfortable stay.  The apartment was immaculate when we got it, with a good amount of light and privacy.  We would definitely go back again!
74207	254340	10.0	10.0	1344897	"Kim and Stewart are very gracious hosts. We enjoyed our conversations with them about Seattle and what was going on in life... like we were old friends. They even brought ""new"" toys for our son to play with. The suite is kept very well and had all the amenities we needed, plus it was spacious enough to allow us to separate during our week's stay. Great shower, comfy bed and clean accommodations. Ceiling height might be a consideration for tall people. Thank you! "
74208	254340	10.0	10.0	1568624	Kim and Stewart were lovely hosts!  The studio is very comfortable and was perfect for my little family.  They even provided a pack and play for my son, which was very convenient!  The kitchen had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable.  We visit my brother in Ballard about once a year and look forward to staying here again!
74209	254340	10.0	10.0	1625657	I highly recommend this Elegant Oasis!  Kim and Stewart were lovely hosts and made me feel right at home.  Their place exceeded my expectations.  The location was perfect for visiting my daughter and being close to public transportation.  I appreciated the beautiful accommodations including a complete kitchen. I would definitely stay there again.
74210	254340	10.0	10.0	1667584	This is a beautiful apartment (even better than the photos) with a really peaceful feel.  It was a very functional and luxurious home base to spend an evening in or to explore Seattle.  I only wish we had planned to stay longer.
74211	254340	10.0	10.0	1724089	Kim & Stewart were wonderful hosts. They were very accommodating of my family, even providing a pack+play for our infant. They were friendly and offered up plenty of area recommendations. The place itself looks great in the photos, but was even better on arrival. It was an easy commute (driving) to Lower Queen Anne, where I needed to be for work. And we enjoyed walking down 65th to the local businesses for coffee, food, and funny socks. This is where we plan to stay on return trips to Seattle!
74212	254340	10.0	10.0	2008904	Kim and Stewart were great. We did not just stay in their wonderful basement apartment, we became friends and hope to stay with them again. My daughter and I live overseas and return to Seattle every summer. This was the first time we had our own space very close to our family and friends. Kim was away for most of our trip but Stewart was home and helped us with everything we needed. The space is cool and cozy - good internet, comfortable bed, excellent washer and dryer, good water temperature and pressure in the bathroom, well appointed kitchen and the companionship of a very sweet dog. The location was perfect for us, close to Ballard restaurants, library, post office and beaches and easy access to downtown, University district and shopping at Northgate Mall. Excellent restaurants, groceries and bakeries within walking distance. Kim and Stewart's was the perfect place for us. Our last night in town Kim, my daughter and I went out for a night at the Seattle waterfront. In the morning  before our flight home, Kim and I went  for pastries. It was a perfect ending to a wonderful stay.
74213	254340	10.0	10.0	2133446	I really enjoyed my stay in Kim and Stewart's apartment. It was very clean, well appointed and comfortable. I've traveled extensively all over the world and the Elegant Oasis is one of the most comfortable places I've ever stayed. It's close to the very vibrant communities of Ballard and Phinney Ridge and it was an easy walk to both the Green Lake walking path and the Woodland Park Zoo. I barely left the area the entire time week because there is so much to do right there. 
74214	254340	10.0	10.0	2462307	The 'oasis' is fabulous - everything you would ever need is in the apartment and it is cozy and comfortable and in a great, quiet neighborhood within walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants.  My husband and I so enjoyed our stay and the hosts were so accommodating and helpful in sharing information on places to go to, etc.  We will definitely come back and have already recommended the 'oasis' to friends who frequently travel to Seattle..  Thanks for making our stay so pleasant!!
74215	254340	10.0	10.0	2698166	In town for a conference, two of us stayed at Kim and Stewart's. It was perfect! Spotless, private, warm, with everything we needed and more. I was especially impressed with the thoughtful little touches Kim and Stewart included (like pastries for the morning since we got in late!).
74216	254340	10.0	10.0	2926984	"Kim and Stewart are so kind and welcoming.  We knew that whatever we needed they were there to help, but we also had all the privacy we needed.  Very comfortable accommodations with a well appointed kitchen.  So nice to have cable and wifi.  A washer and dryer, plus detergent is so appreciated.  Tons of space to unpack and put your clothes.  It was our second stay there and it was all we needed.
"
74217	254340	10.0	10.0	3333746	We arranged this stay for a colleague who was in town. Kim and Stewart were very helpful and quick to reply with answers to any questions we had. Our colleague had a great stayed and really appreciated the hospitality provided. We highly recommend this apt to anyone looking for a place to stay in a great Seattle neighborhood! 
74218	254340	10.0	10.0	3452052	Kim & Stewart's apartment is as advertised.  Very clean, comfortable, cozty even during all the cold rainy days of our Seattle stay.  Great kitchen, excellent bed.  Wif-fi worked great.  Very good privacy, but  Kim & Stewart always available if you need something.  Had to go outside to get good cell phone coverage, but that could have been due to our cell carrier (we are from Anchorage, AK).
74219	254340	10.0	10.0	3582437	Kim has a wonderful very priviate basement apt for stays in the Ballard area.  It was spotless and had everything you could possible need.  We will stay here again when we visit my sister.  Perfect!!!!!
74220	254340	10.0	10.0	3682251	Warm apartment greeted me, even though hosts were away.  Everything was as pictured, with a few extra pillows and shelf space.  When I wanted something, I found it already there, almost every time.  Kim and Stewart were friendly and available, but let me come and go as I wished.  This is the nicest finished basement apt I have stayed in!  Felt like my own place.  Recommended.  Will stay here again.
74221	254340	10.0	10.0	3764552	We had everything we needed in comfortable, charming, reasonably priced surroundings. 
74222	254340	10.0	10.0	4025042	We stayed with Kim for 9 nights during our move from Seattle back to Australia.  The apartment was great, extremely clean and comfortable with everything provided you could possibly need - down to spices and herbs for cooking!  The location is great, with easy access to buses or zipcars.  I highly recommend this as a place to stay, whether you are coming to Seattle to visit friends or family or just to sight see.
74223	254340	10.0	10.0	4077254	Lovely place!  Very clean and accommodating.  
74224	254340	10.0	10.0	4283363	My wife, daughter, and I had a great stay! The apartment was contemporary and clean, and the location was perfect. Also amazing was Kim's offer ahead of time to set up a Pack n' Play for us, so we didn't have to lug ours across the country. We'll definitely stay here again during our next trip to Seattle!
74225	254340	10.0	10.0	4396044	Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.
74226	254340	10.0	10.0	4828029	"We now have absolutely no reason to stay anywhere else when we visit Seattle but in Kim and Stewart's Elegant Oasis. The apartment is exactly as pictured: Quirky but comfortable, with everything you might need for a couple nights or a couple weeks. The kitchen is big and thoughtfully stocked, the bathroom is small but functional (with a heated floor!), and everything was spotlessly clean, organized, and ready for our stay. There's plenty of storage for clothes and travel items, including supplied hangers.

Our trip was a bit of a whirlwind—we needed to stay somewhere in the neighborhood due to a series of family events over a holiday weekend, and Kim's house would've been perfect on location alone (it's in a good spot to get to almost anywhere in the city quickly by car, yet you're tucked into a very quiet, safe neighborhood). There's plenty of nearby restaurants and shops.

Sadly, due to all the activities we had planned, we never had a chance to meet our hosts face-to-face, but Kim checked in with us via e-mail to make sure we had everything we needed, and was proactive, professional, and welcoming in all of her messages. She even made sure we could arrive early without any problems. We heard them upstairs a couple times, but the apartment is very well insulated and noise from anywhere is certainly not a problem.

A few quirks and notes that may or may not matter to some of you:

1. The cocoon-like double bed is very warm and comfortable, but it has a pillow-top or some sort of cushion over the mattress, so it's quite soft. We loved it, but if you need a firm sleep surface, it may not be for you.

2. We had a rental car and found street parking at the house and getting around the city very easy. As such, I can't comment on how access to public transit is from this location. The streets in this neighborhood are narrow and generally parked-in on both sides; if your rental car is a giant SUV or something, it may be a challenge getting in and out.

3. Because it's a basement apartment, the ceiling is low in a couple places. I'm six foot and had to duck in one spot in particular, but otherwise was fine.

We absolutely recommend Kim's apartment, and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Book with confidence!"
74227	254340	10.0	10.0	4986915	"My husband, 1 1/2 year old daughter and I loved our stay with KIm & Stewart! The apartment was just lovely, with great amenities, such as the kitchen, laundry and modern touches. We loved the storage available for our clothing and luggage, as well as the heated floors in the bathroom. It is in a great location, with wonderful shops, restaurants, and coffee shops within walking distance. We loved Bluebird, who served their own ice cream & coffee. The apartment is also a very easy drive downtown - we were to the space needle, waterfront, etc within 10 minutes. We would definitely stay again and recommend it to others, especially those with a little one. 

Kim and Stewart were wonderful hosts. We were greeted with pastries from their favorite local bakery. Kim was happy to provide an iron and iron board. Both Kim and Stewart have a wealth of knowledge on things to do, places to eat, etc in the area and in Seattle as well, which we were thankful for. 

The only thing I was unaware of is the fact that this is more of a studio apartment, as the bedroom is not enclosed, and is open without a door/curtain from one side of the bedroom near the bathroom entrance. I was a little concerned, as we put our daughter to bed at 7:30, that we would wake her up with noise, lights, etc. But in the end, she slept wonderfully and it didn't matter at all! 

Thanks again Kim & Stewart! We will always look back on our trip with such fond memories, and would love an opportunity to stay again. "
74228	254340	10.0	10.0	5053487	We enjoyed our stay very much. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Kim and Stewart were so accommodating. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised that the apartment was completed baby proofed, which meant a lot to us since we have two very active young children. And it is set up in a way that noise is not an issue. We were relieved about that since we are early risers and we didn't want to disturb anyone around us. Also, we were welcomed with a pack of cupcakes. Just what we needed after a long car ride to Seattle. A very nice touch indeed!
74229	254340	10.0	10.0	5306636	"We very much enjoyed our stay at Elegant Oasis in Seattle.  While we never met Kim or Stewart in person, our e-mail and phone conversations were very helpful.  Kim sent me a list of places to eat near by.  There is a really good coffee place just around the corner.  Also make sure you make your way up to Honore Bakery on 70th Street @ 15th Ave.  Thanks Kim for the yummy treat from there. 

The only feedback that I would have for future Airbnb folks would be that you really do need a car in this location, street parking is no problem, and to watch your feet as you walk around the bed, there is a wooden frame that is wider than the bed itself and we both stubbed our toes.   Also make sure you pet their dog he is very friendly "
74230	254340	10.0	10.0	5451140	Fantastic choice!!! Super clean, large, private, attention to detail (2 delicious scones waiting for us), very comfortable bed, and very well supplied kitchen. Filtered water and coffee provided. Great quiet neighborhood that's conveniently located. I needed an iron and ironing board which Stewart was quick to provide. Kim was out of town but Stewart was personable, helpful, and available. We will definitely stay here again when in Seattle. Thanks for such a great stay! Karen & Roger, Tennessee 
74231	254340	10.0	10.0	6144925	Kim and Stewart are wonderful hosts; we've stayed in their place twice now and we will plan on doing so again the next time we are in Seattle.
74232	254340	10.0	10.0	6555791	This was the second time I stayed with Kim and Stewart who were as gracious and welcoming during this visit as they were last year. Their apartment is very clean and inviting to be in which is a huge priority for me. Their apartment is in a good location within walking distance to all the restaurants and amenities of the Phinney Ridge neighborhood and the 3 mile walk around bustling Green Lake. It is also a very short car ride or longer walk to the bars and restaurants of lively old Ballard. Excellent coffee is only 1 block away at Cafe Bambino which is open at 6 am during week days - a great find for those experiencing jet lag! Or Kim and Stewart thoughtfully provided fresh ground coffee if you are more of a do it yourself guest. I will definitely stay with Kim and Stewart again during next year's trip back home to visit with family. 
74233	254340	10.0	10.0	6844554	Our stay at Kim and Stewart's place was a great first experience with Airbnb.  Kim went out of her way to accommodate our wanting to have a nice cup of tea when we arrived in Seattle. The place was wonderfully appointed with everything that we needed for our stay to be comfortable including a washer and dryer.  Both she and her husband were wonderful hosts - sharing their knowledge of Seattle and the area to ensure that we would find things to do that were fun for us. They could not have been nicer to stay with.
74234	254340	10.0	10.0	7092741	"We loved Kim's place!   It is very cozy and comfortable.   The pictures hardly do it justice, since they don't show the attention to architectural detail lavished on the renovation of this basement space.   I'm six feet tall, but didn't come in contact with the ceiling that is sub-six-foot in a few places.   And even if I had, I'm sure the smoothly rounded edges would have only given a gentle bump.   The delicious pastry awaiting us on our arrival was typical of the elegance of Kim and Stuart's welcome to their guests.  The Phinney Ridge neighborhood is charming with some good nearby bars and coffee houses, as well as a wide choice up the hill along Phinney & Greenwood Aves.   They recommend the Honore Artisan Bakery, which is excellent and known across Seattle.   We enjoyed downtown Ballard, which is easy to get to by bus or rental car (or via an ""urban hike"").   We will definitely try to stay here again on our next trip to Seattle.  "
74235	254340	10.0	10.0	7278496	"Kim and Stuart were absolutely fabulous hosts from the moment we arrived. My husband, 8 month old daughter and I felt completely comfortable and safe during our stay. Great quiet neighborhood!

We were checked in via email prior to arrival. As other reviewers noted they had fresh pastries waiting for us from Fresh Flours that were scrumptious, I was barely willing to share the pear pastry with my husband. 

Stuart happened to be home when we arrived. He was very sweet and offered the use of a highchair/ booster seat that could be strapped onto a dining chair. This was such a life saver since it was the one home item I hadn't planned for (I'm a very organized planner) and certainly simplified feeding my daughter. They had also offered to have a pack and play ready for us which we didn't need since our hotel stay the previous weekend required us to travel with our own crib. 

Although the space is not grand in size it provides everything you could possibly need. Every time I thought of something I turned around and there it was. Even the lotion in the bathroom was paraben free! The space is incredibly well laid out and efficient. There is plenty of storage space if you want to unpack and feel at home, which we used, and there is literally a hook everywhere you think it would be nice to have one.

I will say that the height clearance is a bit tight as you would expect in a basement space. My husband is 6'2"" and bonked his head a could of times in the same place. The bedroom space is actually raised a couple inches and the ceiling is also lower in the walkway from the bedroom to the bathroom so just beware or avoid this area if you're tall. As other reviewers noted watch out for the bed since the base is a bit wider than the bed itself. I was conscious of it and still managed to stub my toes more than a few times. 

There is parking available but I think you'd need a truck or SUV to clear the lip just because of the grades between the street, the sidewalk and the driveway. We had a rented Nissan Ultima and unless we wanted to rip off the undercarriage it wasn't going to happen. Street parking was no problem for us and we were able to find space out front.

There are a bunch places within a couple of blocks to grab a bite or a latte. Bambino cafe was awesome (reeeeeealy good coffee), we also enjoyed Ridgeback cafe (beware the crepes are delicious but huge) and The Dray (nice drafts, good sammiches and decent sports bar- check it out if you're a soccer fan). Oh and if you're craving desert take a trip up to Phinney Ave and grab a slice of pie from Pies A La Mode, the sour cherry with Bluebird Creamery ice cream was ahhh-mazing."

The chocolate & raspberry croissants Kim left for us were so delicious and a great welcoming touch!  Everything was comfortable,plenty of room for us and and a well stocked kitchen!  The apt is extremely clean and well-appointed!  The heated floor in the bathroom is the very best!!!!!  
It is close to my very favorite coffe shop that ships coffee to me all the way to Boston...Herkimer on Phinney Ave!  That is a real plus!  Just sorry we did not get to meet Kim and her pooch!!  Hopefully we will when we return in April!  "

The Oasis is truly that--it is a wonderful place in a great neighborhood.

Kim and Stewart left breakfast pastries and coffee for the first morning, which was a very welcome gesture.

I highly recommend the Phinney Oasis!  Thanks again, Kim and Stewart."
74243	254340	10.0	10.0	12295528	The Phinney Oasis is lovely. Well appointed and  centrally located, it was the perfect place for us to stay during our business trip to Seattle. 
74244	254340	10.0	10.0	13011078	This little apartment was so perfect! Very comfortable and roomy. The hosts were very hospitable. The neighborhood was perfect for someone without a vehicle.

74246	254340	10.0	10.0	13863588	The suite was everything I needed for my stay, and the location was great for access to my work and interesting restaurants. 
74247	254340	10.0	10.0	14124455	My boyfriend and I were in town for a UW graduation and stayed at Phinney Oasis for about five nights. We loved it! Kim and Stewart were very gracious hosts and ensured our (very) late check-in was convenient and comfortable. We were also greeted by delicious pastries! The amenities in the apartment exceeded our expectations - we had to work from Seattle during the week and found it very convenient and enjoyable to work from there. If we return to Seattle, we will definitely check back with Phinney Oasis. It was my first Airbnb experience and now I am spoiled!
74248	254340	10.0	10.0	14390095	"I have stayed here several times and each time has been great. The place is clean, quiet, comfortable, and convenient to what I need to get done while in Seattle.

I'd be staying there again later on this summer's trip, but they were booked up for the time I wanted in July. So sad."
74249	254340	10.0	10.0	14742142	Great neighborhood! with ample, easy parking for a good-sized family van loaded with vacation gear. Attention to detail in the apartment made our stay pleasant. Highly recommended. Thank you Kim and Stewart!
74250	254340	10.0	10.0	15211459	Kim and Stuart were great hosts. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. The oasis offers a fine place for a good night's sleep :)
74251	254340	10.0	10.0	15596416	This was my second trip to Kim`s home, and I enjoyed it as much as the first, particularly enjoying the cool space during a hot Seattle spell.  Location worked really well for access to my office, and I was able to try out some of the recommended food choices.  Thank you Kim!
74252	254340	10.0	10.0	15875084	"Everything was exactly as described. The apartment was clean and well-organized.  The location was perfect! Explored ""stumbletown"" as well as golden gardens and the locks. Trudged up the hill to the zoo and Phinney Ridge on what may have been the hottest day this year...coming home to the cool of the basement was better than I had expected. Comfortable bed, ez parking. No worries all around. "
74253	254340	10.0	10.0	16856332	"Kim has a very nice house in a quiet but convenient location, about 3 blocks from a bus which took us downtown in about 20 minutes. The flat is very spacious and modern, and the bed was very comfortable. Kim made us feel very welcome and we had a great time in Seattle!

Next time I'm in Seattle the Oasis is high on my list!"
74254	254340	10.0	10.0	21014777	It is really reassuring to enter a rental and see healthy cleaning products. I have bad allergies and sensitivities and the Phinney Oasis was such a delight. Stewart was wonderful and extremely accommodating to my situation -- he checked in to make sure everything was OK and invited me to sit on their back patio with their lovely dog (which I did every day while the sun lasted). The rental was private, clean, cozy and safe -- and in a great neighborhood. In the mornings, I could hear the hosts walking above briefly, but otherwise the rental was quiet and peaceful. Highly recommended!
74255	254340	10.0	10.0	21940845	Had a fabulous time at the Phinney Oasis! We were greeted with pastries which were amazing. The place was clean and had everything listed on the description. The location was amazing... walking distance from restaurants and shops. 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle! I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Great value! 
74256	254340	10.0	10.0	22552567	I enjoyed my third time in the Phinney Oasis.  The facilities and location were perfect for my work.  Thank you Kim.

Thank you !  "
74258	254340	10.0	10.0	26078079	"We really enjoyed our stay at Kim's and Stewart's and we would thoroughly recommend their tastefully remodeled basement to anyone looking for temporary accommodation in Seattle. 

The place was exactly as described (if not better than expected). Besides, the peace and quiet of the neighborhood and the privacy provided by the hosts were much appreciated during the two stressful weeks we stayed there while on trial.

Also worth mentioning is the fact that communication with the hosts was excellent. We encountered a minor payment issue that took a minute to solve, but they were understanding, patient, and helpful toward its resolution.

In short: Five-star hosts. "
74259	254340	10.0	10.0	26614704	Our experience at Kim's was excellent! Everything is just as described in their listing. They immediately responded to our questions, Kim's husband was friendly and spent time explaining us how to go to places. I recommended without hesitation! Way to go guys! You were just superb!!
74260	254340	10.0	10.0	27267983	The Phinney Oasis is a wonderful place to stay. Kim and Stewart were excellent hosts.  The apartment is clean, the kitchen is well stocked, and the bed is so comfortable!

This is our second visit with Kim; outstanding accomodations is a great part of town; very friendly, as usual; can't go wrong here!
The ""welcome"" pastries are special and a unique touch you won't get elsewhere!"
74262	254340	10.0	10.0	29504121	We enjoyed staying in Kim's delightful apartment. The neighbourhood is quiet and there are convenience stores and restaurants within easy walking distance. The location was ideal for exploring Seattle and the accommodations were comfortable and fully equipped. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit.
74263	254340	10.0	10.0	30840412	Our stay was perfect! The neighborhood is really nice and the Oasis was super comfortable for two of us!!   The fresh scones were a pleasant surprise too.
74264	254340	10.0	10.0	31592143	Kim asked that we give her an approximate arrival time.  We were just unlocking the door when Stewart rode up on his bike.  He gave us some great restaurant reviews, most within walking distance.  I felt he and Kim were happy to have us and also happy to share their local knowledge.  The house is in a great neighborhood, many bars and restaurants nearby representing a range of price levels.  A short drive takes you to the Ballard area with more dining choices, interesting small shops and a working waterfront.  The apartment was great for us.  I was pleasantly surprised by the size (it is quite spacious) and by the heated bathroom floor! Glad they mentioned the low ceilings on the listing page.
74265	254340	10.0	10.0	32184026	Wonderful place, excellent location, awesome hosts. The #28 bus line was close by and easy to use, neighborhood cafes, restaurants, and Goodwill were great. We definitely recommend Kim's Phinney Oasis and would stay here again in a heartbeat.
74266	254340	10.0	10.0	33496231	Everything worked out great. I booked the apartment for my parents who were visiting me here in Seattle.  We got the code for the key box and arrived in a very clean and beautiful apartment. (The little welcome-pastry on the table was really nice). Btw my mom was in love with the modern washing machine ;)
74267	254340	10.0	10.0	34794623	Kim and Stuart were fantastic hosts. My family require a place to live as we waited to move into our new home; so we were looking for something comfortable. Kim and Stewart provided exactly this. One tiny internet problem was corrected in 5 mins! Fantastic. I highly recommend this Oasis in Phinney.  You won't be disappointed. 
74268	254340	10.0	10.0	35310172	Kim was a wonderful host!  She was an excellent communicator with emails and was extremely helpful in helping me reserve these dates.  She was kind enough to have two delicious pastries waiting for us upon our arrival.   She has a lovely apartment that was just perfect for our needs.  We were there to move our son's belongings into storage after completing another year at UW.  The apartment is conveniently situated about 10-15min from UW.   It is in a wonderful neighborhood.  We were within walking distance to a couple of nice coffee places and restaurants. We enjoyed pizza at the Ridge and we were able to watch the NBA finals and enjoy good food at the Park Public House. The apartment also has a very nice TV.  Kim was a very gracious host in accommodating our son who had to spend one night with us. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend the Phinney Oasis. 
74269	254340	10.0	10.0	36006985	Kim's apartment was perfect for our recent trip to Seattle.  It had all of the amenities we needed: full kitchen, living and eating areas, incredibly comfortable bed and as a bonus - a washer and dryer.  It was well located for my walks around Green Lake with my daughter and easy to access downtown and the other site we visited.  It was spotlessly clean and quiet - I would definitely recommend it.
74270	254340	10.0	10.0	36667956	The Oasis proved to be an excellent place to stay on our trip to Seattle. The unit was well-appointed, spotless upon arrival and comfortable throughout. The neighborhood is also, I think, perfectly located for those who want to explore the neighborhoods north of Lake Union. And on top of that, Kim and Stewart were such wonderfully pleasant hosts. If you're traveling to Seattle and the Phinney Oasis is available, your choice of where to stay should definitely be an easy one.
74271	254340	10.0	10.0	38133476	The apartment was clean, comfortable and nice and cool during the extremely hot weather.  Kim and Stewart are friendly and helpful.
74272	254340	10.0	10.0	41626832	"It was perfect! Great location and comfortable, spacious accommodations. 
They had tons of cooking utensils and supplies, which made it great for cooking meals at home. 
We will definitely stay here again!"
74273	254340	10.0	10.0	43621426	Your place was the perfect place for us to stay for the week we were in Seattle. We came and went from your neighborhood with ease any time of the day or evening whether we were there for a nap or for a night's rest. The entire apartment was fully appointed for comfort and convenience. We especially appreciated the nice touches of a heated (on a timer) bathroom floor while we were there, and a ceramic panel in the living area that provided us with radiant and convective heat for our early morning activities. We intend to recommend your place highly to any of our friends or acquaintances planning a trip to Seattle. Your B&B was the first AirB&B we've tried, and we've come away with a very favorable impression of both your place and the whole system. Many thanks!
74274	254340	10.0	10.0	44300428	The place was everything n more than what they describe to be! It was homely, cosy and within walking distance to almost everything! Will stay here again if I visit!
74275	254340	10.0	10.0	45111235	Phinney Oasis is exactly as as advertised and more. It is welcoming and feels very much like home. Many of Kim and Stewart's recommendations are within walking distance and are definitely worth checking out. Additionally a few bus stops are quite close and make travel to other neighborhoods a breeze. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a laid back location when staying in the Seattle area.
74276	254340	10.0	10.0	46146286	Kim and Stewart were great hosts. The apartment was very clean and they had pastries waiting for us when we arrived which was very thoughtful. There was a lot of parking and we were within walking distance to a ton of great restaurants and bars. 
74277	254340	10.0	10.0	47053685	Another great stay here - my mom has stayed here twice now when visiting me in Seattle, and it's worked out well for us. The apartment is spacious, fully stocked with cooking supplies, and a comfortable bed.  The owners always take care to leave a little treat for her upon her arrival, and they have designed and decorated the apartment to be very cozy and homey.  The neighborhood has great access to coffee shops, restaurants, and more.  The only downside would be that b/c you are below the home, you can hear footsteps/noise from above when the owners are home. Not a major disturbance. Definitely an excellent spot to stay!
74278	254340	10.0	10.0	48014607	Great place to stay- clean and convenient. 
74279	254340	10.0	10.0	48741268	Kim was really easy to get in contact with from the beginning and it stayed that way throughout my in-law's stay. We chose this spot because it's close to our place in Ballard and it was convenient for us. 
74280	254340	10.0	10.0	50321397	Oasis is an accurate description for this gem in Phinney Ridge. The apartment is quiet and clean with everything one could need, including washer and dryer, hairdryer, shampoo, washing powder, olive oil, spices, etc.. The bed is comfortable and there are plenty of extra blankets. The hosts are warm and welcoming, but are very respectful of one's privacy. They live above the apartment, so are easily accessible. A parking space was always available in front of the house. The pear tart and cookies on the table when I arrived were an especially thoughtful touch.  All in all, I could not have asked for a better experience. 
74281	254340	10.0	10.0	51473504	"A great experience all around. The place was centrally located, and within 15 minutes of nearly everything we wanted to do in Seattle. Lots of walkable things in the neighborhood, plenty of street parking too. The unit itself was perfect for what we needed (in addition to a bedroom, a living room and kitchen area are also in the unit). The ceilings are a little low (I'm 6'3"") but not a deal breaker at all. Kim and Stewart made us feel right at home with great restaurant suggestions as well. 10/10!"
74282	254340	10.0	10.0	53697335	This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have asked for better. Kim & Stewart's place in Phinney Ridge is clean, quiet, cozy, and extremely convenient to everywhere & everything we wanted to do in Seattle. Great location, with easy access to several bus lines & quick Uber/Lyft pickups. The place itself is fantastic and the communication with Kim & Stewart was excellent both before and during our stay. Our only regret is that our schedule was so hectic while in town that we never got to say hello or to thank them in person! Would absolutely stay again -- assuming it's not booked, of course!
74939	7872818	10.0	10.0	48854743	This was a fantastic airbnb experience. Judy and Bill were kind and welcoming, and the apartment is great. The bed is very comfortable, with soft cotton sheets and a down blanket. And the private bathroom is brand new and has a tub and separate shower. There's also a huge and beautiful outdoor space. A perfect stay in a beautiful city! I highly recommend. 
74940	7872818	10.0	10.0	48976656	A sumptuously comfortable bed and luxurious spa-like bathroom, coupled with a great location and relaxing outdoor garden, made my stay here a truly recharging experience. Add to that that Judy and Bill have thought of and attended to everything I might need -- a Nespresso coffee maker, tea kettle, refrigerator, microwave, not to mention of course soap, towels, body lotion, hair dryer, etc. Bedroom and bathroom have clearly been newly remodeled, and very tastefully. The deep enormous bathtub beckoned to me the whole time. The shower is modern with a satisfying stream. The location is good too-- step outside and you can see the space needle of downtown and the mountains on East and West. And it's less than a mile from UW, and under 30 minutes from the airport. But most of all, that bed, and those sheets! Truly blissful sleep. 
74941	7872818	10.0	10.0	49298342	"Judy and Bill hosted my girlfriend Fiona and I on very short notice as we passed through Seattle on a road trip.  They told us that they were new to being AirBnB hosts, but I wouldn't have guessed it if they didn't tell us!

The space is very cozy and comfy, warm, bright, and spacious.  We had our own entrance and our own garden which I wish we had more time to use!

A selection of coffees and teas, granola, yogurt, and fruit was waiting for us for the morning.  Plenty of towels in the beautiful bright bathroom.  Seattle books, maps, and magazines were available for browsing, but they gave us a good set of suggestions for places to eat dinner and breakfast both.

I would recommend their space to anyone staying in Seattle.  The neighborhood is quite and beautiful, not hard to find, and close to some quaint little neighborhood centers."
74942	7872818	10.0	10.0	49740066	Lovely hideaway!  We loved our stay and felt very much at home.  Being greeted by warm socks, a charming bedroom with private bath, and home made granola was a real treat.  The private garden is just a delight for anyone looking to unwind. The location is very convenient to hiking/biking trails, the U District, and to the highway. Judith and Bill are very accommodating and thoughtful. And there is free wifi to boot! The next time we visit Seattle, I hope we can stay again.
74943	7872818	10.0	10.0	49957199	Judith did a tremendous job with her Airbnb. The bed is comfortable with great down pillows. The place is immaculate and there are special touches throughout from cozy socks to wear, area magazines, and beautiful rugs in the bedroom and hallway. One truly feels like an honored guest. Be sure to read the booklet that Judith put together. This location is close to parks, the University of Washington, the Burke-Gilman Trail, and the University Village for shopping. Great restaurant list and reviews!
74944	7872818	10.0	10.0	51095961	I stayed in Seattle for the start of my vacation and had a wonderful experience with Judy and Bill. Their unit offered plenty of privacy, was located conveniently to small shops, and within walking distance of fabulous views of Mt. Rainier. I did not have a car, but still found it very easy to use public transportation. Judy was there when I arrived and permitted me to check-in early to their very well appointed basement unit. There were lots of thoughtful amenities and best of all the place was very clean and quiet. A great place to relax away from my usual downtown haunts. 
74945	7872818	10.0	10.0	51367388	Judy and Bill were wonderful hosts. The newly remodeled apartment was clean and a delightful place to sleep and hang out. Judy and Bill made me feel right at home. The location was perfect, close to Magnusson Park, the district and many great restaurants. Thank you.
74946	7872818	10.0	10.0	53998761	"I lived near this neighborhood for many years in Seattle and Judith's beautiful house and hospitality made me feel at home again. Everything during our stay was perfect, from the comfortable bed, to the excellent shower, to all the lovely amenities. 

Judith's homemade granola alone is worth a trip back! 

Although off the beaten path, this home is in a great part of Seattle and can really give you the flavor of living in one of Seattle's neighborhoods rather than being trapped amongst the tourists. 

Everything about this stay was easy and flawless. Judith provides excellent and detailed directions on access, wifi, and otherwise enjoying the space. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it."
74947	7872818	10.0	10.0	54767698	A wonderfully charming place with lovely hosts. Very clean and so comfortable. Good location too. 
74948	7872818	10.0	10.0	55863808	Judith's Secret Garden Retreat was absolutely perfect!  The studio is very well appointed. The bed is super comfy with high quality linens and pillows. The bath area is quite large complete with bath salts!  This is a special place and it is obvious Judith and her husband worked hard to make it that way. Probably the most tidy Air BnB I have had the pleasure of renting. Enjoy!  
74949	7872818	10.0	10.0	56668086	Judith and Bill made us feel very welcome. The neighborhood is quiet and very centrally located.
75990	8583457	10.0	10.0	50232449	We had a lovely stay at this beautiful house. The back yard and deck are enormous, and the house actually had peek-a-boo sound views. We enjoyed some beautiful sunsets. Candace was great and very accommodating. We checked in and found fresh fruit and a nice bottle of wine, as well as coffee and tea. And when we had trouble figuring out the heater, she and her husband came right over to help. We would definitely recommend this location. 
75991	8583457	10.0	10.0	51104503	The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

This home is right on Beach Drive, a great location for beachfront walks.  Very safe-feeling residential location. I stayed here with my college-age daughter, and we felt immediately at home as we walked in the door.  Le Petite Retreat is cozy, inviting, and spotless.   It has a lot of character, especially the way the Candace has maintained its architectural history while updating with a more modern design touch, especially in the living room and bedrooms.  My master bedroom was luxurious and spacious - Ioved the linens and duvet.  The second bedroom was also good-sized and very cozy for another guest, as two walls were nearly covered with built-in shelves containing books and board games.  The bath had one of the smallest showers I've been in but super cute, fun and well-supplied with amenities if you need them. My daughter loved it.  Really, this is a nice retreat home.  

The kitchen was extensively equipped with dishware and pans - we even cooked Thanksgiving dinner here for four.  Next time, actually, I hope to take more advantage of the multiple restaurants within walking distance.   Candace is very kind.  She left all kinds of wonderful treats for our arrival (which my two daughters practically devoured); the lights and heat were on when we arrived well after dinnertime.  She provided detailed and very clear  instructions and suggestions that we made good use of, and she was close and readily available for  assistance.   I will definitely try come back here anytime I come back to Seattle for future visits.  "

I strongly recommend her house for those who want to enjoy staying in Seattle.  I will definitely stay at Candace wonderful house next time i go down to Seattle with my family."
77226	6592178	10.0	10.0	35011217	Great place, great location, great trip! We really enjoyed staying at Nicole's place. It is definitely as good as advertised and then some! We got really lucky with weather and got to utilize the roof top deck, which is an amazing space. The location is within walking distance of mostly everything in the CapHill area and not too far from the downtown area as well. If I'm ever in Seattle again, I would love to stay at her place again!
77227	6592178	10.0	10.0	35835666	Thank you for such a great experience in your home. Everything was exactly as described. My friends and I appreciated how much you made the place feel like home. Such a great experience (especially loved the roof deck!).
77228	6592178	10.0	10.0	36431505	Nicole was great.  Her communication was frequent and helpful.  The snacks she left out were greatly appreciated.
77229	6592178	10.0	10.0	41864570	I could not be happier with my stay in Seattle.  Nicole was so helpful  settings things up, preparing the place and providing local insight.  The house was incredible top to bottom, plus Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood.  Nicole left us refreshments to enjoy upon our arrival, gave us plenty of info about the place and even sent all of her favs from the n'hood.  So many cool amenities and and a perfect rooftop deck to enjoy, as well.  This review could not do it justice.  If (and when) I return to Seattle, this is will be my #1 choice for accommodations.  Exactly how Airbnb should work.   Thanks again Nicole!

77583	4388148	9.0	10.0	22410723	We had a lovely experience at Jordan's studio! Jordan was helpful and very quick to respond to our last-minute questions about check-in/out, wifi, keys, etc. The apartment itself was simple and clean, very comfortable for two people.

77585	4388148	9.0	10.0	22545805	Our stay in Jordan's suite was great! The place was clean, bed was comfortable and location was awesome - street parking was a bit tricky but we eventually found a spot down the street. Applesauce was the sweetest kitty ever and made the experience even better.  
77586	4388148	9.0	10.0	22742736	We had a great stay at Jordan's apartment! Jordan was quick to respond to questions we had and the apartment was lovely with many snuggles from the cutest cat ever. We really enjoyed staying here.
77587	4388148	9.0	10.0	22846331	Great neighborhood to stay in and the apartment is as advertised. Jordan went out of his to accommodate an earlier check-in time. Also, awesome cat! 
77588	4388148	9.0	10.0	22988457	Jordan was an incredible host. He made sure everything in the place was set up for us, offered up restaurant suggestions, and kept communication smooth and fluid. Great location and vibes. Cannot say enough nice things.

77590	4388148	9.0	10.0	23244342	Jordan is a very flexible host. We had no problems coordinating. The apt. is as described: a studio with kitchen and bath. We had the pleasure of hosting the cat, also, who is super nice and friendly. He's easy and comes and goes. The location is amazing for breakfast and dinner: Olympia Pizza & Costal kitchen are fantastic. The Wander Goose for breakfast is amazing. Not to mention the cafes. Don't forget the Asian Art Museum and grave of Bruce Lee that is right around the corner. 
77591	4388148	9.0	10.0	23638220	Had a great time in Seattle staying here. The cat is very chill and was no additional work. The place is also walking distance to a lot of great pubs. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Seattle:)
77592	4388148	9.0	10.0	23766989	Great little place, convenient to one of the best parts of town. I recommend a walk through the greenhouse conservatory in Volunteer park. Comfy bed and adorable cat. I would stay again.

The cat is adorable! Very lovely :) "
77594	4388148	9.0	10.0	23994902	"We were welcomed with a bottle of wine. He checked up on us later that night to make sure we got settled OK.  The neighborhood was beautiful and we enjoyed walking around admiring the neighborhood's personality. The bus stop was near giving us easy transport to downtown. The ONLY downside was the construction sites next door. 
Applesauce was charming and cuddly. So friendly and made the place more homy. 
Great value for the location. Worked great for our purposes. "
77595	4388148	9.0	10.0	24182646	Me and my boyfriend absolutely enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Jordan's appartment matched the description, and we had a great time there. It was really cozy to have Applesauce, Jordan's cat around :) The only negative thing was that there was a lot of noise from the heating element in the room and from the construction site outside the window. 
77596	4388148	9.0	10.0	25259602	Cute, clean place as shown in pics. Applesauce the cat was adorable and led us right to the correct apartment. Only two blocks to a street with many options for dining. Didn't hear any of the construction others mentioned, so maybe they don't work weekends or the project is done. Host responded quickly, with clear instructions. Would stay again.
77597	4388148	9.0	10.0	25325628	Jordan's place was great. To start off with, Applesauce is one of the nicest cats I've ever met. Jordan's apartment was tidy and well decorated, and there was plenty of space for two or three people. The area is close to lots of restaurants and bars, and public transportation was easy to access. Jordan left us a bottle of wine, and was in touch quickly when contacted. Would definitely stay again.
77598	4388148	9.0	10.0	25551623	"Jordan apartment was perfect for my weekend getaway to Seattle! It has all the basics i needed for a comfortable stay. The cat was cute and friendly, no trouble at all.
However, what really stand out about his place is the location, ultra convenient to lots of shops, cafes, and restraurants, all were steps away. If i need to get down to lower capitol hill, and didn't feel like to walk, Uber is easy and inexpensive to use. This was my first time using Airbnb in over 2 years and was a great experience. Thanks Jordan!!"
77599	4388148	9.0	10.0	26511744	"Jordan was very quick to respond and was very helpful with my forst experience with an airbnb stay.  The location was great with a walgreens less than a block away and also with lots of nice restaurants, bars and coffee shops close by.  There was a safeway a couple of blocks down and it was about a 15-20 minute walk to the Capitol Hill area where there are more bars, restaurants, etc.  

All in all it was a great, last minute 1 night stay and we were lucky to find this place in the area for such a great price."
77600	4388148	9.0	10.0	26912437	We didn't meet Jordan during our 4-night stay, but everything was easily arranged and the key was exactly where he said it would be.  The cozy studio suited our needs and is conveniently located in a great neighborhood steps from cafes, restaurants, bars, markets, pharmacy, a great bakery, and public transportation.  There is a pretty view of the sunrise from the kitchen window.  Jordan's cat was very friendly and took care of itself.
77601	4388148	9.0	10.0	27255348	We didn't meet Jordan however the apartment was exactly what we needed. Comfortable, clean and extremely cheerful place with lots of great natural lighting. The best part was the location - just blocks away from great restaurants and bars and made it extremely convenient.  Applesauce, the cat, was another charming addition to the apartment and even though he kept to himself mostly, it made the experience all the more fun. Highly recommended, would certainly stay here again.
77602	4388148	9.0	10.0	27912515	The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
77603	4388148	9.0	10.0	28702506	The space, location, and host were amazing! Jordan was quick at getting back to me whenever I had a question and was very accomodating. It was our first time in Seattle and it turned out so well in part by being able to stay at Jordan's rental. The space was cozy and welcoming and very comfortable for two. The bed and couch and pillows are highly recommended as they allowed for a very comfortable stay. Applesauce was the perfect little housemate, she's so friendly and low maintenance. Everything was close by. We walked EVERYWHERE and when our feet complained there were bus stops conveniently located nearby. Good restaurants surrounded us; we had lovely breakfasts a couple of blocks away every morning before heading out to explore the city. I cannot recommend this place enough. Coastal Kitchen, Jamjuree, Harry's Bar and Olympia Pizza were a couple of favorites nearby.
77604	4388148	9.0	10.0	29049300	Nice little spot outside of downtown. Walking distance to restaurants and bars. 
77605	4388148	9.0	10.0	30387653	The apartment was great for our needs, and well priced for what we got.  Note that there is a flight of stairs to climb.  Everything was prepared for our arrival.  Capitol Hill location is excellent; 15th Ave is just one block over, with abundant coffee shops, good restaurants, craft beer bars, etc.  It's in a small apartment building in a quiet and very attractive neighborhood.  Will very likely stay again.
77606	4388148	9.0	10.0	31177171	We arrived a little early and Jordan welcomed us in with a nice chat about the local places.   Great neighborhood with lots of bars, coffee shops, grocery stores and major bus routes within a few blocks. The apartment was properly represented and we were even able to do some laundry in the coin op machines downstairs.  Jordan was quick with communication if we had any questions.  Applesauce the cat had important things to do outside but would pencil us in for some belly rubs, playtime and cuddling.  The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was easy to use. We would definitely stay again.
77607	4388148	9.0	10.0	32916608	Jordan was so accommodating! The apartment had all the basic hotel essentials - he even threw in some beverages and a train pass!! The apartment was near all the things we needed - amazing food, good shopping and uniques sites.
77608	4388148	9.0	10.0	33626101	We had a great time at Jordan's place. Was located near many great restaurants, coffee shops and a grocery store. Apartment was clean and was a comfortable space to live in for a few days. 
77609	4388148	9.0	10.0	34117567	Jordan's studio apartment is an older style but is functional and clean. Importantly there is WiFi and good TV; exactly what a tired traveler sometimes needs.
77610	4388148	9.0	10.0	34362561	Stayed at Jordan's place with my girlfriend for 2 nights. Excellent location - walking distance from great food+drink options. Place was pretty much as described/pictured. A little dusty but not too bad. It is a little difficult to find parking but not much to do about that but be patient. We didn't actually meet Jordan - but he was responsive to our texts and messages and we had no trouble. Overall a positive experience. 
77611	4388148	9.0	10.0	35584449	It was very nice to stay at Jordan's apartment! The neighborhood was quiet and safe and convenient! There was a little construction noise, but it was fine since it only started after around 10am. The cat Applesauce was a very lovely cat! We enjoyed playing with her. We would always expect to see her at he front door when we came back home. She is definitely something special during the stay!
77612	4388148	9.0	10.0	35836367	Jordan's place was exactly as described. We were so happy to have a cute kitty that would come and go as it pleased! It was very easy to find the location and super convenient to a lot of shops and restaurants. The parking is the only thing that was a little tough but that's what you get when ur in a city. I definitely recommend this place and we would stay again if we passed thru Seattle!
77613	4388148	9.0	10.0	36419354	Perfectly described and Jordan was kind enough to leave some refreshments in the fridge for me. Great communication and easy to work with the entire time. In addition, highly recommend for convenience and location.
77614	4388148	9.0	10.0	36648729	"Great place, very comfy bed, Chromecast is a big plus!
Applesauce is a sweety, always around for some love and belly rubs.
Bit of construction noise but nothing crazy. Also quite warm but when it's 30°c + outside that's just a given!
Overall great place, you won't be disappointed!"
77615	4388148	9.0	10.0	37105905	Jordan's place was outstanding! The apartment is located in a really fun neighborhood with numerous places to eat and drink within a block. The apartment was very clean, kitchen was stocked. Jordan made every attempt to make us feel welcome, from leaving the window fan on (during Seattle's record-breaking heat wave!) to stocking the fridge with bottled water! He was very good at communicating and it felt like we were staying with a friend instead of a stranger. The apartment was just a joy to stay in, impeccably decorated and the cat Applesauce was very friendly. The bed was comfortable, and the even though the shower was small the water pressure was on point. This was my first time using Airbnb and now I'm hooked!
77616	4388148	9.0	10.0	38438588	Jordan's apartment has a lot of charm and made my stay in Seattle enjoyable. It's within walking distance to so much - good restaurants, coffee shops, grocery store and bus line - all which I found very convenient. The addition of Applesauce was such a bonus too - very cool cat!
77617	4388148	9.0	10.0	38657667	Wonderful experience! The apartment was very clean and cozy. The bed was super comfy. It's located in a very safe area and the neighborhood was really cute. The owner's cat was there, and she's such a sweetie pie! Felt like I was home. Will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle.
77618	4388148	9.0	10.0	39206982	Jordan was very welcoming and accommodating! Apartment was cute and clean and bed was comfortable. Location was perfect -- very close to lots of shops and restaurants and a pretty easy walk to downtown. 
77619	4388148	9.0	10.0	39851930	"Jordan's little studio apartment made our short stay in Seattle spectacular! 
It was very nicely furnished and he had kindly stocked up everything for his guests. From the stocked fridge to all the toiletries in the bathroom, Jordan provided us with a great stay. 
His studio is located in Capitol Hill where safeway and local food stores are close and convenient. 
We couldnt be more happier with out stay! "
77620	4388148	9.0	10.0	40375498	What a great spot in a great location! If you are looking to be near the hub of Capitol Hill, this is the spot. Clean and airy, the apartment was perfect for two people. Jordan was so helpful and getting in and out was a breeze. Would definitely come back!
77621	4388148	9.0	10.0	40966046	Had a great experience! Jordan was extremely accommodating. The apartment was nice and clean.  It is a great location, next to good restaurants and transportation.

77625	4388148	9.0	10.0	43819185	Capitol Hill was a perfect location for our first trip to Seattle. Our airbnb was near grocery stores, delicious restaurants, trendy bars, convenient public transportation, attractions and sites, and everything necessary to make for a successful trip. The listing was very comfortable and clean and the towels and bath amenities were a major plus for someone who had to pack light. It's located in a quiet neighborhood, so sleeping at night with windows slightly open was not an issue at all. Jordan was very accommodating and helpful! Would definitely stay again. Wish we got to meet Applesauce!
77626	4388148	9.0	10.0	44585686	"Pros: Jordan's place had the ideal location right in the heart of Capitol Hill. With this prime location, the apartment is still very quiet and I had no trouble sleeping and relaxing there. I really appreciated how clean and tidy the place was when I arrived.  Pictures of the space are accurate. I will add: The bed is super comfy.

Host: Jordan was a responsive host and was thoughtful enough to leave me snacks and food for my stay. 

Cons: Like many Seattle apartments, this one has an old built-in carpet. Not much you can do about that; and this is very evident in the pictures. But: If you have allergies, take note."
77627	4388148	9.0	10.0	44807277	Comfortable place in a great neighborhood! Jordan was an excellent host and very communicative. Definitely recommend this place as a base to enjoy Capitol Hill. 
77628	4388148	9.0	10.0	45122888	We loved the location of Jordan's apartment. It was a great base to explore the Capitol Hill area of lovely Seattle. The bed was super comfy too!
77629	4388148	9.0	10.0	46014290	Never met Jordan but he was very friendly and accomodating. The place was everything I had expected from reading the review. Bus 10 picked up a short 3 min walk away and took us to the middle of downtown Seattle. There were also some great places to eat and a couple of grocery stores within very close walking distance. It was a great stay here!
77630	4388148	9.0	10.0	47825106	The place was easy to find and was exactly as listed. The fridge was stocked with water and breakfast foods, and all were offered to me which was great! Jordan always responded to questions instantly so communication was very good. The place was also one block away from a street full of restaurants, so plenty of food options close by. Would definitely stay again!
77631	4388148	9.0	10.0	48153729	Great location and terrific host. Perfect place to walk to broadway, 15th, parks, and if you like long walks, downtown. Jordan was very accommodating and replied almost immediately to every question we had. Also left necessities in bathroom and kitchen. Highly recommend!
77632	4388148	9.0	10.0	48747050	Jordan was in the area when we arrived at his apartment so he was able to stop by and give us the keys personally. Jordan was very thoughtful - when we arrived he had a bottle of wine and 2 glasses out for us. He also left bottled water, orange juice, Greek yogurt, eggs, bacon, and English muffins in the refrigerator for us to eat for breakfast. Jordan was accessible throughout our stay; I had to contact him for help getting Netflix to work and he responded very quickly. It is a small space but this is advertised in the listing so I was not surprised. Overall, Jordan was a very accommodating host.
77633	4388148	9.0	10.0	49957742	Great experience with Jason and this apartment.  Nice and clean little place, great location.
77634	4388148	9.0	10.0	51189516	Jordan was such a good host! He gave full description how to locate the key and everything and he also made sure that we had a good stay and even left food and wine in the refrigerator! Location was good, close to bars and restaurants, which I wanted and it wasn't far from downtown! But be aware, parking sucks at night but other than that, had a good stay at Jordan's place. When I go back to Seattle, I know where to stay again!
77635	4388148	9.0	10.0	51981472	Jordan certainly went above and beyond by leaving us a bottle of wine and a fully stocked fridge.  We loved the neighborhood and felt very at home!
77636	4388148	9.0	10.0	52540434	Once again, I had a lovely stay at Jordan's. Clean, cozy, in a fantastic location, and I adore his cat, Applesauce! Will very likely stay here again. 
77637	4388148	9.0	10.0	57169492	Where to begin.. Jordan's apartment is awesome. It is in a wonderful part of town and has every amenity you could want without feeling like a hotel. The bed is like sleeping on a cloud and the bathroom is large and luxurious, with white fluffy towels. We will absolutely be staying here in the future. His apartment made for the best anniversary getaway imaginable!
77638	4388148	9.0	10.0	58378385	Jordan made our stay great - starting with leaving a bottle of wine! He was happy to offer his help in getting to know the area or give suggestions regarding anything in the city. The neighborhood was great and was walking distance to restaurants, bars and even a Walgreens. We loved our stay and Jordan was a great host!
77781	5164194	9.0	10.0	28837812	This place is absolutely fantastic. It is on the 3rd floor of the house and has a stunning view of Lake Washington and Bellevue via a private balcony. It is conveniently located in Capital Hill, with various bars and grocery stores within walking distance. The Cerfs are gracious and polite. They were really nice to chat with whenever we passed each other. It is a very quiet and relaxing spot, with lots of privacy. I would rent this location for a longer period if I could. 
77782	5164194	9.0	10.0	31329161	Nice sized room with a great view and good light. Hosts are very welcoming and helpful.
77783	5164194	9.0	10.0	48391374	Overall, this was a terrific location to stay at during my month in Seattle.  I primarily chose this site due to its location being in such close proximity to where I would be working (a little over a mile away).  Plus, there is great public transport with bus stops close.  Lynn and Randy were very welcoming, always in communication and made me feel right at home when I arrived.  This room specifically is it's own floor with a private deck that provides gorgeous views of the lake, pointing you directly at downtown Bellevue with the cascades in the background.  No private bathroom, but the common bathroom on the second floor is well kept and it was not a problem sharing with the 1 or 2 other occupants who were renting other rooms.  The neighborhood is quiet, there was always available street parking if you do have a car, and all necessities (groceries, drug store, restaurants, coffee shops, ect) were in close walking distance, no more than 10-15 minutes on foot.  And, if you are a runner, this house is just uphill from the Arboretum, which I made ample use of as a running route during my stay.  I would gladly stay with Lynn and Randy again if my travels do bring me back to Seattle.  Thank you both for the excellent lodging.
78681	5969069	10.0	10.0	31066813	"The accommodation was exactly as described, if not more impressive! The area is a beautiful residential neighbourhood, with lots of trees, flowers, etc. It's also a very quiet area.

Adam is a great host. He is fast w/ his responses and provided helpful guidance. Upon my arrival at the location, Adam met me in person and walked me around the apt. 

As mentioned, the accommodation is amazing. Spacious and modern - incl. a large washer and dryer (separate units) that worked very well. The kitchen is also fully equipped with modern equipment and beautiful plates, cutlery, etc. All that you would need was provided for.

There is a large Safeway about 10mins walk away and there are bus stops close by (I mainly used Uber and it was very easy for them to find the location).

The private garden was great to sit out in during the afternoons and enjoy the sun and peace."
78682	5969069	10.0	10.0	32072838	Adam's place is amazing. My friend and I had a great time staying there. The space is great and the location was continent and in a good neighborhood. We've already decided that if we ever go back to Seattle, this would be the place to stay!
78683	5969069	10.0	10.0	32622904	I loved the spot it. I thought it was only better in person! Adam was an amazing host and was there to answer any questions I had. Would love to stay there in the future.
78684	5969069	10.0	10.0	41584797	"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I couldn't be happier having Adam be the host for this first experience. Not only was this place exactly as it looked in pictures, but everything was just as it was described. Adam was kind and always very thoughtful. We didn't get to interact too often, but whenever we did it was always very pleasant. He was also always there through email or text if we ever needed anything. 

The place itself is a great location in a very nice little neighborhood. It's just a few blocks from coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants and more! Its also a safe neighborhood filled with great neighbors. There is street parking, and it's never an issue finding a spot which was great. The backyard is also a very nice place to just relax and hangout. The only thing to keep in mind is that it is a basement apartment and depending on who is upstairs, the footsteps can be pretty loud and there isn't much you can do about it because its no ones fault! We got used to it over time and Adam did warn about it so it was fully expected and not too bad! Overall though, I absolutely loved the place. I was here for 2 1/2 months during a summer internship and had never been to Seattle before, and I felt right at home. 

So thank you Adam, again, for everything! You made my stay so special."

""Fully furnished"" can really be a crap shoot, but this had everything we needed to comfortably settle in and even entertain guests from out of town. Adam was incredibly helpful, giving us awesome recommendations for the area and quickly addressing any small things that came up. "
78686	5969069	10.0	10.0	57040047	"Adam was very friendly and helpful from the very beginning. He responded in a timely manner to emails which left no questions unanswered at all. Adam contacted me the day before check-in with easy instruction on how to get in as well as internet passwords and other helpful information about the place. We never had the chance to meet Adam in person, but he was such a great host when we had minor questions throughout our trip. He was extremely responsive to text messages and always did his best to accommodate us.

We were traveling with a German shepherd, so it was great that Adam allowed us to stay even with our large dog. The basement apartment was perfect for our one week stay in Seattle. The living room was very spacious with a large TV complete with Netflix. Although we didn't use it much, the kitchen was cute and had any dishes and cutlery you could possibly need. There were 2 bedrooms and a small bathroom with many clean towels available. The pictures show exactly what you will get if you decide to stay at this lovely urban oasis.

Not only was the place perfect, it's location was central to everything. Everywhere we wanted to go was no more than 20 minutes away and there were so many nearby restaurants to try, that we were able to try so many different foods without repeating cuisines. It was great! It sucks that it was cold and rainy during our visit, but we would definitely consider staying here again if we come back to Seattle."
78687	5969069	10.0	10.0	57876108	This apartment was FABULOUS! When we arrive the place was spotless and clean, the heat was on and our beds were already made! Adam had all the essentials we needed to get started; toilet paper, paper towels, dish/hand soap, coffee and bottled water. The internet, flat-screen TV and kitchen appliances were easy to use. The private yard was a big plus for our visiting four-legged friends. Although this place is dog friendly there were no signs of previous dogs living here as the place was spotless and it smelled very fresh and clean. Everything was very organized and tidy so we were able to find everything we needed in the kitchen. Adam was quick to respond to any of my questions and was very helpful! We will definitely be booking again for our next stay. FIVE STARS!!

For the price this place is well worth the money. Fremont is an awesome place and this is an absolute bargain for staying right in the heart of the bars and food places.

Would stay again if back in Seattle one day."
81319	5892185	10.0	10.0	30811359	Great place to stay! Quiet, easy to get to, easy parking, very accommodating hosts. Emily was actually out of town when I was there but her boyfriend Ryan was home. We never actually met because our schedules were opposite of each other, but he left me delicious homemade scones! Wonderful experience all around!
81320	5892185	10.0	10.0	31809432	Host very gracious, friendly, and accommodating. The room is clean, quiet, comfortable, and well-equipped with all essentials and more. The location is excellent, close to everything you need. Highly recommended!
81321	5892185	10.0	10.0	34129162	Emily is a very good host. She was very flexible, welcoming and responsive to any questions you may have. The room is cozy and exactly as described. She even provides ample maps, guides, and personal suggestions. The location is in a nice neighborhood within walking distances to bars and restaurants and super close to public transport. Thanks Emily and Ryan! 
81322	5892185	10.0	10.0	35000577	A lovely space, very clean and simple. Emily made it very easy for us to come and go. She was always available to answer our questions about the area. Aside from one occasionally noisy neighbor, the apartment was very quiet.   Thank you!!
81323	5892185	10.0	10.0	35356286	Seattle is a cool city, and my time there was made all the more friendly with Emily showing me around her neck of the woods in Fremont. We walked around the neighbourhood, had great chats, got bites to eat and drinks to... well, drink. A very casual experience for a pretty chilled out place. :)
81324	5892185	10.0	10.0	35515791	Emily was a friendly and wonderful host! I only stayed for one night, but the place is clean, convenient, and well-suited for travelers staying for a short amount of time. The bed was extremely comfy! The Fremont neighborhood is quaint and convenient, with a bus line that takes you right to the Seattle Center and downtown. I must add that I forgot my shirt after I checked out, but Emily traveled all the way down to my office to hand it to me since I was unavailable the whole day. Emily is amazing. Overall I had a great experience, thanks again Emily!
81325	5892185	10.0	10.0	35719313	Super GREAT!!!  Went for a mom daughter birthday weekend. Very clean and awsome location.  Bed was comf'ee and we will defiantly use this again. Host was great and easy to deal with. ;) thank you 
81326	5892185	10.0	10.0	36077534	The host canceled this reservation 50 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
81327	5892185	10.0	10.0	37217436	Emily was a wonderful host - very friendly but not overbearing. She gave us a lot of suggestions as to what was in the area and how to get the best views of fireworks for 4th of July. The location was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Seemless check in/check out. Also a great location,  easy walking distance to resturaunt, bars, the troll and a bus line stops right across the street to take you downtown.
81328	5892185	10.0	10.0	38005242	My stay in Fremont was wonderful. You couldn't ask for a better location to experience Seattle. Emily wasn't home when I arrived but she had let me know in advance & her boyfriend Ryan was there instead. Ryan was super helpful, from finding me wandering around lost to offering suggestions of places to visit. The neighborhood has a nearly endless supply of restaurants, breweries, and bars. Plus it is right by a bus stop if you want to explore other neighborhoods. I highly recommend Emily's place if you're coming through seattle. 
81329	5892185	10.0	10.0	38667213	Emily was polite and easy to communicate with. Her apartment is a great way to experience Fremont and Seattle.
81330	5892185	10.0	10.0	39086002	Clean and quiet room in a nice neighborhood.
81331	5892185	10.0	10.0	39545582	Emily and Ryan were helpful hosts. They provided great recommendations of places to visit in Seattle. Their place was very nice, clean and comfortable - conveniently located.  The Fremont neighborhood is great - lots of restaurants, stores and close to everything in Seattle. 
81332	5892185	10.0	10.0	40787885	Our flight got in after midnight, and Emily was very accommodating to us to let us come that late! She was very polite and was even kind enough to provide us with bus passes one day. There were helpful maps and guides in the room too. The towels were absolutely luxurious! I wouldn't recommend this room for two people who aren't comfortable getting super close in bed - the bed was just a little too small for two friends. Location was good - we were glad we stayed in Fremont. Gasworks Park was our favorite! 
81333	5892185	10.0	10.0	45813094	"I didn't get a chance to meet Emily, but her apt is clean and comfortable. Check in was well coordinated and Emily was easy to reach on the phone. The best part about this apt is the location. Close to everything in Fremont, which is a highly desirable neighborhood in Seattle. 

The only minor thing is the sink and bathtub are a little clogged."
81334	5892185	10.0	10.0	46195658	Staying here was excellent, everything was very neat and clean! It was a comfortable space in a great location - close to a lot of great restaurants and bars!
81335	5892185	10.0	10.0	47380065	I'd definitely stay again! Emily and Ryan were welcoming and interesting; the room itself was spacious, clean, and well-organized. Sharing the apartment with them was uncomplicated. I used the kitchen (and fridge!) without feeling like I was in their way and there was no problem waiting for the shower, etc. Street parking was easy to find, and the apartment is right on a major bus line, so I could get to and from downtown in fifteen minutes as early or late as I needed to. Fremont is a cool neighborhood well worth exploring, with interesting shops, restaurants, bars, galleries and an excellent grocery store. The apartment is a five-minute walk from the heart of Fremont, so it's a great place to be, whether you have business downtown (as I did) or just want to explore a funky, fun neighborhood (which I also did).  Thanks, Emily and Ryan!
81336	5892185	10.0	10.0	47662986	Emily was an excellent host!  My mother said she had a great stay. They barely saw each other due to busy schedules, but it's great that my mother was able to come and go as she needed to. Thank you Emily!
81337	5892185	10.0	10.0	51555148	Emily and Ryan were very welcoming, I felt at home. We had a few nice conversations but I had plenty of space to do my own thing. Great neighborhood also. Lots to do in the area!
81338	5892185	10.0	10.0	58418611	Emily and her partner Ryan were great hosts. It was easy to check in, come and go, and check out. Plus Fremont is a fantastic neighborhood and was the perfect home base for exploring.
82191	7821351	10.0	10.0	45319185	Beate was a great host. Her place is amazing and very close to great restaurants. I highly recommend this apartment :)
82192	7821351	10.0	10.0	46179080	Beate was a great host, providing all needed information, and easy to communicate with. The townhouse is wonderful - very comfortable, very nicely decorated, all needed amenities and great location, easy access by bus and easy to park, fun shops and restaurants right nearby, and close to many interesting neighborhoods and parks and downtown. Would strongly recommend, without any hesitations and looking forward to staying there again if I can. 
83130	5673552	10.0	10.0	30740955	"So very perfect for us, this lovely loft! We were in Seattle for less than 48 hrs, and were hanging with family and friends almost all of the time, but this place is SO awesome, I wanted to move in! ;) And I live in a national scenic area in The Cascades of The PNW, on forest land that is deeply sacred & beautiful to me; land I give my soul to, that enriches my life beyond measure.
This lovely loft has a personality. I'm an painter & not a writer, but let me continue on by saying this: it is clean, arty, organized, resides in a great neighborhood, & belongs to organized, friendly hosts. While we did not meet them, we communicated back & forth, & felt very welcomed, while at the same time getting the personal space we always seem to need when traveling. 
Thank you, Brittney, for everything. And, thank you for the extras, like the wine! We brought a couple bottles & micros to share w/fam, but as usual, that all got gone very fast, so it was nice to come back ""home"" to the loft & to a bottle of ""drinkable now"" red. 
Having adventured quite a bit, for such a hip place, I must comment on the bed (yeah; I realize I'm showing my age here). The bed was wonderfully firm & very cozy comfortable. This loft was so very well equipped for our purposes. As world adventurers that visit the great Fremont/Ballard area of Seattle often, we're so delighted to have found this beautiful, well-loved loft in downtown Fremont! We hope to be back soon & will happily recommend it to friends & family."
83131	5673552	10.0	10.0	32579738	Brittney's place is great! Our group of 4 spent 3 nights in Seattle (first time for all), and were very pleased with the location in Fremont as a base for our activities. The place is on nice urban neighborhood corner with light traffic, but is less than a 5 minute walk from awesome shops, coffee, food, and some bars (fremont brewing was really good). The bus stop was also only a 5 minute walk away, and it will get you right downtown to pike place market in about 20 minutes. The place was really unique being in an old store front, the perfect open space for a small group or couple (late night games of foosball were fun). Place was very clean. Even better were Brittney's notes and tips on things to do (very professionally laminated/put together) and to top it all off she left us two bottles of wine! Brittney made a solid effort to be a professional host. If you like hip neighborhoods, a nice helpful host, and are looking for a unique place to stay, I definitely recommend this place. 
83132	5673552	10.0	10.0	33142027	Brittney's loft in Fremont is fabulous!  I would recommend the loft and the location to anyone looking to have a fun and adventurous vacation in Seattle.  We were a group of three girls and it was plenty of room for us. The loft is decorated beautifully and is such a unique space. It was also extremely clean and organized. We thoroughly enjoyed not only the accommodations but also the neighborhood, which has fantastic restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance.  There is also a beautiful running path by the canal which is easily accessible from the loft.  Brittney made us feeling extremely welcome and provided various comforts we weren't expecting like wine, snacks and toiletries. She left us maps and an awesome restaurant/bar resource book as well. She was also very easy to get in touch with to arrange the key exchange and the check out process.  Can't say enough wonderful things about this experience :) Thank you Brittney!
83133	5673552	10.0	10.0	34338288	Absolutely beautiful industrial loft that was so homey and comfortable! The surrounding area is full of tons of fun stuff to do, great restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and all within easy walking distance. Brittney was very helpful and easy to get in contact with when I had questions. She also provided lots of little things to make the stay even easier. It took my husband and myself no time at all to feel like (and wish) this was our home. He would also like me to add that the internet is great :)
83134	5673552	10.0	10.0	35186947	Brittney's studio is so amazingly open and cozy at the same time! Checkin went smoothly and she had great recommendations for local fun. Very quick to communicate and 10/10 would stay here again.
83135	5673552	10.0	10.0	35806305	Loft was great - very clean, comfortable and well-equipped.  Host made everything very easy and made herself available in case she was needed (which she wasn't).  Fremont is a great part of Seattle, close to downtown, but with it's own unique, interesting character.  Loft is on a nice street in a convenient location within easy walking distance of downtown Fremont.  This was our first Airbnb rental and we were a bit nervous, but this turned out to be a great alternative to a first class hotel. We would definitely stay here again. 
83136	5673552	10.0	10.0	37148692	Brittney was an excellent host and communicator she quickly responded to each inquiry with professional and thorough information.   Her tastefully designed loft is centrally located in the Fremont area and walking distance to many great places.  She left us thoughtful amenities, crispy clean sheets and plenty of fluffy towels.  I recommend staying in Brittney's care if you are traveling to Fremont.
83137	5673552	10.0	10.0	40950366	"Brittney was an amazing host!  She was always quick to respond to any questions I had and the check-in/check-out process was an absolute breeze.  The loft space itself was even more amazing than the photos make it out to be, if you can believe it.  It is walking distance from a seemingly unlimited number of bars and restaurants and a relatively short cab ride to anywhere else we wanted to go.

When I make it back to Seattle I'll have my fingers crossed that I can stay here again!"
83138	5673552	10.0	10.0	46152489	This was a wonderful apartment to stay in - very clean and comfortable and located in a 'quieter' part of Fremont. We were greeted with 2 complimentary bottles of wine, such a nice treat! We were looking for a place near where our son lives, which is near 'The Troll' and this was perfect. We were able to walk to nearby coffee shops and the Fremont Brewery (awesome). The only thing that took some getting used to was that there were no coverings on the upstairs windows - we felt like people could see us dressing etc. in the bedroom. 
83139	5673552	10.0	10.0	51771998	This place is an example of minimalistic living!  It was a good location for us as we explored the city of Seattle!
83495	7735100	9.0	10.0	42962443	Roger definitely made us feel welcome by accommodating our late-night check-in and responding quickly to any questions we had during our stay. The location of his place is great for walking anywhere in Fremont and we loved the recommendations he had for the area. There was plenty of room for all of our things and the place was spotless.
83496	7735100	9.0	10.0	44469361	"This room was PERFECT for me and fit my needs exactly. It's nicer than the hotel rooms I stayed in during other legs of the trip and definitely fit the budget better. It's a bedroom in a 3-bedroom apartment duplex. Rumor has it that someone lives in at least one of the other rooms, but I didn't see them during the two nights I stayed here. The bathroom is attached to the bedroom, so that's convenient. And this place is located in a very cool neighborhood within walking distance from tons of great spots. I even walked all the way to Pike Place Market from Roger's place and it was a breeze. 

My only warning is that there isn't a lock on the door to the bedroom. I wasn't concerned about this but others might be. I'm traveling solo and don't have anything super valuable sitting around the room, but keep that in mind. 

All in all, the place is rad and Roger lives next door and works 5 minutes away so he's nearby in the event of any major problems. "
83497	7735100	9.0	10.0	45354751	pretty room in a nice neighbourhood. we didn't meet roger as we came in really late and left early, but he sorted everything out. comfy bed, enough privacy, and we would have had a nice view through the window had the weather been better. a definite recommend.
