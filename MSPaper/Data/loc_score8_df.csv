810	8988178	10.0	8.0	54923185	"Paige's place was very nice to come to after a long journey, and it immediately felt cozy and nice.  It was very clean and open, and the check in was smooth.  She had left fresh towels and a nice bag of soaps, and we immediately felt at home.  It was super convenient to get to and was very nicely situated in a great neighbourhood with lots of close amenities.  Great coffee shop 2 blocks away, and a nice breakfast joint as well.  There is a Whole Foods just down the hill which we walked to a few times.  

Also i have to say that Paige was nice to converse with and easy to ask questions to and the booking process was very accommodating.  We had a great stay at Paige's and Seattle, and we would definitely stay here again.  We definitely can recommend this place.

Thanks Paige!"

The house is beautiful and so convenient to everything Seattle has to offer from city living to the gorgeous outlying nature preserves.  We were pleased with the dining recommendations offered and enjoyed a wide variety of menus within walking distance of the house.  Thank you for allowing our family to enjoy your home!!
940	6291829	9.0	8.0	37862643	House was beautiful, very clean and perfectly located.  katy was easy to work with and all was as promised.  This is an excellent place for a group - would highly recommend this to anyone!
941	6291829	9.0	8.0	38576860	The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
942	6291829	9.0	8.0	41358315	The listing was a little modest. The house was outstanding and the neighborhood better. Kary's home was all we could ask for, beautifully kept and perfect for us. 
943	6291829	9.0	8.0	41943504	The home and neighborhood is exactly as it is described. A great place in QA with lots to do all in walking distance.  There was a near cancelation from the owner but she worked it out and we got to stay in the home.  Glad we did because it is a beautiful home and perfect size for our 10 out of town guests.
3062	4395578	10.0	8.0	28706661	Great place in Ballard to stay in! Communication, check in, and checking out is all easy. Will definitely stay again!
4860	1179538	10.0	8.0	54492069	I was searching for a place last minute for my three piece band and I after our sleeping arrangements fell through. Varun was more than willing to host us on such short notice, Incredibly kind and easy going. Very clean home ! Overall excellent experience
4861	1179538	10.0	8.0	55507128	Very nice apartment, clean and quite.
7026	5126077	10.0	8.0	50053385	Brittain is very nice and kind. The place is very good to go to downtown. Also it was very cozy and neat.
7400	9199982	9.0	8.0	54790507	Very clean apartment. Location is very convenient for downtown and walking around Queen Anne.
7401	9199982	9.0	8.0	55483655	Nice & quiet apartment complex with secured entry/exit doors.  Best part was the view from living room and dining room area.   Parking was a challenge every evening though.   Walking from one tower to the other to get to the back entrance area was a little confusing in the first couple days.  I finally got the hang of it towards the end of my stay.  I stayed a total of 5 nights.  The elevator didn't work on the  last day and I had to walk around the front of the building to get to the back of the building to get to my car.  I couldn't figure out how to get down the stairs.  It was way early in the morning, I didn't want to call the host and I had a flight to catch.  Janny was very friendly and hospitable.   She even met me late in the night to give me the keys and a brief tour of the apartment and building complex.
7402	9199982	9.0	8.0	55853350	Janny's apartment was in a super convenient location to downtown with a beatiful view. It was a good size apartment so we had no problems bringing our bikes and not having them be in the way. It was a great stay overall, the only issues I had at all was that there was no wi-fi in the room (lobby only), there being no designated parking & having to park so far away and walk, and no tv (ultimately that was my own fault. Wi-fi & tv are my own preferences & I didn't even think to ask, I just assumed they would be there) These in no way took away from our trip, it was still a great stay & would recommend.
7403	9199982	9.0	8.0	56085740	Janny was easy to work with and available to connect with. The space was clean and convenient to some great Seattle neighborhoods.
7404	9199982	9.0	8.0	56682011	It was great to live here! 
7405	9199982	9.0	8.0	57726753	"Janny was very flexible and accommodating.  And she responded to all my communication very promptly.  

The space was clean and comfortable."
8342	4130112	8.0	8.0	20272324	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8343	4130112	8.0	8.0	29987890	Jordan's place was great. The house was as advertised and the hot tub and grill made it a nice place to come home to after a long day's work.
8680	3939683	8.0	8.0	47516624	"This place was super nice. Location was good, facilities were all ok and host was so kind! 
I really like this place and recommend here!"
10124	6714817	10.0	8.0	36311687	Lovely place -  spotless, cozy, and comfortable, with lots of nice sunlight, though it is on a busy, bright street, and so may not be the right place for light sleepers. Cody was super responsive and thoughtful. He even left us travel toothpaste, etc. by the sink!
10125	6714817	10.0	8.0	37878387	Cody was a fantastic host, from the beginning we were able to communicate  effectively about the details of the reservation. He was not able to meet us in person but he had a designated person who opened the door for us right we we arrived.  When we arrived at the apartment, we found  a welcome letter, instructions and recommended places to eat and check out, that provided a very nice touch and were very helpful. The apartment itself was absolutely beautiful, I loved the decor and we found it extremely clean and welcoming. It was very comfortable and the bed was fantastic. We really appreciated having that air conditioning during that heat wave. The neighbourhood is very charming and conveniently located by an Interstate that would take you to downtown in about 10 minutes. Also, within walking distance to Freemont, which has lots of restaurants, shops and the Freemont Troll.  During our stay Cody continued to communicate with us and asked how things were going, we really had the most wonderful time and are truly grateful for the opportunity of staying in such a sweet home. 
10449	2986056	9.0	8.0	22191686	"The place is great. Brand new, lots of working space a nice kitchen and good people. Bikes are free to borrow, and helmets are provided.
As a hack space it's only starting, but it seems that i'll kick off soon. "
10450	2986056	9.0	8.0	22805949	"The house is beautiful and very comfortable, I met great persons there even though summer was over. From the moment of my visit the house was still far from the concept of a ""hackers house"", there are no events and no special effort on achieving techie interaction. So in general I would try the other house next time, I was kinda disappointed on that perspective."
10451	2986056	9.0	8.0	44299851	I was not the one who lived in the hacker house but my sister. It was a great learning experience for her and it was a stimulating environment. 
10452	2986056	9.0	8.0	52725257	A comfortable house with friendly and interesting hosts. Would stay again!
14132	2800448	10.0	8.0	38552759	Yana was awesome! The room and neighborhood were great as well! It's a short commute into town. Will be back again!
14133	2800448	10.0	8.0	38657923	Yana was super friendly and made it very easy to rent her room. The room was perfect, clean, and easy to get to from the airport (about 15 minutes). Yana thought of everything from a little fridge stocked with water to plenty of clean towels and a comfy bed. I would defintely stay again.
14134	2800448	10.0	8.0	38775680	"This was my first time using airbnb and I could not be happier! It was such a great experience overall and we had such lovely hosts. Yana and her husband both made us feel very welcome. We were able to chat to them both a little and they are extremely friendly, making it easier for us to feel comfortable. The space provided was exactly what my boyfriend and I wanted while in Seattle, and the location was a dream. We are walkers, so we enjoyed the 20-25 min walk to pike place market, however you are able to catch the bus just as easily close to the home. 
Our room/bathroom were super clean and they had even laid out information and maps of Seattle, along with a couple snacks and bottles of water in the fridge.  We were out exploring the city for the most part, but while in the room out privacy was respected. "
14135	2800448	10.0	8.0	39102787	Our stay at Yana's was great! My fiance and I wanted a place centrally located so we were close to everything. She was very helpful throughout our trip and before. We were adequately informed where to park and she let us know about some construction being done, so we wouldn't be surprised by anything. The room was comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. 
14136	2800448	10.0	8.0	39823777	Yana is very friendly and service minded. The Place is in very good condition and clean. Location is good With several Public transportations available. Uber taxis are always nearby. Would most def. come back.
14137	2800448	10.0	8.0	40543987	The room was perfect. Exactly what we wanted. Private, clean and close to downtown. Yana was very nice and accommodating and after we decided we'd like to stay in town for an extra night we contacted her to see if there was any chance we could stay. She mentioned her previous reservations fell through and was happy to put us up for another night. Communication was awesome too. She'd respond to any questions within half an hour at the most. Would love to stay again and would recommend this room to all my family and friends when visiting beautiful Seattle.
14138	2800448	10.0	8.0	41051501	The place is as awesome as shown in the pictures. Very quite neighborhood with convenient public transportation to downtown(line 4&3 in the north and line 14 in the south that you to major tour spots in Seattle).  Would be great if travel with car. The place is well furnished and Yana kindly provided snacks and drinks for guest. And the bed is very comfortable.
14139	2800448	10.0	8.0	41898607	Yana's room was exactly as described. It's an ideal place for a night in Seattle. With its own entrance and ensuite bathroom, it's very private. In fact, we didn't get to meet Yana at all during our stay. She provided us with an access code and very clear instructions. This worked fine for us. The place was small but very clean and there were even some snacks and drinks stocked upon our arrival. The apartment is located in an area close to downtown which has a mixed feel to it (some nice but also some more sketchy looking buildings in the surrounding blocks). There is no immediate parking on the property itself so we had to park in another street. Overall we liked our stay and it was well organized by Yana.
14140	2800448	10.0	8.0	42089675	Great customer service! Yana responded to my inquiries quite timely. Very accommodating with my check-in time and happened to meet her on her way out of her drive way ready to go to the beach with friends, she happened to recognize me and right away had the car stopped, got out and proceeded to guide me to their home and room and gave me pertinent information about the room. The room itself and private bathroom was just as advertised and perfect for my short trip to Seattle. It was clean and conveniently located at the bottom of the townhome but not a basement room so not dark or has a low ceiling so no hassle or worry about disturbing anyone or bumping your head getting around and is perfect for privacy. There was a couple of granola bars offered, a nice convenient small refrigerator that had some cans of soda,  a microwave and a folder containing information about parking in the area and transportation services. The location was perfect and close to everything.
14141	2800448	10.0	8.0	42227164	The room was exactly what one needed for a comfortable and clean stay.  I enjoyed having our own access to the place to avoid disrupting anyone. A great location to access the city-centre easily on transit.
14142	2800448	10.0	8.0	42347389	Yana's place is just perfect. It has a private entrance with own bathroom, which give you a lot of privacy. The room was clean and quit. The location was also perfect. Yana was a really nice and carrying person. She gave us tips about the neighborhood and downtown. The room is Very close to downtown. I really recommend this place and Yana as host. 
14143	2800448	10.0	8.0	42501242	The place was so perfect, that we booked another night! 
14144	2800448	10.0	8.0	43513199	"I saw the host for 3 minutes on arrival and never again.  I had to use the same hand towel and bath towel the entire 7 nights of my stay.  There were no drinking cups.  Bed linens never changed.  My drinking cup for taking medications was an empty plastic 14 oz. milk bottle I used the entire week.  I received a text my 4th day, where I asked for drinking cups.  Never happened.
Room was nice and clean.  Service was absent."
14145	2800448	10.0	8.0	44312505	My stay w Yana was great! The room was just as described. The pamphlets she left and the bus app she suggested were both very helpful. She responds in a timely manner. There was construction on the road in front of the home. It's no big deal if you're catching a bus, but something to note if you may be coming from the airport in an uber. You can walk a few blocks in either direction from the home to catch a bus - that's very convenient. It can be a little noisy when the family are all gathered in the kitchen/living area having breakfast. Otherwise, no complaints. Would definitely plan to stay here if I was ever in the Seattle area again!
14146	2800448	10.0	8.0	44548977	My Mother was very hesitant try out AIRB&B on our trip. But she changed her mind after our stay at Yana's place. It was very clean and sweet. Very easy to get to.
14147	2800448	10.0	8.0	44923799	We really liked our stay at Yana's. The room is very nice, clean, private and has a comfortable bed. Private bathroom was really nice. Easy access to downtown Seattle by bus. We didn't meet Yana but her husband gave us all the info we needed and some great local tips.
14235	1905473	8.0	8.0	13720164	"I had a great time staying at Stephen's bungalow!
Stephen and Jen were excellent hosts! They even invited me out to a show in Fremont where their friend's band was playing. It was a great time!
The place was clean, and is a great location in the central district. Buses very close to downtown or the university district.

I highly recommend staying here! I might just stay there again! :D"
14236	1905473	8.0	8.0	16589568	"Steve and Jen were great hosts. They helped us find our way around and gave us some suggestions on what to see. The location of the house was close to the bus line and very walkable.  
I would recommend it."
14237	1905473	8.0	8.0	18803912	What a great place to stay for PAX!  While we didn't see our hosts much since we were at the convention and touring Seattle, they were very nice for the time we visited.  Check In/Out was very easy. The location is close to the bus line, but we decided to drive/take Lyft out of convenience (~$8).  Parking is very easy here!  Their garden is lovely, and if you're lucky they may have fresh eggs in the morning!  They are very environmentally friendly and have a beautiful home!
14238	1905473	8.0	8.0	34229960	It was a beautiful house that Stephen has and we truly enjoy our stay. 
14239	1905473	8.0	8.0	35420875	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14694	6864319	6.0	8.0	44240923	Kevin was an excellent host, both flexible and full of neighborhood recommendations.
14879	7205443	9.0	8.0	38065286	Marshall was extremely communicative and accommodating. His home was very spacious, clean, and comfortable, and was a quick Uber trip away from Seattle's best spots! 
14880	7205443	9.0	8.0	40519807	Please note this is a real basement appartment with almost no daylight at all. In Denmark this unit will not be allowed as a residence, but I don't know in the US. Fortunately there were garden furniture outside where we could stay. One of the beds were so soft that it was almost impossible to sleep 2 together. We did not feel for using the kitchen at all. There were some ants (and lot of ant cans in all windows to try to prevent this). We were confused of all the positive ratings on airbnb, but found out too late that it is not for this appartment (our mistake). 
14881	7205443	9.0	8.0	44715478	Marshall's place is really nice. It is very close to downtown. The public transportation nearby is very convenient. You can take the bus to many places you want to go. Though it is a half basement, there's still enough sunshine. Also, you can feel quite cool in the room in a hot summer. We really enjoy our stay here.
14882	7205443	9.0	8.0	46647203	The apartment was really nice and close to public transportation into downtown. The apartment was very spacious and provided everything we could possibly need, and for a very fair price. Marshall didn't meet us in person but was very responsive and left us with any and all instructions we needed. 
14883	7205443	9.0	8.0	47185964	"Marshall's basement apartment was very nice, spacious, and adequately clean. It accommodated my group of 6 comfortably. The apartment was a quick 10-15 minute drive to downtown.

I experienced miscommunication with check-in instructions, but Marshall was responsive to our calls/texts/e-mails. Having access to the washing machine and dryer was very convenient, especially because our clothes smelled like food from all of the great restaurants in Seattle! We ran out of laundry detergent, and Marshall provided us with some within a couple of hours.

In addition, my group realized we forgot a blanket after we left Seattle, and Marshall quickly and kindly responded to our messages, and he sent the blanket back to us. Overall, Marshall was communicative and very accommodating!"
14884	7205443	9.0	8.0	48465879	Marshall's place was great! Although my stay was short, this Airbnb was exactly what I needed-- well equipped, cozy, and centrally located. Marshall was very helpful and quickly responded to any questions I had. Thanks!
14885	7205443	9.0	8.0	49828756	Marshall is a great host. Though we did not meet in person he responded to all my emails quick and was so friendly! The basement suite is nice but the ceilings are quiet low so our tall friend struggled some but managed! Good location, close to amenities and a cheap uber ride. Thank you!
14886	7205443	9.0	8.0	54184014	Amazing location and decor. Head space was limited but not a huge issue even for three people over 6 feet. Awesome experience all round!
14887	7205443	9.0	8.0	55855742	We never met the host Marshall but it was a smooth check-in process regardless. It's the best basement/ lower level apartment we've stayed in  (lots of Windows for natural light, good distance between the 2 bedrooms to create privacy). It's in a convenient area too, only a $5 to $10 uber to get to most areas around the city. Thanks for having us Marshall :) 
14941	9300972	8.0	8.0	57705226	Didn't get a chance to meet Caitlyn and get husband but she was very easy to get a hold of and explained everything clearly. The place was lovely, in a great location with buses nearby that take you straight into downtown. The snack and pamphlets left along with the toiletries were a lovely touch by the hosts.
15025	8848854	10.0	8.0	55008530	The house is just as seen in the photos. It was cozy and comfortable.  We would recommend it.
15494	3533112	10.0	8.0	17060792	We had such a great vacation in this studio while we were in Seattle, very tastefully decorated, and has just the right amount of everything. This place is the best use of a small amount of space that I've ever experienced. We also got welcoming flowers and little bottle of champagne. So sweet! My husband and I usually stay in hotel, it was our first rental property experience, and we felt very lucky that we were able to call this place home while we were discovering Seattle. Thank you again for a wonderful stay!
15495	3533112	10.0	8.0	17296974	We did not meet Melissa but arrival and check-out was smooth and easy. The studio is very nice, newly remodeled, very clean and equipped with all your needs. Centrally located to visit all Seattle and surroundings, on the edge of Capital Hill with not a lot in walking distance. We had a car so it was perfect!
15496	3533112	10.0	8.0	17607750	The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15497	3533112	10.0	8.0	17640363	The place is awesome and Melissa is so sweet that she even left a welcome message on the white board～
15498	3533112	10.0	8.0	17855979	Melissa was really easy to work with. She was very prompt with her responses and answering any questions we had. I didn't get a chance to meet her because of my schedule, but she made our travel arrangements very convenient. The studio was really clean and looked exactly like the photos, I highly recommend staying here! 
15499	3533112	10.0	8.0	18947765	Our stay here was great, there was even chocolate and a bottle of wine waiting for us! It was just the place we needed.
15500	3533112	10.0	8.0	19103763	Nicely remodeled space. I'd stay there again. Walking distance to Madrona pub and St. Cloud, which is great!
15501	3533112	10.0	8.0	40167926	Had a perfect stay at Matthew's Studio. Everything is like in the description and the bed is very comfortable.There was breakfast (juice, eggs, bagels etc.) in the fridge for us. It was also very very very clean. There are 3 different bus lines/stations next to the studio, which takes you to downtown in 35 minutes. Check-in/-out was easy. I would definitely stay here again.
15502	3533112	10.0	8.0	41489218	The location was really good, comfortable and with everything you need. It's also near the city center in a strategically position to visit Seattle. Unfortunately I never met Matthew but he helped me immediately by email when I asked something. I suggest it with a pleasure like a perfect accommodation.
15503	3533112	10.0	8.0	41856094	Easy access to downtown (we took Lyft and Uber, it was $5-8, for three of us cheaper than the bus) but also Capitol Hill. Walking distance to grocery store, Farmer's Market (Friday 3-7 pm) and GREAT bakery (Golden Wheat I think) around the corner. Lots of Ethiopian restaurants and a Thai restaurant just around the corner. Otherwise everything as described and very flexible host, thanks!
15504	3533112	10.0	8.0	42323634	Matthews' place was PERFECTION! Originally we were looking for something right in downtown, but this was even better!! It was so close to everything we planned on visiting like the Space Needle, Pikes, Safeco Field and a few others. We were very pleasantly surprised to see that 1/4 of a mile down the road was Grocery Outlet! Our favorite grocery store! We were able to go shopping for breakfast items, dinner items, and snack items since we hadn't planned on eating every meal out. Matthews' house was perfect for my husband and I for sleeping, cooking, and lounging before bed. We were out alot during the day's but it was a very nice feeling walking in the door after a long day of exploring. We were really surprised with a bottle of wine, chocolates, and a cars wishing us a happy anniversary!! It was the nicest gesture that they didn't have to do but did and it was very sweet and made our trip extra special. We will be booking again sometime in the future for sure!!!
15505	3533112	10.0	8.0	45160583	I had a great time in Seattle thanks in large part to this convenient and comfortable studio. The location was easily accessible with only about  five minute uber ride into downtown. The amenities were great and had everything I needed for my trip. Although I never met Matthew, he was more than helpful working with my scheduling. I'd stay here again.
15727	7027507	10.0	8.0	45171952	Comfy room, lovely views. Had a great stay with no issues. Thanks!
16116	9134196	8.0	8.0	55236426	it's ok
16138	3630581	9.0	8.0	17299677	"This apartment was close to the University of Washington, restaurants, bars, and bus stops on University Way NE. The room was big and very clean when I arrived. The room did get very warm during my stay for a couple of days during a heat wave.

Melissa was a great host and responded quickly to my emails and calls. Check-in and check-out was easy.

I feel this was a better deal for staying near the UW campus than the hotel that was nearby."
16139	3630581	9.0	8.0	19131905	"Melissa was very responsive via the intercom outside the building when I arrived late Saturday afternoon. My room was not quite ready, but she had a room for me to wait in with television, etc. She came by the next day to check if everything was OK. 
       The apartment and furnishings were clean. During the stay Melissa brought by some things I needed.  I mentioned that I like having a small lamp by my bed to read before I go to sleep which she brought up for me.
       Any time that I have had concerns, she has answered very quickly by phone or text message. 
        I appreciated that it is close to stores, the bus line, etc.  My apartment faced Brooklyn.  Since it is on a  busy street and somewhat close to I-5, I heard traffic in early morning until late in the night. "
16140	3630581	9.0	8.0	29895496	"Our host was very responsive and able to accommodate our arrival on short notice. The check in system / key handoff she has is very easy. Good access to the University District, Trader Joes, cafe's, etc.

This unit is a basic landing spot in the heart of the U-District and is good for anyone that does not have a car and wants to walk or bike."
16141	3630581	9.0	8.0	33997279	Melissa was a great host. She was very easily reached by email and phone. The apt was very basic, but fit my needs. The neighborhood is in the heart of a very busy neighborhood in Seattle. It was convenient to get around, and felt relatively safe late at night.
16142	3630581	9.0	8.0	34663031	Melissa was very helpful in helping my solve my parking situation. The apartment was well kept and clean. Nice, big desk for getting some work done.
16143	3630581	9.0	8.0	35079288	The apartment was exactly as described. The host was responsive when we had questions or issues.  We were glad to be in such a great location - the heart of the U-District - for our daughter's graduation from college.  
16144	3630581	9.0	8.0	35426231	This place is really close to the UW, clean and tidy with a kitchen if you feel like cooking. 
16145	3630581	9.0	8.0	35685548	Very close to the UW, lots of restaurant, easy access to bus. Anyway, the smell in the building was not good, the furniture was too old.  If you want stay alone in university district, it will be a right place. But if you want spend some time with the house owner and share the local experience, not this.
16146	3630581	9.0	8.0	46165324	Melissa was available to let us in and give a quick tour of the room. The facility came as described, including towels and soap/shampoo. She was also accessible and responsive via text messages. Very professional. The neighborhood felt very safe.
16283	3329962	8.0	8.0	15702156	"The host is easy to contact, and accommodated me when I needed to leave my suitcase before check-in time. Other than that, the small, two-level apartment was a disappointment. It was difficult to find within the older motel-like complex with no elevator. I dragged my suitcase up and down the concrete steps trying to find it.
It was a super hot day in Seattle, but there was no fan or air conditioning in the apartment. Leaving the windows open for air compromised my privacy, but I had to keep the blinds up to get a breeze. Don't expect the level of hotel care because this is an old apartment without fancy amenities. There is no TV. There was one bath towel. The hand soap in the bathroom was used. There were no ice cube trays to fill, important on this ultra warm day. It is located between a creepy alley covered with steel plates that make noise when driven on (see other review), and the parking lot. Lots of air conditioner/machine noise came from the alley. This was an expensive mistake on my part."
16284	3329962	8.0	8.0	15920878	"Melissa was wonderful.  I was worried that she was not receiving my texts and emails, but we connected in advance of our arrival.  She had unlocked the door and met us when we arrived.  I appreciated her friendliness and responsiveness.  The temperatures were very hot in Seattle and their is no ac in the apartment. I let Melissa know that there was no toilet paper and that we really needed a fan.  She drove all over Seattle that afternoon to find us one so that we weren't melting the second night.  She even brought us an ice cream bar each to acknowledge our situation.  She is very thoughtful.
As for the room, it was clean and the bed was comfortable.  This is what I had most hoped for, so I was not disappointed.  The room itself is very noisy because of the alley behind the building and the road in front of the building.  After having lived in NYC in my 20s, it didn't particularly bother me.  The double garbage truck pick up at 6:45 a.m. was a bit of a bummer, but certainly nothing that our hostess could have controlled!  Overall, a very good experience.  Extremely convenient to the University!"
16285	3329962	8.0	8.0	16303336	"We enjoyed our stay at Melissa's apartment a lot. We were in Seattle for job interviews at the university, so the apartment with its central location was ideal for us. It is a clean and cosy little place that has (almost) everything you need for living. 

Before we came, we read some of the negative feedback concerning the apartment: e.g. missing shampoo bottles, missing fan, too little towels. We were very pleased to discover upon our arrival that Melissa had taken this feedback to heart and had made the appropriate changes. Great job!!!"
16286	3329962	8.0	8.0	16575161	"Reviewing unit 44

My gf and I were seeking to stay three nights in Seattle last minute.  Thank God Melissa's place was available - everywhere else was $200+ per night (before fees!)

The place: it's a pretty basic, clean place, no frills here.  But the bed is super comfortable!  We slept great on it.    

There's also an awesome fan that could really keep us comfortable.  It's small but moved serious air!

The location:  it's really easy to get downtown, and quite close to the bus line.   It's also next to large college campus, so there were many restrauraunt  options for when we got back from city.

The host: Melissa is super responsive.  The room didn't have ironing board.  She originally told me she'd have in 2 hrs because of appointments, but then delivered in 15 min.

The value: we paid $140 per night all in.  Given it was last minute booking it was good value.  But had it been further out, I'd say around $100 all in would be a great value, otherwise try to seek another location. "
16287	3329962	8.0	8.0	16748645	Our experience in the U District was great all thanks to this place! Close to everything and easy to find parking. Everything you need was here and Melissa is very responsive and easy to work with! Thanks Melissa! 
16288	3329962	8.0	8.0	17694729	A nice, really functional place in the U District. Clean, enough space, great location. The price is right. One complaint: the wireless internet was really unreliable, so, if wireless is a priority to you, maybe look somewhere else.
16289	3329962	8.0	8.0	17896225	I did not meet Melissa personally, but did chat with her on the phone and could tell she was very willing to help with whatever issues may arise with the apartment. However, she did such a good job of taking care of everything ahead of time, I didn't need to contact her about any issues! It was a great little quiet apartment (except for the garbage trucks as noted) and easily accessible to other parts of the city. I'd definitely be willing to stay here again if I were back in the city and needed a place to stay.
16290	3329962	8.0	8.0	18135899	Melissa is a nice lady and professional host. 
16291	3329962	8.0	8.0	19992787	The space was relatively easy to find and well accommodating for my needs while staying in the Seattle UW area.  The bed was comfortable and the space had everything I needed.  I'd love to stay there again anytime.
16292	3329962	8.0	8.0	20580072	Melissa was very easy to keep in contact with and was always just a text or phone call away! We did not get the chance to meet her in person, but she was still very accommodating with our requests. The location itself is nicely nestled away in an apartment complex that is only a few blocks from The Ave, making it convenient to get to the restaurants there. Portage Bay Cafe, a great spot for breakfast, is just a street behind the apartment, as well! If we were not dining out, the apartment was well stocked with an assortment of kitchen utensils for us to cook with. Street parking was typically a bit of a fight, though we got lucky with all the nights that we stayed and were able to find a spot no more than a block away each time. We did not see many of the neighbors out, though the tenants above us engaged in a very early and thorough DIY project that woke us up a few mornings with their audible hammering and sawing (though I'm sure that this does not happen often). Some mornings, we woke to the sounds of the garbage trucks behind the apartment, but other than that, it was a peaceful location to stay in. The apartment has a cozy feel to it and is convenient for those who just need a place to rest, as the bed was very comfortable and we had all the privacy that we needed. Overall, it was a great place for our temporary stay.
16293	3329962	8.0	8.0	21669770	"This apartment was pretty much as described.  The bed was comfortable, unit was clean. Location is excellent for visiting UW.
Fairly worn feeling apartment but adequate.  Optional parking spot at $8/day was a very good extra, as parking in the area is tight and regulated."
16294	3329962	8.0	8.0	24065531	"Melissa was great to work with. She got back to us quickly.  She answered all our questions. We had to add an extra night for the stay and he was very accommodating. 

The apartment is in a great location. It had everything we needed, including a very reasonably priced parking space.  The apartment was clean and just right for our needs. 


"
16295	3329962	8.0	8.0	25068362	small place in u district, i would even say 100 a night is a little steep, once there for a few days it felt cozy though, nice bed and enough supplies to get by and cook and such, steep cleaning fee though! aside from which melissa was fine; convenient for UW students
16296	3329962	8.0	8.0	26221297	Melissa was a very good host. She welcomed me, showed me apartment, and gave me restaurant suggestions for the area. The apartment was exactly as advertised, and I was very satisfied with it.
16297	3329962	8.0	8.0	26656012	"The host was very responsive through texts which was very comforting.  Great location near UW Campus with a Starbucks a few blocks away.  Nice to have a kitchen to cook in.  Best part of the stay was the bed.  Super comfortable and spacious.
I would definitely say this place is suitable for 1-2 people as the place is not that spacious.  Lot's of noise going on outside with the remodeling but didn't seem to be loud in the house with some music on.  The $60 cleaning fee is a tad steep but was fine paying considering that I was able to walk into a clean place.
I travel to Seattle often and would stay again if the place was available."
16298	3329962	8.0	8.0	31126680	"Melissa was a great host. Although she was not at the  apartment when we arrived, we  could get into it without any problems. Thanks to her arrangements.
If any problem or question came up she was available and helped us. 
The apartment was well equipped, clean and is very close to UW as well as to several bus stops going downtown.
All in all we enjoyed our stay at Melissas apartment and would like to stay there again in the future"
16299	3329962	8.0	8.0	33372031	"It was a cute apartment with all the things I need! The bed was extremely comfortable and really helped me to get good sleep. The location is also great with lots of restaurants ten-minute walk away. It also closed to UW campus. 
 And Melissa is a great host. She always answer my question quickly. I had a chance to meet with her and she is so elegant!"
16300	3329962	8.0	8.0	33756106	I checked in really late, so I didn't get a chance to meet the host at all. However, she was very sweet and accommodating via texting, so that made me felt comfortable to know that I can always contact her for anything. There were shampoo, hand-soap, and towels...but no toothpaste, toothbrush, and body wash. Good thing there was a local drug store that was 5 minutes away, so I was able to buy them all without a problem. Bed was clean and everything was nicely organized/put. I didn't really like how the room felt a bit dead to me; there were dried up plants on the table instead of fresh plants. The carpet wasn't actually clean since there were dark gray stains at some areas of the room. I didn't really used the kitchen since my stay was only for 2 nights. Overall, it was decent living conditions for a 2 nights stay.
16301	3329962	8.0	8.0	34473443	Melissa was very accomodating and responsive--she answered questions quickly and was flexible. She gave us great food recommendations for the area and was generally helpful. The apartment was as pictured. It was well situated in the U District and convenient to UW and surrounding areas. The area is very walkable. The apartment was no frills, which was totally fine with us. Despite having blinds on the window, it did get very light early in the morning which made sleeping-in tough. The apartment was relatively quiet, but we woke up to garbage trucks on Sunday morning and the sound of cars on the roadway. All in all, the apartment met our needs for the weekend.
16302	3329962	8.0	8.0	35072838	It was a really nice experience living in Melissa's apt for one week. I reserved this apt for my mother who came to attend my graduation commencement of UW. This apt has a small kitchen, a cute dinning room, a clean restroom and a warm bedroom. All stuff are clean and neat. It's just like still living in my home. 
16303	3329962	8.0	8.0	35471654	"Key was in a lock box as arranged so access was no problem even though we arrived on a night flight. Melissa made us feel very welcome, texting to make sure everything was alright.
This is a lovely little apartment, compact and cozy, with everything absolutely spotless, and plenty of drawer space to unpack into. Great location too - a few blocks off campus and to the bus stops. "
16304	3329962	8.0	8.0	36180839	The host was very helpful when got to the apartment.
16305	3329962	8.0	8.0	36690026	Melissa was not there for check-in, and there was much confusion. She told us we could just go there and check in, but we couldn't get in the room, so we left. When we got a few miles away, she told me someone would be there in ten minutes, so we went back. No one came for quite awhile. The whole check-in process took one and a half hours, and the person who met us was unapologetic and seemed annoyed. We had said we would have three guests, but there was only bedding for two. Again, we had to wait a significant amount of time for bedding. Then I found there were only two towels for three people. We just suffered through it, rather than go through the lengthy process again.  The carpet was dirty and all was shabbier than we expected. There was no air conditioning, so we had to open the windows, and the neighborhood was noisy, so we had trouble sleeping.  The bed was comfortable and felt clean. We will not stay with Melissa Yao again due to the lack of consideration for our needs. 
16306	3329962	8.0	8.0	40093335	"The apartment was basically as described. It's a well-kept student apartment, with worn but not shabby furniture and carpeting, and a very comfy bed. Fully-stocked might be a slight exaggeration re the kitchen, but there were adequate dishes etc. for meal-making and -eating at home. The bathroom window was either broken or installed in such a way that it couldn't be be fully closed, but that wasn't a problem. And we had no issues with noise from the street or other apartments.  We weren't able to access the apartment wifi, but didn't try very hard, as there was a free and open connection from a nearby hotel.

The location is outstanding. Super-close to the university (we were in town for a conference) with very easy, affordable mass transit (bus) to basically anywhere else one might want to go.

We never saw Melissa, but getting in and checking out was easy.

The place is nothing fancy, but fully met our needs!"
16307	3329962	8.0	8.0	40661613	"Our stay at Melissas unit was totally uncomplicated.
She was quick, very friendly and helpful with her answers.
We didn't get to see her, so I can't say anything else about her.
The unit itself was comfortable and definetly recommendable.
Only the Wifi didn't really work constantly good but it was free at least.
The neighborhood, was easy, safe and full of students. What is understood as it is in U-District. It's also not to far away from downtown. Max. 20 minutes by bus and also 20 minutes by (website hidden) is just 10 minutes away and you can rent a bike for a good price to explore seattle on pedals.
There is also a Trader Joe's and lot's of possibilities to grab a snack or some to drink around the unit.
At night it was not to quiet but if you're used to citylife, you'll easily deal with it."
16547	1571230	8.0	8.0	7031241	Melissa was very responsive and easy to work with and accommodated me nicely.  A couple things to note: make sure to ask Melissa if you need more than one towel.  Make sure to bring shampoo, etc.  There is no air conditioning in the studio.  The mattress and walls are thin so its not optimal for light sleepers.  The room was definitely large enough for 1-2 people with a couch for sitting on.  It's on the first floor which is great. There is a parking lot next door and Melissa also was able to arrange parking for me in the back of the building as well so that was very helpful.  A very economical place and friendly host in a convenient area with restaurants, shops nearby.  Thanks Melissa! 
16548	1571230	8.0	8.0	7520987	"The apartment/studio was very noisy.  All night long and on both nights I heard people outside my window.  It sounded like they were having a party. Melissa later told me I should have called the police. If it's noisy for you, just call the police or Melissa.  I only had one towel and there was no blanket for the bed - just a sheet.  I later learned that you need to ask for another towel - I stayed two nights, but only received one towel. The room is OK, very simple with very basic items, including a broken lamp.  I did not like the parking behind the building - there was a queen size mattress in the alley with lots of bottles and garbage, which made me think that people were sleeping there.  I worried that my rental car would be damaged.  I have stayed at the Deca hotel and it is only $137 a night - not $379.
Melissa argued with me when I gave her a courtesy call to let her know I had vacated the studio. I would not recommend the studio. "
16549	1571230	8.0	8.0	31491071	Melissa was very responsive and accommodating! She made sure that my friends and I had everything we needed including things like a parking space or extra towels. Melissa consistently maintained a friendly and professional demeanor. The room itself did the job, the bed comfortably fits two and the couch comfortably fits one. Also if you're not afraid of sleeping on a floor, theres room there and its not too bad. The only setback to this room is that if you are trying to stay up late with friends, you have to be quiet and considerate of the person sharing the wall in the room next door. If you are an early sleeper or keep it quiet during later hours then you'll be good! The neighborhood is near a lot of late night spots and very walkable. Would definitely stay anywhere hosted by Melissa again.
16550	1571230	8.0	8.0	32938064	This apartment has great location and is nice and pretty for two people living. We enjoyed our stay here.
16551	1571230	8.0	8.0	36518640	This place is clean and convenient to get anywhere you want to. It's kinda noisy since its on the first floor right next to the Brooklyn Ave. especially in the mid night on weekend. I wasn't able to get a good sleep sometimes, if you are the person who need quiet place to sleep, this might not be your top choice. And also It's kind of hot inside the apt too may need a fan.
16552	1571230	8.0	8.0	38871237	"Melissa maintains very professional interactions and the listing is true to its images and description. The building is very quiet and convenient to UW as well as all of the buses in that area (not to mention the new light rail station once it opens).

I would consider staying here, or at one of Melissa's other listings on future trips.

A few considerations:
First, the building (like almost all residences in Seattle) has no AC, and seems reasonably well insulated. Except in summer, this is probably great, but in a heatwave it can be unpleasant. If you expect  hot conditions, be sure to ask Melissa about a fan in advance (I asked while I was there and she looked but most places were sold out). It does cool off after the sun sets if you have the windows open.

Second, the residents of the building are quiet, but it is not a residential neighborhood and there is sometimes larger vehicle traffic. This didn't bother me, but a light/late sleeper may have trouble."
16553	1571230	8.0	8.0	40771505	"The apartment is quit old. But, the location is very convenient. 
I had some troubles related to the Internet, which causes serious problems for me. But, I believe that it will not be happen again."
16554	1571230	8.0	8.0	41170013	Great apt. and location to the university. This would suit people under 30 yrs who do not need a solid night sleep. Also if it is above 80 in Seattle make sure you request a fan very far in advance. It was 95 in the room thanks to phone app. No breeze in Seattle so opening the window does not help, esp. West facing as the sun is pouring in and the noise outside is loud so you cannot sleep with the window open. A fan arrived at 4pm the 2nd day in box for me to assemble. The owner then made a surprise visit that night with an assembled fan. We could not check in until 6:45pm a huge inconvenience. Again, if your a young adult seeking a clean apt. in the UW area it is probably perfect.
16555	1571230	8.0	8.0	42147415	This particular unit is quite small, which I knew going in. The price point is great and the location is as well. I loved Seattle and it was very easy to get around that city. I did not have much of a budget for this trip so we decided to stay here, which was a low price point and have a friend sleep on the pull-out sofa. Even though I specifically requested Melissa provide enough towels and bedding to accommodate three people, the items were not there when we arrived.  Friday night we had to strip apart the bed to ensure our friend had a sheet for the couch. And the next morning, I used t-shirts as towels. She did deliver the items on Saturday but I was very frustrated that they were not there as previously asked. Her communication is not the best. I had asked if there was a place we could stash our luggage before we could check in. She did not confirm until 12 hours before our trip. It made it hard to plan. When I arrived, it was like she had no recollection of this previous arrangement and it took some doing to get in the building. I did appreciate that it worked out. Also, she claims it to be a quiet building. What she means is, you have to be very quiet because people in the unit next to you can hear your every move and you can hear their's.  I heard the man next to us chatting with his xbox and blasting Christian rock well into the night (well, he was probably playing it at a perfectly normal volume, but again, you can hear everything).  Also, this unit is on the bottom floor so you can absolutely hear people out on the street and every word of their conversation.  There are barely any amenities included in this unit. I had to buy hand soap and I left it there for the next tenant. Pu-rel is not hand soap. We also had to arrange specially to get an iron, but there was never an ironing board. I would not recommend this place, but hey, you get what you pay for. It was cheap (for Seattle).
16556	1571230	8.0	8.0	43573323	We had a very nice stay.  The apartment is like a dorm room.  It is not for everyone, but more than adequate for an affordable place to sleep and cleanup.  Melissa quickly responded to our only request.  The area is not the nicest part of Seattle, but we walked at night and never felt unsafe.  There are several good places to eat in walking distance.  Buses to other locations are very convenient, run frequently and are inexpensive.  A bus ride to downtown and popular tourist sites is about 20 minutes.  I can see where the apartment might be noisy.  The windows are right above the sidewalk, so you can hear conversations of people walking by.  But we closed the windows at night and did not have any issues with noise.
16557	1571230	8.0	8.0	47734576	Stayed for one month and had a fantastic time. Room was very clean and quiet.  Melissa was very attentive and went out of her way to help me with mail service. 
16558	1571230	8.0	8.0	51981616	Melissa was very helpful and responded quickly to our request. Would book there again!
16571	5407311	10.0	8.0	28682565	Melissa made check in easy and was a fine host. The apartment is comfortable and as advertised and the neighborhood is great.  We would not hesitate to rent it again.
17077	3291777	6.0	8.0	14255940	"I was in a pinch looking for a last minute place to stay while in town for a work trip during the time of UW and the other Universities graduations in the area. It was great to find a place to stay that was not ""marked up"" during a time of high demand. My 3 night stay was less than what the hotels were asking for a one night stay. The unit is a close walk to restaurants and the UW. The unit was clean and worked well for my needs, at a great price. I did not have any issues finding parking in the immediate area or the street in front of the building. My initial inquiry to Melissa was very late in the evening (actually early am) on the needed day of arrival. Melissa was extremely quick in her response at such a late hour, as well as the couple inquiries I had during my stay. I really appreciated that she arranged for my late evening arrival after a night hosting some clients at a Mariners game. I would definitely stay at this unit if I have the need to be in the area again.  "
17078	3291777	6.0	8.0	14760768	"Melissa replied to our request and approved but by the time we booked it she gave away the apartment to someone else. We had no choice but to book another apartment in the same building. The price we paid was way too high for the room ($129 @ day) because there were a lot of issues which we experienced during our stay. The coffee pot was left dirty with garbage still in the bins from the previous guests. The kitchen faucet was broken and after several emails and 2 days later Melissa did come by and get it fixed. There were used soap bars and shampoo left in the bathroom which raises hygiene risks. My question is why did I pay for cleaning fees if the apartment was dirty.

The apartment building was in very poor condition and the apartment had a disgusting smell with no ventilation. The apartment decor was poor and furniture was old and uncoordinated. Although the carpet was vacuumed that's what Melissa told us but it was very old and stained. The mattress of sofa bed was disgustingly dirty - we only came across because the sofa was so uncomfortable and we checked underneath. The kitchen had left over food items such as coffee, tea bags, raisins etc and utensils were old. There was only 1 small tea cup for an apartment which is suppose to host up to 4 people. Since my partner and I had no choice, but to go out and buy our own disposable utensils. The bathroom has one rusted mirror with stains and the bottom of bath tub has been painted over which became very slippery after one day use. We had to clean the bath tub to ensure we didn't have any accidents. The toilet tank would also drain water constantly because of loose valve. We had to fix it constantly after every use.

The only thing that worked well was the (website hidden) had limited channels and many channels were in Spanish including the sports channel which had the World Cup running. Quite a disappointment for my partner.

The location was the reason we booked the apartment. While the location was great, close to UW and shops etc, the building and apartment needs lots of work to bring it to habitable condition. Unfortunately, it wasn't like we could check out since we had booked for 4 nights and had no choice but to stay. Overall, we were disappointed with the place and since this was our first ever airbnb, we will be very cautious on what we book in the future."
17079	3291777	6.0	8.0	15278962	"I cancelled the reservation first when I got to see the apt. It was not what i was expecting, because the place is more like a hotel. No one actually lives there but, more like a hotel, people come and go for short stays. 
After saying that, the place is not taken care off like if an actual person live there. So most of he furniture is cheap. The bedroom does not have a window(although there is no pic of the bedroom). The smell is of cheap cleaning liquid, combined with the several people that stay there per month. 
In conclusion, overall the place looks cheap, but it can be habitated if one is looking for a cheap short stay.
BTW, the host showed us another place in the same bldg that was 10 dollars more expensive per night but looked like new. So just be careful which apt you choose because some are better than others."
17080	3291777	6.0	8.0	15590881	"Though this place isn't super fancy, it's certainly comfortable for crashing in while exploring Seattle, and the location in the U-district is convenient both in terms of immediate access to restaurants in the neighborhood as well as multiple bus lines running downtown.

The host Melissa was very quick to respond to booking requests and upon check-in made sure we had what we needed ... we didn't make a lot of contact beyond that, but she seemed very kind and willing to be accommodating if we had needed something.

The one thing I feel people should realize about this apartment is that its only window (the one in the living room) is directly adjacent to an alleyway that cars cut across quite frequently. There are steel plates on the pavement there, so they clatter loudly every time someone drives by, which starts pretty early in the morning. Also on two mornings there was non-stop and very loud construction noise, preventing any opportunity to sleep late. On top of that, the upstairs neighbor has a habit of loudly pacing (stomping?) back and forth for hours on end, late at night ... this happened without fail 6 nights in a row. I've lived in various apartments for over a decade (including NYC) and understand they all come with noise, but I'd have to say that for a vacation spot, all this combined was a bit annoying.

Noise aside, which arguably Melissa can't do anything about, the place was fine. The building is on the older side, but the apartment interior is clean if not full of frills. The bed mattress is brand new and very comfortable; the sofa less so. I'd maybe compare it to a college student's first apartment in terms of quality.

Again, if you're using this as a ""home base"" to basically shower and sleep while during the day you're out exploring Seattle, I think it's suitable, and the location in the U-district and quick bus access to downtown are its main positive features."
17081	3291777	6.0	8.0	15920870	The apartment worked out well for me; I was attending a conference for the majority of my time in Seattle but needed a home base to wind down and sleep in the evenings, and get ready in the mornings.  This is not a fancy or modern apartment, but it was quiet,  affordable, a great location, and very convenient.  UW is within walking distance including University Ave with tons of restaurants.   Melissa was a great host.  It was unusually hot in Seattle that week (~90) and she was able to find me a fan to use which I def needed.  She is a very responsive and friendly host.  I would stay again if I came for another conference.  
17082	3291777	6.0	8.0	19295884	Place was great, just as photographed. Melissa was great and very accommodating in getting me set up for the place. I was very happy with the whole experience.
17083	3291777	6.0	8.0	44309765	The location is very close to UW campus and easy to take the bus to downtown. I will choose it when visiting Seattle next time.
17094	5744931	10.0	8.0	28760352	Cute, clean apartment that is exactly as it looks in the photos. Lively, but fun neighborhood. Easy access to the university, shops, and bus lines. We appreciated the accommodations of coffee, oatmeal, and wine. The reserved parking spot was a huge bonus. The bed was comfortable and shower was consistently warm. Morteza was very quick to respond to any questions we had. Overall, our stay was wonderful and we would highly recommend staying here!
17095	5744931	10.0	8.0	29941480	"Morteza was a great host! He was flexible on our arrival and departure--even letting us check out later because of a 10 p.m. flight arrival on day one and 10 p.m. departure on the last day. Everything was extremely clean and comfortable. 

We cooked but a few essentials were missing for proper cooking and cleaning, though we worked with what we had! (Maybe a skillet spatula and dishwashing sponge? And more than 1.5 rolls of TP) 

The only glaring issue was a house party (in the same house/unit) on Friday night that was so loud the walls were vibrating with bass/music and we could hear people falling down and yelling from 6:45 p.m. to 2 a.m. We weren't sure which other unit it was but Morteza apologized, spoke to the college students renting, and it didn't happen again. We only cared because we chose Friday to do a day hike and wanted to have a calm, quiet night in cooking dinner!

The neighborhood is definitely young (University District) and fun with plenty of interesting bits of culture and restaurants. Make sure you are ok with being around a bunch of college students if you stay here! We had a nice spot for our rental car in back of the apartment and it was really convenient. 

Thanks again, Morteza, and best wishes. I recommend this spot as a temporary getaway or home for anyone visiting Seattle.
"
17096	5744931	10.0	8.0	35362144	The host canceled this reservation 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17097	5744931	10.0	8.0	38697463	Morteza was an excellent host. Checked in with us when we arrived to make sure we had everything that we needed. If we ever had any issues like the Internet being reset, it was fixed within the hour. The apartment was just as described and the pictures were accurate. The neighborhood was nice but it could get noisy some nights being that it is close to the college. Everything was in walking distance which made it very convenient. Overall we had a great stay! 
17098	5744931	10.0	8.0	39545462	Great host, location and communications.  The tea, coffee & wine was a great welcoming.   Thank you Morteza!
17099	5744931	10.0	8.0	45704940	Morteza was a most excellent host. Super easy to contact and really friendly. When the wifi went out he was there within 30 minutes to set up a new modem and brought me hangers the next day since he noticed they were missing! The apartment is tiny but sweet and very clean! Great area close to everything you could possibly need. Would come back again for sure!
17100	5744931	10.0	8.0	46287593	Morteza is a very gracious and responsive host. He always promptly replied to emails and text messages from the minute I booked until I checked out. The apartment is as-advertised--clean and cozy, but more than enough to accommodate three adults. The neighborhood is very young as can be expected in University District, with college students dominating the area. It is also very central to many of the Seattle hot spots. One quick tip--if you're using Google Maps to locate the apartment, note that the reserved parking is in the alley between 19th and 18th (Google Maps will take you to the front of the apartment on 19th).
17101	3303857	9.0	8.0	14654958	"Nice flat: clean, calm, spacious and comfortable.
A little far from downtown but located in a quiet place with many buses stops, restaurants and shops. Notice that there is no TV in the flat (but it was not a problem for us).
WIFI was slow during the first day, but Melissa fixed it quickly.  
She made checking in and out very easy."
17102	3303857	9.0	8.0	14881191	Melissa is great and very communicative. The place was exactly as advertised - excellent location, fast wifi, clean and just great for a short-term stay. 
17103	3303857	9.0	8.0	15067794	House was very clean, location is very convenient in the university district. Shops and food one or two blocks near by! Recommend this unit for holiday, visits, and weekend trips! 
17104	3303857	9.0	8.0	15417432	"We loved our stay at Melissa's place.  For the price, this place cannot be beat.  The property was just as described in the listing.  Right in the midst of the University of Washington neighborhood, this property was very walkable to food, bars, a couple markets, and more.  I highly recommend Portage Bay Cafe for brunch just a few blocks away.  

It was also very commutable by bus to other parts of Seattle.  To Pike Place Market, the bus ride was not more than maybe 15 minutes.  Overall, the location was very convenient to get around and felt safe.  

As a host, Melissa was wonderful.  She was always quick to respond throughout the whole process.  Check-in was easy.  She even was so kind to accommodate our friend and allow 3-guest booking even though it was originally listed for 2 people.  Our friend slept on the couch, which was comfortable.  Melissa even brought over extra blankets, pillows, and towels for our friend.  

The place itself is cute and snug, and provided all the basics.  We didn't cook, but would have had what we needed if we wanted to.  There are plenty of windows to let in the summer sunshine, but can block out lots of the street noise if closed.  Also, the bed is really comfortable!!  If you are in Seattle looking for an affordable place to stay, Melissa's place will give you what you need.  "
17105	3303857	9.0	8.0	15592441	Melissa was very nice and responded to our needs immediately.  It was my first time using airnb so I really didn't know what to expect.  We really appreciated that the place was clean.  Very quiet neighborhood.  Easy access to buses and the university.
17106	3303857	9.0	8.0	15705736	Staying at Melissa's was easy, convenient, and comfortable. We arrived later than expected, which was not a problem, as Melissa left the apartment available to access at our convenience. The apartment was a great jumping off point for our weekend in Seattle. 
17107	3303857	9.0	8.0	16257576	"The host was phenomenal and the room was as promised. Clean, comfy and good Internet. 
Accessible to every place and very safe area. Absolutely recommended."
17108	3303857	9.0	8.0	16381646	"Melissa was great, hands-off but attentive.  Very accomodating, given the short notice booking. The place was clean and did just the trick for us spending a couple of days in the city.

Would highly recommend."
17109	3303857	9.0	8.0	16441787	Melissa communicates well and was kind to let me stay one night.  The apartment is older but is very convenient to UW and has what you need. 
17110	3303857	9.0	8.0	16843339	The place was as expected and everything was easy. The floors were a little sticky but everything else was fine.
17111	3303857	9.0	8.0	17290373	Melissa was very nice when she came by during our visit. Since this is a self-contained unit, there was really no occasion to get to know each other. The condo was clean, and sparsely furnished. The street noise is SIGNIFICANT, so do not stay here if you are a light sleeper. It is at a major intersection. Delivery trucks, buses, and drunken college students go by throughout the night.
17112	3303857	9.0	8.0	17471307	"The apartment was as promised - clean and at a very convenient location. 
There was a bus stop right around the corner to get to different parts of the city."
17113	3303857	9.0	8.0	17649151	"Melissa was very accommodating and responded quickly to every request.
The apartment was as promised -- clean, comfortable, and conveniently located."
17114	3303857	9.0	8.0	17957020	Apartment was as listed. It was warm for our taste but glad a fan was provided. Bed was comfy. We could not leave windows open through the night because of the noise from the street down below. The curtains were great to keep the street lights out. We happened to run into Melissa one eve while she was there and she made sure things were ok, and checked in with us the night before we checked out. Overall a nice place to stay very convienent to everything. Only reccomendation is to make sure you purchase the parking space when you book. We got lucky when we arrived but the street parking there is horrible, we added a paid space after arrival.
17115	3303857	9.0	8.0	18270307	"I don't know if these other reviews were written by host ""Melissa's"" friends but they're inaccurate. Please trust me and DO NOT STAY HERE. 

Upon booking my stay there was minimal communication between me and Melissa. I got the overall impression that she didn't really care. I asked her where I could find the keys and she said ""should be on table or kitchen counter"". Lot's of one liners. She did not give me details about the area I would be staying in and she didn't provide much help or ask me if I had been to Seattle before (which I hadn't).

I was very surprised when my Uber driver dropped me off at the apartment complex. It was very run down and ugly. There was dirt and debris in the corners of the complex, the floor had cracks and there was a big industrial sized trash can with rust stains right at the entrance of the complex towards the back wall.

I walked into the apartment and it was subpar. The pictures make it look much nicer than it is. Upon inspection I noticed that the blinds were a bit crooked and the window had water stains. There was a big dent in the floor right before the kitchen entrance (you sink down when you step on it). The soap in the sink was almost empty and the sponge was old and used. The windows were dirty, the toilet moves. So if you're sitting on the toilet and try to shift your weight the entire thing moves... Also, the bathtub had soap scum stains which she blamed on a botched paint job???

The bedroom was actually nicer than the rest of the place but it is very tiny. You feel boxed in.

Melissa did allow me and my guest to check in early at around 9:30 AM which was nice and she did offer to wave the $30 per extra guest fee. She did call me on the last day and ask me how my stay was and I clearly stated that it was a lot worse than I expected.

Overall I felt tricked by the pictures and the place just looks seedy. Sorry Melissa but this is true and you have to clean the place up because it's not fair to other guests.


"
17116	3303857	9.0	8.0	18886066	I had a good stay in this apartment (9 nights for work and holiday). It is conveniently located for the university, has nice neighborhoods such as Fremont and Ballard close by, and many shops at walking distance (I really liked the Traders Joe nearby). The apartment was clean when I arrived and it had everything you need for a short stay (nice living area, bedding, towels, kitchen supplies, stable WiFi connection). Some downsides were limited light in the living room due to the tree in front of the window and the street is quite noisy. Checking in and out went smoothly. Overall, I would recommend this apartment as it is good value for money.
17117	3303857	9.0	8.0	19288395	The Place was great with lots to see and do within walking distance.
17118	3303857	9.0	8.0	19687918	"The neighborhood is quite nice, and most of all very convenient if you are visiting UW -- only 10mins walk to the campus.  House looks kinda old, but I guess that is how things are in the city. 
  The internet speed is definitely something that can be improved! Quite slow at the peak time( night)."
17119	3303857	9.0	8.0	37385819	Melissa was a good host as she was accommodating with our request of checking in early. The place was basic and decent. Could have done with another fan in the living room, as it did become a bit muggy. The overall building getup wasn't the best, but the apartment itself was fine. The complex tends to get a bit noisy at night. 
17120	3303857	9.0	8.0	38136717	I stayed at this apartment for four nights. My stay was very comfortable. The apartment was neat and tidy. The necessities - bedding, towels, kitchen utensils - were all provided. The WiFi also worked a treat. The location is incredibly convenient - a 5 minute walk away from the University of Washington and University Way, the local food hub. Noise at night was a non-issue. Given the price, I wasn't expecting anything grandiose as I suspect some previous reviewers were. The apartment met all my expectations. Overall, this was a nice apartment that would appeal to easygoing individuals who are just looking for a comfortable and convenient, yet inexpensive, place to stay when visiting Seattle.
17121	3303857	9.0	8.0	39248303	Although the host didn't answer as quickly as we wanted the place was 100% as seen in the photos. The neighborhood can be lively at odd hours but we felt safe and were super happy with the location.
17122	3303857	9.0	8.0	44898380	Great experience. I rented the space for a month while I was doing an away rotation for medical school at UW. The apartment was perfect for what I needed: affordable and close proximity to UW clinics. Neighborhood is great with plenty in walking distance. Was a little hot without AC in August, but was I completely fine after purchasing an additional fan for the bedroom that I left in the unit (you are welcome). Street noise was a little loud at night, but quickly got use to it. No problems with hot water. I had an amazing month in Seattle and this apartment served as the perfect home base from which to explore this awesome city. I plan on staying again when I come back. 
17123	3303857	9.0	8.0	47176365	The place was clean and exactly as advertised. Very ckose to UW and in a nice neighborhood. I had limited interaction with Melissa and in those interaction she was super nice and helpfull. Highly recommended for anyone visiting UW.
18213	1566487	10.0	8.0	6863126	Rodrigo's apartment was amazing! Getting to stay in such an awesome place was a highlight of the trip. His apartment is so well decorated and hip (and super clean!) it was like staying in a fancy boutique hotel. Short drive to fun neighborhoods, but a nice quiet place to come back to after a long day of touring Seattle and super easy parking right out front. Will definitely recommend to all my friends! 
18214	1566487	10.0	8.0	6950336	Great time!
18215	1566487	10.0	8.0	7003595	Rodrigo's place is great!  It's very spacious with a good sized kitchen packed with snacks for guests.  His place is situated in a good location between Lake Washington and downtown as well as Capitol Hill.  You can also use Rodrigo's bike, which was a relaxing way to see Seattle.
18216	1566487	10.0	8.0	7207025	Rodrigo's apartment was exactly what we were looking for during our trip to the Northwest. The apartment was clean, well stocked, and conveniently located.  The Blendtec blender was a huge plus.  I would definitely recommend this place to others. 
18217	1566487	10.0	8.0	7498090	Very clean & modern unit. There was always plenty of parking directly in front of the unit. Rodrigo was friendly & very gracious. 
18218	1566487	10.0	8.0	7750592	I was in Seattle for ten days with my fiance, 6 days being a tourist, and 4 days doing some restaurant work around. For this, Rodrigo's place is certainly a gem. It is everything he promised it to  be: CLEAN, so clean, modern, charming, stylish, well decorated with not too many personal affects around, making it truly feel like your own place. As for things he did have, everything you would need to cook, do laundry, get around, perfectly stocked with all the necessities of everyday living.  In addition to all of this, the location was great, 10-15 minutes to Pike Public Market by bus (with two options of bus), 10 minutes to China town (I recommend checking out the Asian markets) and a short 5 minute walk to a grocery store and a few fast food outlets, in case you're a bit exhausted and just want to grab some quick tacos and get back to your favorite show on Netflix.  As well, you can get to the light rail on either the 14 or 27 bus in about 10 minutes, which will then take you straight to SeaTac for about $3 in 30 minutes. As far as Rodrigo himself, we did not meet in person, but had a few contacts over the phone and it was very obvious he knew what he is doing and was very pleasant and helpful. Would definitely stay here again, for the price and accommodations received, this place was essentially perfect. Thank you Rodrigo.
18219	1566487	10.0	8.0	7893107	"Very nice apartment in a quiet neighborhood. We had no issues at all and even found the refrigerator fully stocked. While we did not meet Rodrigo he was always very responsive and answered messages literally within seconds. Great Host!

Expect something like 30 minutes bus transit into downtown. I wouldn't recommend walking as it takes the same time and some street towards downtown are quit steep."
18220	1566487	10.0	8.0	8376589	"We stayed here for two weeks. Apartment was great, super clean, wonderfully designed/curated stuff, and in a good location for us.

If I'm ever back in Seattle, I'll almost definitely come back here."
18221	1566487	10.0	8.0	8604328	5 stars. Everything was as promissed. Clean and stytlish apartment. Plenty of privacy, nice view from balcony. Rodrigo was very helpful host. Great proximity to downtown. We walked nearly everywhere (by choice of course).
18222	1566487	10.0	8.0	8733720	Rodrigo's place was amazing, and he was such a great host.  He gave us all the info we needed up front, responded promptly to messages, and the place itself was very clean and fun to stay at!
18223	1566487	10.0	8.0	8761897	Rodrigo's place was great and just what we needed. It was very clean and he was a pleasure to deal with!
18224	1566487	10.0	8.0	8906677	"My wife and I stayed at Rodrigo's flat for a week and had a great time. It's very bright, clean, comfortable and spacious one-bed flat with all the necessary equipment and kitchen appliances. The area is very well served with Metro bus services to downtown and Capitol hill (15min), and other neighbourhoods. Rodrigo is a great host  - very friendly, helpful and flexible with check-in and check- out times. We highly recommend staying at his place.

18225	1566487	10.0	8.0	9359400	Rodrigo's apartment was very clean and comfortable, and he was an excellent host! Easy to get ahold of and friendly. We would definitely recommend his place!
18226	1566487	10.0	8.0	9554016	"POSITIVE: 
-Place was incredibly clean 
-Rodrigo was extremely responsive
-Easy to access, easy for cabs to find

NEGATIVE: 
-This might be an AirBNB error but I am deducting stars for this. Rodrigo's apartment on the map is stating that his apartment is on 15th and Spring, which IS walking distance to the main 12th Street of Capitol Hill bars/restaurants. However, I was extremely disappointed to find out that the apartment is ACTUALLY 1.3 miles/20+ blocks away from the spot on the map, making it not really walking distance in the evening to and from the 12th street hub so I had to spend money on 2-3 cabs per evening to get around. I would say that this apartment is in the Central District and not actually in Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. 
-The temperature had to be played around with often because without heat, it was too cold and if the heat is on too often, it gets too hot. "
18227	1566487	10.0	8.0	9845115	"Rodrigo was a great host & his place was exactly as advertised.  My father and I stayed this past weekend and I slept on his air mattress in the living room while my Dad took the bedroom.

I'd add that there is plenty of street parking if you have a car, as we rented one for our trip to Seattle."
18228	1566487	10.0	8.0	10089406	We really loved to stay at Rodrigo's apartment, it's a great place to stay in Seattle. Rodigro is a great host and we can recomend his nice apartment very high!
18229	1566487	10.0	8.0	10220983	We stayed at Rodrigo's place for 6 days and really enjoyed it. The apartment was as advertised and very clean. The location is very good. We didn't walk anywhere due to the unusually cold weather but there were a lot of cool restaurants in short driving distance. Overall a great experience. Would definitely stay there again! Highly recommend!
18230	1566487	10.0	8.0	10281294	We had a great stay at Rodrigo's place.  The apartment was immaculately clean and nicely decorated.  The refrigerator was well-stocked with goodies and beverages that could be purchased - and we did! Parking was easy, as well as the key exchange.  The only negative thing that I could say about the experience (which I read from the reviews of other's now) is that the pin on the map for the apartment's location is different than its actual physical address.  This meant that we were farther from down town than we would have liked.  That said, we did walk downtown and it only took around 30 minutes. I would suggest changing the pin just so there are no surprises.  Other than that, Rodrigo's place was very hospitable and accommodating! 
18231	1566487	10.0	8.0	10403283	My husband and I had a great experience staying in Rodrigo's apartment during our stay in Seattle.  Rodrigo was attentive and responded to all of our questions quickly.  His place was very clean and well maintained.  He even had snacks available for purchase!  There was plenty of free street parking too.  We would certainly stay with Rodrigo again if we were ever in need of accommodations in Seattle!
18232	1566487	10.0	8.0	10675625	Very clean apartment, lots of amenities, super quiet neighborhood, comfy bed, SUPER easy bus access, walking distance from supermarket. We discovered on the first day of our visit that we needed a spare key and Rodrigo was quick to supply one. He made it easy. 
18233	1566487	10.0	8.0	10815236	The apartment was in a great location! only several miles from Chinatown and Pike's Place. It was very centrally located and convenient. The place was spotless when I arrived and had everything that I needed for a 3 days stay. The owner even gave us a carton of orange juice. His fridge was also stocked with water, and food some that was available for purchase, kind of like a mini-bar in hotels. Reasons for only 4 stars is because it was located on the 3rd floor with no elevator, no reserved parking, and because it seemed like the owner lives in the apartment on a full time basis. His clothing filled up the entire closet, and personal items were also in the laundry room, and bathroom. Also, the bed was very firm for my liking.
18234	1566487	10.0	8.0	11227624	Rodrigo's apartment is very comfortable and adorably decorated. Extremely tasteful and chic. He was a helpful and communicative host. There is also a cute coffeeshop just a two block walk from the apartment where we got breakfast several times. I would certainly recommend that anyone looking for comfortable and well-located place in Seattle stay at Rodrigo's!
18235	1566487	10.0	8.0	11521975	Great accommodations with everything we needed! Didn't anticipate spending too much time at the apartment but felt comfortable and ended up hanging out more than expected. Rodrigo communicated well and helped us to a streamlined trip. Thanks Rodrigo! Recommended. 
18236	1566487	10.0	8.0	11784738	" Very nice and clean flat, are seemed safe, Walking distance to a few shops and a couple cafes. About a mile walk/drive to the hip and nightlife area of Madison, Pike and Pine streets. Communication with Rodrigo was excellent and access to the flat was easy for us even though we came in late at night.

Would I stay there again, yes I for sure would!"
18243	1566487	10.0	8.0	14121779	Most of these other reviews are spot on. Rodrigo's apartment is  a m a z i n g l y  clean, calm, and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. His decorations are modern, simple, and tasteful. Parking out on the street in front is free and effortless. Access to the apartment building was uncomplicated, even in the late hours. The apartment is very close to downtown and it's adjacent communities with lots to choose for dining and entertainment. he park directly behind the building offers a pleasant view from the balcony. Rodrigo was swift to communicate and easily available for anything we needed.
18244	1566487	10.0	8.0	14435745	"Apartment was clean and exactly as described. Very comfortable for me and my friends. Rodrigo has some snacks and drinks available for purchase.

Only downside was that the internet was really slow, but that forced the person that was supposed to do some work on our vacation to actually come and hang out with us all day, so maybe that goes in the Pros column?"
18245	1566487	10.0	8.0	14613606	I would absolutely recommend anyone to stay at Rodrigo's place, it exceeded our expectations. Fantastic location and Rodrigo's apartment had every detail taken care of, it was extremely clean and Rodrigo was a fantastic communicator, even when we had trouble making contact! We hope to stay again :)
18246	1566487	10.0	8.0	14841791	Rodrigo was a great host - friendly, easy to contact and quick to respond to all our questions and requests.  The apartment is as advertised: cool and stylish, super clean and comfortable, well equipped kitchen, great balcony and grill.  The  neighborhood is quiet and there is nice green space out back.  There are not many shops/cafes/bars nearby, but it is an easy walk into downtown neighborhoods.  I definitely recommend and would stay again. 
18247	1566487	10.0	8.0	14909961	A beautiful, clean apartment. The accommodations we cozy, and working with Rodrigo was a breeze. He provided information quickly, and was polite and friendly. We also had a car, and were happy to see parking was convenient, easy and free. 
18248	1566487	10.0	8.0	15264915	We really enjoyed our stay and experience with Airbnb.  This was the first time that we used it and we definitely will use it again.  Rodrigo's place is centrally located and an easy walk to downtown.    We arrived early to Seattle and Rodrigo was very accomodating and let us check in earlier.  Rodrigo was responsive to all our questions/concerns.  
18249	1566487	10.0	8.0	15427151	"Rodrigo's place was the perfect fit for my wife and I as we visited friends for a few days in Seattle. It's exactly as pictured; minimal, modern, clean, with some very cute and/or cool details.

The central location is ideal for getting most anywhere in Seattle in a few short minutes. There are transit options but having a car would help a lot from here. If you've never been to Seattle and have no connection to the city, perhaps you are better off in a hotel in another neighborhood. If you want to feel like you LIVE in Seattle (if only for a few days) this place is perfect!

Plenty of street parking. No hassle with key exchange. Good to go.

18250	1566487	10.0	8.0	15549757	I stayed at Rodrigo's apartment two nights with my family. It was great time because the apartment was neat, clean, and well equipped. We felt that we were really at home with relaxing mood as well as convenient facilities. Fantastic!! Thank you, Rodrigo!!
18251	1566487	10.0	8.0	15757407	Fabulous location. We were 10-20 minutes from everything we wanted to do. Plenty of parking, quiet, CLEAN, and very comfortable. Grocery store and coffee houses in easy walking distance. Rodrigo is a great host and very responsive to any questions. Definitely would stay with him again.
18252	1566487	10.0	8.0	16202699	Rodrigo laid out his apartment beautifully! My friends and I felt very welcome went we first got there (it looked exactly like the pictures!). The location is great, we were able to get to where we needed in 5-10 minutes. Rodrigo is very professional in handling everything and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Seattle.
18253	1566487	10.0	8.0	16309410	Good location, everything you need is available within 5 minutes walk. Not far from the center. The apartment is well equipped, nicely designed and perfectly clean. Rodrigo was ready to help any time?
18254	1566487	10.0	8.0	16401552	Never met Rodrigo in person -- we communicated via email / text, which worked for me.  Seems to be a very friendly guy.  Very helpful / quick to reply to texts.  Place was clean, immaculately / artistically designed.  Perfect for 1-2 people.   Quiet neighborhood with easy street parking.  Not far from Capitol Hill and downtown.  Recommended.
18255	1566487	10.0	8.0	16771538	The apartment was pristine. Very, very clean and well taken care of. It was evident that Rodrigo was a perfectionist. It had a very nice feel and I loved the balcony overlooking the park. Rodrigo was very responsive.
18256	1566487	10.0	8.0	16988078	Rodrigo was very quick to reply to messages and provided all necessary information prior to our visit.  The apt was clean and very organized.  The location was conveniently close to bus lines, and the cab rides we took to downtown Seattle were surprisingly inexpensive.  WiFi worked great.  A/C was perfect for the heat wave we experienced.  As a first time AirBnB Experience, it's the best I could have hoped for. Thanks!
18257	1566487	10.0	8.0	17169944	"The space was very clean and inviting - and the location was perfect.  My cab ride from Broadway and Pine was less than $10!

Would recommend the space to any of my friends traveling to Seattle."
18258	1566487	10.0	8.0	17343095	This was a clean, top-quality space in a fairly convenient location. Downtown and the Capitol Hill areas were generally a fair hike away, but cabs were cheap when we were too tired to walk. The neighborhood had a nice independent coffee shop and a Walgreens very close. And Rodrigo's initial text sent at check-in time answered any question we might have had.
18259	1566487	10.0	8.0	17580607	"Awesome host and amazing apartment! Very swish but minimalistic! Style right up our street. Great location. Wish we could have spent longer here. Balcony very cute. Shame
We didn't get to utilise the bbq. Rodrigo was brilliant in answering any questions and was a phone call away if we needed any help. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much. E & K  "
18260	1566487	10.0	8.0	17995493	"This flat is just gorgeous! We felt at home just at the time we arrived! Extremely comfy so we did not want to leave.
Rodrigo was very helpful giving us hints where to go and what to do and see - I definitely recommend this place."
18261	1566487	10.0	8.0	18131929	Rodrigo was great and was easy to communicate with.   His apartment was super clean and was just like the pictures.   Rodrigo even included small touches to make it feel like a hotel.   Even though I might choose to stay in a different neighborhood next time I'm in Seattle, this is a good option if you are looking for a deal, aren't traveling with small kids, and don't mind some stairs. 
18262	1566487	10.0	8.0	18417028	The Appartment was clean and comfortable. It reflects the pictures posted. We were fooled by the location, expected easier commuting by foot. In all other aspects, this appt. is better than average. 
18263	1566487	10.0	8.0	18590415	A great apartment in a convenient neighborhood. Many cool design elements - even the tissue box in the bathroom is interesting - and we appreciated the vase of fresh flowers on the balcony. Even the aerobed was unusually comfortable. Like most Seattle homes, no A/C, so during the unusual warm days during our visit, the apt was a bit hot during the day. It's on the top floor, so it got plenty of sunlight. We also enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen.
18264	1566487	10.0	8.0	18875487	"Space was very clean and well kept. Made for a great home-base while in Seattle for the PAX Gaming convention. Rodrigo was easy to communicate with and very prompt with his replies.

The actual location was somewhat off the mark (and further from downtown than we wanted) compared to what the estimate showed when we were initially setting up the booking. It looks like this is no longer a problem and the posting shows an accurate location now."
18265	1566487	10.0	8.0	19274393	"Rodrigo's Condo was magnificent, it was only a 20 minute walk to downtown, great views, great neighbors. When ever i had a question Rodrigo answered almost immediately.  When i come back to Seattle I will try and book Rodrigo's place again!!   

Thank you."
18266	1566487	10.0	8.0	19606391	Rodrigo's apartment was nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. There was an array of snacks and beverages available for purchase, which was a nice touch. The neighbourhood is pleasant, with plenty of parking available and a good supermarket just around the corner. It's about a 30 minute walk from central Seattle: we actually enjoyed the exercise (especially given the wonderful weather when we visited), but there are also bus-stops nearby if you prefer. We didn't meet Rodrigo in person, but his response to messages was consistently fast and helpful.
18267	1566487	10.0	8.0	19945058	Great place. All was as described. Super fast and cheap to make it to downtown. 
18268	1566487	10.0	8.0	20657150	This was a perfect location for us. It was in a vibrant area close to transit and within an easy walking distance to downtown. The apt was as pictured... beautiful and very hip. It was very clean and had everything we might possibly need including wifi. Rodrigo was a lovely host. He was very responsive and had information available on points of interest and suggestions about good locations, restaurants and pubs in the area.
18269	1566487	10.0	8.0	21221955	Rodrigo's space was clean and comfortable. Not entirely home-like (snacks  were laid out for purchase like a hotel), however it was perfect for a few friends needing to crash over the weekend.
18270	1566487	10.0	8.0	21628243	Rodrigo's place was very clean and exactly as described.  He was easy to communicate with through text and was helpful.  We would consider staying again on our next visit to Seattle.  Thanks Rodrigo!
18271	1566487	10.0	8.0	22328439	Rodrigo was very welcoming. He was very helpful in guiding us to the location and gave us all the information we needed to know. His listing was accurate and was a very convenient location. Safeway and restaurants were all less than 10 mins away by car. I will definitely stay here again the next time I travel to Seattle. 
18272	1566487	10.0	8.0	23252566	The experience was exactly as advertised. Very clean. Close to amenities. Free parking on street. Easy access. Rodrigo does a great job in communication as well.
18273	1566487	10.0	8.0	25247722	Rodrigo was incredibly accommodating, attentive, and got back to me immediately when I needed him to.  His place is really charming and clean, and would definitely recommend it to others.
18274	1566487	10.0	8.0	25484399	Great place to stay. It was very comfortable and clean. It was easy to get there from the train station for me, and plenty of food and coffee options around.
18275	1566487	10.0	8.0	25561965	Wonderful home! My girlfriend and I loved every aspect of it. Everything came just as advertised and the entire apartment was exceptionally clean. Can't wait to come back!
18276	1566487	10.0	8.0	25817358	Very clean modern apartment.
18277	1566487	10.0	8.0	25915897	Very clean, very nice place.  Rodrigo was very informative and available .  Recommended.
18278	1566487	10.0	8.0	26121895	The was very clean it was very Central. Located downtown Seattle. There was good communication with Rodrigo. Easy access to the apartment. It was a great experience.
18279	1566487	10.0	8.0	26282844	"i couldn't meet Rodrigo but i didn't need to meet him.
Room was so clean, Everything is fine.
The room is so far from downtown by walking. If you have a car, This room will be good choice, In my case i used Uber. price for Uber is just 5~6 $ to downtown from room."
18280	1566487	10.0	8.0	26574403	"We did not meet Rodrigo, but the instructions were clear and everything was easy and straightforward. 

The apartment was very clean and the description was accurate. 

Location is good, secure and quiet, but far if you plan to walk to the main tourist attractions. That said, you can get anywhere by driving less than 5 minutes. We did not try public transport, but there were buses a few blocks away.

Overall, a good experience. We would definitely stay there again. "
18281	1566487	10.0	8.0	26785910	Lovely cozy place, kept in immaculate condition, tucked away in a nice quiet spot in town. It made for a most excellent trip to Seattle! A+
18282	1566487	10.0	8.0	27502920	"Clean, cool and chill crib.  

I recommend Rodrigo's place.  
It is a little bit of a hike to capital hill and downtown....still very walkable + many a bus line nearby.  And there's an amazing Fried Chicken joint down 23rd.  "
18283	1566487	10.0	8.0	27739487	Great apartment that was spotless and an amazingly accommodating host. It is centrally located in the heart of Seattle, so you are always minutes away from whatever you are planning to do in Seattle. Have I mentioned that the neighborhood is very quiet so when you come back from a long day, you sure can get a good night rest?
18284	1566487	10.0	8.0	28389611	"Loved staying at Rodrigo's place!  I arrived early and he was able to accommodate an early arrival and made the check-in and check-out experience very easy.  He was always on quick to respond to any questions and always offered his help.

We rented a car (in hindsight unnecessary -- you're a quick Uber ride from anything!) and parking was easy nearby.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.   I would definitely stay here again!"
18285	1566487	10.0	8.0	28633965	Rodrigo was very helpful at the last minute and flexible when i needed to stay an extra day. He did a nice job setting the place upa nd I had a great stay.
18286	1566487	10.0	8.0	28809100	"Rodrigo made us feel very welcome! Walking into the apartment, my first impression was, ""Beautiful!"" "
18287	1566487	10.0	8.0	29764906	"Rodrigo is an exceptional host! Upon entering the apartment, we said, ""wow, so fancy!"" He had already made up the extra airbed for us, so all we had to do was relax and enjoy the space. He has thought of everything for his guests in offering snacks or beer (that you pay extra for, but still so generous to take the time to stock the fridge.)
We didn't do much in the neighborhood, mainly going out in nearby Belltown or Capitol Hill. Where Rodrigo lives has a very nice park and ampitheater, and Broadcast Coffee a couple of blocks away made the BEST americano I've ever had. Thank you, Rodrigo for opening your apartment to us!"
18288	1566487	10.0	8.0	29883398	It's wonderful place.
18289	1566487	10.0	8.0	30499633	Loved this place. Rodrigo was super easy to get a hold of and the apartment was so comfy. He had an air mattress to accommodate all 3 of us. Close to downtown and uber ride away. Thank you Rodrigo!
18290	1566487	10.0	8.0	31814990	"Rodrigo is a great host. Communication was good and checkin was easy. 
The apartment is great. Big single bed, with a balcony, good light in the afternoons, and full kitchen with everything. Parking was easy too. 

Good location, there are groceries withing walking distance, you can get the bus to downtown on jackson, or you can walk to downtown about 30 min. Little saigon and china town are a 20 min walk. I had no problem walking.

Overall, I was really pleased."
18291	1566487	10.0	8.0	32511437	We have spent a great weekend at Rodrigo's home. The apartment was very clean and there were all we needed for the weekend in Seattle. It is close to bus stations, so very convenient. 
18292	1566487	10.0	8.0	34345879	Space was as described. Clean, modern, and very comfortable. Rodrigo was very hospitable and the whole experience was very nice. Thank you!
18293	1566487	10.0	8.0	34862798	Great place and location! Few blocks south of Pike street, a few more blocks east of downtown, 2 blocks from a coffee shop and 10 blocks from uncle Ike's! 
18294	1566487	10.0	8.0	35214138	We had a lovely time at Rodrigo's Apartment. It was extremely clean and the patio overlooking the park is great! We had four of us staying at the apartment and Rodrigo graciously set up the airbed for us with linens and sheets. We never cooked but he has all the necessary tools to create a great meal in the kitchen. The walk downtown to Pioneer Square only took 20 minutes and Uber taxi's were always around and convenient. There is a brewery a few blocks away from the apartment and it is a cool place to check out. Overall I would highly recommend his place. It looked exactly like the photos . You can't go wrong! 
18295	1566487	10.0	8.0	35639534	Rodrigo was very welcoming, communicated freely, and accurately described the listing.  This was the beginning week of an extended trip for us, and started us out in a great way: wonderful place, perfect location for us, easy drive to anywhere in the city.  We were very comfortable during our stay!
18296	1566487	10.0	8.0	35817583	"This was my first stay in an Airbnb listed property and it was exactly what I expected.
The apartment had lots of sun in the afternoon and the balcony overlooked a park that had some action but surprisingly very quiet noise wise which was great.
Rodrigo made available lots of extras such as beverages and snacks for a minimal fee which was a nice little touch.
Rodrigo was very prompt at answering any communications and with complete detail to the questions or comments. His home is true to its description in every aspect.
The location was a 5 - 10 minute cab ride to Safeco field  ($7.80 fare $10 with tip made the driver happy). The drive was down Jackson street which took us through Little Saigon and a part of China town. 
Overall we had a great stay and would stay at Rodrigos again in the future.
Thank You Airbnb and Rodrigo"
18297	1566487	10.0	8.0	36122829	"This was my first Airbnb experience and a great one! Rodrigo was awesome to deal with - answering all questions promptly & kindly (before and during the visit). We forgot to tell him we needed the air mattress until the day before we arrived and he accommodated us with no issues. 

Although we were a bit nervous about the process in general, check in was super easy. The place was exactly as it looks in the photos - clean, modern, natural light and well-equipped. Parking was easy and the location was convenient for getting to wherever we needed to go (drive, walk or uber). We used the kitchen for breakfasts, lunches & snacks and found everything we needed.

The neighborhood was pleasantly quiet. There was some noise (planes, get-togethers in the park below) but we never found it to be a nuisance and it always stopped before we were ready to sleep.

Great spot!"
18298	1566487	10.0	8.0	36528908	The apartment was very clean and lovely to stay out. My friend and I enjoyed the decor and amenities that were provided by Rodrigo. Nice neighborhood surrounded by other newly remodeled apartments. It was a little tricky o navigate since there is so much construction going on but other then that I highly recommend this stay. About a 10-15 minutes drive to downtown
18299	1566487	10.0	8.0	37058571	Rodrigo is a very nice person, responded very quickly whenever we had a question. He has a beautiful well furnished modern home. Very clean as well. Plenty of street parking. His home is very close to downtown Seattle. We used uber to get around which cost us less than parking fee in downtown. Overall very pleasant experience. Defiantly recommend his place.
18300	1566487	10.0	8.0	37567572	The place was very enjoyable exactly as advertised. It was clean, well decorated, and spacious for myself and my girlfriend. We loved the balcony. The location was also great for a mixture of walking to destinations and reasonably priced Uber rides. Rodrigo was a very helpful host and responded quickly to inquiries. Overall, I would highly recommend this for a Seattle trip.
18301	1566487	10.0	8.0	37788551	Great place to stay. It was very close to Chinatown and Downtown Seattle. The place was quite spacious. I'd love to stay here again. Rodrigo arrange the check in and check our process really easy and very convenient. I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends. 
18302	1566487	10.0	8.0	40093886	Awesome apartment in a great location close to light rail station and grocery store! Well definitely pick this place to stay at next time I am in town. Amazing host who made sure we had what we needed for our stay!
18303	1566487	10.0	8.0	40789964	The apartment was just as described. It was very clean, check in/out was simple, we loved the washer/dryer, we loved the roku/netflix, and the bathroom was very nice. Although we have no complaints there were things I think would have made our stay better. If you plan to visit Seattle in July/Aug we would highly recommend you get a place with Air Conditioning. We didn't think it would be this warm (the deck read 100+ almost every day we were there) and although we were provided fans we were frying in the apartment. This was also the first Airbnb I had stayed in where the host didn't greet us. One of the main reasons I love airbnb is meeting the hosts and them recommending things for us to do in the city.  Overall though it was exactly as described and our stay was easy. Thank you!
18304	1566487	10.0	8.0	41951942	Very nice place with a good patio view, and a solid host! Affordable Lyft rates to anywhere in the city when you can't handle the Seattle hills in the summer heat!
18305	1566487	10.0	8.0	42473107	Listing was accurate.  Above average Airbnb property, a few issues, but it will be fixed I am sure.  I wouldn't book if it is going to be warm in Seattle as the apartment has a lot of western exposure and heats up excessively in the afternoon and evening.
18306	1566487	10.0	8.0	43072844	This was one of the best Airbnb's I have ever stayed at. The apartment is impeccable; I was very impressed with the cleanliness.  The decor is great too!  Parking is easy and available on the street.  It's possible to walk downtown, but we just took Ubers and it costs about $5 to get downtown.  There isn't any AC and it can get hot on the top floor in August, but there are plenty of fans to cool you off.  Host was responsive.
18307	1566487	10.0	8.0	46124620	I loved staying at Rodrigo's apartment. The space is clean, the grill is excellent, and the place was perfect for me.  I was a little nervous it was too far from Downtown but the 27 bus picks up right up the street and means your downtown in about 20 minutes. Great Stay!
18308	1566487	10.0	8.0	46626992	"Rodrigo's apartment was clean, modern and comfortable. We had a great time staying here. The location was convenient since it was close to downtown and everything else. Parking on the street was easy to find. We were able to use Rodrigo's TV to watch shows on Netflix, and we were also able to use his BBQ, which we were stoked about. The balcony was great! Communicating with Rodrigo was easy and he replied almost instantly, which was convenient when I had questions.
Thanks for a great stay Rodrigo!"
18309	1566487	10.0	8.0	47971198	Rodrigo's apartment was the perfect launching pad for seeing Seattle!  My flight arrived earlier than the official check in, and Rodrigo was very accommodating.  The apartment was clean and nice with all the amenities.  I can't recommend this listing highly enough! 
18310	1566487	10.0	8.0	48890555	Best BNB I've stayed in so far! Rodrigo's home was very clean and exactly how the pictures look! Great communication skills and will reply fairly quickly. His home isn't too far from downtown Seattle- We used uber for 2 days for close by areas and a rental for the other days that were a bit farther. His home has practically everything (extra pillows,linens,towels,dishes,pots,Netflix, Hulu) Definitely a great place to stay!  
18311	1566487	10.0	8.0	49820712	Rodrigo's apartment was great! Super clean and modern with all of the conveniences you could ask for (washer/dryer, dishwasher, balcony, grill(!)). While we didn't meet Rodrigo, he made our arrival and entry super easy and was always very quick to reply to any of our messages. The neighborhood is quiet and seemed safe, just a 20 minute walk from downtown/Capitol Hill. A great experience, thanks Rodrigo!
18312	1566487	10.0	8.0	50632244	"I feel good I was able to spend a week.
Thank you!"
18313	1566487	10.0	8.0	51282118	Rodrigo was in constant contact before the trip and made the stay in Seattle very stress free. His house was very clean and exactly as advertised. He had all beds, sheets, and towels ready when we arrived and provided assistance throughout. A really great host and the place is within walking distance to Capital Hill. 
18314	1566487	10.0	8.0	56049721	Rodrigo's apartment is exactly as it is described - modern, incredibly clean, and perfect.   He responded to any messaging promptly, and included offers of any assistance that we might need.  We were comfortable in his place, and loved the neighborhood.  We would wholeheartedly recommend this listing!
19770	1499596	8.0	8.0	23368699	This place was fantastic.  It was perfect for us.  From the radiant heated floors to the giant bathtub on the third floor.  Love, love Gerry's style.  His furniture is gorgeous--mid-century modern mostly in wood.  Eames kitchen table chairs.  Every looks so good that you're surprised it is all extremely comfortable.  His photos on the walls are uplifting and compelling and visually well-framed.  The kitchen has everything you could want.  The beds were super comfortable.  The building seems eco-friendly and built very solidly.  Windows and window treatments are high quality.  No drafts (even on a snowy day).  The neighborhood was close to everything.  Other folks in the building were kind and casual.  You can walk downtown or to Capitol Hill or take a $5 Uber ride.  We would move into that place in a minute.  Even better than the photos.  And Gerry was a very good host.  Beautifully done, Gerry.  
19771	1499596	8.0	8.0	24420498	the host was great communicating with us and the home was as described.  great place with all the amenities we needed.
19772	1499596	8.0	8.0	29668446	Truly a special home. Airy, cozy and unique at the same time. 
19773	1499596	8.0	8.0	33256570	The house is great, everything was perfect and very comfortable. Gerry was very helpful and answered my questions quickly.
19774	1499596	8.0	8.0	35098405	Great place, we had 5 people and we all fit comfortably. Everyone loved it! Very spacious and description on posting was accurate.
19775	1499596	8.0	8.0	37326492	"the host left a welcome packet that had the wifi information, things to do in the area, what amenities to use and how to keep it clean. that was very useful to have.

the pictures of the listing were very accurate. the house was very modern and had a lot of windows which was nice to let the natural light come in. clean and organized and left some clean towels for us to use. very nice living room on the second floor with the apple tv. the neighborhood was chill and had a nearby park and coffee shop that was very walkable. it's about a 15 minute drive to pike place which was nice since it's not too far or too close. "
21014	666897	6.0	8.0	30999680	Great place in a quiet location, prefect if you are going for work as I was. There are nice bars and restaurants not too far away, probably 20 minutes walking. Qing was very helpful during my stay and I would definitely stay here again
21015	666897	6.0	8.0	31821969	Charming cottage, centrally located.  It was convenient for us to visit our daughter and walk or bus to many great sights.  Onsite parking was very helpful because of two hour parking restriction in the neighborhood.  Looking forward to future visits.
21016	666897	6.0	8.0	32582989	We stayed at Qing's cottage for a belated honeymoon, and it was just perfect! Easy walking distance to the Pine/Pike street attractions, and close to a couple of bus routes. Tucked away in a fenced in yard with gorgeous flowering trees. We were greeted by a woman staying in the front house. She gave us some suggestions for restaurants nearby, and then gave us our privacy. The house was very comfortable, and we enjoyed our stay very much.
21017	666897	6.0	8.0	32792846	This was a lovely little cottage and was exactly as described. The neighbourhood was nice and quiet and we had easy access to the city. Having the space for our car was great too. Our host was very lovely and attended to all our needs promptly. Only issue we had was the toilet blocking quite easily.
21018	666897	6.0	8.0	33554299	My scheduled host did not show up and Nina (Qing's mother) was kind enough to host me on very short notice. The place is cozy and comfortable, good internet, a bit spare in the kitchen but I was able to cook my meals just fine. The area is quiet and centrally located. You can bus or walk most anywhere. I enjoyed the whirlpool tub. I slept well there. I was happy to have a place to stay.
21019	666897	6.0	8.0	34147619	"This cottage was just the right size and the right location....enough out of downtown to be quiet--great café, Broadcast Coffee, within walking distance to downtown Pioneer Square, etc.  I liked the location.  Did rent a car and walked so I don't know about access to public transportation.

Cottage was nicely decorated and stocked with all that might be needed for a basic stay."
21020	666897	6.0	8.0	35470879	The appt was cute and the house manager, Lena, was very helpful and patient; we arrived later in the evening and had many questions.  
21021	666897	6.0	8.0	35928452	The cottage was nice for the price but definitely needs a bit of work. We arrived 20 minutes early, but luckily after a few tries, we found the house manager who said that the place was available for early access which was wonderful. The grounds are not well kept up and there was a random fridge sitting on our porch. Besides needing to be fully cleaned (there was a lot of dust and spiderwebs in some areas) it was a nice place. The bedroom is located upstairs via a narrow spiral staircase. The bedroom has skylights (windows in the ceilings) that allows A LOT of natural sunlight in. It's very nice, but not when you want to sleep in. The kitchen and all around house amenities are extremely limited, but we made it work. We didn't meet or speak to Qing, but talked to the house manager (who is really hard to get a hold of) .. There weren't any big issues that needed to be addressed. 
21022	666897	6.0	8.0	39562205	Checking in and arriving was very easy. The location was great and had parking access and just a quick drive from a lot of things in the Cap Hill area, and not too far from downtown. Definitely near a lot of restaurants and great things to see/do/eat.
21023	666897	6.0	8.0	40493682	Qing’s place was a great place for my brother’s visit to Seattle. It is spacious and convenient to public transportation and is situated in a quiet neighborhood not far from where I live. The kitchen and bathroom are modern and clean. The wifi worked well and Nina, Qing’s mom, was very helpful. There was a slight delay at check-in as the host said the previous guests departed hours later than expected and left a mess. Nina had just steam cleaned the carpet and was trying to get it dry when we arrived. Afterwards, everything went very smoothly. As my brother was packing to leave for the airport, he noticed a trail of ants in the loft space. I called Nina and she responded as we reached the airport. She apologized and said she’d take care of it. Overall, my brother’s stay at Qing’s place was positive and I would request to stay at Qing’s place again in the future.
21024	666897	6.0	8.0	40968939	Good value but could use a little attention to make it outstanding.  Lena was very welcoming and accommodating.  We appreciated her letting us keep our sea kayaks inside the gate. Super cute cottage with a really nice little deck.  It was unusually hot, so a fan would have been nice (as the sleeping area is in the loft.)  Conveniently close to public transportation. Since we had just camped and kayaked for 4 days, the laundry machines came in really handy.  There are sugar ants though and, while they put out ant traps, I didn't like having to dodge them on the bathroom counter.
21025	666897	6.0	8.0	44125952	My boyfriend and I stayed four nights here. The door is locked by a key code so we were able to arrive late at night, which was great. However, we almost couldn't find the place! There's a tall fence with a latched gate around the property and no lights were on. Once we found our way inside we both thought the house was cute and the bed was comfortable. The house is in a convenient location (25 minutes walking or a very short uber to Pioneer Square). We had to improvise a bit to make food as the kitchen's pots, pans, and knives were limited. The kitchen and bedroom were clean, but the rest of the place could've used a little more attention. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. 
21026	666897	6.0	8.0	44841760	"There was a keypad for access so never checked with anyone.  The neighbor hood was typical of that area, close to Seattle U.
The entrance didn't look so ""lovely"" with an old refrigerator on one side of the door and an old futon couch on the other side.  The inside was ok, not the best cleaning job, dishes were in the sink!  Had to plug the dishwasher in to wash all the dishes.  Bed upstairs was comfortable and the location was great.  The futon in front of the tv had a definite dip not for sleeping!"
21027	666897	6.0	8.0	45793414	The cottage was ok. The wifi was solid, and the place had towels, which was nice. Could have used some more kitchenware, and we couldn't get the heat to work. Great location, fair price, and it was nice and quiet. All in all pretty solid.
21028	666897	6.0	8.0	50001198	"This cottage was absolutely perfect for our stay. It's in a lovely neighborhood and getting around was easy. The back patio had a grill which was great for enjoying the nice weather. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment was clean. The pictures show exactly what the place looks like. Also, Lena let us check in early, which was great.
"
21029	666897	6.0	8.0	50777916	My husband and I really enjoyed Qing's place. It's in a great location and is the perfect size for two people. 
21030	666897	6.0	8.0	57470630	Qing was very welcoming and the property was lovely. The location was perfect for our needs, and there was plenty of street parking with the supplied neighborhood parking pass. The space was private and secluded. I'd definitely stay here again.
21827	8525825	8.0	8.0	49070107	Unfortunately, we did not get to meet Taylor but his roommates were great hosts!  Convenient parking, close to major attractions, and a very unique living space.  Fun place to stay :)
22468	877203	9.0	8.0	3932125	Both Laura and her home r awesome. My mom and I stayed there for 8 days.  Everything is amazing. Super clean, quite convenient for going out to the attractions, or just (email hidden), washing clothes, do your work.  My mother and I nearly cooked everyday, and Laura is quite nice and helpful, since  my mother cannot speak English. One day Laura even baked a delicious quiche  inviting us to try. After all, It's just a great time there.
22469	877203	9.0	8.0	6452546	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
22470	877203	9.0	8.0	6485631	"Laura is one of the most friendliest and open minded gung-ho grandmother I've met! She makes you feel so welcomed and comfortable just like living at home. Her place is clean, cozy and centrally located near downtown Seattle about 20 mins bus ride away. I will definitely stay here when I visit Seattle again! Thanks so much, Laura for a wonderful stay and experience in Seattle :-)
"
22471	877203	9.0	8.0	9535869	"I stayed in Laura's house for a little more than 3 wonderful months.
Let me start with the house. It has everything you need and Laura allows you to use them. There is no TV, but for me it was no problem, because I worked most of the day. I felt absolutely at home there, if I didn't want to be disturbed, Laura respected that and I had my own space and time when I wanted.
Now about Laura, she is a wonderful person, you can talk about a lot of different topics and the talk would keep going and going and had to stop so we could get some sleep for the next day. If you need anything, she will try to help whatever you need. She helped me so much, because this was a big change for me and she made this it went really smooth.
I would recommend this house for all my friends coming to Seattle!"
22472	877203	9.0	8.0	10842772	She's absolutely amazing, and so is her home and neighborhood. You will feel so at home here.
22473	877203	9.0	8.0	11379896	I loved staying at Laura's house. It was very cozy and comfortable and the room was lovely. Laura is an adorable host as well! I had a great stay and will be staying with her in the future!
22474	877203	9.0	8.0	11502028	Laura was nice and she was very busy and tried to do as much as she could. i did not realize it was a african-american neighborhood,  though close to international district. It was not up to my cleanness and comfort standard, but considering the room rate,  her place  was good for the traveller with a budget
22475	877203	9.0	8.0	11821708	I had a great time in Seattle thanks in part to Laura's easy and flexible check in. I only saw her on the second day but she was super friendly. The room was very cozy with a comfy bed, it is a bit far from DT but if you don't mind walking then its not that big of an issue. Plus its a great way to experience each little corner. If you're flying in take the light rail (2.50?), also rent a bike from Timbuk2 (free! with a deposit), get out n check all the usual Space Needle, Pike's Market, etc. I would def stay here again, however, consider its a good 30 min walk to DT. Thanks Laura
22476	877203	9.0	8.0	12464745	"My stay in Seattle was to see an old friend. The location to him was perfect, just around the corner.
The house was clean and tidy and the room had all I needed, especially a very comfortable bed.
There was a little trouble with the plumbing in the shower but Laura was on to it as soon as it happened and there was another shower to use, so I wasn't put out at all.
I loved Seattle and wouldn't hesitate to stay their again if my friend was in the same neighborhood, Thanks Lynn, Australia "
22477	877203	9.0	8.0	17118615	Amazing place to stay! It's really clean and lovely! Safe and convenient neighborhood  
22478	877203	9.0	8.0	17639383	Laura was very friendly and responsive. The room had a big table and splendid WiFi. I was able to get the work done, and enjoyed my stay.
22479	877203	9.0	8.0	17946838	This was our third stay with Laura.  Again, she provides just what we need--a comfortable bed, a nice shower, a bright, pleasant home, a big smile.  She is a delightful woman.
22480	877203	9.0	8.0	18201942	Laura was really easy to communicate with even on some last minute changes from me.  The room was as described nice, quiet and clean.
22481	877203	9.0	8.0	18366562	Nice place, clean, good neighbourhood close to downtown. Would stay again.
22482	877203	9.0	8.0	20494408	"Laura is great, I stayed four weeks in her house, she leaves you your space, but if you want a chat or if you need anything she'll be ready to help. She's a lot of fun and cares about others. Great Host !!!
Everything listed is accurate, and the house is really clean and comfortable."
22483	877203	9.0	8.0	21855303	I had a great stay. Laura is friendly and accommodating. The place is very comfortable, close to where I needed to be, and with ample parking. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you.
22484	877203	9.0	8.0	24235442	"Hi Laura.

Thank you very much for a great stay at your place!
I enjoyed it much.

You are an excellent host - your place is excellent.

Happy New Year.
All the Best.

"
22485	877203	9.0	8.0	28127413	This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a success from start to finish. How nice to feel welcome in someones home. Laura Gonzalez was a wonderful Host. She made me feel so comfortable and  answered all questions I had. Her home was perfectly located for my visit. My room was lovely and light and I will hopefully be able to stay there on my next visit to Seattle.
22486	877203	9.0	8.0	28729792	Laura is a friendly and gracious hostess. Staying In Jimi Hendrix's Neighborhood quickly felt like home! The neighborhood has easy access to public transportation with a grocery, drugstore, and library nearby. It's a great place to start in Seattle!
22487	877203	9.0	8.0	32857429	"Laura's place was great and exactly as advertised. The room was spacious and had a lot of natural light. A good place to lounge on a weekend. The house was well connected to the bus routes and a walk away from Seattle Uni (which came in good use for my football games). There were a bunch of nice places to eat and Laura was helpful and guided us in this regard. 

Laura is well traveled and it shows across when you speak to her. She had so many books and movies in her room! And I added a bit to the list of movies she had on her watchlist. She gave us our space but was always there when needed. On weekends she is lounging on her hammock :P Loved her place and would have continued to stay if only it wasnt booked for the next 2 months! "
22488	877203	9.0	8.0	35459986	I could not recommend a stay with Laura more. Laura is not only a wonderful host, highly concerned with your comfort and happiness, she is a remarkably kind person. Here home provided both wonderful accommodations and a sense of real relaxation at the end of the day. 
22489	877203	9.0	8.0	38473259	The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
22490	877203	9.0	8.0	40664415	"Laura was very accommodating to our arrival schedule as since we were on a road-trip we were unsure of our arrival time.  Also, being that we visited during the extreme heat wave and there was no AC, she kindly gave us a fan for the room.  If you are just looking for a good place to sleep and don't spend on being in the house much this is a nice option.

The house was located in a good area for access downtown (quick drive or about a $10 uber ride).  It was a little farther out from Queen Anne and Ballard.

While the listing does say private bathroom, I would point out that Laura also has another listing for a second room in this same home.  If a guest is also staying in the second room then you end up sharing the bathroom.  This was not clear to us and we ended up sharing the bathroom with a mother and her young son.  So if you are looking for something more private this is not the spot."
22491	877203	9.0	8.0	48506291	"Laura has a very cute, clean house with nice rooms available. I slept in a room (not pictured) with two beds. The bathroom is shared with the other tenant, which worked out fine. I was up too early to enjoy the advertised homemade breakfast.
If you aren't familiar with Seattle, please be warned that the Central District is not the cute little cafe neighborhood I expected. It's dangerous to walk at night, and while the bus system is very close, you will be sharing your bus ride with some interesting characters, so that wasn't always a great option either. I didn't have my car, so this was an issue and the added expense of using Uber to get around between the hours of 6pm-6am is something to consider. "
22492	877203	9.0	8.0	50782484	Laura was a very nice host and has a great place to stay!
22493	877203	9.0	8.0	56657762	"I stayed there for 2 months. It was a convenient place near from Red Apple, Walgreen, and a brewery (especially for me).
Laura was a good host. I enjoyed food, beer, and some activities with her and other guests."
22547	7095802	8.0	8.0	37716607	Everything was as described. Kevin was very good at communicating with us and very nice. Everything was clean and organized. Thanks!
22548	7095802	8.0	8.0	38566581	Really cool and clean place! perfect to stay when u are in Seattle! Thank you for hosting
22549	7095802	8.0	8.0	39685593	Room is as described. Complete kitchen for cooking. Bathroom is shared but we did not have any issues with it. Kevin has excellent response time to questions or concerns. In a nice quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown and nightlife areas.
22550	7095802	8.0	8.0	39996589	"Kevin was a welcoming and understanding host as we were ten minutes late for checkout. This happened because there currently is construction around the area which meant cabs as well as buses had to be rerouted. Our bus broke down on the Sunday morning thus having to switch buses and change route. 
The place was clean (minus the tub in the bathroom) and nice. This place was a good place to stay. However, if you are a light sleeper the doors are stiff and are very loud when opening and shutting. 
If you are just looking for a clean room and a bed to sleep I would recommend this place. 
"
22551	7095802	8.0	8.0	40173927	We had a perfectly pleasant time at this place.  It was quaint and just how it was described. The yard was nice.
22552	7095802	8.0	8.0	40809070	The room was exactly as indicated in photos and description. Sharing the bathroom with other guests never posed any problem. The location was perfect for visiting Seattle and close to bus routes and near downtown. Kevin was helpful and friendly and available to answer any questions we had. Thanks for a pleasant stay! :) 
22553	7095802	8.0	8.0	41668844	Nice, clean, quiet space. Easy to find and gain access to. Did not meet host but he made sure we had all info regarding check in/out/ wifi and city suggestions for us before we arrived. 
22554	7095802	8.0	8.0	41985615	Good place to stay, perfect for what we needed. Quiet and conveniently located. We never met the host but he was very responsive :)
22555	7095802	8.0	8.0	43726548	Kevin was a great host. It was very warm in Seattle while we were there and we checked in it was warm in the room. Kevin hooked us up with a new fan to make sure we were comfy. Bed was very comfy. You are sharing a bathroom with others (like a dorm) and the room is very small. However, we were only there one night and it was super close to downtown and from a bus stop so it was totally worth it.  
22556	7095802	8.0	8.0	44471243	Great first stay in Seattle -- Kevin was accomodating and attentive. Thanks for everything!
22557	7095802	8.0	8.0	44730152	Great stay! Thank u Kevin!
22558	7095802	8.0	8.0	45381589	Kevin was a good host, left clear and easy to follow instructions on how to check in and out, even asked if I wanted a fan for my room since it was a warm night the day of my arrival. The bathroom is shared with other people, but was never a problem. Downtown Seattle was only a quick 8 minute drive away, maybe less. If you're like me and just want a place to sleep/shower and keep your belongings, look no further.
22559	7095802	8.0	8.0	45598494	I stayed at Kevin's place for one night before work meetings in downtown Seattle the next day. Kevin was a very responsive and communicative host. I was concerned about being a bit cold, and when I let Kevin know he brought me an extra blanket. Kevin also provided water bottles and towels. I found street parking easily near the house. The room was a little smaller than I had expected, but it was clean and functional. The bathroom is shared, but I didn't have any issues getting in when I needed to. I would recommend this place for a busy person who has a lot on their plate and needs a simple place to sleep at night. 
22560	7095802	8.0	8.0	46158265	Fantastic stay at Kevin's. Excellent and informative communication from time of booking. Everything as described. We ran into him a couple of times and he was so lovely giving us tips on the best places to check out! Thanks again!
22561	7095802	8.0	8.0	46454411	"I loved the fact that we needed a room immediately with an early check in and we were easily accommodated within just a couple of hours.  This was our very first bnb experience and we were soo happy with our decision to do this we will be visiting more bnbs as we travel quite a bit. Thank you for being so helpful. The room was just as described.Although there wasn't a TV the internet was very strong and very fast, so my wife and I were a ble to watch Netflix from my phone. A bit small but accommodating. Oh and the bed.....aaahhh so comfortable 
:)"
22562	7095802	8.0	8.0	48894721	"Host - Kevin had everything prepared and his messages were concise with lots of good info. He was very responsive.
Room - The room is basic, but comfortable. Shared bathroom was fine. Good for solo travelers.
Location - Great location, close to lots of good stuff. This is my main reason for staying here. I didn't take advantage of the public transit since I had a car but it seems really convenient to use from the house. I had no trouble with street parking during my stay."
22563	7095802	8.0	8.0	49559217	It was nice to have detailed description about directions and restaurants around (please add the ligh trail station name to help others in the future). The room itself was ok. There was water, cup, lotion, towels and even a roll of toilette paper (since the bath was shared).  I am personally allergic to fabric softners of the bedding, so i had to sleep with my own towel covering the pillow so i wouldn't smell it.   The sheets had pilling on it as if it were very old. Then i saw a HUGE crack in the window (behind the pillows) as i left in the morning...that is a safety compromise and i wish that was disclosed in the profile (i wouldnt' have stayed in a room with that).  Kevin himself was friendly and helpful when i accidentally ran into him.  The doors weren't well aligned (both to the room and to the bathroom), so when i had to get ready and leave in the morning, i felt i was waking everyone up with the door making big noises from the jamming.  Last thing- someone was talking loud either outside or upstairs and maybe because of the crack in the window, i could hear almost every word of their conversation. it finally stopped after 11pm. 
22564	7095802	8.0	8.0	49895562	Room was as shown and everything was set up well to accommodate accordingly.
22565	7095802	8.0	8.0	51325188	"The location and price are very convenient.
It was easy to find place using host's guidelines.  
Room is really small. Bath and kitchen are shared with more tenants. Unfortunately,kitchen and bath are not very clean. No desire to cook there. Need to wait if toiled is occupied. "
22566	7095802	8.0	8.0	51517179	The queen size mattress is the most comfortable one I ever experienced on AirBnB. But to be honest, I didn't recommend so much if you seek for a clean living environment. The kitchen is shared with 3 other room guests so it is just a big mess when you entered the kitchen. Lots of dishes are just thrown into the sink. And also the floor is not clean very much.  On that night, i guess there are 3 guests in another room and one more guest in second room. So you can imagine  how long the queue is for the showering.  But the good thing is Kevin is nice, his response is fast as well if you message him.  So if you don't care much about the cleanness and long time waiting for the bathroom, it is not a bad choice.
22567	7095802	8.0	8.0	57364577	Very nice room, a little smaller than I thought but It was perfect for to be honest. Private entrance, so I was able to come home any time and not worry if I was going to be disturbing anyone and Kevin is upstairs in case you need anything. I had a great time!
22568	7095802	8.0	8.0	57735747	Kevin let us in and everything was fine! Bed was comfy and clean. Great location!
22826	286712	9.0	8.0	1320925	Galina is very kind, friendly and flexible. She has a very nice place. It is very spacious and the townhouse was surprisingly very private feeling since it was off of the street and had a private fenced back yard. I would definitely recommend her place to future renters. It's a great deal and a beautiful home!
22827	286712	9.0	8.0	1453891	great place to stay close to downtown. groceries stores a block away. very clean place, lots of room for a family. loved the place. downtown is about 10 min driving & to take the bus is a block away. starbucks is very close. as a sport fanatic, is very very close to a mariners & seahawks stadiums. very quiet neighbors around the place. i really recommend this place for any occasion. 
22828	286712	9.0	8.0	1675297	The townhouse was clean, spacious, and perfect for the family members who came to for our wedding. The location was very convenient, as well. Excellent backyard and kitchen.
22829	286712	9.0	8.0	1827125	I chose this house for 3 reasons, it had plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms to accommodate my adult large family, it was close to the bus line, and it appeared to have adequate cooking and dining facilities.  The first 2 expectations were accurate, but we were disappointed to find that there was no dining table , and the kitchen area is much smaller than it appears in the photos, making it difficult for us to sit down for a meal together or use the table for group activities. People should be aware there is no television.  The garden in the rear of the townhouse is lovely!
22830	286712	9.0	8.0	1899319	Nice, well-kept, clean and completely as advertised.  Nearby Starbucks and grocery store was a plus.  Easy drive to Pike Place Market.
22831	286712	9.0	8.0	1920231	We had a great stay. When we had a late night question related to the townhome Galina responded to our telephone call promptly and was very flexible about check out times. Everything was clean and ready to go when we got there. Finding the door and entering the code at night was a little tricky, but aside from that everything went really well.   
22832	286712	9.0	8.0	2043907	Galina was great!  So sweet and the place was perfect for us.  Three of us stayed and we loved having our own bathrooms and a place to cook!  Luxury! :)  It was so convenient to have the keypad--I want to get one for my door!  It meant that we didn't have any problems with figuring out who should take the key and could come and go as we pleased. The only thing that was tough was having to do the laundry at the end. It took longer than we thought it would (we didn't want the red sheets to bleed onto the white, so ended up doing three loads the morning we were leaving).  With other hosts I've just stripped the beds and left the sheets, and wished we didn't have to do laundry at the end. 
22833	286712	9.0	8.0	2189973	"We had an awesome stay!
The neighborhood is quiet, the house was clean. We really loved the room layout, it was perfect for our group. Location was excellent. There is a small shopping area with a Starbucks in walking distance. And a bus stop with the 14 going directly into downtown/convention center.

Galina is a great host, always responsive, all instructions were spot on. "
22834	286712	9.0	8.0	2252287	Galina's place was wonderful for our group visiting Seattle for a wedding. The townhouse was perfect four the six of us. Access was super convenient and it was central to all of the places we needed to go!
22835	286712	9.0	8.0	2313262	"We had a bit of a mishap with Galina's place: her cleaning service didn't actually clean it before we arrived. There was a lot of rotting food in the kitchen, which was pretty unsettling. We called and messaged Galina and she was quick to respond, and sent her cleaning service back to check on the house later that day. They folded the towels in the living room but didn't remove any of the rotting food, yet she told Galina that she had already cleaned the house. We messaged back and forth, and the next day Galina sent a friend to remove a box a rotting bread sitting in the kitchen. She also offered to reimburse our cleaning fee and pay for half of the first night's stay, and she was very apologetic about the entire incident.

Other than that, the place was wonderful and perfect for me and my friends from college. There were 8 of us in the house and with couches, beds and floor sleeping, we all slept comfortably. She has a lovely modern kitchen and is close to the Captiol Hill neighborhood and downtown Seattle. Galina was courteous and prompt to respond to our messages."
22836	286712	9.0	8.0	2393577	"Galina's house was very clean and had plenty of extra towels and bedding for our large group.  Her home was as adverstised and as spacious as it appeared in the photos.  

Galina was a bit hard to get a hold of by email but was very responsive by phone and texting.  

Definately worth the cost.  "
22837	286712	9.0	8.0	2487748	"My friends and I enjoyed our stay for five days at Galina's place. The house was clean, nice, and well setup to cook. There is a grocery store and other shops within a close walking distance. Galina was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any of my questions.

The only issue we had was difficulty finding cabs in the area. The bus system ended up being easier much of the time. Using the Uber app to get a car was much more effective than calling Yellow Cab."
22838	286712	9.0	8.0	5117483	When we arrived the place was a bit of a mess due to some long term tenants not cleaning as promised. Though a bit of a disappointment, Galina was remarkable in responding quickly; she sent someone to clean the next morning, and even sent a (website hidden) delivery of supplies like sponges, soap, etc. The townhouse is lovely, with a cute backyard, easy parking, and enough space to sleep a lot of people comfortably. One of the bedrooms has a futon couch/bed which is as comfortable as to be expected. As long as you know, and come prepared for it, it's just fine. There is a grocery store and starbucks within walking distance, and a Trader Joe's an easy drive away. Overall a great experience!
22839	286712	9.0	8.0	5315882	For our group of 3 couples staying 2 nights in Seattle, this newish 3 story townhouse worked very well.  Two bedrooms (one Queen, one full futon) are on the top floor, one (Queen) is on the lower.  All have full ensuite bathrooms.  Kitchen, dining & living rooms, half bath + laundry occupy the middle floor.  The kitchen is compact but adequately outfitted for simple cooking. There is a full size refrigerator, gas range, microwave but no dishwasher.  Seating for 6 for dining: table for 4, plus 2 (email hidden)e one car garage was tricky to get into with our Kia Optima rental.  Street parking on the block was generally easy to find.  Grocery, drugstore, Starbucks, restaurants & bus stops easy to walk to.  We needed to contact our host two times about the rental:  3 days before we arrived to get the entry code, and at the property when we could not figure out how to lock the front door from the outside.  We were not successful communicating with the host by email; it seemed to work best to leave a phone message to which she responded promptly.  We would definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle.                    
22840	286712	9.0	8.0	5995280	The house was nice and clean when we arrived.  Galina was very responsive and answered all our questions beforehand.  Getting in and out of the place was easy.  One thing we didn't care for too much was paying a $150 cleaning fee when we had to do the cleaning of the towels and sheets.  That wasn't received very well from the parents.  Also the security code doesn't always get changed so if you are the paranoid type you may ask ahead to make sure it can get changed from the last people that stayed there.  Other than that we loved it.  It was very spacious and was in line with hotel prices around the area.  If you are okay with the things I mentioned I'd definitely recommend it!
22841	286712	9.0	8.0	6319050	"We were a group of six friends (2 couples + 2 singles) travelling to Seattle for four nights and were very pleased with our stay at Galina's townhouse. We would definitely stay there again! 

When we first arrived we were a little concerned about how far the location was from the attractions (Pike Place Market, Shopping District, etc) but it was a very quick cab ride - about $10-12 each way. There is a grocery store and Starbucks down the street which were very convenient. 

For the six of us, we thought the townhouse was enough space, though I wouldn't want to go with a bigger group, and we had only minor concerns: 
- Someone over 6' tall won't be too comfortable sleeping in the downstairs bedroom (the bed is a little short) 
- The kitchen is a tight to have two people cooking 
- It would have been nice to have a TV or radio, but we managed without 
- There isn't a toaster or regular coffee maker but enough variety of pots & pans for the cooking we did 

We enjoyed sitting in the backyard (there are only three lawn chairs in the downstairs closet though) and having the code lock was very convenient because when someone wanted to go back to the townhouse we didn't have to coordinate who would have a key.  Also, the three and a half bathrooms were awesome for our large group. 

A note on other reviews: 
- We didn't notice the airport noise mentioned by another reviewer 
- The large capacity washing machine and dryer made laundry very quick 
- There is a dishwasher 
- We fit a Ford Escape in the garage 

All in all, we thought it was a great place to stay. I would recommend it to anyone travelling to Seattle."
22842	286712	9.0	8.0	6367900	"My real rating for this place is a 3.5, but you can't do half stars on Airbnb...

A little bit about our party - there were 6 of us, a mix of immediate family, cousins, and Uncles/Aunts, adults and young adults.

Pros
- The house is located a little over a mile outside downtown Seattle with a bus route nearby (though we ended up walking/taking a car in each time)
- Galina's house is clean and extremely modern with granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances
- There are 3 bathrooms (two of them have showers), which was really nice in the morning while we were all getting ready
- Galina is quick to respond to any issues or questions. For example, the air mattress at the place had a huge hole in it. After I called her about it, she had a replacement dropped off the same day for us.

Cons
- The place says it sleeps 9 people, but I find that to be a bit inflated. There are 3 full/queen beds, 1 queen blow up air mattress, and a couch. To fit 9 people you would have to have 2 people on each bed, 2 people on the air mattress, and 1 on the couch. With 6 people it was even tight, just because there was only one couple in our party and it wasn't really appropriate for the others in our party to share beds.
- If you do have to blow up the air mattress, you will lose the functionality of the living room, as that is the only room with ample space to fit the blow up.
- The driveway and garage are really tight. We had a rental minivan and it wouldn't fit in the garage.

For the most part we had a great experience, but the deceiving sleeping accommodations were unfortunate. I would say this place could comfortably sleep 4-6. But only do 6 if there are multiple couples in your party. "
22843	286712	9.0	8.0	6556241	"The house is smaller than it looks, but OK for 4-6 people. The bed quality is poor except the one in the master bedroom and the neighborhood is not as nice as some other affordable places in Seattle.
This said, the biggest problem is SEATAC airport close approach: be prepared to count planes at the rhythm of one every 60-90 sec. In the silence of the night, these planes are very noisy and since the windows are not double-glazed ...
Brief, we are far from the promised ""great location"". "
22844	286712	9.0	8.0	6853206	Great location. Close to all Seattle sites. We had sufficient room for 9 and having three bathrooms was great. Very clean and ready for us. Thank you.
22845	286712	9.0	8.0	7005598	"The space is much tighter then anticipated. Though it is possible to house up to 9 tenants, but in my opinion I believe that it would be much more comfortable with a maximum of 6 (We had a total of 8). Small cars should be able to fit in the garage, did not wish to attempt with our truck to confirm however. The street is fairly tight and crowed during most of the day, but there usually is at least some places where you can park otherwise.
The location of the townhouse is a little bit hidden as it is behind another townhouse, so it is not easily noticed at first from the street. Like noted by previous tenants, it is fairly close to a small shopping area where you can purchase groceries, go to Starbucks, restaurants and cafes, and various other small stores. Please note that if you do wish to go to larger shopping areas that you will need to either drive or taxi around. 

My party and I found our stay to be decent, though we found that the place was not as cleanly as we had expected it to be. One of the major areas was the bathroom, as we needed to buy drain-o, as a large majority of the drains were clogged prior to our arrival. "
22846	286712	9.0	8.0	7755057	Place is great, very modern, and clean. We slept 5 very comfortably. 9/10 would stay again
22847	286712	9.0	8.0	8100874	We had a really nice time there. The house was very clean and looked really nice. Although it was a bit small for 8 people, we enjoyed our stay. The garage is pretty small but you can park on the street in front of the house. 
22848	286712	9.0	8.0	8381467	"Galina was very pleasant and the experience, overall, was good. The condo is much smaller than you might think; that's not a bad thing, just don't think you can easily sleep 8. Unless your group is filled with couples, don't expect more than space for 4. The neighborhood is fine; don't let people scare you off about it. 

The bottom line is: the place is fantastic for the price, the owner is kind and helpful, and if you're visiting Seattle to explore and discover (ie. not spending the majority of your time inside the place), I couldn't suggest it any higher than I do. "
22849	286712	9.0	8.0	13569672	Had a wonderful stay.The house was very clean. It was also in a nice walking distance form many different things.
22850	286712	9.0	8.0	19785701	"The house was exactly as described. Galina was awesome about responding to any questions quickly.  The place was very clean and we found it slept nine quite comfortably (one was on the couch).  Although we had four couples, so sharing beds wasn't a problem. 

The kitchen is a good size and has everything you need, and the three levels made it feel like we all had our own space.

The location is nice, close to public transit (which was needed to get downtown), and there is a large supermarket and pharmacy really close.  The area feels safe as well.

There's no TV, not that we had much time to watch one anyway."
22851	286712	9.0	8.0	21801662	Galina was very responsive, and access was easy.  The home was neat, clean and well furnished.  Great to have three separate bedrooms with their own baths.  The home is on a nice block that feels safe, although the broader neighborhood is very urban and varied.  Worked great for three colleagues on a business trip.  We'd do it again.
22852	286712	9.0	8.0	21970726	Galina made it super easy to come and stay at her place.     It was a comfortable standalone carriage house, well located to access the many cool areas of Seattle.  It was maybe a little tight for nine of us (but, seriously, what place wouldn't be!).  And it was a great, affordable way to be able to stay in one place with other friends attending a wedding.  
22853	286712	9.0	8.0	22291342	Galina's place was very beautiful and clean. It accommodated all 9 of us perfectly, although we did bring an extra air mattress that we used. Her place was only 10 minutes away from downtown. I would highly recommend staying with her.
22854	286712	9.0	8.0	26241468	Host was easy to communicate with-very nice and accommodating. We stayed for 6 weeks with 2 kids and it was a great temporary stay set up. Large enough space and rooms for all 4 of us. Location was central and easy to get around from.
22855	286712	9.0	8.0	32009919	the place was in an excellent location, and everything was neat and clean. the backyard was nice as well. the host was also very accomodating and flexible towards our arrival times!
22856	286712	9.0	8.0	41914964	The house that we stayed at this summer was amazing, it definitely matched the picture description that we were given and the location was accurately described. I stayed with 3 other people for about 3 months and the place was definitely homey and big enough for all of us. Galina was a great host and if we ever had any issues, I could just text her and she would come to the house and take care of the problem. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want to be close to downtown!
22857	286712	9.0	8.0	42575653	"The townhouse was very spacious and comfortable and comfortably slept all 8 of us during our stay. The location was perfect, 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, 20 minutes to downtown Bellevue and there are grocery stores and restaurants nearby.

Galina was a great host and she was very responsive with all my questions.

The townhouse does have a quite a few steps, the living room is situated on the second floor and all the bedrooms require walking two flights of stairs. So it was not as accessible as we would have liked for my grandparents.

Overall, the place is very well furnished and a great place to stay for a visit to Seattle!"
22858	286712	9.0	8.0	43952420	Galina's house was great for me and my coworkers. Quiet, clean, and convenient; I would absolutely stay here again!
22859	286712	9.0	8.0	45243674	"Very clean.  Seemed Quiet.  Close to downtown. There are 3 floors, lots of stairs, would be difficult for the elderly.  The garage is a little difficult to get in and out of due to the lay out, so street parking is preferred.  The Townhouse is hidden behind another townhouse.  Her number on airbnb was wrong, it was to some company called ""Pillow"" that used to own this listing.  She was very accommodating once we were able to get a hold of her.  There are 3 double real beds and 1 double inflatable bed.   We brought 2 extra air beds and were able to sleep 8 people with only 2 people having to share a bed and one on the couch.  The wifi has a difficult time handling 8 people trying to stream stuff at once since there's no tv."
22860	286712	9.0	8.0	46147293	Great house for our group.  We had two couples and two single friends heading to the west coast for a wedding.  Having 3 bathrooms was a huge help when everyone was getting ready.  Galina's house was in an easy location to uber around the city and out to points east (wineries!).  The house is clean and modern and had everything we needed.
22861	286712	9.0	8.0	46942203	Wow! I cannot say enough good things about Galina and her beautiful home! The townhouse is actually quite spacious and very easily sleeps 9 people with the really nice air bed. The location is amazing and the neighborhood is quiet and right around the corner from shopping, coffee, and restaurants and about 5 minutes to freeway access. The property itself was great, but what really made our stay was what an amazing hostess Galina was. She always replies to any questions very quickly and has excellent communication. She went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. When someone accidentally turned on the heater and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off, she came by and did it for us. And then, when our weekend event went longer than expected she accommodated our team by allowing us a later checkout. Polite, friendly, accommodating, and an A+++ hostess! Would recommend to my friends and stay with her anytime.
22862	286712	9.0	8.0	47962621	We had a fantastic stay here! The space was clean and spacious and our party of 9 fit perfectly! 
22863	286712	9.0	8.0	51569553	Working with Galina was a good experience.  She was very responsive and helped answer every question we had.  We liked the location and the neighborhood.  It was very clean and comfortable.  I just wish it had a TV for relaxing in the evenings.
22864	286712	9.0	8.0	53559925	"We never met Galina. The property is managed by TurnKey. Which was confusing. They asked for me to send a photo of my drivers license for verification even though i am verified through AirBnb with several reviews and references. 

Initial confusion aside, the neighborhood is quiet with ample parking. The house is nice, they fit a lot of stuff into a small space, which is impressive; there are 3 bathrooms! The small yard out back was a nice retreat.   "
22963	7429207	10.0	8.0	43974640	Brilliant host. Very easy to deal with and made us feel very welcome. The house itself was beautiful. 
23219	6411986	8.0	8.0	33329162	We loved staying here, plenty of space convent and easy to navigate. Great location especially if you have a car. Easy to get  to cap hill, downtown, bell town, etc. Also decently priced for Seattle.
23220	6411986	8.0	8.0	33865720	I enjoyed staying here. The space was neat and tidy and Tim was willing to answer any questions I had.
23221	6411986	8.0	8.0	34576881	This was my first Airbnb experience and I loved it. Tim, the host is very friendly as well as his roommate Rob. The apartment was in good shape and it was easy to come in and out as we pleased since we had our own key. The location is pretty close to the city so it was very convenient to just take Uber or Lyft from the apartment to the city each day. I had a wonderful experience and I plan to use Airbnb again in the future.
23222	6411986	8.0	8.0	35256703	The description of the place was accurate. Tim was very nice and welcoming. He also offered to pick us up from the airport. He is very nice and gave us recommendations of places to visit. The location of the apartment is so close to downtown and convenient.
23223	6411986	8.0	8.0	35842373	This was an awesome experience. The whole house is covered in super rad art, and Tim was a super gracious host. The room was clean and well appointed. It was clear how things worked and any house quirks. Its also a quick jaunt to a lot of rad areas in the city. Tim is cool and an engaging conversationalist. Thanks so much!!
23224	6411986	8.0	8.0	38293695	"Tim was very helpful; he left a detailed note describing rules, amenities, and tips. Replied quickly, and offered directions on how to get there from the airport most efficiently.

The space itself was more cluttered than I would consider comfortable; not that it's not livable, but it seemed every counter, corner, and wall-space was packed and stacked.

The bathroom was in good condition, clean, albeit a tight squeeze, especially in the shower for 6'2"" me. Just be prepared.

I appreciated the extra blankets and sleeping bags! Most of them smelled like dog though, which was a bit off-putting. To be honest, I must have skipped over the part of the listing that said they had a dog. Totally my bad. The listing DOES say they have a dog.

The kitchen was a bit of a mess - there was a cloud of gnats around the sink the entire time. 

It got rather hot at night, and there's no AC or fans. Windows don't have screens (and those that do are ripped open), so I didn't feel comfortable leaving them open.

In summary, Tim was a gracious host, but the space could use some work.

P.S. We had far too much fun with Alexa, the Amazon Echo."
23225	6411986	8.0	8.0	41110315	We were really happy with this place!  Spacious living room and kitchen, garden and great we could use Netflix and plenty of other utilities. The bed was super comfortable. Nice decorations too, with an endless amount of books and movies. It's doable to walk to the center, otherwise a taxi won't cost much. Tim and his roommate are very nice and they helped us where necessary. Also, we basically had the whole spot to ourselves the whole weekend! 
23226	6411986	8.0	8.0	45848567	The bed was super comfy! Tim was out of town but his roommate Rob was very nice and welcoming.
23227	6411986	8.0	8.0	46309920	Tim was great from the get go, super prompt with all correspondence and very helpful directing out of towners :) the house is older but adorable, really nice just outside the city, and everything was very clean. The bed is large and comfortable, the bathroom is clean and large, and the linens were great. Tims roommate is very quiet and conscientious and was really helpful setting us up with getting into the house. Great for young people exploring the city!!
23305	7048843	8.0	8.0	40145959	Great communication and easy to check in.  Place was simple and just what I needed.  Many thanks for your fast responses to all questions I had.  I enjoyed my stay.
23306	7048843	8.0	8.0	40773937	The room is spacious, Kevin is very friendly. The location is a bit inconvenient but still accessible with public transport. 
23307	7048843	8.0	8.0	41975083	Before my arrival, as well as during, Kevin was very informative and gave very detailed directions to places to eat nearby, as well as sources of transportation around downtown Seattle. The room is quiet, very spacious, and the King sized bed allowed both my friend and I to sprawl out and sleep very comfortably. The complimentary water and shampoo and body wash were a nice surprise. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I wouldn't hesitate to book again.
23308	7048843	8.0	8.0	42938088	Our stay with Kevin was great. We were late checking in, but Kevin was very accommodating and the process was smooth and simple. Kevin was very friendly when we met him outside. The neighbourhood is quiet and pleasant. The room was nice and spacious enough to comfortably accommodate a King bed and Queen mattress. The place in general was very clean. The bathroom was shared with ~2-3 other rooms which was a bit of an issue in the morning but not much. Though we didn't use the kitchen at all, it was somewhat sub-par and probably the only negative of the place. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the place for a short-term rental.
23309	7048843	8.0	8.0	43541957	Kevin answered my questions very quickly and promptly with tons of helpful information. The room was clean, bed was comfortable, and a clean bathroom. There was a fridge in the room which was great. There was 2 complimentary water bottles, cups, and shampoo.  It was a very comfortable stay. Location was near public transportation. 
23310	7048843	8.0	8.0	43732053	This was my experience using airbnb is was a great! The host was phenomenal very welcoming, made sure that my friends and I were comfortable! It was a great experience and surely I would contact the host again.
23311	7048843	8.0	8.0	43981559	My stay at Kevin's place has been very pleasant. Prior to arrival, Kevin has provided me with very informative messages about checking in as well as tips of getting around the house. The room itself is spacious, bright, clean, and very comfortable. I also had no problem contacting the house owner when I needed help and was replied immediately. Highly recommend this place!
23312	7048843	8.0	8.0	44331789	Kevin gave me all the information I needed to make my trip a breeze. Directions, near by restaurants, and clear instructions of getting into the room. The house itself was a little old so you really had to pull the doors hard to open and close them which was a little noisy, but everything was clean and well maintained. The shared bathroom only posed an issue one morning when I had to wait about an hour to use the restroom because everyone was showering right after each other. However that's expected when 3 rooms share 1 bathroom. Overall it was an easy visit and I'd recommend it for a low maintancene trip. 
23313	7048843	8.0	8.0	44703015	Although we didn't meet in person, the host was very helpful, placing an extra Queen sized bed to accommodate 3 people and also providing useful information on Seattle. The only issue was the toilet was shared among the occupants of 3 rooms. Still on overall a good place to stay and I would definitely stay again when I am back in Seattle.
23314	7048843	8.0	8.0	45122393	Kevin was a great host. My cousins and I were in Seattle for just the weekend so we only needed a place to pretty much freshen up and sleep, so the 4 of us were looking for to squeeze into one room. Kevin's large room not only had a king size bed, but he also provided another queen size mattress to help us be more comfortable. Everything went smoothly this weekend and the location is prime as all areas of Seattle were within a quick, cheap uber ride away. The bathroom was shared with 3 other guests, but this didn't turn out to be a problem for us and hopefully not for them either. Overall great stay!
23315	7048843	8.0	8.0	45697553	Kevin was very insightful and helpful in our stay and provided us with very convenient methods of checking in and checking out. Was very good at replying messages promptly and catering to our needs.
23316	7048843	8.0	8.0	46172861	My group of four had a wonderful stay at Kevin's for bumbershoot weekend. It was easy to check in and the room was exactly as described along with an extra mattress. It's in a nice neighborhood with easy bus access to downtown and a chill place to get some good pizza within walking distance. Kevin was excellent at communicating all the information needed to make our stay in Seattle the best it could be and was always quick to respond to any messages. 
23317	7048843	8.0	8.0	46768024	Very hands off and low-key, which I loved. Less like a room in a house and more like a hotel room. Kevin was very gracious about communication and recommendations. Also came across another person that lived in the house and she was extremely polite and friendly :)
23318	7048843	8.0	8.0	47276733	"My friends and I loved the airbnb room. It was perfect for our needs. 
The listing description was accurate. We loved that the house was near a big park, community garden, and bus stops. I appreciated that the host always responded back to my questions ASAP. For the affordable price, the room was high-quality, spacious, and clean. No complaints here. "
23319	7048843	8.0	8.0	48894807	Phenomenal location. Great place to crash. Sitting to eat a bit of a challenge (if you want to eat in). GRACIOUS host. Clean rooms. VERY accommodating. 
23320	7048843	8.0	8.0	49393038	Great communication, easy access, everything was clean and just as described! Great place to stay.
23321	7048843	8.0	8.0	50054209	A great value for Seattle. It's nothing flash, but if you want a good location and to save a little money, this is the spot. Kevin runs his Airbnb house smoothly so there is a lot of flexibility for check in and coming and going without host interaction. 
23322	7048843	8.0	8.0	50492543	The host is nice to give many food and traffic message. This room is lovely, but too small for four person. The kitchen and bathroom is not clean enough. Too many tenants at the same time in this house, so we should wait to use bathroom and kitchen, it's not conveninent. And the other tenants didn't wash dishes immediately, so the kitchen sink is dirty and messy.      
23323	7048843	8.0	8.0	50785364	We are really dissapointed. The bathroom was very dirty. The house smelt not well. The hallway was not clean. We will not come back to this house. 
23324	7048843	8.0	8.0	51061197	Near downtown. The room is ok. The landlord offered many information.
23325	7048843	8.0	8.0	52782373	Wonderful place!!! Located in a quiet, clean, safe neighborhood. Very close to multiple bus routs making it very easy to get anywhere.  The Room was large, clean and offered many wonderful amenities even had fridge and  tea kettle in the room. Would definitely choose to stay here when returning to Seattle 
23326	7048843	8.0	8.0	54218593	Kevin has his Airbnb down to a science. Everything was nice and easy, check in and check out is all automatic. Room was exactly as pictured, everything seemed great. For the price it was really good deal.
23327	7048843	8.0	8.0	55444574	We enjoyed the stay-nice host! Easy and fast to go to downtown and nice bedroom. Only wished that the washroom and kitchen is more clean.
23328	7048843	8.0	8.0	56685043	Kevin is easy to work with and the stay was nice. The bus routes are by his house and are easy to get to the downtown or Udub.
23329	7048843	8.0	8.0	57826018	Was very comfortable, Kevin responds quickly to messages and I will stay again in my next visit
23373	1246809	9.0	8.0	5202076	Staying with Prez was one of the coolest experiences we ever had. He gave us the full experience from picking us up at the airport despite our last minute arrival and also hooking us up with the best suite in town! Definitely a recommend for any of you traveling to Seattle.
23374	1246809	9.0	8.0	5268258	"This apartment was great. We stayed there with our puppy, and he enjoyed the little yard and walking around the (very hilly) neighborhood. The location was also great. Though it is not directly in downtown, the light rail station is about 10 minutes away by foot, and it is a 15 minute ride downtown. 

Keith (AKA Prez) checked in with us every couple of days to be sure that we were doing alright. "
23375	1246809	9.0	8.0	5327301	I had a very pleasant stay at Keith and Cherie's apartment.  The thing I like about airbnb so much is avoiding that touristy hotel vibe.  I like staying in real neighborhoods, so I understand the city from a resident's point of view.  The balcony at Keith and Cherie's place is huge, and the view of the mountains and surrounding greenery were very nice.  It is a plus to be able to do a load of laundry before departure, as well.  Very clean apartment with large shower.  Thank you!
23376	1246809	9.0	8.0	5662114	Prez & Cherie are absolutely amazing host! They were very welcoming and helpful, especially to somebody like me who just moved to Seattle. The apartment is very nice and quite. Super comfortable and close to the city. It was a great place to stay while I went apartment hunting in Seattle. I 100% recommend them!!
23377	1246809	9.0	8.0	5699759	Very comfortable, quiet one bedroom apartment. Prez and Cherie were very helpful, friendly and accommodating. I would absolutely recommend this place to others!
23378	1246809	9.0	8.0	5856607	Prez and Cherie's place was exactly as pictured and described and we had a great stay. Prez is extremely helpful and responsive and the place was clean and ready for us on short notice. The porch is a great place to sit on a summer evening and the keyless entry gives you one less thing to worry about. Really nice to have a washer/dryer too right in the unit. We were happy we found this place - we had our baby with us and having everything we needed all set right away made traveling a lot easier for us!
23379	1246809	9.0	8.0	6030565	"The unit we rented just what we were looking for and well prepared for guests. The unit is very spacious and so it would be fantastic value for a group of three or four.

It is also very convenient if you are coming to/from the airport and are reliant on public transport.

While everything ran smoothly, Prez and Cherie made it clear that they would be available at any time to assist with our request.

The only downside was the post booking 'further information' request. It was a bit tedious given that Airbnb covers almost all bases, especially reattaching pictures we already had on airbnb. It kind of felt like applying for my Chinese visa again i.e. ticking a lot of no brainer boxes."
23380	1246809	9.0	8.0	6084073	Some friends and I used this space for home base during a laid back bachelorette weekend, and it was ideal. Super quick cab ride to Capitol Hill, five minute walk to the light rail station for an easy trip downtown. You won't find premium movie channels or deluxe bedding, but the simple yet comfortable unit was the perfect, affordable, easy location we were looking for. MUCH cheaper than anything comparable at a hotel. Cherie was very quick to respond when we had a few issues with the key code and needed some extra linens. All in all, we were very satisfied with our experience. Would not hesitate to recommend this unit or the other units they have available.
23381	1246809	9.0	8.0	6141012	"Great communication and the place was amazing  and newly updated (or maybe it was always this nice).
Parking wasn't an issue as there was a spot right in front reserved. 
The only issue was some random occurrence with the freezer at an odd hour of the night, but they were very quick with a response to fix it that day (an easy fix was to unplug the freezer so it was a non-issue essentially). That issue isn't something that I would attribute to them, it more represents the care they take with responding to guests in the face of random occurrences. 
The place is near light rail and an easy walk down to QFC/starbucks if you need a quick bite. 


"
23382	1246809	9.0	8.0	6167634	"We had a great time at Prez and Cherie's place! The one bedroom unit was very clean and in a great location. Although I never met our hosts, they were very quick to respond to any questions through the phone. We also were allowed to have our pup at the place which was awesome. 
Overall, we had a great time and would recommend their place in a heart beat. "
23383	1246809	9.0	8.0	6185208	Although we didn't meet our host, it was so easy coordinating our arrival with Cherie through text since she was so responsive. The 1br apartment is big and well stocked (excellently stocked kitchen with utensils, plates, cheese graters, the works and extra blankets etc.) with a large, clean, new bathroom. Plenty of street parking around. It was spotless and the bed very comfortable. My only complaint (which is not the host's fault) was that the renters who had the attached house had dogs that wouldn't stop barking and you can sometimes hear them through the adjoining (locked) door. Overall, very comfy stay!
23384	1246809	9.0	8.0	6466038	Prez and Cherie were very accommodating and very nice! They made sure everything was taken care of for us. It was a very nice and pleasant experience!
23385	1246809	9.0	8.0	6760781	"Our first time using Air BNB and Prez & Cherie made it so easy.  They gave us their number so we could call or text if we needed anything.
The home was clean and comfy.  I'd stay here again.  We loved sitting on the balcony in the morning drinking our coffee and using the wifi to make plans to sightsee.
The only odd thing about the place is that there isn't a table or chairs.  No problem - we had breakfast in bed!"
23386	1246809	9.0	8.0	6904319	"Very clean and close to downtown 
Highly recommended 
Thanks "
23387	1246809	9.0	8.0	6921479	"I thoroughly enjoyed the Presidential treatment I got during my stay; Town Car service from the airport, and a chauffeured tour of several nightlife venues... Like having the key to the city!

Prez & Cherie follow through on the mantra that communication is key-- I couldn't ask for more attentive and responsive hosts. And the cleaning service also does a thorough job. This has been a uniquely delightful experience."
23388	1246809	9.0	8.0	6987383	Great hosts and very great/clean place!  They were very kind and checked up on us to make sure we have everything we need.  Thanks for everything!
23389	1246809	9.0	8.0	7096100	My parents loved it! Prez made sure we were able to get in and stopped by to say hello. He checked in regularly and even organized a breakfast table within a day. My parents felt very welcome and taken care off. We would definitely book the apartment again if we have guests visiting us in Seattle. Prez and Cherie are great hosts! 
23390	1246809	9.0	8.0	8061296	We had a nice stay at Prez & Cherie's.  They were easy to get a hold of, had a clean place and easy to get to.
23391	1246809	9.0	8.0	8162781	Basic place close to downtown, clean and quiet. The host are very available at any time and helpful. Thanks again.
23392	1246809	9.0	8.0	8243521	great location, prez and cherie are wonderful helpful hosts that go the extra step to make you feel comfortable in their space.
23393	1246809	9.0	8.0	10704634	"As a Pacific Northwest native, I've been to Seattle several times throughout my life, but it wasn't until my week long stay with Prez and Cherie that I really had a chance to get to know this wonderful city in-depth.

After landing at SeaTac, I took a quick train to Beacon Hill where Prez picked me up and gave me a quick tour of the neighborhood to make sure I felt oriented.  His place is just a 10 minute walk away from two different train stations, which makes for convenient access to downtown Seattle and the airport.

The accommodations themselves are exactly as shown in the photos: modern, clean and comfortable -- especially the bedroom and bathroom.  I was in town to get some writing done on a book, and the apartment was the perfect haven to relax and reflect, fixing meals in the fully-appointed kitchen, working from the comfort of the couch, admiring the view from the spacious porch, or unwinding with some HD cable TV.  There's even a dishwasher, washer and dryer, which makes the place perfect for a longer stay.

While the purpose of my trip was for creative work, you can't work all the time, which is why I was so grateful for the friendly community of guests that Prez has established at his multi-room unit just across the street.  During my stay, I met fellow travelers from across the world, sharing Seattle recommendations and tips.  Even better: as the owner of a transportation and entertainment company, Prez knows the city like the back of his hand and is always available to provide guidance or recommendations, whether it's a place to grab coffee, or suggestions to great nightlife.  If you don't feel up for taking the train, he is usually available to give you a lift in one of his cars or -- in one of the highlights of my trip -- on a party bus.

Ultimately, as Prez will tell you: Communication is KEY.  If you're just looking for a relaxing place to stay in a great part of Seattle, he'll get you set up and let you enjoy your trip.  At the same time, if you need anything at all, Prez is always just a phone call or a text-message away.

I'm grateful to Prez and Cherie for re-introducing me to one of America's truly great cities.  I'll be back soon -- and I'll be staying with them again, that's for sure."
23394	1246809	9.0	8.0	11367030	I had a great stay here. It was spacious and very clean. The only problem I had was the dog next door constantly barked every night. But other than that I would probably come back again. Prez was very pleasant and checked on me frequently through text. 
23395	1246809	9.0	8.0	13166748	The place was clean and just the way it was described on the listing. Even though the apartment is part of a bigger house I never really noticed the people in the other part of the house. Location is conveniently located near the airport and a lot of ethnic restaurants.  Prez and cherie were great host, checking on us several times to make sure we had everything we needed. I also found the keyless entry to be very convenient
23396	1246809	9.0	8.0	14453645	Was not happy with the place.  Dog kept barking, had to wait for a code for 30 mins as the owners did not send this prior to my check in time. The numbers I called went straight to VM.  I was so upset, left next night and didn't even refund me the night.  Would not stay here again.
23397	1246809	9.0	8.0	14551619	"Prez was very friendly, he picked up my mom from the airport and let her have an early check in as she flew in early. The place was clean and pleasant. The price was reasonable. The neighborhood was quiet. I picked this place because it was handicap accessible, for my mom; and she appreciated the shower. 

However, I had asked about the wheelchair lift in the initial inquiry, as my mom has a hard time with stairs. We never used it, because the key could not be found. While my mom was able to navigate the stairs, it was a source of stress and one I thought I had taken steps to prevent. 

I would stay with Prez again, he was friendly and responded to texted concerns quickly, but I was very disappointed at the lack of the amenity that I booked for. "
23398	1246809	9.0	8.0	15323118	We love the location of the place! It's very strategic and near to downtown. The apartment is clean and comfort and have a spacious bathroom. We have a nice stay there. The host is very friendly too!
23399	1246809	9.0	8.0	15506504	Prez was awesome and was very quick to respond to all my questions. The apartment has everything you could need and there's a grocery store walking distance. Everything was clean and spacious. Couldn't have asked for more. Thanks again Prez!
23400	1246809	9.0	8.0	15686459	The apartment itself was clean n comfortable. The exterior n garden however could be better maintained.  
23401	1246809	9.0	8.0	15877642	Clean, well kept apartment in the Beacon Hill area of Seattle. About a 10-15 minute stop to the light rail which takes you to the airport and downtown Seattle. Very easy to navigate the city without a car from this locale. The unit was very welcoming especially after long travel days. Would definitely stay here again.
23402	1246809	9.0	8.0	16065729	This AirB&B for a few nights was perfect!. It was centrally located to our event (Wedding) at Jefferson Park and a very short drive to Downtown Seattle (maybe 5 miles). The train station (a very brisk walk up the hill) about 5 blocks was close enough for us.  Everything was in good working order and everything you needed was a available. Definitely recommend this unit to anyone. The hosts were only a txt away and very accommodating. 
23403	1246809	9.0	8.0	16545783	The house was spacious enough for me and my 3 friends. We had a wonderful stay and felt welcomed. We were out  during the day most of the time exploring Seattle. The location was close to the light rail which was our main transportation. We didn't mind walking, but for those who don't have a car it can be trek. The bed was very comfortable and extra sheets & towels were provided! 
23404	1246809	9.0	8.0	16713745	My family and I stayed at Prez & Cherie's place in Summer 2014. The place was the same as it is on the picts. Quite neighborhood. My parents slept in the bedroom (the bed was comfy). Me and my brother slept on the sofa bed. The bathroom was spacious. We didn't meet Prez and Cherie but it was easy communicating by text or call. 
23405	1246809	9.0	8.0	16847632	An itinerary was provided via email/Airbnb messaging before we arrived at the listing and provided very thorough instructions, as well as addressing FAQS and concerns one may have about the stay. I would say the listing description was pretty accurate. The suite was clean and tidy when we arrived. The location itself was not too far from popular destinations, and there was easy access to the main road. The neighborhood was quiet in my opinion, no obnoxious loud noises from my 2-night stay. Prez was very accommodating during my stay and is a very good host.  
23406	1246809	9.0	8.0	17015511	"Prez was really nice and responded quickly to phone calls and texts. He let us check in early and stopped by to say hi and make sure everything was going well. I couldn't have asked for more from a host - excellent experience. Absolutely no issues with check-in or check-out. 

Pros - the house location provides quick access to downtown Seattle and the lake. We rented in the middle of the summer and were really happy to have AC (many houses in Seattle don't have this). The inside of the house was nice. The pictures don't show this, but there's also a couch in the living room. It was fun to be able to watch some of the Seafair airshow from the balcony.

Cons - the exterior of the house and balcony was a bit dirty with lots of spiders. There's also a door that separates your room from the neighbor's and you can hear everything (talking, dishes clanging in the sink when we're sleeping). 

That said, we had a great time!"
23407	1246809	9.0	8.0	17349206	Although I never met Prez or Cherie during the visit, they were very responsive via email and texting before the visit & stopped by when we were out sightseeing.  We made a small grocery request beforehand, they were very gracious to get everything on the list and have it ready in the apartment after arrival.  Overall, the apartment was described accurately, with the highlights being the fully stocked kitchen and a great bathroom.  We liked how it was a private apartment, although you can hear everything in the adjacent house (alarm clocks, dogs, arguing, etc.).  The exterior can be a bit more welcoming and although parking was available, we had an SUV and it was a bit difficult to park.   A table & chairs would have been nice for the meals, but we just ate it on the porch sofa!
23408	1246809	9.0	8.0	17581258	The overall experience with Prez was great and exactly what we needed in the midst of a long west coast trip! The house was comfortable, clean and as expected! The house was quiet enough to get some much needed rest, yet close to downtown and the light rail which made getting around the city a breeze! 
23409	1246809	9.0	8.0	18192207	"We had four people, two on the bed, two on the pull-out. There was enough room for a cozy stay. The place was clean and well kept-up. The oven, stove, fridge, etc. are all in great shape; we used them almost every day to make breakfast and dinner, which saved lots of money! It is a moderately-short, hilly walk to the train, which you can ride anywhere, as many times as you want for $5/day. The streets were around the are were not kept up very well and some of the houses has junk around that made the neighborhood seem a bit sketchy, but we walked back to the apartment late at night a couple of times, and we had no indication that the neighborhood was unsafe. 
Prez and Cherie were great at responding quickly, and they are super friendly! They live close by and even invited us over to their place when they had people over one night. Overall, we really enjoyed the stay!"
23410	1246809	9.0	8.0	18482840	"Right off the bat, Prez was a great host. Although we didn't have that much interaction, he was available when needed.

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly able to check in earlier and drop off our stuff so we could explore the city. He welcomed us on the porch and gave us a quick tour of the place. 

The place itself is a comfy, cozy place. The 1 bed in the room was super comfortable and the air mattress and pull-out sofa bed all fit in the living room. For my group of 5 it worked out fine. Bathroom was big, nice and clean. Kitchen was also convenient to have. The best part is the AC--which I heard was rare in Seattle. It was a lifesaver during our hot weekend there (85 degrees in Seattle, say what?). TV in the living room and the bedroom was also nice to have and kept us entertained during our idle time.

Location was really perfect--basically 15 mins to where ever you needed to go! The neighborhood is adorable and quiet. 

Check out process was so easy. Just pack up, leave the towels in the hamper, wash your dishes, and go! 

Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. Nice host, great location, cute and clean place with a comfy bed--why not! "
23411	1246809	9.0	8.0	18789473	"A group of 6 of us stayed at Prez and Cherie's for the Penny Arcade Expo convention.

We got settled in with very little problem. The house is clean and tidy, and the place is air conditioned which is very nice for the hot weather. The porch is nicely lit do you don't stumble at night (when you sit porch outside, you can hear crickets! don't worry, doesn't travel inside). Our group ran into some problems but Prez and Cherie were patient as I tried to rectify any problems that arose. Though the rules were too strict for a couple of people in our group, understand that you are a guest in someone's home and you have to be mindful of their property--Sorry about the makeup on the towels.

All in all, my stay at Prez and Cherie's was good, and special thanks to Janaye for welcoming and showing us around the house."
23412	1246809	9.0	8.0	19485732	Although I did not meet Prez, he did text to see how I was doing at his place the next day.  I wasn't able to reach him a few days before arriving to get the details, so I did have to call him to get access and set up to the place.  The place is nice and spacious, especially since we had 4 adults and a baby. 
23413	1246809	9.0	8.0	20453209	We had a great stay during our 5 nights! It was nice to be able to cook and relax. It's in a quiet area that's really close to get to inner-Seattle by car or train. Some places are walking distance as well. If you have a larger group, be prepared to be in tight corners and the 1 bathroom. Prez was super friendly, helpful and stopped by a couple times to say hey which was nice. The shower is great and it was nice to do some laundry with ease. I recommend this spot!
23414	1246809	9.0	8.0	21316924	Deadly Location, Deadly People, 100% Happy! Will stay again
23415	1246809	9.0	8.0	25978131	Prez and Cherie provided all the information I needed to make our check-in easy.  The accommodations were just as described.  From this location, it is an easy 10 minute walk to the Beacon Hill Link station, so getting around town is simple.  10 minutes will also get you to some great local restaurants and coffee shops.
23416	1246809	9.0	8.0	28280230	Prez & Cherie were great hosts! The room wasn't our favorite, but for the price it was good!
23417	1246809	9.0	8.0	28731615	Prez was very accommodating to our check-in time and was helpful when we needed him! He was really friendly and chill - thanks for making our stay enjoyable!
23418	1246809	9.0	8.0	29757413	Prez & Cherie's mother-in-law suite was perfect for me. Prez was very welcoming and super helpful. The apartment was as described, nicely equipped with all of the kitchen and bath items you would need, clean and comfortable. I loved the shower! The washer and dryer was super handy. This would be perfect for a handicapped guest because they had an elevator and everything was handicapped accessible. The location is primo too! Being so close to I-5, major roads and 2 Link stations made getting around a snap. I was traveling alone and felt safe there. I definitely recommend staying here.
23419	1246809	9.0	8.0	31004456	This place was great.  Prez was great. Would recommend this rental!
23420	1246809	9.0	8.0	32665191	We left our booking to the last minute. Luckily we got offered to stay at this beautiful, self contained home. Much better than staying in a small hotel room. Prez was very prompt with his replies and very patient in answering my queries. Definitely recommend this place.
23421	1246809	9.0	8.0	33120928	Hosts were super welcoming & helpful in suggesting local places to check out. They have a layout of pamphlets in the living room that are fun to browse through too. Neighborhood was ideal-- central location and close to everything!
23422	1246809	9.0	8.0	34946886	It has a good location, close to the city center and airport. And you will find everything you need when you live.
23423	1246809	9.0	8.0	35318895	Prez was very kind when my plans changed last minute.
23424	1246809	9.0	8.0	35797228	"We had a great stay in Prez and Cherie's MIL suite! There was a minor hiccup with communication at the start, but once we got that worked out everything went fine. 
The space was perfectly located for what we needed and the best part was the washer and dryer in unit!"
23425	1246809	9.0	8.0	37197419	Prez & Cherie were great hosts! We had last minute plans and didn't stay for our last night, but Prez & Cherie graciously offered a partial refund. The place was clean and tidy, and we were only a 10-minute drive to downtown. Would highly recommend to stay here if you're in Seattle.
23426	1246809	9.0	8.0	37999829	"Prez was welcoming and accommodating. He was a nice host.
The room itself is spacious and having good facilities. 
The location of Prez needs six stops from Beacon Hill station to Westlake downtown station. And it takes 10 minutes walk up to the hill from Prez place to the station - which is a very good exercise to your heart!"
23427	1246809	9.0	8.0	38734153	The owner was great.  We loved the location!  The unit had all of the amenities we needed.
23428	1246809	9.0	8.0	40087492	Carpet could use a cleaning but overall good for the price. Convenient location - very close to downtown.  Very spacious and clean bathroom.  
23429	1246809	9.0	8.0	42502173	Clean place and easy access, all that we needed, very accommodating with short notice. Thank you
23430	1246809	9.0	8.0	42752364	Thank you really enjoyed the space, so much better than a hotel room. Bed was really comfy. The directions from downtown on the light rail was easy to follow. We recommend this place to anyone.
23431	1246809	9.0	8.0	43856851	The house is clean and well equipped, near the bus station and light rail station, very convenience. Prez is an easygoing host and he picked me up at the first day from the light rail station. Recommend ;)
23432	1246809	9.0	8.0	45264753	Prez was a warm and gracious host, and checked in several times through the stay to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. The suite was comfortable and clean, and well located for our purposes. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with the host again.
23433	1246809	9.0	8.0	47947962	The fact that we were able to check in late at night was amazing. Everything was great the price the location they're room definitely a great first airbnb experience. 
23434	1246809	9.0	8.0	51251269	I had a wonderful stay in this place, very close to downtown and very private. The hostess are very relaxed and caring. Loved it here and will definitely be back! 
23435	1246809	9.0	8.0	56280090	"This place was amazing. I was looking for a place close to work and there place was open. And wow did I score. It's really homey and was super clean. It's had all the things to make my stay fantastic. A full size kitchen with all the cookware I needed. 
The bathroom was large and also extra clean. 
I really enjoyed the front porch were I could read at night and just decompress after a long work day. 
The best part was the hosts are extra nice and accommodating with my stay. I for sure would stay here again! I recommend anyone who's staying in Seattle to give this place a shot!"
23718	9532861	8.0	8.0	55326289	Beautiful loft. Internet did not work, which was unfortunate. Great place if you are looking for minimalism and a convenient location.
24799	7697340	10.0	8.0	43172005	We were the first guests for this wonderful place with a fantastic host.  Lovely new modern house in East Lake.  Patio on the roof has gorgeous views of the lake and Seattle skyline.  The house is very tastefully furnished with all the modern touches.  Ruby is an absolutely fantastic host.   Ruby provided very detailed and helpful information of the house and the area, and was very responsive when we had questions. Would highly recommend to my friends. Thanks Ruby.
24800	7697340	10.0	8.0	48901213	12 hours before our arrival our host tried cancelling our reservation and told us there were sewer problems. When we arrived it was dirty, hair all over the master bath and bedroom, dishes still in dishwasher, laundry in machine, no room for food of our own. She told us there would be 3 bikes and there was none. She told us the neighbors that shared the deck knew she rented her property but they had no idea. After we left she has continued to harass us about the sewer problem saying this is our fault. Due to the way she treated us throughout our stay, we would never reccomend this property to anyone.  She had no respect for us as guests and has given us no reason to ever use this website again. 
24979	3316219	8.0	8.0	16211604	"We stayed in the downstairs unit at Gavin's. Located close to several bus lines to both downtown and the U District in the gorgeous Eastlake neighborhood, Gavin's place was the perfect space for our stay. The unit was spacious, contained all the essentials (including cookware, hairdryer, towels, etc.), was easy to access using the security coded doors and, with two bedrooms and two couches, allowed the three of us to stay very comfortably. 

The unit is also just blocks from Lake Union and nearby several restaurants, as well as the famous Voxx coffee and a few bars. It's also just a 20-minute bus ride from downtown, Pioneer Square, CenturyLink Field, Safeco Field, the waterfront and Pike Place Market. 

Gavin was very responsive and his manager Pushpa was available for any questions or needs while we were there. Parking was also available for those who will be bringing a car. Be aware that the house is right next to Interstate 5, so you may have to get used to noise but within a day or so we were used to it. Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend the space to anyone looking for an ideal location without being in the middle of downtown.

"
24980	3316219	8.0	8.0	16725335	My friends and I enjoyed our stay at this residence. The housekeeper, Pushpa, was readily available to answer questions and was very accommodating with our early check in and late check out. The room with 2 Queen sized beds was really a room with one Queen sized bed and a Queen sized mattress on the floor. The space did not look like the pictures. The location was pretty good but you really should have a car. We used Uber to get around everywhere. There is wifi but it wasn't the fastest. There are a few places to eat and a convenient store down the hill. Overall it was clean, not too noisy, and in a relatively good location. 
24981	3316219	8.0	8.0	16987716	"The house was on a busy street and a little difficult to park and get in and out of driveway. The housekeeper was nice and easy to get in touch with. 
"
24982	3316219	8.0	8.0	17137581	Nice big space, convenient location.  The flat could have been cleaner and the wifi network was non existent. 
24983	3316219	8.0	8.0	17779755	"Busy/noisy location near the freeway. Parking was a challenge, but we worked it out with other tenants and some car juggling. 

Unit was not as clean as I would have expected for the price (dirty towels hanging on backs of doors for example), and some maintenance needs to be done in the bathroom and kitchen to bring the unit up to snuff. We were unable to close the bathroom window, as it had apparently been 'painted open' instead of 'shut'. The window is alongside the back deck, which could easily be reached from the ground. This was a little unnerving to my wife, who wondered if we would be safe as we slept. 

I would suggest a modest investment in a plastic tray to help unjumble the mismatched flatware, and perhaps a set of matching plates/glassware for the cupboard. As it was, it seemed like all the kitchen utensils were purchased at Goodwill. It looked like a paint job had been done in the recent past, but I don't think the painters paid a great deal of attention to detail. That could be revisited to good effect.

The online photos look very nice and might be a little misleading. On close examination that only comes with actually being there, it didn't seem as clean/straight as the pictures looked. (I don't think that's deception on the part of Gavin: I'm just saying that pictures only tell so much and they looked nicer than reality) Someone more discerning than I might be disappointed.

Gavin was polite, responsive and pleasant, but our dealings were with his coordinator, who was 40 minutes late for our check-in (2:40pm), then wanted into the unit 20 minutes early the next day. She was polite, but it was mildly inconsiderate, given their *strict* check-out time of 10am the next morning. I understand that there were unusual circumstances that weekend, but given the lateness of our check in, I would have expected the courtesy of waiting until the agreed upon check out time to come knocking at the door.

The bedrooms/living room were fine and comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen could use some work. I would have been OK with all of this if the price had been more reasonable. As it was we could have stayed in a very nice hotel for the $200 we were charged.

It must sound like I was very unhappy, but I wasn't. The place was 'ok'. With a few improvements in maintenance and process I would upgrade it to a B. Drop the price to an appropriate $125 and I think Gavin has a very reasonable place to stay for a quick visit. At it's current state/price point, I don't think I would book again however."
24984	3316219	8.0	8.0	18006701	I'm sorry to say that our stay was less than desirable.  The house, albeit old, was in a somewhat dilapidated state, especially where the plumbing was concerned.  Also, we don't think our bed sheets had been washed and there were small blood stains on the sheets.  The hot water handle on the bathroom sink is missing a screw so the ceramic handle kept falling off.  I think a youth hostel would have been more comfortable and clean. There was a towel in one of the drawers that had stains on it.  Super gross!
24985	3316219	8.0	8.0	18246169	The place was as advertised and easy to get to from the bus line. Thanks for having us!
24986	3316219	8.0	8.0	18567316	Gavin is being very helpful. The space is clean and nice, located right off the highway. Slightly loud if the windows are opened. Love the parking space. Great experience overall. 
24987	3316219	8.0	8.0	18612679	"We stayed for a quick night at Gavin's after coming back from a backpacking trip on the Olympic Peninsula -- some showers, a dinner in Eastlake, and then fell asleep and left first thing in the morning explore the city -- and it suited our needs just fine. I should note also that we ended our hiking trip a day earlier than expected, so we booked Gavin's place last-minute in the afternoon of the day we planned to arrive; it was great to be able to find something so quickly.

It is right near the highway,  but we didn't have any problems with traffic or noise. Our main suggestions would be that the shower and lighting could be updated a bit (the place definitely looks better in the daylight of the pictures, but to be fair, we arrived at night and left early), and on a warm night it was a little hot with no fans that we could find and some windows that wouldn't open. I did call the manager Pushpa to clarify where we were supposed to park (the language in the house manual was a little confusing) and it went straight to voicemail -- but, it was a last-minute booking, and we didn't end up having any problems with it."
24988	3316219	8.0	8.0	18631547	The place was in a convenient location and clean and tidy - great for our quick one night stay.
24989	3316219	8.0	8.0	19042762	My trip to Seattle was amazing and it wouldn't have been possible without Gavin. The house was beautiful, clean, and just a few minutes from down town. It was right off of the 5 making it so convenient to get to, didn't have to worry about getting lost in a new city. The drive way was big enough for 2 cars (if you really squeeze them in there) which is impressive for being so close to down town. Although I did not personally meet Gavin, he had amazing response time and was vary helpful with questions I had. If I visit Seattle again (which I plan to) Gavin will be the first place I look!
24990	3316219	8.0	8.0	19205406	Gavin's place suited our needs perfectly, as it is situated in a convenient location and was a short walk from where our family we were visiting live. It is right nearby the I-5, but we didn't find the noise to be a problem at all. 
24991	3316219	8.0	8.0	19365157	A tad disappointed! Water pressure in sink very bad! Kitchen old and inadequate! Windows didn't close! TV didn't work due wifi down! No clothes iron. A little bit away from life (25 min walk) all in all very disappointed as this was my first and worst airBnb experience  
24992	3316219	8.0	8.0	19537799	"The house was a mess when we arrived at check in. The house keeper didn't come until two hours after we checked in. 

There is NO wifi and if you tell Gavin about this he will begin to read his laundry list of excuses of how it's not his fault or problem but either yours or the internet providers... neither of which is was (because I called the company on his behalf). 

The shower leaks on the ground.

The windows are propped open with no way to lock.

The floors feel unswept and mopped, which makes me even more concerned about if the sheets are actually changed. Seems like the cleaning lady just spot cleans.

The location is really great. 

There is lots of space for plenty of people to have a nice comfortable time.

The pull-out is literally a giant mattress you pull out of the closet in back... but that frees up an extra couch.

Honestly, I'm tired of AirBnb hosts thinking they can buy properties, rent them all out to make an income, evade tax laws of the hotel industry because of this, and just treat their guests with no respect. WE ARE PAYING CUSTOMERS, NOT HOMELESS PEOPLE YOU ARE PUTTING UP FOR FREE. Gavin spoke to me like I was indebted to him for some reason and yet made no effort to seem conscientious that his lack of care and misrepresented amenities created an awful amount of trouble for us as working professionals trying to make a quick weekend getaway home for a reunion possible amidst our busy work schedules.

If you just want a party house and don't care about anything but a place to crash and pack in a ton of people in a good central location, this house is a perfect rent for you. Just don't tell him how many people you have because he'll never know anyhow. When we asked him if he could come by to help us with his archaic wifi router, he insisted it'd take hours since he in not in the area but he could send his house cleaner by, who was a very nice woman, but he expressed directly as ""not able to understand technology, even basic email communication was difficult"".

Anyhow, we are happy people and still were able to look past everything, but don't believe the hype. This is just a conveniently located place to drop your stuff off and go find the real beauty of Seattle elsewhere.

24993	3316219	8.0	8.0	21648357	The place was clean, furnished well, and very spacious. 
24994	3316219	8.0	8.0	22508545	The house was clean and has a lot of character. It was a perfect place to stay for a few nights and in a cool location. 
24995	3316219	8.0	8.0	22780325	Good stay. Exactly what I was looking for. 
24996	3316219	8.0	8.0	23118527	Gavin was a very gracious and laid back host. He was nice enough to bring us more towels. The apartment is relaxing and it posesses a quaint charm. You can hear some road noise but that did not bother me. I liked the neighborhood and being so close to the lake and some cute houseboats. 
24997	3316219	8.0	8.0	26789404	It was a great time to stay for a girls night in so cozy and spacious apartment. It is very nice, vintage and close to restaurants. Thanks Gavin! 
24998	3316219	8.0	8.0	27419890	"I had a last minute trip to take family from AZ to visit Seattle for a site seeing and possible future move, so finding a place close to downtown and easy to access was great! We arrived late after touring the back roads from Portland to Seattle and enjoying the Bremerton Ferry view of the city. I received info from Gavin in a detailed text message while out of phone service and had everything we needed to access the house. The apartment was clean, neat, made beds and towels ready. A great last minute find for a quick overnight trip. Gavin offered places to visit in the neighborhood, but we had a short schedule to get around the city. The best part was off street parking and walking straight into the apartment. No, parking 3-4 blocks away and taking everything out and repacking in the morning.

Great access to Pike Street, Space Needle, Capitol Hill, and beyond. I would stay here again. "
24999	3316219	8.0	8.0	27478631	"The place was nice, with typical old place ""quirks"" (lack of electrical plugs, somewhat placated by extension cords placed here and there, squeaky floors, old school kitchen etc), and the photos are very accurate (though now they have some nice dark leather couches instead of the white cloth ones shown in the pictures. 

I had trouble (my own doing) getting in, Gavin was available by phone quick and walked me through it. Place was SUPER CLEAN, and though it is almost right next to the I-5 highway, wasn't too bad on noise, especially in the back bedroom.

Kitchen is well stocked - dive into the cupboards and you'll even find a hand blender, mixer, lots of bowls and stuff to cook with, good amount of glassware, etc. There's even candles and such to light up in the evening if you want. 

Be aware - there's a TV, but nothing plugged (there was a remote for something to access netflix, but couldn't find the actual thing to make it happen). If you bring a Chromecast, you're set.  

Internet speed was okay. Horrible going up (I tried to upload my photos to the cloud storage, that was mission impossible) but good enough down to your computer to watch netflix or something else.

Overall, a great deal, for a reasonably close stay to ""the happenings"" in Seattle - 2 blocks down a hill and you're in the Eastlake village area. Hop in your car, drive on Boylston / under the highway, and you're a few minutes away from 12th and the Broadway Capitol hill neighbourhoods. 

Recommended, and I'd stay here again."
25000	3316219	8.0	8.0	27501134	Very convenient and centrally located!!! Worked out perfect for our one night in the city!!!!
25001	3316219	8.0	8.0	27879038	The apartment is spacious and easy to get to. We drove so don't know how convenient it is for public transportation. The code to get into the apartment door didn't work but the host responded right away and sorted it out. The wifi was spotty and slow at times. The upstairs guests were loud and running footsteps could be heard all afternoon when one of us stayed in. We didn't actually meet the host but he was helpful and quick to respond via the app. We had a great trip to Seattle.
25002	3316219	8.0	8.0	28166923	"All in all, the place was as expected from Gavin's posting.  The rooms were spacious, furniture was comfortable, linens were all clean and sufficient. The kitchen was well stocked and clean. The neighborhood was great, and perfect for us as we were visiting family down in the Lake Union houseboats.  Some cute and delicious restaurants within easy walking distance.   The floors are extremely dirty and need a major deep clean.  Also the traffic noise was quite loud.

As for Gavin as a host, he was quick to respond to my questions leading up to the trip; however, didn't really answer all my questions, and we had a pretty big mix up over the correct code to enter the unit, and whether the Pack n' Play would be there.  He gave us the code for the upper unit, though we were renting the lower.  I wrote back to get the information straight and didn't get a clear response from him until after we had arrived. Then when I told him there was no crib, he told me to knock upstairs, and if they don't answer to just go in.  I didn't appreciate that, and wondered whether he'd tell them to do the same if they needed something from our unit.  We did eventually meet the upstairs neighbors and sorted it out, but it was a rocky start.   

There are a lot of pro's to the place, but I wouldn't book again.  The deal breakers for me were the dirty floors, traffic noise, and poor communications .  "
25003	3316219	8.0	8.0	28232076	The place was very spacious. I liked that the beds were a good size and the rooms were comfortable to stay in. The area it's in is very green and had many paths to go running on. It was quiet during the evening and is conveniently close to down town Seattle. 
25004	3316219	8.0	8.0	28294196	Great place to stay! It is close to everything. Had a little difficulties with the door but it all worked out Gavin walked me through it on the phone. Highly recommended!
25005	3316219	8.0	8.0	28508394	Great experience! Easy entry and exit, location is right near Capitol Hill nightlife.
25006	3316219	8.0	8.0	28615192	The location of this place is great. The apartment is definitely spacious and can fit 4 people comfortably. The bathroom is really old and pretty gross, but if you can get past that, it's a reasonably priced place to stay close to all of Seattle's best sites. I'd recommend this to anyone who isn't picky and just wants to be close to downtown without spending over $150 a night. 
25007	3316219	8.0	8.0	28879517	"Very convenient location a few exits away from Pike Place and a short drive to the freeway. This is a duplex where people are renting upstairs and renting downstairs. Please verify which unit you are staying in. There was a mix up during my stay. It's not really the best feeling rushing from dinner and being told you need to ""get your stuff out of there right now"". The place is dirty with hair all over the restroom floor. The cleaning fee is going to the cleaners but they aren't doing their job thoroughly. We arrived early and waited till our check in time and the cleaners still weren't done. It was really cold and the heater wasn't working even though I cranked it up higher than recommended. I wouldn't stay here again. "
25008	3316219	8.0	8.0	29056955	All and All a great experience. Gavin was on point with all my needs and most importantly he was quick to respond with any of my messages. House is Located in a perfect location. Close to the party scene in Capital Hill. If working out, getting exercise is more your thing, the famous Howe(Lakeview blvd & Howe) stair sets are right around the corner. You can find many active locals there. Those stairs are no joke. Intense workout with a great view of the lake and city. I would gladly return to Gavin's place for my next Seattle trip.
25009	3316219	8.0	8.0	29435197	This character home was neat and clean. The beds were soft and we slept soundly. No tv and we did not miss it. Wifi works great. Super location and we loved the neighbourhood. No complaints.
25010	3316219	8.0	8.0	29607157	This location is very convenient to the lake, access to the interstate and near downtown. Very easy to get in and out of traffic but with a close in location. Very comfortable.  It was nice to have a few amenities in the pantry. This place could only be better if a TV was available- but not necessary because of its great location. 
25011	3316219	8.0	8.0	30009822	The place was great. We had to book it the day we needed it, and everything ran smoothly. Clean and spacious, would stay at Gavin's again for sure. 
25012	3316219	8.0	8.0	30247747	"The house is located in a great neighborhood just blocks from Union lake. It is also few minutes driving from both city center and downtown Seattle with is covenient.
It is really easy to get the house and also check in because of the keypad doorlock on the front door, so just virtual contact with the host.
The house has 2 confortable queen beds on separated rooms and 2 extra mattresses for additional guests. Nevertheless the pictures must be updated, living room looks completly diferent, no tv at all and brighter than it really is. The bathroon is ok with a good shower but the kitchen is not. 
The house was fine for a weekend but If you are planning to stay longer take into account that there is no dinning table neither washing machine.
The hard wood floor looks older and there is lack of maintenance. Oh something really important is that is difficult to find and electrical plug.
"
25013	3316219	8.0	8.0	30734689	Gavin was really great with communications. The duplex was clean and spacious. It was at a great location to go downtown by transit or car and we are happy to have a big corner store and good restaurants within a block or 2. Thank you!
25014	3316219	8.0	8.0	30817364	The apartment is clean and spacious. Beds are really comfry.  Location is great. It is a good place to spend the night while you are exploring Seattle.

"
25016	3316219	8.0	8.0	32183696	Although I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Gavin, he was truly remarkable with his organisation and attention to detail. He also fielded ad hoc requests and questions with a much-appreciated sense of humour. The house itself was also fantastic: spacious, beautiful and well-maintained. It was the perfect spot to explore Seattle - close to the water, a lovely  long walk to Downtown along the water and a short stroll to Capitol Hill.
25017	3316219	8.0	8.0	32218146	Had a last minute trip to Seattle and needed a place to crash for the evening. Was able to book Gavin's space the day of our stay with no hassle. Unit is well appointed, comfortable, and clean. Having dedicated parking in Eastlake is a huge bonus. 
25018	3316219	8.0	8.0	32510756	Booking was simple and easy. The place was clean and spacious, however, it was a little too big for 2 people. We didn't have any shower problems so it was great. We love the location of the place because its right next to the highway and everything we did was about 5-10 minutes drive. We did rent a car and it was quite a challenge to park outside especially during rush hours. Also, I think they remodel the house or something because it looks pretty different than the pictures. The pictures on website is brighter and nicer.
25019	3316219	8.0	8.0	33366427	We stayed in this 2BD split level house for 6 nights. It was very easy to find the place and gain access upon arrival. The heating was very confusing and while there were instructions, we didn't figure it out. The pictures were not accurate to what we saw when we walked in. The decor is quite different in the living room (brown couches). Overall the place was clean and the host was responsive. When we arrived,  the light in on of the rooms was not working. We informed Gavin right away and he responded, but unfortunately he did not come and fix this during our stay -- which would have been nice so we could see better at night. The location was convenient and and overall we enjoyed our stay.  
25020	3316219	8.0	8.0	33488447	Nice, clean home. Booking was easy and straight-forward. Plenty of space with comfortable beds. Right by the interstate which was a bit noisy, but also convenient. The Eastlake location was great. 
25021	3316219	8.0	8.0	33797511	Great experience at Gavin's. All the information was easy to understand abs everything was where we needed it. Would totally stay there again if I ever come back!
25022	3316219	8.0	8.0	33975495	For a last minute booking I was very impressed!  Joshua was a very prompt gracious host.  His place is very close to downtown Seattle, just a short bus ride away.  This place is amazing for the location and price and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area.  
25023	3316219	8.0	8.0	34011320	Gavin's home was very spacious and comfortable. The house had everything we needed. The parking space was a huge bonus for us! Booking was quick and simple and the host was very responsive.

25025	3316219	8.0	8.0	34711408	Good experience, house as described. A bit tricky to find extra bedding but sorted out quickly. Very good overall. A bit expensive for the area. 
25026	3316219	8.0	8.0	34808425	The neighborhood was very convenient and the place is exactly as described. Access to the place was seamless and we did not have any issues. There is plenty of character in the home. The beds were very comfortable! I would definitely stay here again in the future. 
25027	3316219	8.0	8.0	35066291	Good communication and as advertised. Great location.  
25028	3316219	8.0	8.0	35277039	"Easy and close to the highway, but slept 5 not 6 with one person on a mattress that was in the closet. 6 would have to been, well...ah?

 Summer time isn't the greatest as almost all windows were painted shut and it gets warm

Nice clean paint and linens and booking was easy and fast. House is old and quaint, but limited. 

Good crash pad, but we didn't spend much time there other than sleeping, because of limits, but Seattle and neighborhood has lots to see. 

Photos are the house, but not decore. "
25029	3316219	8.0	8.0	35465037	"A little gut honest feedback for you.  First off, I thought I was working with Gavin Walker and don't quite understand who Joshua Dotson is.
The pictures you've got posted show a light and traditionally furnished home. The photos show furniture, bedding and shower curtains that are all very different than what are now in the home. The home feels dark; the pictures are very deceiving.  There is no mention of the actual location being right next to the highway.  The traffic noise was very loud and made it difficult to block out while trying to sleep. Maybe a television or radio could have helped alleviate some o the traffic sounds.  Finally, the lock to the actual rental is difficult to figure out both in entering and relocking."
25030	3316219	8.0	8.0	37047351	This home met our needs beautifully when we were recently in Seattle for our niece's wedding.  The location was phenomenal - about 10-15 minutes from Seattle city center. It was also an easy walking distance to Starbucks every morning :) Our unit in the house has a spacious, clean, comfortable and fully equipped kitchen, family room, two bedrooms and a good sized bathroom - all with lots of natural light and large closets. It felt like home and added great enjoyment to our trip. There's a great deck on the back of the house;  easy check in and check out. One comment: The house is best suited for 5 or fewer adults. There are two double beds and a twin mattress that we set up in the family room - all very comfortable with lots of extra bedding. However, the couch was a bit small for an adult to have a comfortable night sleep. Otherwise, this property was just what we were hoping for.     
25031	3316219	8.0	8.0	37538055	The house is in a great place to get around the city. The space is large and accommodating. The living space is open and inviting and the bedrooms comfortable. It would have been an even nicer experience had there been a table to sit and eat at. I loved the back deck but wished there had been some place to sit (especially given that there is no AC and the temp was nearly 90 outside when we stayed). Overall the price was fair and the space inviting as advertised.
25032	3316219	8.0	8.0	37952823	"The property managers (Gavin, Joshua? Gavin & Friends? Joshua & Gavin's Big Adventure? Etc.) do a fantastic job keeping this place beautiful. They were very prompt in answering my questions and the check-in/check-out process was straightforward. Great location. 

A few things were bothersome:
-It doesn't sleep 6 comfortably. 5 should be the max. The particular couch in that space isn't made for sleeping. 
-Secondly, this listing does not have a fully-equipped kitchen and the oven is sorely outdated. Our group planned on making a big breakfast together and it was rather tough to do. 
-The refrigerator froze our food. Boo.

25033	3316219	8.0	8.0	38354820	I never met the host. The apartment is indeed spacious and economical. It's in an older house; some of the floors slope pretty markedly, it's easy to trip in a few places, and there are even fewer electrical outlets than most places of this age (and some of the lights were missing bulbs). Most windows can't be opened; while Seattle has a mild climate, it was pretty warm some of the time we were there. Parking is a definite plus. On the other hand, the house is right across from I-5. Noise wasn't too bad, but the view, the closed windows, and the sparse furniture didn't make us want to spend time there.
25034	3316219	8.0	8.0	38427989	This was a really cute place. It's an older house but we found that charming. It is right by the highway but the noise didn't bother us, and the convenience was appreciated. Having parking is always a plus, and checking in was a breeze. Would stay here again because of the great price! 
25035	3316219	8.0	8.0	38498553	The house was exactly how it was pictured and exactly what my group needed! The bed in the first room was THE most comfortable thing I've ever slept in. Only issues: back door was open when we arrived, not sure why and the sink handle in the bathroom was broken...but all minor issues. Joshua was very responsive when we thought we'd need to arrive early and getting into the house was a breeze with the door codes.  Thanks for the crash pad!
25036	3316219	8.0	8.0	38692790	"Honestly this place was not worth what we paid. It looks very contemporary from the picture, but the place is very old and needs some work. Mostly though our issue was cleanliness. None of us felt comfortable taking off our shoes as the floors were dirty. The bathroom had a huge ball of hair on the floor and the hand towel hanging in the bathroom (brown) had a huge rust- colored stain on it (bleach or peroxide stain??). There were other towels to use (white) but one of them had a handprint on it. We had 5 people so when we arrived (10:15pm) we looked for the mattress in the closet. There were no sheets available for the mattress so we called Josh to see if we could get some sheets. He gave us the code to the basement where there are supplies. When I went down, the light  was on and there was a man down there (cleaning guy??) who handed me sheets. Kind of scary! Each bedroom only has one outlet which is behind the bed so you have to move the bed to plug in anything which in the summer is the fan because in the main bedroom and in the living area the windows do not open. You have to use the kitchen plugs to charge your phone. There were coffee grounds in the coffee maker. The shower is an old tub with 2 shower curtains surrounding it so when you are showering the curtains suck in on you. We did not have a ""lake view"" and I do not know how 6 people could sleep there unless someone sleeps on top of the couch which does not look comfortable for sleeping. This house is right next to highway 5 which is convenient for getting around but that is the biggest asset."
25037	3316219	8.0	8.0	39309182	Logistics and communication with Joshua were quite easy and we had no problem finding or getting into the place. However, the apartment was much darker than the pictures showed (as many of the reviews implied). It was fine for one night but I wouldn't have wanted to spend much more time there. 
25038	3316219	8.0	8.0	39386728	Cute house, GREAT BEDS! We felt very comfortable here, all 6 of us- 1 on a couch and 1 on a pull out bed. Easy to hop on the freeway to get anywhere. 
25039	3316219	8.0	8.0	39561106	Josh was communicative and helpful. The place came as advertised. However, as other reviewers have noted, the house is very close to I-5, and one of the bedrooms can be a little noisey. Overall a pleasant experience.
25040	3316219	8.0	8.0	39734847	Overall our group had a nice stay. The general consensus was the location & amenities served their purpose. Since our group rented both sides of the duplex we were able to have double the room to roam and relax which was excellent. Our only problem unfortunately was the cleanliness of the floors. Our feet were black from the soot/dirt. We found this problem in both units sadly. There were also misc items in the fridge (roast beef, ice cream, half container of juice etc) from previous guests. We did find everything to be accurate from the photos and enjoyed the central location. The house has it's charm and we very much appreciated having a comfortable bed to sleep in. The linens that were provided were great as well. The door key pad was a great feature and had no problem accessing either unit or the front door. Parking was also a plus. 
25041	3316219	8.0	8.0	40067391	We arrived at the place an hour after checkin to find the cleaners still there but finishing up. The place was clean, but some windows didn’t lock which made us uneasy leaving bags. The code we received for the front door was the same code as our unit, which also made us a little uneasy knowing there was another rental unit on the upper floor. We unfortunately woke up to some random guy we didn't know entering our unit at 4am, which really freaked us out. He left quickly, seemed confused about which unit he was supposed to be in, but we still were super unsettled. We couldn’t sleep after that and left quickly in the morning. We texted Joshua and he apologized, but we hope that he remedy's the situation.
25042	3316219	8.0	8.0	40090403	Joshua was very helpful. The 2 bedroom unit was quaint, clean, and comfortable. It was very convenient to the concert we attended in downtown Seattle. We enjoyed our overnight stay!
25043	3316219	8.0	8.0	40388617	Josh's house was pretty much as advertised. The house was clean and everything worked. Surprisingly , the nearby freeway was not noisy... We didn't even know it was there!
25044	3316219	8.0	8.0	41320591	The house is ok. They get it cleaned before you use it which is essential. It's a very old house and the floors creek as you walk by and the doors don't shut properly. But the amazing thing is you can park 3 cars easily. On another note I had to call the cleaners to come do some fixes around the place as there was lacking electricity points and lamps etc. but they came promptly and did the work in a very acceptable timeframe
25045	3316219	8.0	8.0	41610787	Joshua's place was clean and comfortable although the location wasn't ideal due to its proximity to the highway. The keyless entry made it convenient to coordinate check in and check out. The house was older with peeling paint and old bathtub set up didn't make for ideal showers. Overall, the place met our needs for shelter but we wouldn't likely stay here again.
25046	3316219	8.0	8.0	42378341	Host was good and gave instructions in advance. Had no issues with my second stay. They made sure that my trip was smooth. Thanks
25047	3316219	8.0	8.0	42822114	We were very unhappy with this rental. It was supposed to sleep 6 but that meant 2 people had to sleep on a single mattress pulled out of a closet. It was misrepresented. The living room had seating for 4 with different furniture. The kitchen had 2 chairs, the bathroom sink did not drain, the tv did not work. I went to a hotel. When I complained to Joshua he said that this rental was not a hotel. Lots of busy traffic on the street but that is something I should have researched. Don't stay here!
25048	3316219	8.0	8.0	43497724	We weren't very safisfied with the rental as Joshua was not very responsive (missed calls, took a few hours to reply multiple messages), the photos were not very accurate either. The floors were creaky, the TV didn't work for a while, the lights were very dim.. Overall, our stay was alright as the beds were comfortable, but other than that, I was quite disappointed with the rental and I wouldn't come here again..
25049	3316219	8.0	8.0	43976834	This was a very unpleasant experience. The bathroom smelled, with drains and toilets that backed up, and had two towels for 4 people. The place reminded us of our sophomore apartment- barely any of the lamps worked, the floors squeeked, and the neighbors partied all night.  The bathroom light was connected to a fan that was louder than the traffic of I5, just outside the front door.  We conacted him several times to ask for towels, with NO response.  Does not make a great Seattle experience.
25050	3316219	8.0	8.0	44358546	Our stay was great. The description was accurate. We had a little trouble with the TV, but Joshua was very helpful. We enjoyed our time!
25051	3316219	8.0	8.0	44624723	Amazing place! Had a lot of fun and Joshua was so great for our last minute craziness.
25052	3316219	8.0	8.0	45066473	Access code accurate. Overpriced. 2 double beds that need replaced. Toilet sitting on reinforced boards. Looked like an outhouse. Ancient tub okay. Only update was living room but very cheap furniture. No TV access.
25053	3316219	8.0	8.0	45525214	We had a decent experience with this space. We are from Seattle and know it well, so we recognized the value--it's a great neighborhood, super central with parking included at far less than your average hotel. That said, this is far less than your average hotel. Its a great crash pad, a great place to store your stuff and shower and sleep, but if you are looking to hang out and cook meals, or chill on the couch, this is not your spot. The bathroom and kitchen are very dated and look like they could use a deep clean, and the bedrooms are not nearly as nice as pictured, though the beds were comfy and the linens clean. The lamp in the living room didn't seem to work and there was a random shoe left on a table.  A decent  value, but not a great spot if you're looking for more than a place to lay your head. Our host was accommodating at the last minute and the cleaners were very friendly. 
25054	3316219	8.0	8.0	45772992	Would not recommend this place at all. Outlets and wires are falling out of the wall, the sink is missing a knob, paint is coming off the wall in big chips. House is right next to highway which is very noisy. No welcome book. But the icing on the cake was the party that happened upstairs until 2:30am and they left the front door wide open. Traveling with my 3 adult children from SF- who have stayed in over 50 Airbnb's combined and they all agree this was the worst Airbnb experience they have ever had. Stay away! 
25055	3316219	8.0	8.0	46359609	We only used this place for a bed to sleep on overnight, but it very much felt like a home and I was very pleased to be staying there rather than a hotel. I wish I could say that we used the facilities, like the cute little living room, or the kitchen (which was nicely stocked for convenient use), but we didn't. It was extremely efficient to have a code for the door rather than a key card or a key, I was worried about losing something like that. The thing I liked the most about staying there was the parking space. I drove up to Seattle, unlike most travelers who come by plane and transit, so it was nice to have spot for my truck without having to find parking on the street or pay for a garage.
25056	3316219	8.0	8.0	46683045	Location was good, near highway to everywhere. The air condition seems a little problem which the temperature always high. 
25057	3316219	8.0	8.0	46803399	The keyless entry made check-in/out very convenient. 4 of us were comfortable in the apartment. Seemed like a good value for the area. Very convenient to a Zipcar lot, which made a big difference to us.
25058	3316219	8.0	8.0	47366415	Clean, quiet apartment that was in a nice neighborhood convenient to our friends in town. Close to the interstate but no trouble with noise, even with open windows. 
25059	3316219	8.0	8.0	47602010	Had a great time at Joshua's. The place was clean and he was a friendly, attentive host! 
25060	3316219	8.0	8.0	48053942	Joshua's home was comfortable and welcoming!  Best nights of sleep I've had in a month.  Check-in and check-out was very easy, and having a dedicated parking space was a definite plus.  The house is well-located, near restaurants and markets on Eastlake and easy walking distance to the north tip of Capitol Hill.
25061	3316219	8.0	8.0	48260534	This is a great location and beautifully appointed large 2 bedroom with a great kitchen and a private deck. Everything was perfect. Highly recommended to explore seattle from this quiet but close neighborhood.
25062	3316219	8.0	8.0	48977805	Very easy to book, great communication, and convenient no-key access. The house had a great location near the highway that played a large role in our decision to stay here. The house had basically everything we needed: a tea kettle, hairdryer, towels, toothpaste, etc.  However, the photos don't really exhibit how old the house is (over 100 years). A little TLC would definitely bring the house to its full potential. Still very grateful for the ease of booking since our previous host cancelled on us. 
25063	3316219	8.0	8.0	49415306	Great house in great shape. Would rent again
25064	3316219	8.0	8.0	49522835	The place was lovely, well kept, and easy to get to. I would recommend this location to friends.
25065	3316219	8.0	8.0	49851803	Joshua's place was fantastic! Everything was very comfortable, and it was tastefully decorated in a way that really brought out the charm of the house.  Check-in was incredibly easy, and the kitchen was well-stocked (the large tea kettle was a plus!) I would happily stay again.
25066	3316219	8.0	8.0	50339521	Blown away at how convenient this spot was! Sweet little coffee shop and market on the corner.The apt was quiet, comfortable, and cozy vibes. Roku made for late night entertainment. The 3 of us loved the place! Joshua was super responsive and friendly in every interaction.
25067	3316219	8.0	8.0	50983115	Everything was great! Spacious and cute  charm to the place!
25068	3316219	8.0	8.0	51183998	Joshua's unit was great. Very comfortable, clean and centrally located. My friends and I traveled to Seattle for the Seahawks game and it was the perfect location, close to downtown and close to capitol hill for dinner, drinks, etc. Easy check in and check out and I hope whoever stays there next enjoys the shampoo and conditioner my husband forgot to pack. haha
25069	3316219	8.0	8.0	52346630	We felt very welcomed during our trip, the neighborhood was great. The are some pretty convenient places down the hill, a good bar, a nice breakfast restaurant and a convenience store. 
25070	3316219	8.0	8.0	52473166	awesome place! there is parking, its clean! big unit! there is wifi! we loved it for the few hours we stayed. thanks!! =D we thought there was a city view from an upstairs balcony =D its another unit =D just don't go upstairs lol =D live and learn. thanks Joshua!! we will come back again. i recommend.
25071	3316219	8.0	8.0	52907612	Very spacious and clean, in a good location near restaurants, bars and shops. A bit noisy next to the highway, unexpected problem with the plumbing in the sink and bathtub, but overall a good experience. 
25072	3316219	8.0	8.0	53280452	Great location. Had everything we needed. 
25073	3316219	8.0	8.0	53670325	Joshua provide excellent communication as we had a last minute request for his accommodation. The place was adequate and for the most part pretty clean. 
25074	3316219	8.0	8.0	53738358	Josh had great communication with us as we needed to book his place again while we were up there for work. Place was for the most part pretty clean and was a good place to crash for the night. 
25075	3316219	8.0	8.0	54890320	It's a good house
25076	3316219	8.0	8.0	55131842	Great house. Right next to a bus stop and enough supplements to make a thanksgiving dinner!
25077	3316219	8.0	8.0	55600278	Needed a quick place to stay to escape the fumes of a newly painted room in our home and found Gavin's 2 br for a reasonable nightly rate. It was clean, well furnished and homey. Despite being near a freeway, we could hardly hear any noise inside. Great pad for a night or a week. 
25078	3316219	8.0	8.0	56437162	Great location and super cute. Parking was better then we expected since our rig was a super large SUV. The lights in the living room a little too dim for the liking and half lamps did not work. But great communication. Would totally book again. 
25079	3316219	8.0	8.0	56802710	We really enjoyed our stay here in Seattle. The house was in a very nice location, close to shops and restaurants, and the bus service was easy access into the town centre. The house came with everything we needed, and was comfortable and homy. It definitely made our stay in Seattle much more enjoyable!
25080	3316219	8.0	8.0	56961217	The place was well-stocked with kitchen ware and toiletries. The surroundings were very serene, and very accessible by public transport.
25241	7203765	6.0	8.0	41820722	"This was our first time in Seattle and first airbnb experience; Iulia made it a great one! Despite the last minute booking arrangements Iulia was a wonderful host for our trip to Seattle. She made us feel very welcome in her home and made our arrival and departure very smooth.
The studio apartment was an excellent home base for our walking excursions to Key Arena, in the Seattle Center as well as a visit to Capitol Hill.  The apartment was a little cozy, but there was plenty of room for the 2 of us. 
I would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone looking to avoid the bustle of the downtown core.
Thanks for a great trip, Iulia!"
31612	9449062	10.0	8.0	56870340	Kara’s apartment was perfect for my needs. Although the building is old (it's historic) it's well-maintained and the apartment itself looks new. Very clean and tidy, and quiet neighbors. The neighborhood is a bit gritty, but nothing unexpected for any urban location. Convenient for downtown Seattle. 
35085	7431247	10.0	8.0	42734617	"We had a Great stay in Seattle!

We had booked another accommodation before, but unfortunately they cancelled our booking 2 weeks before our trip started.
So we have sent a message to Evan and explained our situation. Because he was on a trip at the same time than our stay, a friend of him  welcomed us at his appartment and showed us everything. 
Even we didn't meet Evan personally we felt really welcomed, because there was a personal note waiting for us. 
The appartment is exactly as shown on the pictures and really clean.
Evan is really hospitable, friendly and helpful. 
We can definetly recommend this appartment and would book it again if we come back to Seattle one day."
36889	6226666	9.0	8.0	36234702	My wife and I stayed for four days in this great home. It's easy to find, and checking in was super easy with the key made available in a lockbox. Our host was rapidly responsive and everything was just an Uber away. Most importantly, the place was very clean with fresh towels and toiletries left for us. Would definitely recommend it for others!
36890	6226666	9.0	8.0	37792973	The ad reflects this condo exactly. Nice building, great neighborhood. Condo was very clean and the clean towels were appreciated. Kitchen was very functional and the bathroom was as well. Thank you very much!
36891	9151374	6.0	8.0	53543652	"TL;DR - This place has a ton of potential, but I can't recommend it due to the complete lack of responsiveness of the host (never once responded to any of our concerns in the 4 nights we stayed), the lack of WiFi when it was promised, the bath tub drain was clogged, and the total lack of basic essentials like toilet paper and hand soap.       


PROS: 
The location was great and the apartment was nice.       


CONS:
However, after dropping the keys, the host mentioned she didn't have the wifi password on her, and that she'd run to the office and message me later. She then left to let us settle in. We first noticed there was no hand soap or toilet paper in the bathroom. So I messaged her, and got no response. I messaged her later about the WiFi, which looked like the modem wasn't connected to the Comcast backbone, and never got a response. We ended up going to Target to stock up on TP and soap.       


The next morning, when we used the shower, the bath tub drain was almost completely clogged, and there was a residue on the bath tub floor. I texted the host again, and got no response.

37182	3449059	9.0	8.0	15785060	Darcy was wonderful.  She was helpful, fun and kind. The atmosphere of the apartment and surrounding pioneer square was exactly what we were looking for.
37183	3449059	9.0	8.0	16266185	Apartment was great and Darcy was very helpful! Thanks!
37184	3449059	9.0	8.0	16486464	"
The place is very cute and spacious, plus it is in a cool location. There is a club next door/under it (Trinity) which had very loud music, but with fans on at night we were not too bothered by it.
I didn't get a chance to meet Darcy or interact with her in person, but the check-in and check-out process were easy and she was responsive to emails/communication.
Plus, I loved how walkable the location was as well! It really lets you get a taste of Seattle!"
37185	3449059	9.0	8.0	16996389	"Pros
-Location, location, location.  Everything is within walking distance
-Host was fairly quick at responding to questions and very accommodating
-Cable tv/comfortable bed
-Spacious apartment/vintage decor

Cons
-""Sounds of Seattle"" loud outside noise including bar patrons/garbage trucks/seagulls/sirens/traffic
-Poor WI-FI (only worked in the bedroom...sometimes)
-Check-in and check-out were a bit of a hassle (bar staff unaware of schedule)
-Hot apartment (requires more fans)
-Cleanliness could be improved"
37186	3449059	9.0	8.0	17376006	"If you're looking for a really cool place to stay in a really cool part of Seattle this is the place. It's nicer and cheaper and better located than most hotels in the area and there's an awesome bar/restaurant downstairs and public parking right across the street. If I'm lucky enough to travel to Seattle again in the future, Darcy will be my first call.
"
37187	3449059	9.0	8.0	17511996	It was okay. Way too hot in the apt.
37188	3449059	9.0	8.0	17844956	"I had a great experience staying with Darcy, the check in process was very smooth and Darcy was very helpful. We were able to store our luggage in the bar while our rooms were getting ready so I appreciate that. I also loved how organised Darcy was with the rooms. 

The apartment was clean and well equipped. I only wish I could have stayed longer to utilise it more!"
37189	3449059	9.0	8.0	18029625	Darcy was great!  Great communication with host prior to arrival.  Had a rental car before arriving, but opted to return it a day early since the apartment was so close to everything.  Took the light rail back to the airport instead of fighting the Seattle traffic.
37190	3449059	9.0	8.0	18315775	The location worked out really well for us.  We took the light rail from Seattle-Tacoma airport, which was a fairly quick ride.  If you get out at Pioneer Square and take the escalator to Yesler Street, you need only 2 walk 2 blocks.  From here we could easily explore the downtown sites on foot.  The only downside is it was noisy at night.  Well into the night we could hear late night revelers and restaurant noises.  The place itself was comfortable and nicely kept.  There is no air conditioning and it was a bit warm in the evening, but that is probably only the case a few days in the year.  Check in and check out was smooth.  I recommend the place to anyone who wants to really experience being right in the center of historic Seattle and doesn't mind some noise.  You can catch the underground tour across the street, which at first seemed might be really touristy, but turned out to be an fun and interesting way to learn a little about Seattle's history.
37191	3449059	9.0	8.0	18547713	The apartment was just as described and right in historic Pioneer Square. Check-in was easy via the bar staff in Merchants Café. Everything I needed for my stay was provided and I had no issues at all with anything in the facility. It was a bit warm during my late August stay and fans were provided in the room to help circulate some air from the window. However the staff I spoke with said Darcy is considering adding A/C before next summer. The apartments are all newly done so I understand completely. If you stay here you MUST try the fried cheese curds with honey and enjoy a Pyramid Apricot Ale on tap downstairs in the bar. I will definitely stay again given the opportunity.
37192	3449059	9.0	8.0	19074727	"We stayed in the Historic apartment #303 for 2 nights for the Seahawks opening game  9/4/2014.  We were right in the middle of all the cool activities in the Pioneer square area and within walking distance of Century link stadium.   
The location could not have been more perfect.  Good parking across the street and later free parking on the street.  Darcy consistently responded quickly to my inquiries, (e-mails & texts).  The apartment was a good size for 3 people and served our needs quite well.  It was warm, but the fans provided, ceiling fan and open window helped make it more comfortable.  We were on the 3rd floor so climbing the stairs did get old, but it was short term.   All in all it was a very good experience and we were all very satisfied with the stay.  "
37193	3449059	9.0	8.0	19531676	Great spot in downtown Seattle. The room is charming with a really good feel. Check-in was very easy at the Merchant Cafe downstairs and they have fried cheese curds which are one of my favorite foods. 
37194	3449059	9.0	8.0	20757318	Great little apartment in a historic building.  We enjoyed our stay and the place is easy walking distance to most of the cool stuff in Seattle. It was clean and comfortable and the staff downstairs was friendly and helpful.  Fun place to stay. 
37195	3449059	9.0	8.0	20982016	"What a wonderful spot. First, I want to say that Darcy was so accommodating.  Now, I can talk about the space. It's in a historic building, but the interior has been updated while keeping the historic feel.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the apartment. The bed was comfortable, the place was obviously professionally cleaned, and it had all of the amenities.  Location was perfect. Right in the heart of Pioneer Square.  Just a few blocks from the air train, which I took from the airport.  I didn't expect an elevator, so the stairs were fine for me. 

My husband ate in the cafe downstairs and said his salad was huge and the food was good. "
37196	3449059	9.0	8.0	21205706	The description was very accurate.  The apartment is full of historic charm.  We loved how closely located to CenturyLink field we were.  We also loved the tavern downstairs.  The people were crazy friendly.  We were also located close to everything downtown, completely walkable to everything.  We will definitely stay here again.
37197	3449059	9.0	8.0	21500922	Darcy's place was great, right near cool bars and restaurants and close enough to walk to the stadiums. Thumping bass at night from nearby club was somewhat annoying but that goes along with staying in the heart of the action. Would stay here again.
37198	3449059	9.0	8.0	21516254	This was a really great apartment, super cute I loved all the vintage decor.  It was clean and well-kept, perfect Homebase for the weekend.  Beds were comfortable, ceiling fan was great (and necessary), kitchen and living room was cozy.  The neighborhood gets pretty sketchy at night tho, just keep your wits about you if you're out after midnight.
37199	3449059	9.0	8.0	22010184	Great place, super easy! Worth the money!
37200	3449059	9.0	8.0	22045428	"We loved our stay with Darcy!!!!!! The place was clean and comfortable. But, the history of the building and the way Darcy has put a personal touch into the rooms...........totally cool.
Darcy communicated well  and provided us with a parking pass ($20/day) that allowed us to spend our time walking the city. 
The location worked for us as we wanted to walk to Pike's, the sculpture garden and the rock and roll museum. The Seattle Center is 30-40 minutes walk. 
We had everything we needed in the apartment for a very comfortable stay."
37201	3449059	9.0	8.0	22073985	Wasn't given an exact address and spent 4 hours looking for the apartment in a ghetto part of town. Darcy didn't answer her phone or reply to our messages. When we did find the apartment it was quite cool.
37202	3449059	9.0	8.0	22531767	This was our first time using AirBnB and I must say, it was a fabulous experience!  Our host, Darcy, was very attentive and promptly answered all my questions via text.  Check in and out was simple and quick.  The apartment was adorable!  We had two people statying in the room and had plenty of space.  The bed was also super comfy, so it felt like home.  There is a complete kitchen which was great in that we were able to make ourselves a nice breakfast before hitting all the sights we planned to see.  Saved us some money on restaurants!  Only con would be lots of stairs, if you have mobility issues (no elevator).  This was our first time in Seattle and at first we were a little concerned with the neighborhood, but quickly our fears disappeared.  Just use common sense.  Other reviews noted the noise from the neighboring night club, but it didn't really bother us, as we only noticed it on Saturday night.  The proximity to the stadium was incredible and an easy walk.  We also easily walked to Pike's Place Market.  If you go there, have the Mac 'n Cheese at Beechers.  It was heavenly!!   It is also just a couple of blocks from the Pioneer Station Light Rail which was a breeze getting to and from the airport.  Overall, we LOVED our stay here and would definitely stay here again!!
37203	3449059	9.0	8.0	22834002	We really enjoyed staying in this apartment, as there were three of us, and one person was able to use the futon that was set up in the living room.  The neighborhood is not the most desirable, but we had absolutely no problems there and it was only a 2 block walk from the train station.  
37204	3449059	9.0	8.0	22974759	Darcy's historic apartment is comfortable and pleasant stay! The location is convenient and in the heart of the city. With that, comes the harsh realities of systemic poverty. Darcy provides a great place and is very accommodating. If you're traveling by public transit you will have minimal problems. If driving, I highly recommend locating a locked or secure parking garage and not parking on the street nearby. Due to out of state plates and looking like a tourist, my car was broken into. Don't assume I ignorantly left stuff worthy of stealing. Darcy's place is recommended, but don't park on the street nearby!
37205	3449059	9.0	8.0	23495662	Darcy was a lovely hostess, greeting us upon arrival and making sure we were comfortable and our room was completely prepared upon check-in. The room itself is spacious, clean, comfortable, and well stocked. I especially enjoyed the location literally 2.5 blocks from the light rail to SEA-TAC. It's right in the heart of Pioneer Square, which is one of my favorite areas - close to touristy Pike's Market, but also within easy walking distance to all the amazing restaurants in International Village (I highly recommend Jade Garden!) Our only inconvenience was the other airbnb guests staying in the unit below us. They decided to have an insanely loud 25-person party in their room starting from about 8pm Saturday night until about 4am. It was a huge nightmare as we came back to the apt early that night because I was wiped out and needed sleep. I know Darcy did her best to get them to stop (including calling the police), and apparently they did a number on the room before finally getting out of there. Those rude guests aside, I would definitely recommend this place as it seems like that group was an unfortunate one-off.
37206	3449059	9.0	8.0	23759893	The apartment was adorable. It was clean and quiet. The location was ideal. The staff were beyond helpful and friendly. They recommended great places to go. Alicia the bartender actually drove me to get my friends purse she (email hidden)ry big thanks to her for helping us out. 
37207	3449059	9.0	8.0	23901562	"Great stay with Darcy. First AirBnB stay. Was a bit different than I was expecting, but turned out perfect. It's more like a hotel stay. The rooms are above the Merchant Cafe, so you check (email hidden), similar to if it was a hotel lobby. They give you the key to the room and take you upstairs. The place was very nice and clean.  Pretty much all the amenities you'd need.  
One call out I would say is it isn't actually a 2 bedroom. There's one bedroom and a foldable bed that's stored in the closet that you can put out in the living area. Worked perfectly fine for my buddy and I. 
Also, there is a club next door and you can hear/feel the bass during the night. Didn't bother us since we expected it. 
A nice bonus is you get a discount on food/(email hidden) below!  Would definitely recommend for anyone. "
37208	3449059	9.0	8.0	24029694	Darcy had a nice, clean unit in a convenient downtown location 
37209	3449059	9.0	8.0	24058050	"Short version: Get here during daylight hours. Find secure parking for the night. Nice place, but the pictures are misleading.
Long version: Didn't get to meet our hostess, Darcy. The location is easy enough to find. What's not easy to find is secure parking nearby. This is not a good choice if you are not familiar with Seattle or if you'll be arriving after dark. We arrived later in the day (after dinner) and were surprised that we nearly missed the bartender at the cafe (where we were directed to pick up keys) would have been gone. He had no clue about the room and had to call someone to confirm. Got pestered by drunk customers until the bartender led us upstairs (a lot of stairs). The apartment was very cold as we walked in and very dark. The window in the living room faces an office building across the alleyway. I'm not sure where the street view picture was taken from, but it's certainly not from this apartment. The space is very clean, well decorated and full amenities. I'm sure someone could make better use of the features if we were staying longer (kitchen and laundry)."
37210	3449059	9.0	8.0	24328233	I had a great Holiday stay in the heart of downtown Seattle. The place was clean and comfortable. I'll stay there again!
37211	3449059	9.0	8.0	24644283	Darcy was very sweet and even flexible with our check out time since we had a late flight and didn't want to drag our luggage all around Seattle. The room was very cute, I especially liked the exposed brick. The restaurant downstairs has amazing happy hour prices. My boyfriend and I were able to order more than we could actually eat for about $15. All in all it was a wonderful experience and we will definitely be staying with Darcy again next time we are in Seattle.
37212	3449059	9.0	8.0	25143642	"Darcy's apartment was a real slice of Seattle history, and we enjoyed our stay there. Three of us fit in comfortably with a double bed in a separate bedroom and a futon in the living room. We didn't get to meet Darcy in person, however the bar staff were friendly and showed us to the apartment on arrival.

The location right on Pioneer Square is excellent, and we could walk around central Seattle easily from the apartment."
37213	3449059	9.0	8.0	25328233	"The apartment was perfect for My husband and I, the location is perfect for dinning, going out for drinks and just wondering around the city.  The apartment is comfortable, super clean and the perfect size. The people (email hidden) are super friendly. 
"
37214	3449059	9.0	8.0	25537760	Great location. Great apartment. Definitely gives you the feel of being in a city. Would love to stay here again. 
37215	3449059	9.0	8.0	25712459	We enjoyed our stay. Darcy's appartment is above Merchant's cafe which has pretty good appetizers. The appartment itself was tidy and comfortable to stay in for 3 people. The TV was a plus to use at the end of our outings. The only downside was the location. At night, the homeless are more aggressive at night when asking for money, especially the ones outside 7-eleven nearby.
37216	3449059	9.0	8.0	25765667	"What a great staycation!  We only live about 20 minutes away from Seattle but love to visit the city often.   
This was our first Airbnb experience and we were NOT disappointed. The apartment was walking distance to a lot of the city. And only a $5 Über ride to everywhere you want to go. 

We got there right at 2pm checkin time but our room wasn't quite ready. Darcy was a gracious host and upgraded us to a more expensive room free. We really appreciated that as our place was a corner room looking out over pioneer square. 

After we got situated we visited the cafe downstairs for a wonderful snack of fried cheese curds and yummy sliders. 
It was great to experience Seattle as if we lived there.  Thank you Darcy!  We will be back. "
37217	3449059	9.0	8.0	26166428	The place is beautiful and with just enough finishing touches to remind you of it's history.  Very well kept and lovely to spend time in - I'd recommend for sure!
37218	3449059	9.0	8.0	26455519	Before even getting to the room above Merchant's Cafe, Darcy was very helpful and timely with providing answers to questions. The room was well kept and rather nice for an older building. Location was very convenient downtown however parking was tricky at times and the amount of homeless individuals in the area could be overwhelming at times. Very fair advertisement of the room, location and the stairs! Would gladly visit again. 
37219	3449059	9.0	8.0	26493776	We enjoyed our quick stay. It was close to everything we wanted to see and a short walk to the train station in the morning. The bar down stairs was nice for a late night snack. Our flight got in earlier than the bar opens so we waited with a coffee at the Starbucks next door. Cute decor, comfy bed!  Everything we could need. Thanks for the stay!
37220	3449059	9.0	8.0	27531325	Cool location - a bit dark but very clean. Easy checking in and out.
37221	3449059	9.0	8.0	28297655	What a fabulous weekend we had!!! First, we were able to park right next to the condo using the parking pass for a small fee which was great knowing my car was safe & a lot less than paying street parking. Second, we got to meet Darcy who was lovely. She showed us our condo and was a gracious host. Third, her staff were great! We enjoyed visiting and having drinks in the bar down stairs, plus the bonus discount was a treat! Our condo was perfect and had everything we needed: a well stocked kitchen, washer/dryer. Seriously, next time we are in town for a game or just need a little get away, we will be staying here!!!
37222	3449059	9.0	8.0	28545943	"Check-in was easy, just had to wait around til the 2pm check-in time, but since you get to wait in a nice restaurant that's not such a big deal. It's a very cool location, and during my stay I walked to lots of great places downtown. Having the bright marquee of ""Merchant's Cafe"" to walk back to made it easy to find while wandering around. The apartment itself is very cute, exactly what I expected from the pictures. "
37223	3449059	9.0	8.0	29023836	I was in Seattle for business the week of March 30th. This was my first time in the city and wanted to stay close to the Pike Place market and great restaurants.  This location was perfect from a touring perspective, however as can be expected, there was a lot of street noise in the evenings. Also, the homeless are everywhere and comfortable asking for money. I personally do not have an issue with this, but be prepared if you are in this area. Parking can be a bit of a challenge, so ask the host about a parking pass for your stay.  $20 per day is deal considering most places are $15 during the day and don't offer overnight parking.
37224	3449059	9.0	8.0	29118414	A very neat, historic place to stay. The unit had everything we needed and was a convenient launching spot for exploring the city. The staff at Merchants was super accommodating when we arrived shortly before closing due to a flight delay. They helped carry our bags when showing us to the unit and even put in a last minute food order for us. We would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a clean, fun place to stay in Seattle. 
37225	3449059	9.0	8.0	29510767	We only stayed there one night. Great place to stay for 4 with the extra futon. Awesome location and a quick Lyft ride to anywhere you want to go in Seattle.
37226	3449059	9.0	8.0	29668210	We enjoyed our stay at Darcy's place. The check in was a breeze. We grab our key from the bartender downstairs. He was very kind and offered to carry some luggage for us to the 3rd floor. The apartment was very nice. The only downside to the stay was the noise outside. This is to be expected though when you stay downtown. A lot of early morning trash trucks in the alley, random people, and birds. The club music next door can be heard through the walls too. We did split the room, so my experience comes from sleeping in the living room on the pullout bed. Whereas the other couple we traveled with said most of the noise was muffled or rarely heard in the bedroom. We had a great stay though as the noise is tolerable. Again, it comes with the location. The check out process was really easy and everyone was very accommodating. Our flight was in the evening, but we were allowed to leave our luggage in the bar after check out and stroll the city. Terrific cafes and shops all around. I would recommend this place! 
37227	3449059	9.0	8.0	30426678	Had a very good experience at the historic apartment. Started with a very friendly and helpful bartender at Merchants who let me in the property. 303 is at the top of the building , so requires a couple flights of stairs. The room itself was quiet (in an active neighborhood) and comfortable, if a touch dim. The location was great for access to the waterfront and the rest of downtown Seattle. Walked for hours around the neighborhood, which is equal parts historic, fun and gritty. 
37228	3449059	9.0	8.0	30767648	Great overall experience! The space was exactly as described. We were able to easily walk to the stadiums, Pikes Place and the ferry terminal. It was a quick ride from Sea-Tac Airport on the light rail. Would highly recommend for anyone looking to experience Seattle for the first time!
37229	3449059	9.0	8.0	31018051	The apartment is nice and comfortable and the host was very helpful! Recommended!
37230	3449059	9.0	8.0	32041030	Lovely historic neighborhood and building. Apartment is clean and comfortable. Good location for access to waterfront, market, shopping and parking. 
37231	3449059	9.0	8.0	32309737	We actually didn't end up staying in apartment 303 we stayed in 203 since 303 was given to another guest by mistake. Not a big deal 203 was really nice.  The location was perfect and only a 10 minuet walk from the train station/stadiums. I loved the old building with the brick walls. The neighborhood has a lot of homeless people which is hard to avoid in any downtown area. Just be prepared to get asked for change a lot. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. 
37232	3449059	9.0	8.0	32507141	"While the location of this place is great, we had lots of difficulties with the hostess. I don’t know how many of these troubles stemmed from misunderstandings between us, but Darcy’s slow response time and hostile attitude was off-putting, to say the least. 

I had given Darcy our time of arrival, but we had to wait at least fifty minutes for her to come and open the door for us. When we finally got into the apartment, the WIFI was so weak that it was unusable from the flat. We had to sit on the stairwell or go downstairs to the bar in order to access the internet. We complained to the bartender downstairs but were informed that there was nothing that could be done. The only response Darcy gave us regarding this issue was that she was certain that we were incorrectly inputing the password, which was clearly not the case. 

Then, we discovered that there was no hot water! We complained again, but the employees downstairs were understandably busy. They called Darcy but were not able to reach her. Later on, the hot water came back intermittently. There was only enough for one person to shower at a time. We were offered another apartment, but it had poor ventilation and was smaller than the one we had booked, and there was no guarantee that the hot water situation would be better in this other apartment, so we declined. While sorting out all of this, the bartender spoke to us in the corridor, causing some noise, and another guest complained. We apologised and went back to our apartment. 

After this, Darcy began sending aggressive messages to us, deploring us as the “worst guests ever” and threatening to call Airbnb security. In addition, she oh-so-helpfully reminded us that we would be fined if we “trash” the apartment. Last of all, she asked us to leave a day earlier than we had planned. 

We did so. I don’t know if she was having a bad day, but I don't think my concerns and requests were unreasonable. While I am sorry for causing unnecessary noise that evening, that only happened because the bartender was trying to sort our situation out, and we did not deserve Darcy’s vitriol. "
37233	3449059	9.0	8.0	33060796	"No sign of the host but an employee looked after us.
The location was good, and we could indeed walk to the major attractions of the city.
The apartment was for two couples but one couple was on a fold down bed blocking the way to the bathroom.
Because the bed would not even unfold we removed the mattress and put it on the floor of the living room for the other couple.
Not convinced that it was good value for the money."
37234	3449059	9.0	8.0	34071466	"We did not meet Darcy in person, but picked up the key from Merchants Cafe. Tony was very nice and helpful to anything we needed. 
The apartment was clean, up two flights of stairs, and very historic feeling. In the pictures it shows a view of Pioneer square. This is inaccurate, this apartment has a view of the ally/office building. There were some hidden gems within the block. Julie's Garden, cheap Chinese/Vietnamese food. Comedy Underground, cheap entry fee and the local comedy was hilarious!

Pros: Great location, washer/dryer, secure entrance, mini fridge, HD TV, queen size bed, coffee shop two doors down.

Cons: Internet is TERRIBLY slow, noisy (it's in the city, so just expect it), 7am garbage truck wake up call every morning, homeless in this area are verbally aggressive (we found acknowledging them is much better than ignoring them)"
37235	3449059	9.0	8.0	34138205	This was a great place to stay while sightseeing in Seattle. The location was close to many attractions, and we were able to easily find a spot to park on the street overnight. Check-in with the bartender downstairs was quick and easy. The apartment was spacious, and while there is a kitchen and washer/dryer, we didn't need them during our one-night stay. There was some noise that came in through the window from the street below, but it wasn't a problem at night with the bedroom door closed. Recommended!
37236	3449059	9.0	8.0	35446303	"We really enjoyed Darcy's 303 apartment on Yesler way in Seattle. it was located central to all the attractions that i wanted to show my parents. 
As for the host: we encountered an issue during checking in- since the bartender could not find the key to #303. Darcy was out of town. So we spend about 1 .5 hr at the Merchant cafe and finally the bartender arranged us to stay the night in the close by Marriot hotel- and gave us a round of drinks and offered food on the house. Also we got a nice bay view room at the mar riot of the night. Darcy and her bartenders were quick to communicate through all this and the next day they got us the 303 apt and Darcy gave us a complimentary fruit basket. 
Even though we had an issue, they resolved it as well as any one could and was quick to make sure that they did their best to make us comfortable. We stayed there for 7 days altogether- and quickly settled into the beautiful apartment. I would certainly recommend this spot- and i will stay there again. I know that even if some unexpected thing happens the host would take care of it!"
37237	3449059	9.0	8.0	35808463	The apartment was great - One room had a kitchen with a 4 person peninsula and a loveseat with a couple comfortable chairs...and a big flatscreen. The other room had a very comfortable bed. No AC, but the fans and open windows cooled it down comfortably. It's clearly a vacation rental - not someone's personal apartment. The windows look into the alley - and there was typical city noise. It was an easy 10-15 minute walk to Pike's place in one direction, and the stadium in the other. Homeless in the area are plentiful and can get a bit aggressive, but it is the city. We parked on the street at night and in the garage across the street during the day and just walked everywhere. The Merchant's cafe downstairs was a nice perk - and they have a great happy hour. We have plans to come back! 
37238	3449059	9.0	8.0	36564593	The room was very nice with a perfect location to downtown! Would stay there again. It was hard to contact the host and the place could of been cleaner, but other than that good stay.
37239	3449059	9.0	8.0	37165308	We did not meet Darcy. We stayed one night. We checked in with the bartender at 2pm., and he went looking for the key. He found it upstairs with the housekeeper who wasn't done cleaning until close to 40 minutes later. We stayed in #303, and it is beautiful brick and wood, as in the photos. It could use some general upkeep and a deeper cleaning, such as fixing the toilet so it doesn't wobble or cleaning dust balls off the ceiling fan and ceiling--but it was clean enough and fine for a night. We happened to be there during a heat wave, and so we were glad there was a portable air conditioner in the apartment. The second bed is an air mattress, and we needed to move some furniture in the living room to get it set up. The hall light shines in over the door, which makes sleeping in the living room less than ideal. There were some street sounds, as other reviews have mentioned, but the air conditioner was nice for white noise. The bedroom was comfortable. I guess I'd recommend this apartment for 2 people rather than the 4 it can sleep. When making coffee the next morning, we found that the housekeeper had overlooked cleaning the maker/pot. We could walk around town really easily from this location, and we took the lightrail to the airport--it was a cinch. Many homeless asking for money--just as other reviews say. Some cool shops in the area, and we found a great restaurant 10-minute walk north--I can't remember the name, but they served sourdough pizzas and many types of drinks. 
37240	3449059	9.0	8.0	37544239	Great place and location!  Only downsides was parking was difficult and expensive (but that is everywhere in Seattle) and it was warm at night in bedroom. Living room has window unit but it doesn't reach bedroom well. On behalf of host, it was unusually hot for Seattle during our stay. 
37241	3449059	9.0	8.0	37957669	"(email hidden) downstairs were very helpful and friendly. The 2nd bed  (which is actually an air mattress) is surprisingly not horrible. More than enough towels provided. Neighborhood is close to plenty of things to do.

Only minor complaint is that the wifi is not the most reliable."
37242	3449059	9.0	8.0	38197006	A very interesting location above a landmark pub. Lots of pan handlers from the park across the street. Close to everything. Updated appliances, easy checking in and out,  secure building.
37243	3449059	9.0	8.0	38376108	The space was decent and the neighborhood was good.  Alot within walking distance.  The air conditioning left alot to be desired
37244	3449059	9.0	8.0	38599072	It was a great place to stay. The steps up to the apartment are pretty steep, so make sure you are up for it. She did have a plug in air conditioner for us, but the bedroom was still a little hot. I think it is usually much cooler in Seattle, so it shouldn't be a problem most of the year. The apartment was very clean and bright. The neighborhood was great. We were only a $10 cab ride from the Space Needle, so it is very well situated. There are two parking garages right across the street for overnight parking. 
37245	3449059	9.0	8.0	38818117	Efficient communication and cozy apartment! We especially appreciated the easy access to the airbed and extra linens.
37246	3449059	9.0	8.0	39222339	"description was right on point - adorable historic apartment with a super-easy check in process through the cafe downstairs. the location was very walkable to pike's place / downtown, with a lot of cute shops/eateries nearby. 

I couldn't find street parking readily available (and did not want to feed the meter), but the parking garage, although pricey, could not be any closer. It was perfect for our stay in Seattle. "
37247	3449059	9.0	8.0	40703954	Delighted with our stay st Darcy's!  Check in super easy - apartment had everything we needed including washing machine! Beds super comfy - very important after long flight! But best of all was the location! Great bars and restaurants and lots of life,  enjoyed our stay so much we're going back again in two weeks!
37248	3449059	9.0	8.0	41995613	Everything was as advertised, no issues. Cool historic building and neighborhood.
37249	3449059	9.0	8.0	43023720	Fantastic experience as my first Airbnb. Darcy and the cafe staff were great and very helpful. The place was just as described and pictured. The place was conveniently located and everything we could need was provided in the room. 
37250	3449059	9.0	8.0	43611069	"I would not recommend staying here.
The apartment is nice enough, but has a dingy feeling to it. Not as nice as the pictures make it seem. We never met the host, just received a key from the bartender of the bar below. That was the only interaction we had with anyone related to the apartment. When we got in to the apartment the bedding was still in the washer and dryer, so we had to finish doing the laundry before we could use the beds. We were told to park in the parking garage across the street for the night. Do NOT park there! Our car was broken into that night, the window smashed,and many things stolen out of it. I messaged the host to let her know and she never replied to my message. If you're looking for a nice place in Seattle, do not choose this one. "
37251	3449059	9.0	8.0	44111757	"Although we did not met Darcy, her instructions were very clear and the staff at Merchants cafe (the oldest restaurant in Seattle!) was super kind and helpful. They even let us keep our luggage on the bar all day while we explore the city. One of the problems is that the apartment was listed as it has 2 beds. The second ""bed"" is actually an air mattress (which was comfortable, though). I think this information should be mentioned in the apartment description. The apartment is not very well insulated from external noise (garbage collecting, and a nearby factory that runs all night). It was difficult to sleep on the living room. The apartment is very nice and well located, it is ideal for 2 people but not for 4 people. Also when we arrived some of the sheets and towels were still on the washing machine and wet. The area, Pioneer Sq, is really cool, tons of nice restaurants and cafes (Gran Central, 2 blocks away) and you can easily walk everywhere, but also lots of homeless, it can be a bit scary at night if you go alone. It is also conveniently located 1min away from the tram that goes to the airport. But very difficult to park your car (unless you pay for the parking lot). "
37252	3449059	9.0	8.0	45052199	We didn't meet Darcy however, Justin the barman of the Merchants Cafe, looked after our luggage until checkin time. The Apartment is ideally located in a vibrant area providing easy access to the city by foot and bus. The King Street train station is only a short walk away; this was useful to us as we took Amtrak from Vancouver. There are a good selection of nearby restaurants in the Pioneer Square  area and the Apartment reflected the era of construction, having just one window, however it suited us well. Even the blow up bed was self inflating & comfortable. The vibrant location meant it wasn't the too quiet however this wasn't a problem & one of the highlights was letting Justin conjure up a cocktail in the bar. If you want to visit Seattle Apartment 303 is a good choice. 
37253	3449059	9.0	8.0	45233241	"We found Darcy's appartment very stylish. Location and description of it was perfect for one night stay. Check-in and check-out in 1st floor's café was very convenient for late arrival. The appartment was clean and offered everything one could need for a city trip. The somewhat ""interesting"" neighbourhood in Downtown Seattle (especially at night) does not disturb once you close the appartment door."
37254	3449059	9.0	8.0	45573562	"Great location ... neighborhood has many fun pubs and restaurants,
Light rail and bus route is within a couple of blocks. All the major attractions are within walking distance. The room is exactly as pictured.  We were a party of four, one couple used the bedroom and the other had a blowup mattress in the living room. The room and neighborhood is best suited for the young. Darcy and her staff were excellent in taking care of our needs and providing us with info on how best to enjoy our time in Seattle. We would go back."
37255	3449059	9.0	8.0	46364324	Darcy was extremely helpful. The apartment is clean and tidy and steeped in history!  I accidentally left my jacket downstairs and Darcy made sure I had it back before I left.  Just beware that there are a few older style stairs to the apartment.  thanks Darcy
37256	3449059	9.0	8.0	46582529	A nice place to stay with an even better restaurant on the ground floor.  Darcy was courteous and quick to respond, as well as had someone check the room after it was thought that something was left behind;  interactions were very business like.
37257	3449059	9.0	8.0	46877113	Easy booking, great location, above a bar, but not noisy. It did get hot upstairs, but Darcy had a fan in the bedroom and it did a fine job of cooling it down.  Plenty of towels and kitchen amenities.
37258	3449059	9.0	8.0	47125833	"Everything was easy and this is a downtown gem, near Seattle Underground tours. Great dining on 1st, and typical urban streetscene as noted in other reviews. Key pick up was easy and I could always get help if needed.
Simple stay, would recommend to others."
37259	3449059	9.0	8.0	47205845	Darcy was a great host, fast response times, lovely apartment in a great location.
37260	3449059	9.0	8.0	47247518	"All went well ...we arrived early from Vancouver so dropped our (email hidden)/cafe downstairs and walked to pike market for lunch.
We were on the 3 rd floor so the stairs were only an issue because Liz managed to load two tons of luggage into 1 bag.  She repeated this amazing feat yet again for bag number 2.
I thought by not buying another bag it may curb and limit the shopping.  
Oh how wrong I was.  Lol
The apartment was a good size and very clean.
Great location easy walk to pike street and even closer to central rail station when we arrived from Vancouver.

Thanks for hosting us.
 Steve and Liz."
37261	3449059	9.0	8.0	49892305	This is our second time staying at Darcy's place and we enjoyed it even more the second time.  The check in/check out process is simple and the room is centrally located to everything we wanted to see in Seattle.  If going to the stadium, you can't get a better location as the stadium is literally just a few blocks away.  The room is clean and we appreciated the fact that there is a full kitchen so we could make breakfast before we set out for our day.  We highly recommend Darcy's place!
37262	3449059	9.0	8.0	50957165	We never met Darcy however the apartment is pretty much as described except the couch didn't pull out. What isn't described is the slightly spooky atmosphere of the hallways complete with Victorian era pictures/paintings. Definitely feels a bit haunted but after reading the history of the Merchants Saloon it seems the ghosties tend to stay downstairs. The bartender was kind and recommended we park in the Butler garage a street over instead of the one in front of the actual building.  The three flight walk up is a bit difficult with luggage but manageable. At night the area definitely had a large homeless population in the park across the way however we felt pretty safe walking to the piers and back after dark.  Overall, interesting building and history and decent place to stay for a couple nights in Seattle 
37263	3449059	9.0	8.0	51129250	The apartment was as advertised. A beautiful old apartment in a really central location. The one issue we had was that the second bed (futon) was broken and needed to be reinflated several times during the night to keep it from sinking. This meant only one working bed in the apartment. The staff in the bar below were great. 
37264	3449059	9.0	8.0	51712143	We were in Seattle to attend the Women’s Soccer Victory Tour and wanted a place close to the Amtrak Station and CenturyLink Field. First, keep in mind this is an old historic building/apartment with only stair access which was not an issue for us. We were in apartment 303 on the third floor. The positive aspects of this apartment: LOCATION- it is perfect if you are attending an event at CenturyLink field and/or taking Amtrak; there are many good restaurants in the area so you do not have to venture out of the area for a meal; transit (bus) stops are close by to get you to any other part of the city. Also, it is not too far a walk to Pike Market. APARTMENT- the apartment was very clean with a comfortable bed, largeTV, internet with cable and comfortable furniture. When we got there the internet connection kept crashing and Darcy quickly responded to my text message and had me go downstairs and have the cafe staff reset the unit and we had no problems after that. If you arrive before check in or are leaving town after check out you can leave your bags in the Merchant’s Cafe and Saloon until you need them; this is very convenient. The people who help you with any apartment issues in the Cafe were super friendly and very welcoming. Some aspects of the apartment that were less desirable for us: 1) there is only one window in the living area that opens into the busy alley below. Since we like fresh air, we kept it open and heard the pulse of the city very clearly day and night. 2) since the bedroom did not have a window, we kept the bedroom door open which let in the light from the hallway into the room (there is a bright light outside the apartment door [for safety] and a window above the door into the apartment and a window into the bedroom) so the room was never really dark. 3) there was no hair dryer or microwave 4) we kind of felt like unexpected guests as there were two ladders leaning along the wall and railing leading to our apartment and vacuum cleaners behind a chair outside the apartment. Also there were sheets still in the dryer and the dresser was filled with sheets so you could not use it if you wanted to. This was just a little tacky. I was a little disappointed when I emailed Darcy prior to our arrival (as Airbnb recommends) to give her our arrival plans and I got no response. Perhaps a text message would have been a better communication option. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle and this place met our needs for this particular trip. One thing I wish I would have done prior to staying here is spent some time reading the Merchant’s history—it is really fascinating and I would have explored inside the Cafe to appreciate the history. However, when...
37265	3449059	9.0	8.0	52346127	"Loved this historic old apartment with modern convenience. .
There were stairs getting in, which was ok for us. We drove right off the ferry and straight in front of the apartment.  It was great, we used the blow up mattress for the second bed. 
Great old apartment with brick walls, nice colors, amazing location. 
It really made Seattle feel magical .. 
And though we never met Darcy, the unit was easy to access abd she worked with us in the days as we were one day behind due to our family catching the flu during our road trip 
Would recommend  and we would stay there again 
 "
37266	3449059	9.0	8.0	52748707	Darcy welcomed us in person and showed us another suite in addition to the one we'd reserved the night, to give us more choice (though we chose to stick with 303). Merchants bar below is a gem. I've stayed in different apartments in the building before and have always had a great stay. I'll be back! 
37267	3449059	9.0	8.0	53359117	Cool building and room. Great location for walking to almost everyplace in the southern part of (website hidden) downstairs was cool.
37268	3449059	9.0	8.0	53798857	Darcy's place above the merchants cafe was a gorgeous stay. Everything was so close to the hotel. Literally walking distance! The original character in the house was beautiful and so cozy. 
37269	3449059	9.0	8.0	53869967	Exactly as advertised. Helpful staff. There are a lot of homeless people in the area but definitely feel safe and at home in the room! Would stay here again.
37270	3449059	9.0	8.0	53935404	"Really good place to stay. 
They have got everything; convenient location, facilities, wonderful hosts and affordable price.
Room was cozy and spacious."
37271	3449059	9.0	8.0	55340672	We had a great time staying here. The historic apartment was as described.  I am a social studies teacher so I loved the historic room, historic bar, and historic district. The place was clean.  The bar Merchants Cafe was a great place to eat and drink.  The male bartender was fun and very helpful! The local/regional beers on tap was a plus and the food was great!   I would recommend this place and I would stay there again!
37272	3449059	9.0	8.0	55680656	Very cool location not to far from pike place and century link field 
37758	5021969	9.0	8.0	28156255	Darcy was great accommodating us last minute! The place was beautiful, historic, clean, and walkable to everywhere in town. We were able to have an easy (email hidden) downstairs and the bartenders were very nice and welcoming. Overall we loved the area and the room! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
37759	5021969	9.0	8.0	29582184	"Unfortunately I haven't met Darcy in person, I was greeted by the bar tender downstairs to check in.  The room itself was cozy with very tall ceilings and old world charm. reminded me of my old NYC apartment in a pre-war building. Pioneer square can be a tad seedy late at night, although I knew this ahead of time. Just keep your head up when walking at night alone.

My stay was problem-free otherwise. Checking in and out was quite easy and flexible. "
37760	5021969	9.0	8.0	29765809	Great location. Walking distance to a lot of Seattle's best and only a 10$ cab ride to the rest. I am from the area and just in town for an event... some people claim in reviews that the homeless in the area are pushy, but it is just a Seattle thing, they are 99% harmless and will leave you alone if you just push on. Stick to the main streets and you will be fine. The amount of living space you get vs. a hotel in Seattle is about double for half the price so well worth it. Darcy and the (email hidden) are very helpful if you need anything. If you are there on a weekend expect it to be noisy until around two am or so, mostly from people in the street more than the club next door. It is an old building with thinner walls and you can hear the building make it's own noises (creaky floors and such) if you are a super light sleeper bring ear plugs. Would definitely stay again! We stayed in 202.
37761	5021969	9.0	8.0	30781898	Darcy's apartment was comfortable, clean and in a great location. There is a bar and restaurant right downstairs which made picking up and returning the key to the room easy. Great place!
37762	5021969	9.0	8.0	31831663	Very nice apartment. 
37763	5021969	9.0	8.0	33099543	"Nice place to stay. Room was clean, lots of towels, lots of linens, and lots of pillows. The pictured couch is a pull-out bed, so the room can probably comfortably fit 4 people even. Picking up and returning the key at Merchant's is convenient. Being able to get to the place by light rail from SeaTac is a great perk.

Apartment is walking distance to Pike Place and Seattle Center. Ballard Street and Capitol Hill are about a $10 Uber ride away. As others have said, there are homeless around asking for money, but they don't pester you if you politely decline.

Only possible drawback (or benefit) is that the apartment is right next to the Trinity nightclub, which we could hear one night. Not loud enough to disturb sleep though."
37764	5021969	9.0	8.0	33990748	Great stay! The apartment was very comfortable and centrally located. The check-in & check-out was a smooth easy process. It did get a little noisy at night, but it didn't affect my sleep. I definitely recommend! 
37765	5021969	9.0	8.0	34266828	The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
37766	5021969	9.0	8.0	34613354	The communication with Darcy was easy. She gave specific and easy instructions to follow. The apartment was wonderful, had a rustic charm to it and the bed, oh my, was divine. It's a short walk away from the King Street train station. 
37767	5021969	9.0	8.0	34958489	I arrived at the Merchants Cafe early to pick-up the keys. The staff at the Cafe were very nice and checked me in right away. The apartment was very comfortable and had everything i needed.
37768	5021969	9.0	8.0	36282428	This mini flat is really pretty big and has everything you would need for a short stay. You can't really beat the location although it can be a little loud. Check out London Plane a few minutes walk away for brunch or dinner.
37769	5021969	9.0	8.0	36365208	Checked in through Merchants Cafe after lunch. We were escorted to our room by Cafe staff. Room exactly as described in photos. Excellent location to sports venues - about 5 blocks. And theres 2 parking garage options across yhe street. The neighborhood is always busy with the bustle of city life but still quaint and always people around. Dispute the heat (90s) the place was surprisingly cool and had many windows and a fan. Also didn't hear night club or Cafe at all in our room. 
37770	5021969	9.0	8.0	36689400	This is a very central location in Seattle, just steps to the ferry and a 15 minute walk to Pike's Place. It's directly above the Merchant's Cafe. The apartment was a great value for Seattle with a small kitchen, living room, bathroom and private bed room costing less than a hotel room anywhere! The brick/chalkboard walls were fun and created a lot of fun ambiance. The building is on a busy corner and the walls are thing so you will hear everything going on outside. There are street cleaners and other vehicles that will wake up even deep sleepers wearing earplugs, so that's something to consider. The building is old and some electrical outlets do not work. Internet was also unavailable. It's a great spot from which to explore Seattle and the total value was great, but it's best for those who want to unplug and don't need to be connected. 
37771	5021969	9.0	8.0	36948890	"Myself and a couple friends had a nice stay at Darcy's apartment. Darcy responded promptly to all communications. The bar staff at Merchants was very friendly when we checked in, and the check-out process was easy as well. The apartment is just as pictured and described in the listing. Clean and comfy. 

A few other reviewers have commented about the street noise, and it did bother us. The weather was pretty warm when we were in Seattle, so we kept the windows open to get some air. We heard a good bit of noise between 12-2am with people leaving bars and then more noise in the early morning with dump trucks emptying out trash bins in the alley (right below the bedroom window) and seagulls waking up. I purchased some ear plugs and they helped a bit, but I probably would not stay here again in the summer due to the noise. I imagine with the windows closed it probably wouldn't be a problem. 

I have mixed feelings about the neighborhood. On the positive side, it was very convenient (just a couple blocks from Kings St station and easy walk to the market and other attractions), and there are some great restaurants nearby (loved Damn the Weather). However, it's sketchy at night. A lot of homeless people sleep on Occidental, and there are some shady characters that hang around the Saveway convenience store right around the corner from the apt. No one really bothered us, but I would avoid that particular area at night. "
37772	5021969	9.0	8.0	37592602	This booking was refunded, less fees. Had arranged to leave door unlocked because our train would get in 4 hours late than anticipated. We arrived to find the door locked and no one was available to answer messages due to it being 1 hour later than he restaurant closed, so I had to find a hotel downtown instead. Please note I that airbnb requires feedback for all items, even though some do not apply as I did not stay; average ratings have been selected in these cases.
37773	5021969	9.0	8.0	37958411	"This place is a corner of the building, it is nice and a good location.
However, it is very noisy. In fact, probably the noisiest place I have ever been, due to the club next door, and the general street noise.
In the early evening, the music is bearable, but as the night goes on the music got louder.  So I was not able to get to sleep any earlier than 2:00am.  Over the course of consecutive days, this gets pretty grating, when all you want to do is sleep.

Fear not, It is only open Thu-Sat, so if your days are outside of this it is a great place to stay.
Also, I would suggest getting the top floor, because the old floors in the place are wooden and creak, so you are privy to the bedroom habits of those above you.

The location is close to public transit hubs, and walking distance to many places.

However, the neighborhood is full of homeless and panhandlers, and they are aggressive. One came in to Merchants (the Bar and Restaurant downstairs) while I (email hidden) and begged money there. The Bar Tender, caught this and hastily removed them from the building.

Other than this, the place can get pretty hot, and at night. You can't really open the windows due to the noise until after 2:00am when the bars let out due to the street noise and people.  This was not really the case on Wednesday, mostly Thu-Sat.

The wifi, is spotty at best.  It continually drops your phone, but laptops with strong connections are a bit better.

Would I book again?  Yes, Sunday through Wednesday.
You really can't beat the location.

Based on the noise alone, I would give this place a 2 star rating, but coupled with the fact of the location, and a washer and drier, that is a 4, so I will split the difference at 3 Stars.
"
37774	5021969	9.0	8.0	38489365	This place was exactly as listed. Perfect place to stay and be close to everything down town. We loved it and will be back.
37775	5021969	9.0	8.0	38711126	Great location, clean, spacious, no complaints.
37776	5021969	9.0	8.0	39644547	Location was great - near a lot of great places. It was a bit loud overnight as the apartment is close to a bar - so bring ear plugs - other than that everything was as described.
37777	5021969	9.0	8.0	40098089	Easy and quick booking and arrangements. Great location for our day in Seattle--afternoon at Pike Place Market and evening with the Mariner--walking distance to both. Surprisingly quiet for Pioneer Square. A perfect fit for us and our 12-year-old nephew.
37778	5021969	9.0	8.0	40458919	The apartment is very spacious and we really enjoyed our stay there. Staff at the merchant cafe were very helpful and the area being the original part of Seattle was most interesting.
37779	5021969	9.0	8.0	40920720	Great apartment in a great location!
37780	5021969	9.0	8.0	41334400	Beautiful place – we were very impressed with the size and furnishings of the apartment. Very high ceilings, lots of large windows, well furnished. I have been to Seattle a number of times, but had never explored the Pioneer Square area: a great part of town, with a lot of good places to eat, grab coffee, and great architecture. Highly recommend the Sky View Observatory only a couple blocks away. Also an easy walk to King Street Station.
37781	5021969	9.0	8.0	41935437	"Wonderful old historic building. The flat was clean and comfortable. It is on the second floor, and there is no wheelchair access. The stairs are a bit on the steep side, but wide, with a sturdy handrail. We stayed on a Sunday night and the neighbourhood was quiet.  Conveniently located near the Pioneer Square train station, so we were able to get there easily from the airport. The second bed is the sofa shown in the photos. The back pillows remove and it is a single. I am 5'7"" 150 lbs and had no problem getting comfortable. Would definitely stay there again. "
37782	5021969	9.0	8.0	43528832	t was a bit hot, but the temperature in the city didn't help the day I was in in town. It was very loud due to construction going on in the city. For the most part it looked like the picture, the furniture in the apartment was different then the picture. Not as modern or new as the pictures display. It was easy getting into the apartment. 
37783	5021969	9.0	8.0	45267032	The pictures were very accurate and it was close to major attractions (aquarium, Pike Place Market, Amtrak station).  Darcy was very easy to communicate with before and during the stay.
37784	5021969	9.0	8.0	46392597	Great apartment, good size and nice layout. The location is awesome, really close to shopping, food, and the water. The one negative thing I will say about the location is that there is a number of homeless people that come out at night and stay in the park across the street from the building, they stay to themselves and dont cause any problems though, so it isint something to really worry about. The only thing to be aware of is the parking situation. There are multiple garages and llts around the building, but they all have signs posted saying no overnight parking. Luckily darcy was an amazing host and was able to let us rent her parking pass for the garage directly across the street from her building allowing us to park there overnight. All in all it was an amazing experience and i look forward to staying at darcys again wheb i am back in the city in a couple of months.
37785	5021969	9.0	8.0	46584724	Great location with easy access to public transportation.  Darcy made check-in and check-out easy and seamless. The noise of the surrounding restaurants and night life was minimal so we had no trouble sleeping.  Would definitely stay here again.
37786	5021969	9.0	8.0	47006242	Darcy and her staff were great. They did everything to make our experience pleasant. They place is very very very centrally located in pioneer square. 
37787	5021969	9.0	8.0	47385177	We arrived before check in time and the downstairs bar was great and let us store our bags while we explored a bit. The space and neighborhood are great. We walked easily to everything including a baseball game the waterfront and shopping the library and market. Would recommend and stay again when in Seattle. 
37788	5021969	9.0	8.0	47734822	What a great apartment.  Clean and extremely well put together.  The location is perfect for exploring Seattle! Thanks, Darcy.
37789	5021969	9.0	8.0	48134984	This is a beautiful, historic apartment in the heart of Pioneer Square - I was truly impressed, and I look forward to visiting again. Darcy went out of her way to make me feel welcome. The bed was comfortable. The wifi was fast. I had a wonderful stay. Highly recommended whether you're in town for work or play.
37790	5021969	9.0	8.0	48308770	"Apt 202 is a great apt in a primo location. It's a corner apt with windows on two sides and the front room windows look right onto Pioneer Square and the pergola. It's in public transpo heaven --close to many bus routes, 1.5 short blocks from the transit tunnel and light rail from the airport, an easy 10 minute walk from the Amtrak station, and there are always plenty of Ubers near. It's a charming old place with a living room kitchen and bedroom. If you like an older place in the heart of the city, you'll love this.

We add an issue with the facility and the cleaning so I knocked off a star, but Darcy jumped on it right away, taking time from what she was doing and driving through double-crazy traffic to get there and make it right, so I only knocked off one star. She was responsive, responsible and efficient.  We'd book it again."
37791	5021969	9.0	8.0	48469891	"Experience was Good overall, the building is old but well kept and renovated for the most part. Darcy's employee was there to welcome me and explain the ins and outs. 
The only bad side is not the listing itself but the area, which is not the safest part of town and there are many homeless asking for change at all times. Beware if you travel with children."
37792	5021969	9.0	8.0	48941066	This place was so cute!! Very central location and walking distance to many things. My friend and I loved the interior. It's very accurate to the pictures. Also got to meet some of the people that worked the bar below and everyone was very friendly and helpful. Overall great place and would recommend!
37793	5021969	9.0	8.0	49959317	This is a really cool apartment, located really close to King Street station.  Check in was easy in the bar downstairs.  The Pioneer Square area certainly has its fair share of interesting characters, but if you want a place close to the station, you can't do better than this.
37794	5021969	9.0	8.0	50146288	Really a great place to stay.  A cool, spacious room right in Pioneer Square at a reasonable price.  Convenient to everything. The bar staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Checking in and out with them was a breeze.  The neighborhood was a bit noisy at night, but that was expected.  Would stay here again.
37795	5021969	9.0	8.0	50374516	"If you are 25 years young this is a great place.  Pretty much nightclub central.  If you want a relaxing atmosphere and ""peace"" of mind this is not for you.  The suite itself has everything you need including a washer/dryer and kitchen.  Paper thin walls.  Nothing very close for breakfast.  One thing I will say is that the bed was very comfy.  Be prepared for a very steep flight of stairs!!!"
37796	5021969	9.0	8.0	50644239	The listing and photos were pretty accurate, and the location is excellent. The host never responded to us after 3 messages we sent prior to our arrival. We left a day early due to excessive dust that seriously aggravated our allergies.
37797	5021969	9.0	8.0	51072989	The building had a historic charm to it and the room was clean. It's in a great location, right in the heart of Pioneer Square, very close to the light rail station and walking distance to the market and downtown area. Overall really enjoyed staying here. 
37798	5021969	9.0	8.0	53261418	The apartment was absolutely great! It looks gorgeous and has everything you need. The bed is very comfortable and cozy, the WiFi is fast, and having  a well-supplied kitchen and washing machine/dryer was great as well. Some people complained about street noise but I didn't notice anything other than what is normal for a city. It didn't bother me. The location was very convenient to downtown the surrounding areas so I was able to walk mostly everywhere. Check in at the cafe below was very smooth. Overall my stay was great and I highly recommend the apartment to others. 
37799	5021969	9.0	8.0	53825443	Loved our apartment and the stay as a whole!  The place is super comfy and cute, and so much fun with all of the saloon, speak-easy, brothel and hauntings history.  The decor/feel of the apartment and building is so much better than some modern high-rise in my opinion (the Pioneer Square area is as a whole).  We arrived on the light rail, day-tripped on ferry, departed by Amtrak... all within easy walking distance.  Though we arrived before check-in, we were able to store our luggage... couldn't have been an easier process.  For us, a huge part of our stay, was the great input, warmth and humor of all three women working at the saloon/cafe.  We'll definitely stay again the next time we are in Seattle.  Thank you!
38319	9186256	8.0	8.0	54686510	Krystal was very accommodating with our check in. We were welcomed with wine, a cheese tray, and a few necessities in the fridge. Plenty of fresh towels, great Wifi, nice TV, convenient location, and decent beds! Met all of our needs!
38331	5252543	10.0	8.0	34368927	"Ali and Dirk were great. They made me feel very welcomed. Since this location is in family friendly community outside the city, it can be a bit tricky getting around if don't have a car.  It took me about 45 minutes to get to and from the city on the bus. Once you figure out the bus route, it can be very convenient for daytime excursions. 

The house has a stunning view of the water and is very peaceful and tranquil at sunset. Their dog Neva was a big ol' sweetheart.
The room was clean and cozy - the perfect size for a solo traveler. 
 I was very happy with my stay. 
"
38332	5252543	10.0	8.0	35947503	Ali & Dirk were very kind and generous hosts.  The room and bed were comfortable and looks just like photos.  I had a car and the location was close enough to the studio I was attending a training at.  I would stay with them again.
38333	5252543	10.0	8.0	42964701	"Ali and Dirk are awesome! I was driving in from San Francisco and at the mercy of fluctuating traffic conditions. Dirk worked around my arrival and met me at the house on a weekday while he was working. The WiFi is great, the house is clean and I have to say the downstairs unit where I slept was one of the coziest places I've been on AirBnB. I normally have trouble sleeping somewhere new, but I was out like a light every night while I was in town. I actually took pictures of the bed frame, pillows and sheets so I can try to find some for myself. Ali and Dirk were gracious and helpful hosts, and I never experienced any feeling of being ""underfoot"" in someone else's home. A great stay that I'll visit again next time I'm in Seattle. And Neeva is an adorable dog! The reading selection in the room was formidable and perfect for bedtime. "
38334	5252543	10.0	8.0	47820339	Dirk and Ali were very welcoming and friendly.  They have a beautiful house in a nice, quiet area of West Seattle.  Dirk and Ali were both very accommodating.  And they have a great dog!  
38335	5252543	10.0	8.0	48586793	Excellent Hosts!  Ali and Dirk's place is wonderful and they were gracious and flexible.  We were attending a wedding at The Hall at Fauntleroy, which is a quick drive down the hill from their house.  The location was perfect for us with a nice view of the sound, and it wasn't too hard to drive into downtown.  The bus also runs right in front of their house.  Nice accommodations and comfortable bed!
38336	5252543	10.0	8.0	56101624	Dirk and Ali are great hosts. The place was very comfortable and clean. Will stay again on my next trip to Seattle! 
39926	9736940	10.0	8.0	55770280	Nice, clean place. Elise was also very nice and lent me her Orca (public transit) card and offered me some Thanksgiving leftovers. Everything was clean, quiet and the place is a good value for sure.

40580	4395654	10.0	8.0	35942001	We enjoyed our couple of nights here. The place is just as photographed but there is peace and charm too that the photographs don't portray. 
40791	8342968	10.0	8.0	47875921	"Our stay with David in Seattle has been one of our best airbnb experiences. It really felt like we were his guests, he was so friendly and helpful, suggested lots of things to do and made us feel very welcome. Also Sawyer (his dog) and Artie (his cat) are super lovely and we really enjoyed hanging out with them. They definitely added to the experience in a positive way!
The room is right next to the bathroom and toiletries were provided making us feel right at home.
We would definitely stay here if we visited Seattle again."

41215	2134911	9.0	8.0	14753347	The Studio at Mibbett Hollow was everything promised from the advertisement and very comfortable; the location and view were even better! I was a first-time boat dweller and I loved it. Princess, the cat, is a sweetheart and Lynne is a delight to get to know. Everyone at the marina was friendly; the location is safe and convenient. 
41216	2134911	9.0	8.0	15078535	"Had a great visit with my son and stayed on Lynne's great houseboat. She was there to share info as needed, pick up milk for my morning tea and was a good unobtrusive host. We chatted in the evenings briefly if we were both around. The studio is comfy and princess the cat is a nice occasional visitor : ) Easy to get to, onsite parking, comforts of home away from home and anticipated boat facilities. I will surely be back now that my son is a Seattle transplant. 
"
41217	2134911	9.0	8.0	16169810	Lynne was a wonderful host. She welcomed me and told me everything I needed to know, she even took me to the grocery I needed to get to! The place was cozy and comfortable and her cat, princess was precious.
41218	2134911	9.0	8.0	16368611	"Lynn was gracious and helpful. It was a great time to stay on a Seattle house boat.
It's great to see the boats go by in the morning, right out the window."
41219	2134911	9.0	8.0	19377114	Lynne was a very gracious host, she met me at the houseboat the first day and went over everything I needed to know.  I had a magical experience on the water in her home, I will gladly visit again.  The location of her home is very close to the Ballard & Fremont neighborhoods, which was a perfect location for my trip. Thanks again Lynne for your hospitality!
41231	2586642	9.0	8.0	13965863	"We truly enjoyed our stay in this private, fresh and airy, newly renovated, comfortable suite! Emily and Daniel were great hosts! They immediately responded to any requests or questions we asked by email or text.

The location is great! Just blocks from Upper Queen Anne (we enjoyed the uphill ""hike"" to the center and the downhill stroll home), one block from Whole Foods, walking access to the Elliott Bay Trail along the Sound, and a short drive to Discovery Park, Ballard, and so much more!"
41232	2586642	9.0	8.0	14446280	The listing was exactly as presented and met all of our needs. Since we were going to events in Capitol Hill, Ballard, Fremont and the U-District this was a great central location. The patio is a nice feature, as are the new appliances and furniture. Emily was always available when needed and check-in and check-out was easy. Would rent the unit again in the future.
41233	2586642	9.0	8.0	14705417	We stayed here with another couple and absolutely loved it! The space is small but still gave enough privacy for the four of us. No complaints.
41234	2586642	9.0	8.0	19405933	We had a lovely time staying in Emily and Daniel's 2 bedroom get away. It has a separate entrance and is completely private from the upstairs dwelling. There is a nice deck with a fire pit and large table with chairs off the main bedroom which we were allowed to use as our private outdoor space. Our stay was longer than the typical trip. We were in the space for 2+ months waiting for a house to be built.  This worked well for our small family for an extended period. Ballard, the space needle, centennial park, and the heart of Queen Anne are all a short drive away. 
41235	2586642	9.0	8.0	20053799	This place was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. The apartment is the lower unit of a very cute house in Queen Anne. It's very close to the D Line, a quick bus ride into Lower Queen Anne, Downtown Seattle or Ballard. The place was clean and very cute. Emily had scones, coffee, and fruit in the fridge for us which was so nice to wake up to -- and unexpected. Thank you for a great stay, we loved it! 
41236	2586642	9.0	8.0	20878055	"Emily provided pastries and juice, which was nice, upon arrival. The unit was a nice size but there were a list of other items that provided an unsatisfied feeling after our stay. When I expressed them to Emily, she indicated that they were ""courtesy"" items and not a requirement of rental. Some of the items I mentioned to her were; that we did not receive hand towels, the bath towels we did receive were musty, there was mold in the tea canister, water was left in the tea kettle, tea kettle's Teflon coating was coming off, and there were two pillows per bed provided that were paper thin. In fact let my wife have both paper thin pillow on our bed and used a rolled up blanket as a pillow.

To my family we place an emphasis on attention to detail. I truly believe that finishes selected could have been nice had it not been for the poor craftsmanship at installation. The perception of a rushed renovation was amplified during our stay by, what we felt was, a unit that was l rushed during the cleaning process. Mind you a cleaning process that we pay $75 for.

Maybe Im overly critical OR maybe I just expect more when Im spending $250/night."
41237	2586642	9.0	8.0	23570512	"This place was just perfect! I stayed there several weeks for a temporary living situation - it had everything I needed and was super cozy. They've spent a lot of time on the ambiance through finishes and décor, and it was clean and modern and cozy all at the same time. 

The location is great, right on Queen Anne with lots of restaurants and shops close by, Whole Foods just down the street, and just a few minutes to downtown and other great neighborhoods. 

Emily was a wonderful host, ensuring I was all settled in and leaving me to it. They even hung a holiday wreath on my door, which was a nice touch! I would definitely recommend this unit!"
41238	2586642	9.0	8.0	24389873	Emily was not able to greet us when we checked in, but the instructions she provided were excellent and had every detail for us to check in and out without any questions.  It made my job easier as the organizer of our trip to not have to deal with too many questions.  We rented the basement floor which was decorated in a clean and modern style.  Everything was provided, including kitchen appliances and utensils.  All amenities we expected were there.  The wall heaters were very effective in keeping the place warm and cozy.  There was construction going on at the house next door, but they kept appropriate quiet hours at night and the machinery was barely noticeable during the day.  
41239	2586642	9.0	8.0	34600630	"We really enjoyed our stay here! It was clean, and the check in/out process was simple. The unit had all the amenities necessary for our stay, and was centrally located with a car, but walking anywhere was not very convenient. We barely saw the owners, but when we did, they were friendly and welcoming.

Thanks!"
41240	2586642	9.0	8.0	35565186	We had a lovely time. Home was clean, comfortable and in a centrally located area. Emily was helpful, provided some toys and extra bedding for our little ones. Would recommend this for others looking to stay in Seattle!
41241	2586642	9.0	8.0	35817167	"My parents stayed at Emily's for 2 nights during our stay in Seattle and we could not have asked for a better vacation. Emily provided  us anything we needed to check-in. The unit was quaint and comfortable (the kitchen is super cute!!!) and there is a very nice patio area to sit and enjoy your coffee in the morning (there is a beautiful view of lake). The house is located in one of the cutest neighborhoods , which is very close to all the attractions in Seattle has to offer. It didn't take us longer than 10-15 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go.

Overall they had such a great experience and I would highly recommend Emily  to anyone planning to visit Seattle!"
41242	2586642	9.0	8.0	36319221	Emily and Daniel were great hosts and made us feel very welcome. Their place had everything that we needed and was in an ideal location. Very close to downtown yet quiet and not too crowded. The apartment size was just right and included all of the amenities that made you feel like you were at home.
41243	2586642	9.0	8.0	36746772	The place was perfect. Very clean and had everything one would want at a great price. Short uber ride to everywhere we went. Nothing was more than 10-15 mins away. 
41244	2586642	9.0	8.0	38108524	We very much enjoyed our stay at Emily's. The 4 of us were quite comfortable sleeping in the 2 bedrooms, and the kitchen made it easy to have breakfast before heading out. The scones that were provided for us the first day were tasty! There were only 3 chairs for the 4 of us, but we brought in an extra one from the deck. Some evenings when we returned it was a little difficult to find parking on the street, but we never had to park more than a couple of blocks away. 
41245	2586642	9.0	8.0	38663563	"I had a lovely stay. The neighborhood is near Interbay and the Ballard bridge. I was able to walk or Uber to where I needed to go, but would suggest a rental car if staying for an extended period of time. New homes were being built next door, but surprisingly had no effect on the noise level or waking me up in the mornings. 

Emily was a gracious host with quick responses and thoughtful details. Fresh flowers, scones and a list of things to do/see were left out on the counter. The internet connection was great and I enjoyed the patio every night during these long summer days. I stayed here while on a work trip so the apartment was perfect for a quite location to come back to, relax and work from. "
41246	2586642	9.0	8.0	39306990	yes, we enjoyed staying at Emily's. We felt welcome and the place was clean and well equiped.
41247	2586642	9.0	8.0	39944228	Amazing. Extremely lovely place. Modern, great design. Emily was fabulous, couldn't have asked for a better experience to visit seattle for the first time. She was even overly nice when we made the mistake of walking into the wrong part of the house (rental is to the right down the hill of the main entrance). Would recommend this place to anyone. 
41248	2586642	9.0	8.0	40494989	We enjoyed staying here.  It was very easy to get to downtown Seattle and all of the things to do there.  It was a nice place for us to stay during our visit and served my family's needs well.
41249	2586642	9.0	8.0	41095161	Emily was a great host.  She was there when we arrived and extremely welcoming.  The space was great for us.  With a car the location was very convenient, the kitchen has everything we needed to cook and make coffee, and the beds were comfortable.  
41250	2586642	9.0	8.0	41625845	"Emily and family were very accommodating. The neighborhood was very safe and the description of the apartment was spot on. I very much enjoyed my stay and they made me feel at home and comfortable.
Thank you!!"
41251	2586642	9.0	8.0	42816815	"When we first arrived at Emily’s place, I was disappointed to find that it did not appear very clean. The sheets had crumb-type residue as well as small dog-like hairs on them and the pillows did not smell fresh, but rather as if they had been slept on. The carpet in one of the bedrooms seemed dirty; there was hair enough (blond and mine is brown) so that it gathered on my foot when I walked over it. The bathroom smelled like mildew with a slight urine odor, the towels reeked of mildew as if they had been left wet in a washer and then dried. None of the beds had a top sheet at all, only a bottom sheet and comforter, and I generally found this gross. The place had the appearance of not only a shabby cleaning job, but also a shabby construction job, which lent to the feeling of “yuck.” Lastly, they recycling bin had been left full under the sink and one of the odors revealed itself to be the old compost left in the bin long enough to grow mold and reek, this may have contributed to the flies that had taken up residence. I am a fan of composting as much as anyone, however—I don’t want to find it left in the bin for me to dump.

After sleeping on the disappointing arrival (I want to do things with a clear head) I wrote an email to Emily, and outlined what I had found. I had just finished and walked out the door (with my husband and 5-year-old) when Emily appeared outside, she was visibly upset (and obviously having an immediate emotional reaction given the timing) and she stated that “the floor had been cleaned with a toothbrush, the place was clean” and “So sorry it is not up to your standards” and I was “more than welcome to wash (myself) the sheets and towels if I felt they were not clean.” Clearly we were not going to agree on any other outcome. I was wrong in her eyes and that was that. 
Later, I contacted the Air bnb and sent them the pictures (I took after getting home that day) and they agreed that cleanliness was an issue and worked with me to resolve the matter. I could not change locations (Seattle in August is BUSY), which was what I would have liked to do. However, Air BnB was awesome and acted as an intermediary with Emily. They arranged for her to have the place cleaned, and that was a huge relief. We bought ourselves towels, 

 I wish that Emily had come to me and said, “I am so sorry you are uncomfortable, how can we resolve this?” I would have gladly worked with her. Instead her attitude and general lack of willingness to help left me without an alternative. In fact she NEVER spoke with us again, not to say she was sorry, not to ask if things had improved-nothing. 

"
41252	2586642	9.0	8.0	43424455	This was a very nice and cute little place.  It was obviously taken care of and was very clean.  Emily was responsive to a last minute phone call.  The location is not too far from downtown and within walking distance of the Queen Anne area (if you are in shape and don't mind hills).  No complaints at all.
41253	1815472	9.0	8.0	9335143	My stay with Darcy was pleasant. The positives of the stay was the full kitchen provided, the location to Pike Place and downtown Seattle, and the security of the apartment overall. The only downside I had with my stay was with the difficultly of getting ahold of Darcy to retrieve the keys and general questions about the apartment. 
41254	1815472	9.0	8.0	9876309	Darcy's apartment is in a very good location, within walking distance to many sites and neighborhoods in Seattle. Darcy was a generous host, and we didn't have any noise complaints with the bar downstairs, though we stayed in the apartment during the week. Overall, a very cute apartment that provided a great jumping-off point for exploring Seattle! 
41255	1815472	9.0	8.0	9921491	The room was just what we were looking for, a reasonably priced room in a fun part of Seattle where we could walk to dinner and entertainment. The room was clean and comfortable and had some charm as well. The room is small, barely accommodating the bed ,even with one side against the wall, but we were hardly there enough to care. Darcy and her crew at the restaurant are really nice and helpful. Yes, like others have said, it was noisy, but we were up for a break from country quiet, so that was OK.
41256	1815472	9.0	8.0	9933672	Darcy was amazing and so was the room. 
41257	1815472	9.0	8.0	10079070	Everything we needed, and in a great location. Any complaints about the homelessness/ safety should be directed towards the city of Seattle, not this apartment. It is certainly rampant, and not necessarily confined to several areas (think San Francisco/ LA). Wifi was spotty
41258	1815472	9.0	8.0	10179740	My boyfriend and I went to Seattle for a show in the international district and to watch the Super Bowl and the location of this place was perfect! Right in pioneer square it was walking distance to a lot of fun places and really awesome bars, in fact right down stairs is the oldest saloon in Seattle, so fun! Darcy the landlady is super helpful and flexible with check in and out times, the internet is pretty spotty so if you're relying on that maybe speak to Darcy first. 
41259	1815472	9.0	8.0	10507494	"Darcy has flexible check-in and check-out times, which was great and worked amazingly with my hectic schedule. Great central location and easy to access public transportation as well as the train station, but also located on top of a bar and club - the club is very very noisy and you can hear noise from the street very easily so slight warning for those who cannot fall asleep well or wake easily.

Small room in an old building but had all the necessities and had a comfortable one-night stay. Very reasonable, especially when comparing to hotels in the area who seemed to offer way worse accommodations for a much higher asking price! If I need a place to crash in Seattle again, I would definitely come back!"
41260	1815472	9.0	8.0	11178798	"This is a lovely space.  Unfortunately it's above a bar that closes at 2am on Friday and Saturday, and next door to a nightclub that closes at 2:30am on Friday and Saturday.  Also, the neighbors in the building are loud laughers and TV watchers.  Friday night they were watching TV until 4:30am.  I thought they'd turn it off at some point.  Instead they started a movie at 2 in the morning.  It was the movie Catch Me If You Can.  I could tell because the walls are paper thin and I could hear everything like it was an old-timey radio show.  So if you enjoy sleep and plan on being in Seattle over the weekend, find somewhere else.

When I came back late Saturday night, the keypad to let me in the building was broken--didn't work at all.  Luckily there were still some employees of the bar hanging out inside, and after banging on the door and explaining through hand gestures that I was trying to get upstairs, they were able to call someone to come over and unlock the door.  If they hadn't been there, I might have had to sleep on a park bench, with one of the dozens of homeless people all over this neighborhood.

Don't stay here, unless you go to bed at 4 in the morning.  But at that point, the garbage trucks and leaf blowers outside start up, and the homeless people start yelling at each other, and the seagulls start screaming at each other, and the homeless people scream at the seagulls, and the seagulls scream at the homeless people."
41261	1815472	9.0	8.0	11401425	This location was a great place, easy to find and located just a block from the Pioneer Square light link station and walking distance to Pike's Place and most other attractions. Darcy was a great host and everything was great with no problems checking in and helped us with anything we needed, I would definitely stay here again should I go back to Seattle. Neighborhood was also great with everything we needed to make our stay (email hidden)anks Darcy!!!
41262	1815472	9.0	8.0	11503225	"Darcy and her space offered a wonderful and truly unique experience for us in Seattle!! She went above and beyond to accomodate us, very last minute. The unit sits above the Merchants Cafe, Seattle's oldest running bar and restaurant. TOO COOL. We took the light rail train from the airport to the Pioneer Square stop and were blown away when we learned the property was only a block or two away. It was SO convenience. And then to top it all off, we were able to connect on (email hidden) below, which was PERFECT as I believe anyone enjoys a good beer or drink after a long day of travel. At least, we did :) We enjoyed a pint and some bites before seeing our room, which turned out to be quaint studio apartment RICH WITH CHARACTER. We will stay here again next time we visit Seattle, for sure. 

For those past guests who have made negative comments related to the area's homelessness populations and nearby nightclubs, DON'T STAY DOWNTOWN SEATTLE IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THESE COMMON URBAN CONDITIONS. If you were to stay in my space downtown Denver you would have to deal with the same.....and I'm sure that goes for many of America's great cities and their downtowns. 

Overall, Darcy and her space made our short trip in Seattle what it was and we cannot thank her enough!!!

"
41263	1815472	9.0	8.0	11704650	Thank you so much for the hospitality. Loved the decor of the home. Also it is in a great neighborhood. A lot of street parking. Pretty close to downtown Seattle and the university. Thanks a bunch. Hope to stay again.
41264	1815472	9.0	8.0	11998451	Darcy is a very friendly host with an amazing spot right above the very cool wine bar The Merchant.  I enjoyed Seattle thoroughly thanks to the great hospitality given to me by Darcy. Thank you!
41265	1815472	9.0	8.0	13016327	Darcy was a great host.  She was pleasant and full of information. The room was very nice with a view of the square. The Merchant Cafe' is just downstairs with good food and a great atmosphere  It is walking distance from almost anything. If you are coming from the airport it is just a light rail ride away with only a short walk from the Pioneer Square stop. I had a wonderful visit. 
41266	1815472	9.0	8.0	13052048	Check-in and check-out times are flexible and the process went extremely smooth.  The studio was well decorated and clean.  It's location is amazing.  Walking distance to Amtrak, CenturyLink and Safeco fields, Pioneer Square and the Waterfront markets.  It is in the oldest restaurant/bar still operating in the same location on the West Coast and that gives the place a special feel.  And if you want food and drinks, just walk downstairs.  An awesome place that is on our list to stay again. 
41267	1815472	9.0	8.0	13787232	Such a perfect spot for a newcomer to Seattle! Right in the heart of everything, but not quite in the hustle and bustle. I didn't get to meet Darcy, but she was very prompt and courteous with her messages, so there wasn't any confusion at all. We checked in with Tony, the bartender at Merchant's Cafe below the apartment, and he was very friendly and helpful with everything, from the room to the beer and the local attractions. The apartment is only a (downwards sloping!) block from the Pioneer Square lightrail station, and a short walk to the piers, or stadium. The Space Needle is a bit of a hike but not by much, and Pike Market is pretty close as well. If you are looking for the perfect place to stay and explore the city, with everything at your fingertips, this is the place to go! 
41268	1815472	9.0	8.0	14141714	The host was wonderful and very accommodating. Look forward to my time there again soon.
41269	1815472	9.0	8.0	14730690	Perfect little studio! AMAZING location! Very clean. The bed was super comfortable. We loved that the decor was new, but that it was styled in a vintage fashion to go along with the history of the building and the area.  We were in town for the games and were able to walk to the stadium. It was also super convenient when we got back to have a drink downstairs at Darcy's restaurant/bar.  They even reopened the kitchen for some spectacular food for us.  My only comments would be to plan to park in the garage across the street ($28 for 24 hours), and you must be okay with the street noise (you are in the middle of downtown-it's LOUD).
41270	1815472	9.0	8.0	14936221	This was my first time using Airbnb, and I will gladly do it again, thanks to my great experience with booking this lovely room and working with Darcy.  She was prompt, welcoming and easy to work with.  The room was exactly as it's presented in it's photos.  The staff who (email hidden) were just as kind as Darcy, and made the entire stay that much better.  The next time I go to Seattle, I will definitely want to book this room again.
41271	1815472	9.0	8.0	15187292	Wonderful location!!!! We  weren't in the apartment too much but it was about a half mile away from pikes and right next to a bus stop that takes you to the space needle. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family! 
41272	1815472	9.0	8.0	15403990	"The apartment was a sweet spot. It was nice to have a kitchen and bathroom - even a washer and dryer! Darcy was incredibly kind and accommodating. REALLY GREAT! I do wish that the windows had screens so that we could've had them open and been safe from lots of bugs flying in. There was a fan, but no a/c, so the fresh air was welcome. The place is in a very very central and also very gritty part of town. It was awesome to be close to pike and the waterfront, but it didn't feel quite as private as we were hoping for. With those big wonderful windows on the 2nd story we felt close to the street, and it's a busy and really ""real"" part of downtown. Great for being a tourist in downtown, not ideal for a super private romantic getaway. "
41273	1815472	9.0	8.0	16299716	Darcy was an excellent host and the place was perfect for my 2 night midweek stay.  Everything I needed was supplied and I had a great time in the pioneer square area.  Would definitely stay here again in the future.
41274	1815472	9.0	8.0	16636165	Darcy's studio apartment rental is above her historic tavern. It's very comfortable and charming, but simple. The vaulted ceiling, big windows, and brick walls make it feel spacious. The ceiling fan cooled off the room quickly! Great new, clean bathroom, clothes washer and dryer. I would only change the bathroom door, it doesn't provide much privacy. The location is amazing for tourism, it's right in the center of Pioneer Square. Darcy seemed nice though she and her staff at the cafe weren't overly attentive. The wifi did not work. We had a nice time, a classic bed and breakfast experience- without the breakfast.
41275	1815472	9.0	8.0	18621217	Darcy was very warm and welcoming and made us feel very welcomed! The space was  just as the photos show. We rented the space to go to a football game and it was perfect! 3 blocks! And my husband was is heaven since it was above a bar! Very cool historic place! Would recommend it to anyone ! 
41276	1815472	9.0	8.0	19588157	Quick check in, everything was very clean and organized. Anything that we needed, we could get. 
41277	1815472	9.0	8.0	19999822	While we didn't meet the host directly, Darcy was easy to get ahold of through Airbnb. Her directions were clear as to where to pick up keys, etc. The people in the Merchant Cafe/Bar were nice. Quaint room with all the amenities one needs for few days in Seattle. The plus of staying at this Pioneer Street location is its location, no doubt. It was easy to walk anywhere and everywhere, especially the stadium. Recommend bringing headsets or ear plugs, should you stay over the weekend when street noise extends to 2am.
41278	1815472	9.0	8.0	20540235	"Upon arrival, I was held back about an hour before I was given access to my room due to the housekeeper still cleaning; it wasn't a major deal, but it was a bit upsetting. The apartment is clean, tidy, and described exactly like the listing. It's situated in a historical part of town which is great for a history lover and it's only about a 10-15 minutes walk to the Pike Place Market and the Downtown Retail Core. Also, close to the transit system which is convenient for anyone arriving from the airport, Amtrak or Greyhound. It was relatively quiet at night time too (weekdays), not much going on in the neighbourhood after about ~8PM. The wifi is pretty much non existent in the apartment but you got a Starbucks just two doors down. 

Overall, as a one night stay, it was affordable and relatively close to everything I wanted to see/do in town. Despite the wifi issues, I would recommend this place again! "
41279	1815472	9.0	8.0	22430979	We didn't meet Darcy but those we did meet were very friendly and accommodating. The place was exactly as it appears. Gorgeous! The location was great for getting where we needed to, only a bit of street noise but barely disturbed us. Picking up and dropping off the keys was so easy, it reduced a of stress knowing we had some flexibility.
41280	1815472	9.0	8.0	23267762	"A very good appartment in a really good place of Seattle : pionner square. Everything is near this appartement : Subway, Starbuck, supermarket and parking. And the bar the Merchants, of course!!
The appartement is cute and practice. If you have a very light sleeper, take earplug but it's ok for the others. "
41281	1815472	9.0	8.0	24078151	"I am not usually so negative, but this was one of my worst travel experiences. The studio was not clean, there was hair all over the wall in the bathroom, towels and rugs were dingy, and the wifi didn't work. The walls were paper thin, and I could hear everything that happened in the next room. There also isn't a real door to the bathroom, so there is no real privacy if you aren't traveling by yourself. The live music kept me up until 2am, which was my own fault for not reading thoroughly that Thursdays were included as a weekend night. 

However, the staff was extremely nice!! I think it would be a fine place to stay for a night but not for an extended period of time. "
41282	1815472	9.0	8.0	24257086	A beautiful room, just as the pictures look. The location is a quick walk from down town, with lots of shops close by. Along with a cute bar below. The process was easy to get set up & sign out.
41283	1815472	9.0	8.0	24564791	Though the apartment had not been cleaned when we arrived, the bar staff kindly sorted everything out and gave us free drinks while we waited. An interesting perch above Pioneer Square.
41284	1815472	9.0	8.0	24615658	Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very nice bartender with an awesome haircut who promptly showed us the room.  Unfortunately, the room was not clean.  She and Darcy handled it immediately by upgrading us to a bigger room and gave us a free dinner and drinks!  Things happen, but we were very pleasantly surprised by how well the situation was handled.  The room was beautiful and clean.  The food was good and the drinks were well made.  Overall a great experience! 
41285	1815472	9.0	8.0	25241531	"The studio over Merchants Cafe was a perfect little escape in the old part of Seattle. The room was tiny but full of everything you would need for a warm stay. 

The noise issues with the club wasn't too bad, definitely heard it but nothing that made it hard to fall asleep. As others have said, the WiFi was abysmal. 

I would stay here if I was looking for a place in a easily walkable part of the city with plenty of cafes, restaurants and museums within a 20 min walk. "
41286	1815472	9.0	8.0	25405825	Darcy was a very welcoming and responsive host. If you want an authentic experience in an historic part of Seattle, I'd highly recommend her Pioneer Square apartments. 
41287	1815472	9.0	8.0	25721773	FANTASTIC location! Darcy is extremely thoughtful and provides a high quality and professionally up kept place to stay! Cafe staff are super nice too :) 
41288	1815472	9.0	8.0	26536137	"Hello,
We were greeted by the bartender who let us leave our bags until check in time. The place was perfect for how long we stayed. It is located conveniently to downtown and the harbor. It was noisy at night but we were prepared with some ear plugs. Thanks for the stay.
Ryan and Carly Crewe"
41289	1815472	9.0	8.0	26592935	Our stay was brief but Darcy was a very accommodating host. The place was well heated for the chilly winter stay and in the heart of downtown. Hard to find a better spot for the price!
41290	1815472	9.0	8.0	27980404	"What a dynamic experience this studio added to our weekend getaway to Seattle! Location, location, location. Situated above the storied Merchants Cafe, the bar was alive with Sounders fans when we approached the swamped staff about our room. One bartender quickly (and wonderfully) stepped aside to show us our studio overlooking Pioneer Square. The city was alive. Clean, flat screen, spacious. We couldn't ask for more. Only suggestion is to have ear plugs available for guests due to the noise of patrons frequently the next door bar. 

*On the final note, my partner and I experienced something a little paranormal around 2:25A. Nothing malevolent, but surely another energy of Seattle's historic center passing by to say hello. 

Look forward to staying again!"
41291	1815472	9.0	8.0	28731425	Great location! It was only a 7 min walk from Bolt Bus and about 10-15 min walk to Pike's Place Market. Beautiful old building, definitely has character. Staff was friendly and quick to help when needed. Would stay here again. 
41292	1815472	9.0	8.0	30434542	Well-furnished and aesthetically-pleasing studio. The bar downstairs is a nice touch, and the bartender who showed us the room was quite friendly. I only stayed for a night, but this listing is comfortable enough to be more than fitting for a longer vacation.
41293	1815472	9.0	8.0	30628536	This apartment was clean and tidy with a very comfortable and warm bed. As mentioned in previous reviews there is a bar downstairs which plays loud music until around 1am but we were prepared for this. The Internet was practically non existent, this had also been mentioned previously in other reviews but unfortunately was very accurate. The location was central to everything but somewhat on the sketchy side. There was a washer and dryer in the room which was a bonus however the washer door handle was broken and made for very difficult opening and closing. All in all the space was plenty big enough for us and I would recommend it to other travelers.
41294	1815472	9.0	8.0	33477045	This was a nice stay I love the easy access to downtown and Century link I was bummed out on the WiFi It could have been my computer but I couldnt connect and I tried for quite a while. Not sure what the deal was there but all in all it was great I will come back.
41295	1815472	9.0	8.0	33689938	The location is good, one block from the rail station to the airport. Close to nice bars and restaurants. It is a very cozy bedroom with kitchen. 
41296	1815472	9.0	8.0	34464830	My wife and I had a late flight into Seattle and Darcy was more than accommodating. She was quick to respond to any questions we had and everyone at the cafe was very helpful. The space was comfortable and had tons of character and was a close walk to everything. When back in Seattle, we will definitely stay again!
41297	1815472	9.0	8.0	36098900	"The apartment was in a good location, so we could walk everywhere. It was cozy and we enjoyed our 2 nights there! 

The wifi didn't really work properly, it kept going off and on (mostly off). And also we would have liked to use the washing machine, but the door handle was broken so we couldn't open it.

All in all, this was a good experience for our short stay in Seattle."
41298	1815472	9.0	8.0	40247323	This is a nice little place in a busy part of town- lots of tourists and homeless people. I stayed on a Tuesday and it was still loud on the street late at night. If you are a light sleeper, it might not be the place for you. I would recommend parking your car at the 1st and Cherry garage. 
41299	1815472	9.0	8.0	42167202	Darcy is amazing - I was so appreciative of her super quick response rate! And also her customer service was great. On arrival, because of the hot weather, there were a few flies in the room; she got the bar to send over bug spray right away and I was thankful it all happened really quickly. The apartment is in a great location, it was clean and it was a comfy bed! I didn't experience any of the loud noise mentioned in the other reviews, but I stayed on a Monday night. The apt does get hot and there are fans, but that can get quite loud. The dryer was also on when I arrived and seemed to go on forever, so every now and again, there was noise from there throughout the night. Overall, for the location, it's good - I could take walks to Space Needle and to Pike Place Market, really easily. It's also only a 5-10 minute walk from Seattle amtrak station. Good for if you're on a flying visit for a night or two. 
41300	1815472	9.0	8.0	43979990	I had a nice time staying at Darby's place. It was clean, tidy and within a convenient distance to places in downtown Seattle. Previous comments on the choppy wi-fi and the loud music downstairs are true, but they didn't affect our stay at all. 
41301	1815472	9.0	8.0	46284579	"My female friend and I enjoyed our stay for one night in Seattle here. The apartment 203 was cozy and so cute and true to the photos. Just a reminder there is no elevator so if youre a heavy packer be ready for some lifting ;) The bed was so comfy and we got a chance to do a load of laundry in the washer/dryer. Overall a nice comfy spot for the last night of a long trip. 

We sat and people watched from the window for awhile. There's a small square in view and we saw several groups from the underground tour walk by to see the oldest restaurant in Seattle. 

I would say the only con was finding a place to park our rental car. We ended up paying $28 for the Butler parking garage very close to the apartment. Which worked out just fine, we just weren't accustomed to city parking! We made sure to not leave any items in our car and had no troubles to report. 
 
The bartenders of Merchants, Hannah and Justin, were extremely helpful in checking in and answering any questions we had. We did not go out for drinks when we stayed here because we didn't want to walk home through the surrounding area alone. We did however have a drink at Merchants and had a nice time."
41302	1815472	9.0	8.0	46386054	I only had the pleasure of staying in this adorable apartment for one night---I wish that I could have stayed longer.  The apartment was clean and exactly as pictures on the website.  It's located in a great location for touring Seattle, many great restaurants, and very close to the ferries and Pike's Market.  I could continue raving about the apartment, but what I really want to rave about is the host, Darcy.  On my flight to Seattle for Atlanta, I injured my knee.  When I arrived at the apartment, I was in great pain.  Darcy quickly found an urgent care center that took my insurance, physically drove me to the center, came back to pick me up (after a 4-hour ordeal), and then had dinner with me in the cafe that she owns below the apartment (great food and drinks, by the way).  She was a Godsend.   I can't thank her enough for all of the help that she provided me, as I was traveling by myself.  I highly recommend staying in this adorable apartment.  Darcy is the kind of host that makes Airbnb the great entity that it is.  
41303	1815472	9.0	8.0	46691445	Location was excellent and and easy trip back to the airport.  The check in process was also great because of the ability to leave bags with the Merchant (bar downstairs - also the oldest bar in Seattle!)  The room was very cozy and clean. 
41304	1815472	9.0	8.0	48439839	Darcy was a great host and the place was very central. It was the perfect little spot to stay.
41305	1815472	9.0	8.0	48570115	"This is such a cute place in a cool, historical building. It was perfect for our one night stay for a concert in the neighborhood.

We loved having the Merchant Cafe below the apartment to grab drinks. Everyone that we met that works there was really nice and fun.

We would love to stay here again."
41306	1815472	9.0	8.0	48894116	Loved the apartment! Such a cool vibe and had an amazing location. I was able to walk anywhere I wanted. Was a little noisy at night but can't do much about that when you are in the middle of Downtown.
41307	1815472	9.0	8.0	49111753	Apartment was as described. The staff were fantastic and stored our bags for us when we arrived early.
41308	1815472	9.0	8.0	49930683	"The Host Darcy called me a couple of days before my arrival. She conveniently accommodated an additional request I had at the last min and made sure it worked out for me. 
Nice cozy Apt. Centrally located. Uber/Taxi cost $5 to downtown so perfect for staying extremely close to Seattle downtown.... without the outrageous downtown hotel prices.
Would definitely recommend!
"
41309	1815472	9.0	8.0	50292078	"Darcy's place is located in a historic building and the room has exposed brick walls, making it very charming. The view from the window is Pioneer Square. The location is excellent, only 3 min walk from the airport light rail. 

As Darcy also owns the bar downstairs checking in is super easy. 

The flat has a full kitchen that we did not use but will be useful for longer stays. We only stayed a night. "
41310	1815472	9.0	8.0	50647921	Darcy was great at responding to our texts very promptly.  She has an arrangement that you can leave your bags in The Merchant Cafe below and you can also collect your key from there too. The apartment was ideal.  We were only there a night, but it was comfortable and well equipped.  The neighbourhood was the only thing that we found a little off putting, as there were a lot of people begging in the area.  The apartment is in a good position for walking to Pike Market, Pioneer Sq. and the Amtrak station.
41311	1815472	9.0	8.0	50747212	What a wonderful cozy place to stay and right in the middle of everything! Check in and out was quick and easy. The place was clean and exactly as listed. There is a fairly wicked pair of stairs to get up to the apartment tho for those who may have difficulty. They allowed me to store my bike indoors (up the stairs) as well which was a huge bonus. Very clean! 
41312	1815472	9.0	8.0	51018891	The staff down at Merchants Cafe on the ground floor made us feel extremely welcomed for our stay. They were very friendly and accessible if we needed something like ice, water or directions. The listing was exactly as described, very chic and homey as expected with plenty amenities as listed. The neighborhood (Pioneer Square) was very picturesque, right in the middle of what seemed to be a very historical area of Seattle and it was so close to many sight-seeing spots we wanted to visit. There was quite a few homeless people lingering in the area, and it was a little loud for us on Friday night because of the nearby bars, but it wasn't an issue too big of an issue for us at all. It was a little eerie when we found out the building was slightly spooky, but it was super thrilling for us since we visited just weeks before Halloween!
41313	1815472	9.0	8.0	51307132	Overall it was a good experience staying at the Studio Apartment. We paid a lot to park across the street, but that seems to be typical for Seattle. There were two different football games going on the weekend that we went, so it was pretty crazy in the Pioneer Square area. Saturday night was very loud and difficult to sleep. It was nice to be in the middle of everything and walking distance to Pikes Place, and many other sites, but I think I would have preferred to be in a different part of town. 
41314	1815472	9.0	8.0	51706361	This was such a quaint place to stay. Everyone from Merchants cafe was helpful and friendly. Easy access to some of the most popular sites to see and a short walk to all forms of public transportation. I would highly recommend staying here if your passing through Seattle. We loved it:)
41315	1815472	9.0	8.0	52225543	loved the neighbour, absolutely central to everything you would want to see and do in Seattle. all the staff connected to the place were friendly - from the cleaners to the key holder. Also I forgot something at the apartment and they were quick to locate it and mail it back to me. So grateful for that! totally recommend!
41316	1815472	9.0	8.0	52512432	Darcy's Seattle studio was beautiful, cozy and tidy... not to mention perfectly centrally-located right by 1st Ave in downtown Seattle. We discovered the best parts of the city within a 10 minute walk from the apartment. Check-in and check-out was easy with help from the cafe downstairs (the oldest restaurant in Seattle!). All in all it was a wonderful stay.
41317	1815472	9.0	8.0	52666505	Great experience. Super easy quick check in and check out. It was great being at the heart of Seattle.
41318	1815472	9.0	8.0	52991389	We arrived in Seattle right a sports game was starting. Great to see the energy on the streets but parking was impossible as the stadiums are closeby.  We ended up parking in a gated garage across the street which was expensive, but worth it for the overall peace of mind. Getting into the room was a piece of cake. We grabbed the key from the Bar below amd that was it! Very cool, cozy room with an awesome window for people watching.  Definitely a large homeless population just around the corner, but after living in Philly for 6 years I felt right at home. Everyone was friendly.  Was very cool stayinabove the oldest bar in Seattle, definitely felt the history. Was a great little cap to an awesome west coast RT. 1 roadtrip.
41319	1815472	9.0	8.0	53588368	Darcy was so sweet and accommodating. Her place is very charming, and full of history.
41320	1815472	9.0	8.0	53671070	I will absolutely be coming back. The bar downstairs is a great place to hang out before turning in for the night. The studio was a bit noisy but it had a great feel to it!
41321	1815472	9.0	8.0	53700795	Great space in a continent location. Clean and comfortable accommodations. Darcy was great with communication and even arrange parking for us. Would stay again. 
41322	1815472	9.0	8.0	53772178	Check-in was super easy. We picked up (email hidden) downstairs from a very friendly and helpful bartender who showed us to our room. The room was as pictured-cute and cozy with exposed brick and a nice kitchenette. We were a ten minute walk away from the WaMu Center, where we were heading to see a show. The neighborhood is awesome, and so close to many bars and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again.
41323	1815472	9.0	8.0	54132111	Darcy's place was wonderful and the staff down at the Merchant provided wonderful service. Right in the heart of the action, great for a short weekend stay. (The club downstairs may be a little loud for some!)
41324	1815472	9.0	8.0	55039164	"Darcy is an experienced and thoughtful host.  The apartment is clean, convenient, and comfortable. The original charm of the 100+ year old building has been preserved. Rooms are decorated tastefully, to accentuate the brick walls and character of Pioneer Square. The apartment was unobtrusively stocked with all the essentials for a several day stay.

I would recommend this place to anyone who'd like to see real, historic downtown Seattle. It is located on the corner of 1st Ave, right by the piers and the bars. 

We were able to easily find on-street parking ($3 / hour during the day, free at night until 8am, free on holidays). There is also a parking place across the street.

The Seattle Art Museum and all the restaurants and small shops are within walking distance. 

The waterfront was a couple of blocks down the hill, and I could go on runs to see the sunrise and seagulls every morning. The wi-fi was good.

As an added bonus, Darcy quietly upgraded our room to the largest one (#203) before we checked in."
41325	1815472	9.0	8.0	55169226	Great location everything is walking distance! Easy check in and check out! As advertised it get loud on the weekend. I did enjoyed staying there though I'll definitely recommend this place! 
41326	1815472	9.0	8.0	55815273	Great place! Very convenient location and easy checkin. So helpful being able to leave bags downstairs after checkout. Also fun downstairs bar with a discount because you're staying upstairs. Highly recommended!
41329	1484651	9.0	8.0	8557456	The Little Red Day Spa is a unique and very special place. After having our own wonderful experiences here, we sent our friends on their wedding night. They were so overwhelmingly happy for the experience. This place is amazing!!! It's the best place in Seattle for couples and friends to relax in hot tubs, paint each other with mud body paints, and play in this incredible adult oasis. We feel lucky to have access to this place and will be back for more! Thank you Jeff for being such a great host!! :-)
41330	1484651	9.0	8.0	14807942	Great place for a couple's getaway! Bed could be more comfortable though
41331	1484651	9.0	8.0	15082175	The Little Red Day Spa was one of the most amazing airbnb places I've ever stayed...  Jeff was super welcoming, and helpful (I arrived late, nearly 11pm at night, and he still let me check in). There were lovely chocolates waiting for us by the bed and the entire place felt like a zen retreat. I would definitely stay again.
41332	1484651	9.0	8.0	15284811	"Even though I was unable to stay with Jeff, he and Mary were a pleasure to deal with and very quick to respond to any questions or concerns I had.
I hope to be able to stay at the Little Red Day Spa on my next trip to Seattle."
41333	1484651	9.0	8.0	15722814	Comfortable, great location, room has a full-sized hot tub and a great shower, very spacious, totally private. Cool and funky atmosphere. It was very warm in the room at night, which I didn't mind (I liked it) but people who like to sleep in a cold space might have a problem. A little noise off in the distance on Saturday night from a late night party bothered me, but I'm a light sleeper--my son slept with no problems. Over all a great place, and very accommodating people.
41334	1484651	9.0	8.0	15782269	The Grand Suite at the Little Red Day Spa is a sensual, warm, and elegant room for a romantic night. The decorations are in deep colors with heavy curtains on the windows, creating an amorously subdued setting. I love host Jeff's paintings on the walls. There are two hot tubs, a freestanding bed, comfy couch, two shower heads (one into the tub!), a table for eating, and a private bathroom. Amber and Jeff warmly greeted us (check in after the spa closes around 7 pm and check out before it opens at 10 am.) and showed us around, then left us to our privacy.  Once we closed the heavy red curtain over the door we were in our own private sanctuary. The complimentary bottle of wine and mellow music were nice touches. The whole atmosphere is one of fun and sensuality. 
41335	1484651	9.0	8.0	16153794	My husband and I enjoyed our stay here very much. This is a very unique, very romantic place to stay at. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by how big the space is. Then we were thrown another surprise with complementary wine and some yummy little snacks. The art (all by Jeff) was so fun to look at, and it definitely prompted some interesting discussions. We wanted to try everything the space offered, and you have to! The hot tubs, massage tables, aromatherapy, salt scrub, etc. It was the perfect little getaway for us. In addition, as a nursing mom, they were so accommodating of my needs. They let me store my pumped milk in their freezer, which allowed me and my husband to enjoy Seattle without worry. Thank you for that! My only complaint was the sofa bed. They were trying it out with us, but it was so uncomfortable it was difficult to sleep. Since it is a business during the day, they do need a bed that they can easily stow away after the night. I'm interested in other creative ways they will deal with this. We would definitely recommend the Little Red Day Spa though. It's cheaper than a Seattle hotel but it offers so much more! 
41336	1484651	9.0	8.0	16501344	It was the first time I ever booked a house via AirBnB. Wow! What an exceptional place. The spacious room has two whirl pools. Jeff is a painter and some of his pictures enrich this wonderful and clean temple of living. I highly recommend to stay at this house that has very friendly hosts. Peter
41337	1484651	9.0	8.0	16683668	I definitely recommend this place if your looking for a relaxing atmosphere. We had a late flight and checked in late after 11pm and someone was still there to greet us! She was very informative showed us around everything was great! It was warm because of the hot tubs but it still was a great place to stay! 
41338	1484651	9.0	8.0	17192453	"""Divinely appointed with just a hint of wild decadence."" That is how I would describe the Room at the Little Red Day Spa. I stayed only one night as I was in Seattle for a 1-day meeting and it was the perfect place to relax, unwind and feel pampered. Spa Owner Mary confirmed my stay on short notice and had the room prepped for my arrival. It was gorgeous; like a set of the Paris Opera House from Phantom of the Opera. There are two private hot tubs, a wonderful rain-shower and complimentary robes for your use (everything from kimono style to terry-cloth). It's located in an old brewery building and the lofty ceilings are two stories high so there is a wonderful spaciousness about it the photos don't convey and I didn't expect. Large-scale paintings and smaller sculptures were placed throughout the space and the beautiful fabrics (I mean, you enter the space through heavy, wine-colored, velvet curtains) really gave the suite a luxurious feel.

Mary left me a welcome note in addition to the suite's instructions. She invited me to help myself to a glass of  wine in the lobby refrigerator (delish). There is a water cooler and mini-refrigerator inside the suite (very convenient). The neighborhood was a bit industrial as one would expect, so arriving in the evening felt like the area was a little deserted. My cab driver and I had a little difficulty finding the address/entry. It's located behind and to the right of the Tully's coffee shop, in the large brick building. 

I had a great stay there and if I am in Seattle again, I hope to have the opportunity to say at the suite at the Little Red Day Spa again."
41339	1484651	9.0	8.0	17599971	Beautiful spa! Jeff made the place very cosy and he was great at communicating with us about the times we were able to come and go. We really appreciated that. We also loved the fact that the bus stops right down the street and there is plants of free parking so travelers can avoid paying expensive rates to park downtown. It can be very hot there in there, but the fans he provided were great. Great experience!
41340	1484651	9.0	8.0	17970479	Jeff and everyone at the spa were very communicative and friendly! The brief tour of the room was very helpful and we had so much fun trying the hot tubs, clay, massage table, and body paints. One of the most creative options I've ever found on Airbnb! An amazing stay that we won't forget. 
41341	1484651	9.0	8.0	18612833	"This was one of the most amazing AirBNB experiences I've ever had. The space itself is epic, super high ceilings, beautiful woodwork, design, and warm earth tones - reds, browns, dark greens. Jeff's large scale artwork adorns the walls and create and almost Helenic feeling. It feels as if you are in a healing & inspiring paradise of the senses.

Some people on AirBNB have mentioned that the room was too ""warm"" for them. The day we checked in was one of the hottest on record in Seattle and I'm pretty heat sensitive, so I had my concerns. But I didn't find the temperature to be an issue at all. There's a huge industrial door in the back and industrial fan which you can open up if you need a cool breeze. And the fans by the bed were great.

The bed itself was also super comfortable, and we had the best night's sleep we had during our whole stay in Seattle.

If you are considering this as a romantic evening with someone you love, it's going to be totally worth it. Seriously, it's epic. And the hosts are super awesome, laid back, and just great people."
41342	1484651	9.0	8.0	18817802	My partner and I had a fantastic stay at the Little Red Day Spa this past weekend.  We were only in town for one night but Mary made us feel incredibly welcome as soon as we arrived.  The room is beautiful, the bed is comfortable and the perk of taking a midnight hot tub is awesome.  The spa is close to the I-5 and a quick 15-minute (easy) bus ride from downtown Seattle, too, so it's well-located for anything you're planning to get up to.  Thank you Mary and Jeff for your fantastic hospitality! 
41343	1484651	9.0	8.0	18919407	"Definitely a fun an unique place to spend a night. Easy to get to and from by public transport; bus and/or light rail (light rail being a good choice to get to the airport if need be).  Jeff et al. were very friendly and helpful when checking in, then left me to my privacy as I enjoyed the amenities. I spent a little time just ogling the building and the decor before settling in. I found the bed and pillows to be very comfortable, and the wifi password to be hilarious!

It's probably worth noting that being an old warehouse style building (albeit beautiful) with two hot tubs and many fans, that the ambient noise level is fairly high. If you are sensitive to this, bringing your own music to plug into the (rather awesome) sound system might help. Or maybe it's just a good excuse to spend more time in the hot tub."
41344	1484651	9.0	8.0	19716367	"This was a very lovely and unique airbnb experience. We booked super last minute (day-of) and Jeff was able to accommodate us. The space is GORGEOUS with extremely high ceilings and ornate decorations. It reminded me of something out of Phantom of the Opera. One of the coolest features was the shower in the middle of the room. It feels surreal to shower in such a beautiful space. 

Since there were spa appointments during the day, we weren't able to spend a ton of time there, but this was clearly communicated with us before we made the reservation. There was also an event happening in an event space behind the spa - Jeff was kind enough to add us to the guest list so we could check it out. "
41345	1484651	9.0	8.0	31083869	The place was magical. I checked in late, but Jeff was very accommodating. I would love to come back for a romantic weekend. 
41346	1484651	9.0	8.0	34389181	My wife and I had a last minute change of plans and ended up having a staycation in town while grandma had the kiddo and man was that the best change of plans ever. This place is incredible, magical, perfect, from the hot tubs to the giant paintings and the body paint, every moment in here was good for the soul.
41347	1484651	9.0	8.0	35337461	Convenient location to downtown Seattle. Jeff, the owner, was very accommodating and helpful, attending to our needs. He makes you feel welcome and at home. Unique property, not your typical room and board, with lots of artwork and spa atmosphere. 
41348	1484651	9.0	8.0	35518360	My boyfriend and I were in town for a Mariner's game, and were looking for somewhere close to the stadium to stay. Jeff's place was in a convenient location, within walking distance, and not far off I-5. Check-in was easy, the room was clean, and access to the spa was just an added bonus!
41349	1484651	9.0	8.0	35892787	The place exceeded expectations. Jeff and his staff are very friendly and accommodating. We were on a road trip and they were extremely flexible with our arrival times. 
41350	1484651	9.0	8.0	35914543	"This was our 2nd time staying at the Little Red Day Spa and this time it was even better. They have made a larger space available to guests and the bed upstairs was lovely to sleep in. 

We were contacted and giving info on how to check in the day before we arrived and were meet at the spa by Stevie who made sure that we got the tour and had everything that we needed. 

It is a wonderful retreat in Seattle with free parking. So perfect for visiting the stadiums."
41351	1484651	9.0	8.0	36222521	Wonderful place to stay.  Jeff and Mary were available for any questions and went out of their way to make us comfortable.  My daughters were with us and have been asking to go back ever since. 
41352	1484651	9.0	8.0	36324127	The space is spacious and unique.  The host was very welcoming and accommodating.  The location was a quick Uber ride from the International district and short walk to the SoDo Link station, which made getting around town a breeze.  There's a Tully's on the same block for a breakfast.  Next time, I'll make time to book a massage! 
41353	1484651	9.0	8.0	36599301	Jeff and Mary are very kind and thoughtful hosts, and they worked very hard to make sure our stay was comfortable. The hostess who checked us in did everything she could to mitigate the fact that we arrived in the midst of an unprecedented heatwave and brought us every fan in the building! We also really appreciated how helpful and flexible they were when there was an initial mishap with our booking dates. The space was clean and comfortable, despite the heat. I particularly liked that the space could accommodate several adults with multiple beds, and had several bathrooms with luxurious bathing options. 
41354	1484651	9.0	8.0	37879505	Our family of four enjoyed our stay at the Little Red Day Spa very much!  We were able to get out and explore Seattle during the day, using public transportation easily.  At night, we refreshed ourselves with a hot tub or a bath and explored Jeff's beautiful artwork.  We are early risers which was probably just fine since the weekday traffic noise did build up quickly.  Mary was very responsive to our questions, and made sure that we had everything we needed.  
41355	1484651	9.0	8.0	38296469	This place is great for anyone who wants to take advantage of a relaxing nights stay.  The listing had great amenities, the check in was very easy, and Jeff was very communicative to all my concerns.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a tranquil retreat. 
41356	1484651	9.0	8.0	38597119	Super great place! Staff was amazingly sweet and helpful! The space is unique and the artist is very talented. Lots of perks with hot tub and sauna use!
41357	1484651	9.0	8.0	39089772	What an incredible discovery! The accommodation was fantastic, the facilities were sublime, and whole experience was a pleasure. Thank you for making this wonderful place available to guests - what a treat!
41358	1484651	9.0	8.0	39229778	We checked in Sunday and were greeted by one of the workers at the spa.  Never met Mary or Jeff.  Although she was friendly, the young woman was not able to provide info on things such as how to get around or places to eat.  The area is pretty isolated it seems as it is in an industrial area. I suggest that maybe a guest book with bus or metrolink info as well as places to eat nearby be provided for guests.  On to the accommodations.  Being that so many people gave such high ratings, my expectations were high.  I hate to say it but I was disappointed. The place is unbearably HOT!!. Might be a good thing in winter but our stay was in summer.  Had to sleep with the fan blowing in my face all night to be remotely comfortable.  Especially upstairs where the beds are. The room is interesting but is in need of some updating.  One bed is just a mattress on the floor and the other has an extremely soft mattress.  Our heavy material at the windows fell at some point since they were not really drapes but just clipped up at the window.  This place has potential but needs some attention to detail.  Having access to an iron to take the wrinkles out of our clothes once we unpacked would have been nice.  On the good note, bathrooms are very nice and having the body scrubs were a nice touch.  Mary was also very accommodating in allowing up to stay way past check out since we had a late flight and the spa is closed on Monday. And it is nice to have the place to yourself. But overall I found the place to be very dark and in need of more attention.  Wish I could give a better review but have to be honest. 
41359	1484651	9.0	8.0	39587806	What an amazing place!  I had a last minute meeting in Seattle and needed a place to crash.  Within minutes of requesting a reservation, i was emailed by the host.  They were able to accommodate me and were extremely friendly on the emails.  The place is honestly AMAZING!  
41360	1484651	9.0	8.0	39684536	"When arriving at the Little Red Day Spa, it takes just a second to adjust to the fact that there is no receptionist desk, or the standard spa feel with product line plastering the walls and sale signs on everything from candles to lotions.  Instead, you walk into the door of a charming historic building with renovation touches that compliment the tradition within.  One can not help but immediate notice the 20 foot tall paintings, the old hardwood floors from yesteryear, and of course this is your impression just in the blink of an eye.

The Moroccan room is the room that is offered for couples (or a party of 4) which is up on the third floor. The iron staircase you climb to the top is adorned with lighting both ambient and whimsical and more paintings and wall murals adorn your trip to the top.  Once into the long rectangular room, one notices that this is going to be unlike any stay one has every had before.  The lighting is most certainly inspired by a Moroccan theme and the wood furniture, all help reinforce the theme. The room has a bohemian sparseness about it that makes one instantly feel comfortable.

While we didn't use the cable tv, or the Amazon Prime movies that were offered, we did enjoy having the run of the place after the staff left. The hot tub in the Art room was wonderful and all the little touches that were left around for our use were kindly used. Scented Sea Salt rubs for the skin helped remove the clay mud applications that we placed on each other and the giant rainfall shower helped cleaned us off.

The best thing about the Little Red Day Spa is its promising potential. While already getting a solid 5 stars from us, this unique venue has so many blank walls for the host to adorn with his paintings or murals that I am eager to return again in a year and see how much greater an already great thing can be!"
41361	1484651	9.0	8.0	39958903	Though somewhat tucked away in an industrial area, based out of a section of the old Ranier Brewery, the Little Red Day Spa offers amazing space, soaring ceilings on the main floor, to the large bedroom loft on the third floor, rich fabrics and soft lighting... Mary, the General Manager of the day spa, Stevie, and staff were friendly and helpful, and ensured we had a comfortable stay. For a unique Airbnb experience, the Little Red Day Spa is a must see.
41362	1484651	9.0	8.0	40532262	"It was great, they actually have a team of people around working on various aspects of customer service. When you show up at the front door though, they are 100% focused on you. I had phenomenal communication from this team of people. 

Pretty much everything people are saying about the unique charming character of the place and the artwork and amenities are spot on. I won't restate them. "
41363	1484651	9.0	8.0	40696451	What a great find in the Seattle area - way better than staying at an overpriced hotel! Booking was a breeze, I mainly communicated with Mary the spa/reservation manager who made sure there was someone there to greet us and make sure we had everything we needed to get settled in. The rooms were clean, spacious and beds comfy. We also made full use of the spa facilities (mud, salt scrubs, etc...) and hot tubs, which were a treat after a long day of shopping. One little thing I would caution on is that the rain shower downstairs beside the hot tub can get a bit slippery especially if you've followed instructions and showered with soap before getting into the tub. So to avoid a tumble like I did either bring flip flops (highly recommended) or tread carefully if you decide to take a rinse after soaking in the tub. Otherwise a great stay and would definitely return! 
41364	1484651	9.0	8.0	41176028	"The little red day spa was truly a treat and place I would love to return to. We started our arrival off by first visiting the winery next door and enjoying a lovely tasting. We then checked in and were shown to our room. We chose to stay on the second floor suite with the master bathroom. Both suites were beautiful, but the third floor suite is much much bigger in real life then it shows in the picture. I thought it was only the floor bed when I looked online so we booked the 2nd floor suite. Doing it again, we would probably choose the 3rd floor suite-not to take away from the room we stayed in, which was absolutely beautiful as well. 
My husband and I enjoyed the spa to the fullest. I was expecting a small space with a hot tub and maybe a couple of massage tables but we were blown away. 
Upon our arrival there was music playing, candles lit and the hot tub ready (with the perfect temperature for summer). A beautiful grand space with body scrub and mud mask were out for us to enjoy. We left feeling totally relaxed, reconnected and completely pampered. 
I couldn't recommend this place enough. Jeff's artistry really shows in every corner of the little red day spa. "
41365	1484651	9.0	8.0	41568402	"The suite at the Little Red Day spa is excellent and great value for money. The hot tub in the lobby was a great amenity and my wife enjoyed the complementary mud pack. I didn't get to try the sauna on this trip. 

Highly recommend this to anyone looking to unwind after a long day of checking out all that Seattle has to offer. "
41366	1484651	9.0	8.0	42437807	Had a good stay. The use of the spa during the evening was a nice perk! The location was convenient for getting to the metro to head downtown or to the stadiums. Please note that when staying in the room on the third floor, if there is someone in the suite on the second floor, you will be required to use the communal bathroom on the first floor. 
41367	1484651	9.0	8.0	42630478	Host's were very welcoming and flexible with arrival times. The spa was clean, nice, and has a very relaxing feel to it ( go figure! ). A little warm on the 3rd level when we arrived, but with the fans provided in the room we were able to sleep well. Would definitely stay again.
41368	1484651	9.0	8.0	42669297	It was a great experience. Such a nice hot tub. Convient to the metro link. Inside the old Ranier brewery!
41369	1484651	9.0	8.0	42860045	We had a great time and the whole process of checking in and out was very easy.  Loved the accomidations and the people there were very friendly and quite helpful. 
41370	1484651	9.0	8.0	43705928	The hosts were attentive and welcoming.  They let us drop our bags off early which was much appreciated.  However, when we returned to our room for the evening our experience was not so great.  Someone walked in to our private bathroom while it was in use.  The inner door to the bathroom was closed but we did not see an outer door to the hallway and another guest walked in.  This was partially our mistake but we feel that the owners should make it clear that the bedroom/bathroom on the second floor are private.   There was also loud drumming coming from one of the other buildings in the complex.   The location is not a residential area so the drumming may have come from another business.  We contacted the owner and both issues were addressed but the experience was unsettling. The bathroom was beautiful but the bedroom was dark and did not have windows.  The bedroom was long and had a bed and a massage table so I assume it is used during the day for massage.  The mattress on the bed was nice but we both had trouble sleeping  because the room was quite warm and stuffy.  There was a small fan and we left the bathroom door open to allow for air from the bathroom window but it was still uncomfortable.  This location may be a good option for some because it is reasonably priced and the owners were helpful but we did not have a great experience.   
41371	1484651	9.0	8.0	44059161	Very comfortable, nice big space. 
41372	1484651	9.0	8.0	44209658	"My husband and I were very excited to stay here for our anniversary. A few words of advice for people booking here, however. 

Call ahead and schedule your check-in time. We didn't do this and we weren't able to check-in until about 4.30. We called a number of times earlier in the day but Mary was in session with clients and couldn't pick up the phone. We hung out at Bartholomew wine next door which is awesome. 

Secondly, before you make your reservation, get clear information on the use of the hot tub, sauna and other communal areas. Again, we were excited to arrive in the afternoon and have time to use the sauna and hot tub before heading out for the night. We were able to use the sauna which was great but the staff seemed a bit annoyed about turning it on and giving us access to the room. We were really sad when we found out that clients were using the room with the hot tub and we wouldn't have access until 10pm. 10pm became 11pm and we had an early flight in the morning - just a bit disappointed. 

We stayed in the Sky Suite which is spacious and the bathroom is great and was very clean. The bed is essentially a mattress on the floor and that was fine, but there are no windows in that bedroom. Also, the door to this bedroom does not lock - that always makes me nervous given that other guests are wandering around the spa at all times. 

While the downstairs was a bit dark and dim, this didn't bother us too much because we checked in so late in the day.

We didn't have too much interaction with the staff and while everything was fairly explained to us, we were just disappointed overall, especially at $224 a night. We were excited to celebrate our anniversary and had mentioned this to Jeff ahead of time. We had read other reviews of wine and the like being provided but I think given how busy the spa was that day, we were a bit of an afterthought. 

Overall, very cool venue, I would just be sure you can check in early and if you do, that you can actually use some of the services in the Spa. "
41373	1484651	9.0	8.0	46142237	The Little Red Day Spa is an absolute gem in the midst of an industrial part of the city. My brother and I stayed here for labor day weekend and were able to check in a little early and leave whenever it was convenient for us on the day of check out. The whole checking in and out process was thoroughly easy. Jeff and Mary are absolutely accommodating and kept us informed of what is to be expected (with their spa clients, hours of operation, etc). We were able to use the spa facility which was very nice. We felt as if we stayed in our own home. This is most definitely, a recommended spot! 
41374	1484651	9.0	8.0	46839846	Amazing place and great price for what you get!
41375	1484651	9.0	8.0	48362962	Was so great staying here! The room was great and use of the spa was a huge bonus. 
41376	1484651	9.0	8.0	48916509	My friends and I had a wonderful experience staying in the Moroccan suite at the spa! The location is convenient to downtown, the room is huge and fit three women and all our stuff easily, and everyone working at the spa is so welcoming. They have bottles of wine for purchase (only $10) and it was delicious. We weren't at the spa much, since we were out exploring both days we were in Seattle, but every time we came back it was so peaceful and relaxing to be there. We especially loved the little fireplace and cashews on the mantle in the lobby!
41377	1484651	9.0	8.0	53306950	"We were in late at night and out early in the mornings, so unfortunately we didn't get a chance to interact with the hosts in person, but they were very responsive and helpful by text message.  The room was great - two comfortable beds, tastefully decorated, and all the amenities you would hope for.   

The downstairs areas were absolutely incredible and are the main reason I would highly recommend staying here.  The hot tub and shower room is enormous (20ft+ ceilings), beautifully lit, and filled with amazing paintings.   Showering in that room in the morning was the best way to wake up."
41411	3544964	10.0	8.0	16325702	Chris is a wonderful host! From the moment I arrived she made me feel right at home. The location is just a short walk to the Link railway that takes you right into downtown in about 20 to 25 mins, so for me it was perfect. Chris is so chatty and was very considerate to my needs, and I loved wondering around her garden! The room was very comfortable and cheery and was a pleasure to come back to in the evening after a long day of walking around the city. I left here feeling like i was leaving a friend. I would definitely consider staying here again.
41412	3544964	10.0	8.0	16376449	Cris was a fantastic host and honestly, could not have been any more helpful.  She was very welcoming and kind, and was extremely responsive and attentive to all of my questions and needs both before and during my stay.  The room and bed were also very comfortable and I got a great night's sleep.  Highly recommend her and the place and would gladly return!
41413	3544964	10.0	8.0	16759369	Good stay. Hospitable people and a clean house/room. Only negatives were that the bed was a little firm for my liking and that the neighborhood was confusing during the evening. 
41414	3544964	10.0	8.0	17015661	Cris's place was nice! The neighborhood wasn't amazing but it wasn't that bad either. It was a pretty short walk to the light rail and bus. Her dog was also really sweet!
41415	3544964	10.0	8.0	17320816	It was great to stay at Cris house. The location of the house is just 10 minuets walking to the Light Rail. The room was clean and neat. Cris is a great host and helped me to know the restaurants nearby and how to go to downtown. Thanks Cris!
41416	3544964	10.0	8.0	18901026	"I put my family members up (a couple in their 50s) up with Cris and her husband, and right of the bat, they all had a great connection. Drinks and food in the kitchen came complimentary with the room and the guests could enjoy a guest bathroom.

They still keep talking about the way in which staying with Cris made their trip so much better. Thank you for that!


For people looking to book: right between Othello and Columbia City light rail stations. # 8 bus runs right by.  It is not in the heart of the city, but conveniently located and easy to reach by public transportation.

Clear recommendation if being very close to downtown is not a high priority for you.

"
41417	3544964	10.0	8.0	20210879	"Cris is a great host who is doing a very professional job. The house is clean, organized and amenities have easy access. Cris and husband share the common areas with guests, but it's fine since they are friendly. I'd recommend this place for a short or extended stay.

41418	3544964	10.0	8.0	21013523	"Cris and her husband were warm and friendly hosts. The room was as described and the minor issue with the TV channels were fixed before I returned from work by Dan (the manager) the next day. 

I'm glad I had a car, as the hill to get to the buses and/or light rail would have been a challenge. Cris watched a Seahawks game with me on the big TV in the living room, and though she didn't know a lot about the game, her enthusiasm for the Hawks to win was adorable. 

I was not aware that there are dogs living in the house (one belonging to the host and another with a guest), and would have liked to have known that prior to booking. 

Overall, it was a welcome respite during this time of transition in my life, and I hope to see Cris and her husband again in the future to thank them for their hospitality and kindness. "
41419	3544964	10.0	8.0	34261960	"Cris was great at responding to my late request to stay. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable and Cris was a terrific host. I was even given a lift from the light rail stop nearby so my rather tired, jet lagged body didn't have to cope with the walk. 
My main reason for the trip to Seattle was to visit the Boeing museum and while this was a great spot to stay for that purpose, the convenience of the light rail made getting into downtown really simple too. I would be happy to stay again if I return to Seattle."
41420	3544964	10.0	8.0	34812563	Cris was the ideal hostess. Room was perfect. In fact the entire home and yard were fabulous. Super clean. Quiet. Her little dog fell in love with me cause I gave her popcorn. She was so generous. Coffee YUM! Parking was good. Neighborhood was safe. I would definitely stay here again. Their air conditioning was not good so if it is going to be hot in Seattle rethink your stay.
41421	3544964	10.0	8.0	36902290	"I had a great experience staying here! I stayed for about a week and half when I first moved to Seattle for a new job. I was pretty blown out from the move and new job and it was wonderful to have such a welcoming and quiet home to come back to! Cris is extremely kind and a very welcoming host. They really have set up their home to make their guests feel as comfortable as possible, even if that just means giving them space. Cris gave me a tour right away and worked to make sure I felt at home. I would definitely stay here again!

        HIGHLIGHTS:
• The shared bathroom was very clean and right next to the room.
• They have coffee, croissants, and fruit available for you every day!
• She gave me fridge space and I was able to cook when I needed to.
• I was able to do laundry and the washer and dryer are new.
• You get your own room key and the house code when you arrive.
• There is filtered water in the kitchen.
• The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and exactly as shown (but with new comforter and sheets).
• There was always plenty of parking and easy Light Rail access.
• I was in Seattle during a heat wave and there is no AC in the house, but there was already a fan in the room and Cris brought me an extra one and checked in just to make sure I was comfortable!
• Cris has a little dog who is very sweet and quite smart. She might bark a bit when you first arrive but not in an excessive way and is very well behaved. I loved having her around!
• I think smoking is allowed on the porch and outside. So you might smell it a touch but I have asthma (and am quite sensitive) and it never bothered me once. Cris and guests are very considerate."
41422	3544964	10.0	8.0	37244550	Staying with Cris and her husband was very nice, they were very welcoming and the room was nice. They also gave us nice advice on what to do in Seattle. The room doesn't have any aircondition though, so it was a bit hot. Buy a very nice stay and I would definetely recommend staying there!
41423	3544964	10.0	8.0	37515613	"The room was great!  The room was very pleasant and the entire house (room, kitchen, bathroom, etc) was clean and neat.  Cris is extremely welcoming, helpful and has a very wonderful energy about her.  The train is an easy ten minute walk away, which takes you directly downtown.  Good location.
I was a really warm weekend to visit (mid 90s), however there were two fans provided and kept us quite cool through the night.
Would recommend staying with Cris!!

"
41425	3544964	10.0	8.0	42544881	"The room was fine, it's called sunset because the sun hits the window at sunset :D 

Cris is a great host, there are some included extras (like free coffee) that should be an example to other Airbnb's; also Cris is well organized and she will assign you an allocated space in the bathroom for your personal things and in the fridge or freezer.

I loved her dog Jening, it's lovely and well trained. 

Location is 10 minutes walking to the link station and 5 min to bus 36. If you are going to downtown at morning, its worth those extra 5 to catch the link and avoid traffic. Safeway is next to the station as well.

Nice place, nice host, just exactly what I expected :D"
41426	3544964	10.0	8.0	42763381	Cris is a warm-hearted and charming lady. Her house is tidy and cozy, and her dog jennie is so cute! Apart from her house, the neighborhood is also quite, safe and clean. I thank her for holding us and truely mading us feel like home.  
41427	3544964	10.0	8.0	42914669	"Chris and her husband, Raul, were awesome hosts! They were friendly and made us feel at home. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable; exactly like the photos. 
The location was a short walk to the train, which made it easy to get around. Great experience!! "
41428	3544964	10.0	8.0	43136618	We had a great experience here and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area. The room and house were very welcoming and clean. 
41429	3544964	10.0	8.0	43710602	This place has been the most successful place ever since I started airbnb. Cris and her husband were so nice and friendly, and the room was perfect with tourist books and a map of neighborhood including markets and restaurants. They kindly answered whatever questions we asked. The room, kitchen, and bathroom were so clean, and well organized. I highly recommend this place. 
41430	3544964	10.0	8.0	44342685	Thanks for the great place to stay Cris! Everything was as described and the location is excellent. The walk to the train terminal was sub 10 minutes for me and it was easy to find, a short and easy 2 minute drive off of I-5. Cris is an excellent host and had a great little sheet with some helpful details about your stay, and some of the restaurants within walking distance. The bed was a little firm for my taste but some people might prefer that. Thanks again for the accomodations and hospitality. 
41431	3544964	10.0	8.0	44791070	I'm a traveller and have been to so many places around the (website hidden) one week stay in Cris and Raul's house is one of the best. Their house is super neat and cozy. Every small details can tell the host takes good care of their house and truly love their home.Plus, their lovely dog Jenning always kept me company. As host, Cris and Raul are very kind and considerate. We did have a good time sitting together and sharing our happy memories. So,the stay makes me feel like living at home with caring families, not just simple B&B.Thumbs up!Highly recommended.
41432	3544964	10.0	8.0	48546318	Cris and her husband made me feel very welcome. They are extremely accommodating. My room and bathroom were very clean when I arrived. I went in and out of the house freely, and parking was not an issue. There were always yummy pastries and coffee in the kitchen that were free to all guests. Cris and her husband were kind enough to cook for me when I was home, so I felt like I was staying with family. They were also very accommodating to guests that were visiting.  There are a lot of local eateries in the neighborhood that made getting food very convenient. The drive to seattle is less than 15 minutes. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan on spending some time in seattle.
41433	3544964	10.0	8.0	49408528	Cris was great, had great conversations with her. She was flexible and helped with me checking in late. The house was in a prime location close to the freeway and public transport. The room was very comfortable and clean. Cris was a great host with a great room. 
41434	3544964	10.0	8.0	50260176	Cris was accommodating of my late arrival and early departure.  The home is nice and a great location for my early morning client.  I'd love to stay there whenever I visit.  Cris was gracious and welcoming.
41435	3544964	10.0	8.0	51993142	Very comfortable and pleasant stay. Cris is very friendly and caring. i enjoyed my stay . Thanks for hosting me.

Host is really kindly!
She is really nice!
A room is clearn.
"
41437	3544964	10.0	8.0	56817708	The room and house were a great value and everything was accurate. Bathroom was clean and all details were covered regarding entry, wifi, etc. I was only there for just enough time to sleep, but they also offer a few basic food items for breakfast/coffee which was nice. I would recommend them for a stay.
41438	3544964	10.0	8.0	57189294	We felt very much at home! The hosts were very friendly and helpful :)
41720	3951768	9.0	8.0	18852404	The Apartment was like in the description. It was clean and everything you need was there. Even the landlords weren't there it was easy to get the keys. The neighborrhood is not far from downtown and anyway quiet. I would go there again.
41721	3951768	9.0	8.0	19008306	We had really good days in Seattle. The room we had was very nice and big. Unfortunately we did not see Kelly once, but there were notes all over which explained everything we needed to know. ;-) and her roommate Sabrina :-) which helped us with every question there was. Thanks for the stay!
41722	3951768	9.0	8.0	19451303	Kelly's place was spacious and comfortable.  They were very accommodating, even though we made reservations at the last minute.  We didn't see them much as we were off and going our whole stay.
41723	3951768	9.0	8.0	19862761	Kelly was great about accepting our last minute request, getting to her place off the I-5 was effortless & it is priced decent for the proximity to downtown. There was on street parking which was a little scarce later into the night. We did not meet Kelly but Sabrina was helpful upon arrival, a few other things worth mentioning would be the noise transfer from upstairs which IMO was quite a bit I actually had a hard time sleeping & the stairs down to the basement apartment are steep & narrow which would be tough for anyone older or with disabilities.  Overall it was a good space for a quick overnight.
41724	3951768	9.0	8.0	19917740	The hosts were very welcoming and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. They explained everything very well and provided more then we could have asked for. The stairs are on the steep side and parts of the ceiling in the basement are low. We did not spend much time there but the neighborhood felt safe so we did not worry about our car. 
41725	3951768	9.0	8.0	20473650	"Great place to stay! Very private and, even though it was a shared bath, we never ran into the hosts. Only going to get better once the shower in the unit is done. 

Place was very clean and comfortable. Just a short drive to downtown and close to a few nice restaurants/bars in the Georgetown neighborhood. We spent most of our days exploring Seattle and this suited well as a place to just lay our heads comfortably. 

Although we didn't have to interact with them much, the hosts were very welcoming and kind to us. 

Highly recommend! "
41726	3951768	9.0	8.0	22512464	Kelly seemed very nice and the accommodations met my expectations, though I ended up spending much less time there than I had planned, which was totally unrelated to the room or Kelly. I would certainly recommend Kelly and her house, though.
41727	3951768	9.0	8.0	22638858	"We had a nice stay in Kelly's suite.  It was warm, clean and comfortable for a good night's sleep with our car parked right outside the window (this is a safe area).  The neighborhood is very close to downtown and easy to get to and from all areas by using 15th Ave or freeway.  What a great little spot! 
"
41728	3951768	9.0	8.0	22780583	"I did not meet Kelly but our communication was perfect email, text, cellphone.

Unit as listed the space is nice, bed was comfortable, tv service and desk with plenty of local information there, local bus to downtown seattle was easy, 30 mins, washer and dryer, no kitchen in the space but access was upstairs to the house kitchen, bathroom was private and a nice tiled shower, great hot water, towels, soap, & heat.

Nice suburban area, the house is a small older built home with low clearance in the area 6' clearance, doorway and steps leading down was narrow, i highly recommed staying if you plan to be in seattle area."
41729	3951768	9.0	8.0	23565193	Kelly was super-responsive and easy to communicate with. The basement room with separate entrance felt very private and cozy, as promised.
41730	3951768	9.0	8.0	23673551	"Listing was just as advertised! I didn't actually meet Kelly, but on short notice I had, for me, the perfect landing spot. One night just to crash, out early. Entire lower level for space an privacy. My own bath (important to me) and nice little touches (coffee, TV, internet).
Would recommend without hesitation."
41731	3951768	9.0	8.0	24164688	Great place to stay. As described. We had privacy and lots of space, our own bathroom. Will definitely book again if I need to. This was my first time staying in a place like this. Great experience, better than a hotel. Will recommend to everybody.
41732	3951768	9.0	8.0	24630236	I enjoyed my stay at Kelly's. The room was exactly as described. I was even able to leave my luggages there when I landed in Seattle. The room has the privacy one can possibly ask for and it is separate from the rest of the house. I liked the neighborhood as well.
41733	3951768	9.0	8.0	25091250	Very private experience, which was just what we wanted. Side entrance, private bathroom, and spacious room. Bed was cozy, the temperature in the room was never too cold or too got, and there was coffee and such to help ourselves to in the morning. We realized that in general, everything is fairly close and easy to get to in Seattle - but Kelly's house was 15 min. tops from anything we wanted to do. A great first AirBnb experience. :)
41734	3951768	9.0	8.0	34739453	Very clean and comfortable room. We enjoyed our stay here in Seattle.
41735	3951768	9.0	8.0	34872330	We enjoyed our stay in this basement. The proximity to I5 and Seward Park were especially useful to us. Stay at this listing if you do not plan to cook or eat at the house and have a full slate of activities to keep you occupied. We were only here to sleep and it worked out great! Thanks to our hostess for providing a clean and comfortable place to crash. 
41736	3951768	9.0	8.0	39927426	"Let me start by saying I don't want to knock Kelly or her home and I respect anyone who is willing to open their home to complete strangers. I do, however, want to ensure that I am accurate in describing our personal experience.  

The area itself was big enough but it was not completely private. Once down the narrow dark stairway, you enter a utility area which includes the furnace, hot water tank, and laundry area. None of this is shown in the pictures. We had to use the flashlight on our phone to navigate our way through the pitch black until we could find a light around the corner. There was a note that indicated the owners wouldn't come down except to do laundry. Again, this wasn't mentioned in the ad. They never actually came down but we spent the 4 nights on edge that they might appear without warning. This was especially uncomfortable as the laundry is directly next to the bathroom. 
 
 The parking situation was probably the most frustrating. There was room in front of the house for 2 cars as well as a large enough driveway. Unfortunately someone purposely parked their vehicle across both spots on the road. We also weren't permitted to park in the driveway (which remained empty for almost the entire 4 days). Because of this we were forced to park down the street in a questionable neighborhood. 

  The neighborhood itself wasn't the worst place ever but it was definitely sketchy. The first sign of this was when I almost stepped on a used condom directly in front of the house. The funny thing about a used condom is nobody is going to clean it up so it remained there for the entire 4 days. This is obviously out of Kelly's control but again I'm just being honest. Very close to the I-5 and you could get almost anywhere in Seattle within 10-20 minutes. Also, an Uber cab was only $10 to downtown. We did avoid public transit because we felt it could be a little sketchy at night. 

Kelly and her roommate were quick to respond to our texts. Other than that there was no direct interaction with either of them which was fine by us. 

On a positive note, the bed was decently comfortable, the shower was great and as mentioned, the proximity to downtown was great. Also, when you consider most hotels downtown are around $300 a night in summer, you're getting a great deal at $80.  

 "
41737	3951768	9.0	8.0	40444902	This was a nice, little, newly renovated basement room, a good base for coming back to at night. It isn't completely private as the basement isn't completely closed off, but we had no problem with anyone coming in. Be careful of the relatively steep descent into the space; it doesn't have the best lighting placement. The windows, though, are well blocked for a dark, uninterrupted sleep. It doesn't look like the greatest neighborhood at night, but is a good location to Uber in and out of the city. 
41738	3951768	9.0	8.0	40746963	Kelly was responsive over text and put us in touch with Sabrina, who helped answer questions and coordinate check-in/check-out. The room is a redone basement with full bath, a mini-fridge, desk space, internet, and a dresser (no closet). The hosts provided toilet paper, soap, and shampoo/conditioner, and the room is situated such that we never saw them at all. 
41739	3951768	9.0	8.0	41115419	We had a great experience in Seattle at Kelly's. She is a quick communicator and answered all of our questions right away. The place was just like the listing, only bigger than expected - which was great. The location is perfect. We could easily drive downtown in about 10 minutes. Would stay here again!
41740	3951768	9.0	8.0	41750752	"Cozy little basement apartment! We loved having a private entry since we were in town for a wedding and came back late most nights. It was nice to know we weren't disturbing the hosts. The bathroom is fantastic and looks newly renovated. Tip: Look in the dresser for extra towels – we didn't even notice them until the last day! 

Comfy bed and friendly, available hosts - they answered all our texts right away. Great wifi too. You may hear a little bit of the upstairs folks walking around but they were very mindful about the time and it never bothered us a bit. Great place, great price!"
41741	3951768	9.0	8.0	43290005	"Very nice studio with all the amenities and services that we needed. Contrary to what is said below, it is specified on the ""rules"" that they dont come down to the basement unless they notify it which guaranteed us a total privacy. Merci!"
41742	3951768	9.0	8.0	44661409	We had a brief but pleasant stay at Kelly's airbnb. It was clean and spacious and looked just like the pictures. We never saw Kelly as her policy is to stay out of your way but she will gladly assist you if needed (although we didn't). 
41743	3951768	9.0	8.0	45079415	Our stay in Seattle was excellent. Sabrina and Kelly's studio was perfect for us. Sabrina one of the host was extremely nice to supply us with some toiletries that we ran out of. It was much appreciated. I would definitely recommend staying here next time your in Seattle.
41744	3951768	9.0	8.0	45639672	I found myself in a situation where I arrived in a city and had not made arrangements, it was the sixth week in a row, and this has never happened.  On that day I searched and found Kelly's place, and within an hour she had me booked. I was so relieved, and once I arrived found her place very comfortable for me.  Its in the basement of their home, and between the sleeping area and the bathroom there is a laundry space, but the photos show accurately, that it is furnished perfectly for a traveler and there is a very nice kitchen area.  I was very comfortable, parking was directly in front of the house, and with a little mapping, is a nice back way to get in and out of the city. They have done a lot with lighting, to counter to other reviews.  Thanks again Kelly.
41745	3951768	9.0	8.0	45980648	"Great parking space, comfortable bed.
Books and Coupons for Seattle travel on the table.

Clean and nice bathroom and Shower booth.
"
41746	3951768	9.0	8.0	46744923	"Description Accuracy:
The description is mostly accurate, but it's important to note that its not 100% private. The room itself is the basement of their house that was remodeled to be a living area, but it is very nice inside as you can tell from the pictures. 

The pictures are a little misleading, making it appear as if you have your own area that is completely closed off, but there is actually some amount of 'shared space'. 

In front of the restroom door is a laundry room and a staircase that leads up to basement to the door you will be using to get in and out, but up the stairs is also a door leading to where they live upstairs. 

The bed area itself has a door to block the bed area and the staircase, but next to the restroom/kitchen there is an opening that leads to bedroom that has no doors. You imagine the entire area as a big U shape, with the staircase on one end, the kitchen restroom at the bottom of the U, and the bed area on the other end of the U.

Neighborhood: It's a quiet neighborhood that's very close to the 5 freeway, and getting to downtown was easy. 10 minutes with no traffic, 20 with. 

Parking: The front of the house has free street parking, but you might find yourself parking in front of someone else's house (I luckily didn't encounter this problem). The parking is just a little strip of dirt/grass in front of the sidewalk, and seemingly, everyone parks in either direction regardless of which side of the street they are on. Don't know if this is legal/illegal.

Kitchen: Kitchen has a mini-fridge, toaster oven, coffee maker, and a sink. She provides some cups and things. Sometimes, the previous guests will have food left for you in the fridge, which is nice.

Restroom: The shower is very nice and big. She provides towels and even shampoo and soap, etc. 

Bedroom: There are a couple of nightstands, nothing to fancy. One thing that was interesting was that the windows are covered with cardboard, because the curtains aren't wide enough to cover the window. This was not very appealing, but got the job done.

The bed itself is very loud. Nearly every movement will cause the bed to squeak, it can get annoying. This is really the biggest downside I had. 

Hosts:
Although the layout is not 100% private, they were very good about not using the downstairs area completely. I only saw her once the entire stay which is when I checked in. She was very responsive to my text messages and was even nice enough to allow me to leave my car parked out front past my checkout time. 

Overall, for the price you pay, the ease of parking, and proximity to downtown and West Seattle, I would stay here again and recommend it. "
41747	3951768	9.0	8.0	47492056	I never got to meet Kelly but Sabrina was very kind. She provided all the essentials including umbrella. The studio is not completely private but we never encountered any awkward situation. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place!
41748	3951768	9.0	8.0	48107021	"I was looking for a place that allowed me my own privacy because we would come back at late hours, and we didn't want to disturb the residents living there; Kelly's place was perfect!
We 'checked in' on our own wacky schedule.
The whole time I stayed there, I only received one request (via text) ahead of time, asking if it was okay for them to come down to the area I was staying in. She was also very quick to respond to any questions I had via text messages. Other than that, I was left to my own devices.
Towels, shampoo, body wash, and WiFi were provided, so I was very grateful for that.
There is even a mini kitchentte area connected, with a provided mini toaster oven and mini fridge, perfect for heating up a late dinner!
There was ample street parking when we stayed. (We were baffled that everyone parks anyone which way they wanted?)
All in all, I was very pleased with my stay at Kelly's place and would stay here again!"
41749	3951768	9.0	8.0	48551815	Kelly was a great host and the place was exactly as listed. She didn't bug us at all (although we wouldn't have minded if she did), but let us know she was there if we needed anything. The bathroom was fully stocked with anything we might need and the tons of tourist brochures helped us out a lot. The house is in a perfect location and only takes about 10-15 minutes to get downtown. 
41750	3951768	9.0	8.0	49647261	"This was a great place to stay while in Seattle.  It is quite close to downtown and SeaTac Airport (not walking distance) but close. I was there to charter fish and see some friends (not really to see the sights) so I did not need to walk out my front door and be ""downtown"".  I thought the place was perfect for what I needed.  It is a basement apartment with a side entrance with basic appointments for people who need a nice place to stay that is safe and has great freeway access.  The host Kelly was super nice and even left some basics there for our use like shower supplies and coffee and creamer.  I would recommend it as a nice, quiet, and safe place to stay."
41751	3951768	9.0	8.0	52414872	The place was easy to find and in a great location. Cozy and comfortable. Easy access to the freeway and surrounding area. It was my first trip to Seattle but won't be my last and would definitely stay here and recommend it to friends. Thank you for making it a great experience. 
41752	3951768	9.0	8.0	52768203	"Kelly was a great host. The location was exactly as described. It was safe, quiet, and located near a lot of points of interest in the Seattle area.

The place was spacious and comfortable. "
41753	3951768	9.0	8.0	53306292	"Kelly’s place is just minutes from Seattle downtown and really close to interstate I5; it is a very good location to go practically anywhere in Seattle. 

Her place is spacious and private with its own entrance. Parking is available in front of the house.

I did not meet Kelly personally however she was very prompt to any questions I had. 

Kelly was very nice to accommodate last minute request to book when I was in Seattle."
41754	3951768	9.0	8.0	54073903	This space is exactly as described- private and spacious!  The basement studio is quiet, bigger than you'd expect (plenty of room for yoga!), and has all the basics you might need.  The shower is nice and hot with good water pressure and the nice hairdryer in the space was a good surprise.  The host accommodated a late arrival.  The neighborhood was neat and seemed like a great location for exploring Seattle and surrounding areas. 
41755	3951768	9.0	8.0	55004129	The entrance to the basement looked unfinished. That was the only thing I can say was maybe something to work on since it's the first thing you see. The remainder of the basement was very well done. It had I nice, comfortable room with a little dining area and kitchenette. The bathroom was nice and especially the showet. They had nice clean towels as well as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and just about anything you could need. The kitchenette also had a little minifridge, toaster over, coffee maker and a sink. They also offered complimentary coffee, sugar, tea, coffee creamer, water, and glasses and mugs which also added to the experience. We never even met Kelly, which was nice since I've always found it a bit awkward to stay at a stranger's house. We had our own entrance and any time we had a question or request Kelly was available via text to answer our questions and concerns. Overall it was a great experience and we would stay here again. Thank you, Kelly for sharing your space.
41756	7007598	10.0	8.0	39969310	"Thank you so much Shadi for opening your home up to us. It was exactly what we were looking for! The house is beautiful with lots of places to sleep (gorgeous kitchen) and only a 10 minute drive to downtown where we always park for free behind the stadiums. Shadi, the host, was extremely helpful and answered all my many emails before and during our stay. I would love to come back next time we're in Seattle. 
Thanks again!
Janelle"
41757	7007598	10.0	8.0	40772018	Shadi's home was beautiful! The location was perfect and the price was right. This spacious house has been beautifully renovated, which made it a welcome rest stop between jaunts around the city. We even ended up staying in one night just to enjoy time around the house. Also, Georgetown is just down the street, a kitschy, fun neighborhood with plenty of awesome bars, breweries, and restaurants.
41758	7007598	10.0	8.0	41782287	"What a beautiful and spacious home! It was a treat to relax after a long day of sight-seeing. I wish my own house had such a nice kitchen and laundry room. We stayed here for a girls' weekend, and having three bathrooms for four women/girls was a nice feature when it came to getting ready each morning.

There was continual airplane traffic overhead, but that's probably common most anywhere in the Seattle area. I kind of enjoyed watching them, but if you're sensitive to noise it might be an issue. 

I especially loved sitting out in the back yard with a cup of coffee. Ahhh! Perfect! "
41759	7007598	10.0	8.0	45967045	Our stay at Shadi's home was a great experience. She was a very accommodating host dealing with plan changes and early check ins. The house was very clean and having the 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms was great. Uber is definitely a must have if staying here as there isn't much in walking distance. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone who is planning a trip to Seattle. 
41760	7007598	10.0	8.0	57585191	Shadi was wonderful.  She was very prompt in getting information to us in a timely manner in advance of our reservation.  Christmas in Portland caused our trip to be delayed by several hours so we weren't able to check in until around 9pm on Christmas day.  The house was clean and charming and well represented by the pictures we found on Airbnb.  We hadn't fully thought things out regarding food and found ourselves at the house on Christmas in the evening without any food.  We found some food in the fridge and made quesadillas from some tortillas and cheese we found in there.  I emailed Shadhi about this and she was very warm, supportive and understanding in her response.  The only minor problem that we encountered was that the TV and the internet weren't working.  I emailed Shadi about the issue and I got a prompt email back and followup call from her husband, Matt.  I ended up being able to figure out that a breaker had been tripped that had shut off all the wall outlets in the basement and hence knocked out both the internet and the tv.  Overall we had a nice experience at the house.  We were gone a lot of the time so we really only got to enjoy it in the evenings right before bed time.  But I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great rental.
41801	4163851	10.0	8.0	20535058	"Just had a great stay at Amy's home in Seattle. Location was very convenient to  I-5 and West Seattle. Amy also has all the low down on the backroads to avoid traffic which was a huge help while we were there. Her home is very close (walking distance) to Georgetown which is full of great places to eat and drink. Go to Smarty Pants and get the Troublemaker sandwich. So good! 

Amy's home is clean and comfortable and she's a very gracious host! Thank you for opening your place up. We'll be staying there again!"
41802	4163851	10.0	8.0	20718392	Amy was a very welcoming host. She made her entire house available to us. Very clean. Easy access to highway. Would stay again for sure. One of the best Airbnb places I have stayed at.
41803	4163851	10.0	8.0	21353794	We enjoyed our stay at Amy's place. It's well organized and charmingly decorated. The location is good as well, only 15minutes from downtown and 15minutes from Tacoma airport. We would recommend this place!
41804	4163851	10.0	8.0	21623959	Amy was a great host.  Her place was very clean and she had great attention to detail.  She had coffee brewing when we met her as she gave the tour of her home and she left many snacks for us to enjoy.  She had maps left out for us of Seattle which was handy.  The location was actually quite convenient allowing us to get to the airport in about 15 minutes.  Also definitely check out all city coffee, it really was amazing coffee two minutes away.
41805	4163851	10.0	8.0	25361315	Staying with Amy was really awesome and I totally recommend her place. She was more than accommodating and most certainly went above and beyond. Her place was cute, clean and just as described. She had tons of yummy snacks waiting for us and even helped me out when I locked myself out (Ooops!) I used Uber a lot to get to and from downtown Seattle and it was super convenient . I would definitely stay with her again!
41806	4163851	10.0	8.0	26657035	"Everything about Amy and her home is beautiful! 

Amy is so generous, considerate, and flexible.  She had yummy snacks for us upon arrive. She even allowed us to dig thru her pantry. She allowed us to stay past check out time with no fuss or guidelines, just a simple ""Sure. Text me when you leave"". Checking in was a breeze. Although I made the reservation, she allowed my partner to retrieve the keys. She even gave him a tour of the house to make sure he knew where everything was placed. 

The house is comfortable and homey! Onsite, private parking was a huge plus. The master bedroom on the 3rd floor is warm and gets plenty of sunlight during the day. The kitchen is stocked with pots/pans/cups/plates/utensils.  The washer and dryer is convenient since we were there for almost a week. I don't know what to say...anything you need to feel at home, Amy will have it or she'll be happy  (and generous) to provide it before you arrive.  

We had a car and was able to get to University District,  International District, Downtown, airport, waterfront in about 20mins. Quiet neighborhood and neighbors. Close to highways=super convenient. 

Highly recommend it to anybody and everybody visiting Seattle! Thank you Amy! "
41807	4163851	10.0	8.0	26922637	"Amy's condo was equivalent to a 5-star hotel! The place is gorgeous and has a lot of convenient amenities (washer, dryer, 2.5 bathrooms, free parking, and plenty of tea!).

Amy was very welcoming and hospitable. Upon our arrival, she greeted us with tea and food. She even allowed an extremely late check-out (6 PM vs. the usual 12 PM). 5/5 would definitely stay @ Amy's place again!"
41808	4163851	10.0	8.0	33644363	If you ever have the chance to stay at Amy's - take it!! The house was comfortable and homey, and she as a host made the entire stay easy and enjoyable. I was welcomed with treats and a helpful tour and she stayed in touch throughout whenever I had a question. I have stayed in many airbnbs and this one wins the prize!!
41809	4163851	10.0	8.0	34187099	"Amy's town home was a lovely place to come back to at the end of our busy day. We felt so much at home and Amy did a fantastic job welcoming us! Though lots of traffic noise is noted in the review, we were not bothered by this a bit. If you're a light sleeper though, it may.

Overall, we had a wonderful experience and enjoyed getting to see this part of Seattle!"
41810	4163851	10.0	8.0	35378275	The house is really pretty inside , and has a beautiful garage attach to it. But the environment near the house aren't so good , near a high way ,hard to fail asleep at night 
41811	4163851	10.0	8.0	35796420	My parents stayed at Amy's condo when they came out for my wedding.  They loved the condo and had everything they could possibly need. Thank you for the hospitality!!
41812	4163851	10.0	8.0	36553183	"
Amy is an amazingly gracious and generous host. Her place is pretty and conveniently located and very, very comfortable and well appointed.  Unfortunately, we lucked into an unusual heatwave for Seattle (90's) so AC would have been great--her apt without it is quite stifling--no airflow at all, even with fans that she provided. Also, do beware of the traffic noise.  The apt is right next to Rt 5 . Fine for New Yorkers, and she does provide bedside earplugs, but...

All in all, we were fine but you should know these things."
41813	4163851	10.0	8.0	38108773	Amy's home is great! We were in town for 4 weeks with work and her townhome served us very well! Easy check-in, she had some fruit and drinks ready for our arrival. It was very clean and the decor is aesthetically appealing. Be advised there is no air conditioning, but that seems like a standard thing in Seattle. It is close to the freeway, great restaurants and coffee shops. I would highly recommend staying here!
41814	4163851	10.0	8.0	40933985	I loved staying here! Amy is one of the nicest hosts I've ever rented from. She is accommodating and so sweet. I highly recommend staying here. Great bargain for an expensive city too. Make sure you have a car if you're trying to go downtown often. 
41815	4163851	10.0	8.0	42120095	Three of us stayed at this comfortable, well appointed townhouse in Seattle's Georgetown district.  Amy, the host, was there to meet us at check-in, giving us a tour, and also telling us her favorite Georgetown spots.  The townhouse is adjacent to the  freeway making for easy transportation to the airport and greater Seattle area.   We got around easily with Uber and no car.  Georgetown has an industrial edge, a great little neighborhood with casual restaurants, bars, and coffeeshops.
41816	4163851	10.0	8.0	43022782	Beautiful town-home literally 1 min (driving distance) from the Georgetown Ballroom where our friend was getting married.  Spacious and well-layed out.  Bedrooms were comfortable and master had enough closet space for my husband and I, plus our baby- which was awesome!  Neighborhood was quiet, and central to highway/many locations.  Also garage was a plus we didn't expect!
41817	4163851	10.0	8.0	44293736	"Amy met us when we arrived, and gave us a quick tour of the place. She was so welcoming!! She even had yummy treats for us- which were great after a long day of travel! The townhouse was just as described and made a great base camp for our Seattle excursion. Having the kitchen was extremely helpful and saved $$$!
We enjoyed our 5 night stay and totally recommend Amy's place!"
41818	4163851	10.0	8.0	45376909	Amy was very friendly and welcoming, and the townhouse was just as described and pictured. Very comfortable for our five-day stay - we particularly liked the kitchen and living area, and there were lots of interesting books on the shelves. For us, as first-time visitors to the U.S. and Seattle, we found the neighbourhood quite intimidating at first - given its industrial background and proximity to railyards. We used the 124 bus to travel to Downtown Seattle (20mins) and to the Museum of Flight (8mins South) - $2.50. The bus was fine but this location is better suited for people with their own cars. 
41819	4163851	10.0	8.0	53532112	This is a great place to stay. Very handy location to everywhere we wanted to go. The neighborhood felt very safe and we were able to do our daily walks without problem. We just really enjoyed staying here and would certainly come again.
42216	9564093	9.0	8.0	55960666	"The 3 2 1 Contact House was an excellent place to stay.  The bed is super comfortable. It was a quiet place to sleep.  Everything was clean.
The location is great! --close to Chinatown and downtown Seattle.  John was super helpful and had all important info ready.  I would definitely re-book here again."
42217	9564093	9.0	8.0	57051600	"John was an excellent host and the house is located at a very convenient location. You just need to walk a few steps to catch a bus to downtown. Link services are also available within a miles walk. 

The house was very clean and tidy and spacious enough for 2 people living. I had initially booked for 8 days and then loved it enough to rebook it for 4 more days. "
42218	9564093	9.0	8.0	57819564	"John was a very accomodating host! The house was just like the photos, close enough to downtown. He even left us some yogurt and drinks in the fridge. The area was very quiet and the bed was comfortable to sleep in. 
We enjoyed our stay in Seattle! "
42219	1652107	9.0	8.0	8059328	"So warm and cozy!! We rented this amazing cottage-like house for a girls weekend for two nights. The picture's don't do the decor justice-from the paint colors to the touches here and there it's downright adorable. Two of the bedrooms have beds comfy for two people, and the third room has a bunk bed: All the guests raved about the mattresses-even the bunk bed was cozy! Nice linens in all rooms and the bathroom. We were 7 people (It's an extra 40$ per night for each person over 6 staying) and I wouldn't do more than that in the space. 

One bathroom (be advised) but stocked with everything you'll need. The kitchen is large and well appointed: We cooked and stayed in one of the nights-plenty of glassware, silverware and cooking utensils. 

The street this house is cute and seemed safe, the red door is a classic touch and the back yard is small and cute. The neighborhood you drive through to get there might unnerve you a bit-stay strong my friend, once you get there you won't be disappointed.

Speaking of being unnerved: A word on the slasher film style basement. As the door creaked open from the kitchen we all gasped in horror: descending those creepy stairs meant certain death for sure!! Sigh, over-reaction-there's actually a ping pong table down there and also where the laundry is located. 

Internet worked great! Lots of books and a piano in the living room. The dishwasher wasn't really hooked up. Not just not plugged in, but didn't look like it was actually attached to any water sources. Annoying but oh well. The property isn't walkable to much. Downtown is a 35$ cab ride and the airport is about the same. The nearest grocery store of any substance was about a 5 minute drive. 

The host Blair communicated with me quickly and easily throughout the booking, during out stay and afterwards. We'll definitely book it again next time we're in the area.

42220	1652107	9.0	8.0	8105967	    Blair was very accommodating and easy to work with. The stay was very clean, spacious, and had ping pong! Would stay here again next time we visit Seattle thanks Blair! 
42221	1652107	9.0	8.0	8205287	Excellent.  Very comfortable beds.  A little further outside of downtown then I would have wanted but all in all a great place 
42222	1652107	9.0	8.0	8679050	"If you are looking for all the brand new fancy shmancy, this house is NOT for you!! Its quiant, its quircky (roll the dishwasher over and hook it up!!) its FUN (ping pong table), its spacious (my 4 kids played downstairs all weekend), its quiet (I thought the front street was going to be noisy all night, not AT ALL!!) its adorable for its age!! The beds were so soft with down comforters, my kids said they felt like they ""were sleeping in cotton candy""!! I'm not used to furnace heat and we were plenty toasty warm even with hardwood floors. Yes, its a wee bit out of town but we found a place to park by the light rail for free and we rode the light rail downtown for $16 for 6 of us!! First day, we got off the train 3 blocks from the waterfront, the 2nd day, we went to Space Needle via monorail!! We had a great stay!! Blair was VERY fast to respond to any questions we had!! Thanks 
"
42223	1652107	9.0	8.0	9115154	"I had a group of three stay at Blair's property for a work trip and the place worked out perfect.  I have used airbnb before and found that sometimes it was tough getting the keys to the homes but in this case it was very simple.  Blair had everything that we needed already set up and he emailed us all the directions and house rules days before we got there.

I would definitely stay here again!"
42224	1652107	9.0	8.0	9736232	We truly enjoyed our stay at this home. It was clean, cute and centrally located. The kitchen and bathroom were very well equipped,  and the bedrooms were comfortable. The dishwasher wasn’t plugged in so it was a bit difficult to use. Other than a few logistical issues with the delivery of the keys at our arrival and technical questions about the internet and cable, we were happy at this home.
42225	1652107	9.0	8.0	10665094	By sheer coincidence, some very good friends and I were all going to be in Seattle over the same weekend. We envisioned a house where we could all stay together, catching up and checking in with one another. When we found Blair's house in the southern part of the city, it was a dream come true! The space was lovely, and comfortably housed 6 people. It was spotlessly clean, and came with all of the extras we needed (including 2 bottles of wine). The house was in prime location for exploring the city (just a quick 10 minute drive to downtown), but also allowed us to spend time with one another without outside distractions. Although we didn't meet in person, Blair was very welcoming, and responded to all of our questions at lightening speed. At the end of our stay, we all agreed that we would stay again. Many thanks for your hospitality, Blair!
42226	1652107	9.0	8.0	10844539	"This place is easy breazy and full of steezy. Blair wasnt too rapid with the communication---but I'd give him a B. Im super easy in that respect, in fact the less we speak the happier I am. This House is perfect for a group, so easy, so cute, and so DWELL magazine! EASY. The location isn't my dream, but its so cheap who cares if the closest star bucks is 9.3 minutes by car?

Super Chill host, let us check out late. Really easy. Worked great for us."
42227	1652107	9.0	8.0	10925279	Pleasant, quiet neighborhood with a park within walking distance. Comfortable beds and nice backyard. Easy 20 minute commute to downtown. Everything was just as described and perfect for our family. 
42228	1652107	9.0	8.0	12002641	The Prime Seattle Craftsman home makes our journey wonderful. The host is easily to be contacted. The location is really convenient. Neighborhood is very nice. Anyway, it's a good place to stay!! 
42229	1652107	9.0	8.0	13117608	"It was great to have a 3 bedroom house for myself and 2 girlfriends on a shopping trip to Seattle. The beds were very comfortable and the duvets were a treat.
The house is in a good location.
It was nice to have the instant book option on this property and Blair was very quick to respond.
Thanks very much

42230	1652107	9.0	8.0	14969375	lovely place to stay that accommodated my whole family. communications were easy and the host was welcoming and flexible with a last minute request.
42231	1652107	9.0	8.0	15694841	Super cute house! Well appointed with everything we needed (linens, dishware, even a pizza knife!, good reads, adorable back yard. Easy parking for our large group, easy access to the I-5 for a quick drive into downtown Seattle. Downstairs basement was perfect play area. Thank you!! 
42232	1652107	9.0	8.0	16293634	"This home was a wonderful place for my group to reside in for the week of our convention. The kitchen is fully stocked for all types of cooking as well as a ping pong table in the basement for entertainment. The living room has a sofa that can be converted to a bed for extra capacity along with wireless internet and basic television. The neighborhood is quiet and felt quite safe in the evening. 

Overall it has exceeded our expectations and will be in consideration for future  travel needs!"
42233	1652107	9.0	8.0	16891011	We love the house very much and it is nearly downtown. 
42234	1652107	9.0	8.0	17208267	In general we had a nice stay in the house.  There were plenty of clean towels and dishes for us to use.  The beds were fairy comfortable.  The location was convenient although the surrounding area looks a bit rundown.  Parking on the street was very easy.  A few areas need improvement - the kitchen sink doesn't drain well, a doorknob broke, the ventilation cover on the floor was loose, and there a few spiderwebs in the corner.  Overall the house had enough room to accommodate seven of us and the owner provided very clear directions.
42235	1652107	9.0	8.0	19442818	Great. Quiet neighborhood. Clean house. Close to the city. Very much appreciated.
42236	1652107	9.0	8.0	21448179	"The house was as described. It is an older home with lots of character and charm. 
The beds were so very cozy and the layout worked perfectly for our family of 5. 

The basement is a bit creepy but that can be overlooked when you start playing ping pong. 

We had a great stay.

Thanks

The Cornelius Family"
42237	1652107	9.0	8.0	22292558	I had a fairly large group of friends that I met up with in Seattle for a 2 night stay over Halloween weekend. Blair's listing said the house could sleep 8 but he was very accommodating in letting my group of 11 use his home. There were two extra carpeted rooms downstairs in the basement in which a few people were perfectly fine sleeping in with an air mattress or sleeping bag. The house provided everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and was only about a 5 minute drive from the freeway which made getting into downtown VERY easy for the activities we had planned for the weekend. The extra fee for having a few more people stay in the house was also more than reasonable. I feel like our overall experience was worth far more than what I pad to rent the house. It was a very good value and I would definitely recommend renting one of his properties in the future.
42238	1652107	9.0	8.0	23657947	Blair was very responsive via email and provided detailed easy to follow instructions. Staying at Blair's place was amazing. We had a party of 8 people for a bachelorette party. The house was cozy and comfortable. Highly recommend Blair. Thank you Blair! 
42239	1652107	9.0	8.0	25815858	I was staying at Blair's place with my family and we had such an amazing time! The place was very clean and comfortable and Blair was perfectly available any time I contacted. I highly recommend this place and Blair is a great host!
42240	1652107	9.0	8.0	27662591	We only stayed in the house for one night but it was super cute and very clean and the beds were very comfortable! There was plenty of parking on the street too. Thanks Blair!
42241	1652107	9.0	8.0	28025555	beautiful house, very nice place to stay!
42242	1652107	9.0	8.0	28398030	Right off the freeway, you think you've landed yourself in the heart of an old industrial area, however, a short drive up a hill and you reach an established quiet neighborhood. Perfect location, equidistance between west Seattle, downtown, and the airport! Very convenient for any type of traveler, choose from the abundance of street parking available no matter what time of day/night it is or public transportation right outside the house! House was clean and comfortable for the five of us. Blair responded to all emails within 12 hours. 
42243	1652107	9.0	8.0	28984734	Blair's home was quaint and suited our needs better than a hotel would have. The location is conveniently located near the rail system and the mass transit system literally picks up outside the front door. The walk to the rail system however is a steep walk down and feels even steeper on the way back up. Just a short walk away is a lovely park that during the day was pretty quiet but had some questionable people after dark. The neighborhood overall was quiet but we did not feel 100% comfortable in the evenings. The front of the home had sheer curtains so everyone riding the bus or driving by had a glimpse of what was going on inside. The back of the house which butts up to an alley, had no curtains and gave us an uneasy feeling as well. On a positive note the beds and bedding were extremely comfortable but the folding futon for a 7th person was stiff. The kitchen was stocked with plenty of pans, dishes, silverware and cups but lacked in cooking utensils. We were not adequately  my stocked with toilet paper (3 rolls for 7 people for 10 days) but this was a fairly inexpensive but inconvenient purchase for us to make. The neighboring area is pretty rough but can easily be avoided if you drive a bit further for your shopping. For a rental it met our needs for the time in the Seattle area and I would recommend this place in the future. 
42244	1652107	9.0	8.0	29430174	What a wonderful time in Seattle. Blair made it so convenient and provided an amazing place to stay. There were six of us friends who met up in Seattle from Vegas, NYC, California, and Nebraska. we wanted an intimate place where we could stay and spend some time and also had the flexibility for each of us to aig off and do our own things. This was thee perfect place.
42245	1652107	9.0	8.0	29896132	"Blair's home was clean, cozy and very comfortable. Definitely family friendly.  Beds and sheets were perfect, kitchen had everything we needed.  It felt really homey, calm, quiet and safe. 
It's just a short drive to downtown Seattle and there is a lovely park right down the street. 
Communication was timely, checking in was a breeze and really this is an amazing value. 
I recommend and will likely be back."
42246	1652107	9.0	8.0	30884558	Our group of 7 adults and 2 kids had a very comfortable stay at Blair's house. Although we did not get a chance to meet him in person, he answered all questions promptly and was flexible about our changing group size, who was going to check in first, etc. The location was convenient for us because we were mostly attending wedding events to the south of dowtown, and easy access to Sea-Tac was also a plus. Thanks!
42247	1652107	9.0	8.0	31464796	Great house, great stay! We loved the decor and the common spaces; the backyard was lovely as well! Infractions with Blair were prompt and efficient; I would definitely recommend it. 
42248	1652107	9.0	8.0	32132118	"The house was great. It was cozy and comfortable. The bedrooms are simple and very clean. The beds are very comfortable and the linens were nice. The TV is newer and had an extra HDMI port, which we plugged into to play games.

The surrounding neighborhood is quiet and seemed safe. It was very convenient to drive into the city while staying out of the worst of the traffic. It's away from the noise of the city but very close to Boeing Field with the sound of airplanes taking off during the day. The gap you drive through to park in the back is a bit tight, so if you have a larger car or van, it may be easier to park on the street in front of the house.

The exchange with Blair was very simple and without any issues. I'd recommend staying here to my friends."
42249	1652107	9.0	8.0	32908734	Blair's place was extremely perfect for our short stay in between our travels. It had everything we needed and was perfect for a group. Would highly recommend !
42250	1652107	9.0	8.0	33723031	 We love the location. The location was quiet and in a nice area. The kitchen was well stock. The beds were comfy. The ping pong table was excellent. The park was walking distance. All rooms were spacious. The backyard was perfect for my dog. Towels were available at all time. Downtown was a short drive. Privacy was one problem in our stay. Adding better curtains to all rooms for more privacy. Especially the kitchen window had no curtain. Neighbors were looking through. Felt a little uneasy. When we arrived the house was not as clean. Also  there were not enough channels on the television. We only had about 20 channels. Overall the house was perfect for us. 
42251	1652107	9.0	8.0	33808976	The house was close to Seattle but not in busy downtown, which was awesome. Nice, quiet neighborhood and parking wasn't too hard to find. It had room for all us ladies. Only downside was there was only 1 bathroom.
42252	1652107	9.0	8.0	36733762	"We had a great experience at this house! We knew the location and were actually looking for something south of downtown, but it's a good spot for anyone visiting Seattle! The house was ""no frills"" compared to some of the places we've stayed on AirBnB (e.g. no breakfast food or supplies beyond utensils and sheets/linens) but everything was clean and as advertised. Blair was responsive and easy to work with! We happened to stay during the heat wave so the house got a bit warm but that's just Seattle when it's in the upper 80's!"
42253	1652107	9.0	8.0	39622958	I love this small and lovely house. Everything is perfect.there is a road that go to the house is very beautiful。hope next time we can stay here again.
42254	1652107	9.0	8.0	43523338	The house was great!  There was ample space for my five friends and I.    The beds were comfy.  The neighborhood was nice and quiet.  Downtown Seattle was only 10-15 minutes away.
42255	1652107	9.0	8.0	45573478	The house is clean and nice.
42256	1652107	9.0	8.0	46138219	It was one of our great experience. The house was kept clean before we arrived and we really enjoyed our stay.
42257	1652107	9.0	8.0	46626856	Super easy check in and check out. Perfect for business or leisure travelers. Really responsive host. Problem with the sink was fixed within an hour. 
42258	1652107	9.0	8.0	46747572	House was very cute! Would definitely recommend staying here, but not in the summer... I didn't realize at the time of booking there was no air conditioning.  However, all of the bedroom windows had screens, so we could at least open them at night to cool off the house. They also had some floor fans, but no ceiling fans. Overall, a good experience. Had lots of fun playing ping pong :)
42259	1652107	9.0	8.0	46920463	We had a wonderful visit and would recommend the place to friends!
42260	1652107	9.0	8.0	47097643	The house was great. The sheets, especially, were amazing and earned praise from several family members. The neighborhood was quiet and we had a nice night. It was an easy shot to SeaTac the next morning without much traffic.
42261	1652107	9.0	8.0	47793950	The house was great, very clean and spacious the rooms were a good size. Perfect for our stay!
42262	1652107	9.0	8.0	48125740	The house was exactly as depicted in the pictures online at airb&b. The bed was really comfortable and the house was light and airy. I'd definitely come back again! 
42263	1652107	9.0	8.0	49341732	Blair was quick to communicate with us and made the check-in process easy. The neighborhood is nice and the house was really cute--perfect for our short visit to Seattle! 
42264	1652107	9.0	8.0	49598150	Blair was an awesome host! The house was great and clean as well as all of the linens. He was also very accommodating for everything I needed and answered questions immediately.
42265	1652107	9.0	8.0	51321674	The house was very cute and mostly had what we needed. Not much within walking distance. 
42266	1652107	9.0	8.0	52249964	Blair was very accommodating to our every need and request, even an additional evening.  The house was perfectly suited for us and we throughly enjoyed our stay.  Blair was a great host and the house made it even better!
42267	1652107	9.0	8.0	53497013	The house was great and very comfortable. It is filled with beds and meets all basic needs. The location is near some bars on Rainer S and the Link and buses stop right by the house and make for an easy commute downtown. 
42268	1652107	9.0	8.0	54525618	Blair's place is in a good neighborhood, not much to do and see without a car when it is raining but that was because we had a baby and actually the bus stop is right in front of the house :) but I would love to come back in summer again. The place itself is nice, clean, and neat. Really nicely decorated and feels like home. And Blake is fast to respond for your inquiries.
42269	1652107	9.0	8.0	55367899	"Blair was great at communicating prior to and during our stay.  The house is charming.  Large and clean with comfy beds and in a quiet area.  Well stocked kitchen.  Good wifi connection.  Lots of street parking.
"
42270	1652107	9.0	8.0	56033858	This cozy house is in a nice quiet neighborhood south of the city. There is a bus stop right out front. We had a car and there was plenty of parking on the street. Blair was quick to respond to questions and since no one was staying the night before or the night after, allowed us an early check-in and a late check-out. The bedrooms were nice and the beds comfortable. The kitchen was great- fully stocked to cook up a meal with our loot from Pike Place Market. Overall a very nice stay!
42271	1652107	9.0	8.0	57218328	This was a great place, very comfortable and lots of space. As mentioned the beds were super comfortable. The kitchen was well supplied to make most meals, the only thing we couldn't locate was a can opener. Blair was responsive and helpful. 
42349	823989	9.0	8.0	3294718	Liz was wonderful to work with, great communication.  Very fast to respond and in my case that was very important we were booking in the very next day.  The Apartment was wonderfully furnished and clean.  The beds were really comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything.  We traveled with our corgi dog and Liz was very gracious about his presence.  The location is 5 mins from the Ballard District, great restaurants and shops.  Thanks again Liz.
42350	823989	9.0	8.0	3908117	Liz was awesome. Just the perfect mix of being there if need be, but allowing us our privacy when we didn't need anything. Liz was very understanding of our travel needs and very helpful with the facility and Seattle in general. Apartment was nice, the location was interesting. Definitely an eye-opener for us country folks! Easy location to downtown. Took the direct express bus and drove in - no problem.
42351	823989	9.0	8.0	5489533	The apartment was clean and big with nice furnishings, and Liz helped us out with what we needed.  Would stay again.
42352	823989	9.0	8.0	5715277	The place is as advertised! Very clean with comfortable beds and a homey atmosphere. Liz was absolutely great, and responded to phone calls/emails well. Would book this place again in a heartbeat.
42353	823989	9.0	8.0	5780254	Nice, clean apartment. One mile from freeway, in a fairly commercial area, but not at all noisy. The hosts were very gracious to us.
42354	823989	9.0	8.0	5999423	Our stay at this apartment was outstanding! The decor was excellent, and everything was neat and clean. It offers easy access to the highway and is within walking distance of bus stops.  Liz was very responsive and helpful.  Our stay exceeded our expectations; I would definitely recommend!
42355	823989	9.0	8.0	7486016	Very clean and well equipped apartment.  Beds were comfortable, and there were plenty of towels and linens.  I did find it a little musty smelling, which aggravated my allergies to mold and mildew, but that would only bother others with allergies.  Good experience and good price for two bedrooms.
42356	823989	9.0	8.0	8475161	"This place is as pictured! We are a family of 5 and the stay at this apartment was great for us. It is close to downtown and to all the places we needed to get to in Seattle. It had all the amenities we needed - most importantly, a dishwasher, which is excellent when you want to be out doing things and not inside doing dishes (plus, dishwashers waste less water than hand washing!)
The apartment is easily accessed, being on the ground floor; there was plenty of parking; it was easy to find; it was roomy and comfortable, with great furniture; private, cozy, and warm; great kitchen and bedrooms; luxurious bathroom - as you can see, a great package. Liz (the host) was very kind and communicative, and was amazing considering that she was busy with her new baby!! We'll definitely be choosing this place again for our next Seattle stay. Thank you!!"
42357	823989	9.0	8.0	8620939	We enjoyed a lovely time in Seattle with our 3 children. There was plenty of space for all, we loved the large flatscreen TV to watch games, Liz even had some personal touches handy with a highchair for our baby! We look forward to coming again!
42358	823989	9.0	8.0	8822702	This apartment is great! It's spacious and comfortable. It has all the comforts of home. The bed was even more comfortable than my bed at home! It was exactly as pictured, though seemed even more beautiful in real life. Checking in and out was super easy because of the lock box. Liz was very friendly and always available to answer my questions, but also gave me space when I didn't need anything. My only frustration was with the wireless internet. Sometimes it worked just fine and other times it was very slow.
42359	823989	9.0	8.0	9787228	Great deal in Seattle.  For the price the apartment is very spacious and was clean. It is a bit north of downtown and is not a great neighborhood for walking, but it is a perfect home base to see the city from. 
42360	823989	9.0	8.0	11574324	Was a wonderfully comfortable home. The beds were very comfortable and the pull out couch was great! The location is very close to the highway and plenty of restaurant.
42361	823989	9.0	8.0	12242243	Nice and comfortable appartment. Not difficult to find. 
42362	823989	9.0	8.0	12382335	As advertised.  Large, comfortable space.  Very quiet location despite being so close to Aurora/99.  Easy check-in and we had no need to contact the host or on-site managers while there, which is great.  Very easy access to downtown (straight shot down Aurora/99 takes about 15 minutes - except in rush hour).  Would stay again.
42363	823989	9.0	8.0	12931359	The apartment was very good as described, very clean and spacious. The location is very strategic. The host was very quick to respond. However, we didn't like the smell of the apartment somehow.
42364	823989	9.0	8.0	13141104	The apartment was as advertised. Location was great, it was in a very safe neighborhood near downtown. Secure covered parking. The apartment itself was spacious and very clean. Complete kitchen with microwave, stove, oven and fridge. Internet service was fast. Tvs in every room. Would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle. 
42365	823989	9.0	8.0	13543056	Andrea was perfectly polite and helpful and her apartment is exactly as it appears. The space was very clean and orderly, a perfect place to stay in Seattle on a budget. Check in was extremely easy and the building was quiet and accessible. I would absolutely stay at the Whitman Ave Suites again. Thanks Andrea!
42366	823989	9.0	8.0	13957278	"Andrea 's place clean and cozy. The beds are very comfortable. And we love the part that she has a TV in each room, very nice and convenient.

The apartment has a nice location. We drove to the Green Lake nearby nearly everyday. (Highly recommended) Great for taking a walk or jogging or just rest after a day's travel. Also there are two supermarkets nearby. And not to far away from downtown. Easy to drive.

Andrea is friendly and fast respond. We had a great stay at her place. Thank you for your host, Andrea!"
42367	823989	9.0	8.0	16698861	The reservation was canceled 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
42368	823989	9.0	8.0	16977010	Roomy and homey.  Exactly what we expected.  We totally enjoyed our stay, and would love to return again.  Would highly recommend to others.  Thank you.
42369	823989	9.0	8.0	17819045	The Whitman Ave Suite is exactly the same description on the listing. It is a nice place for us to stay in during the vacation in Seattle.  
42370	823989	9.0	8.0	18166018	"Hello Andrea, 
Thank you for all services!
I really enjoyed staying in Seattle. The house was so cozy, easy to use kitchen, good qualities of beds and big enough dining room. !!! Awsome! 
Anyone who wants to stay this house while traveling, it will be a good choice!"
42371	823989	9.0	8.0	19300064	The place was clean and the beds were comfortable. We were very happy with our stay and had no complaints.
42372	823989	9.0	8.0	19814201	The Whitman Ave Suites were perfect for my parents visit to Seattle after a long Alaskan Adventure. The beds were wonderful and they were able to catch up on some much needed sleep. Clean, well furnished apartment makes you feel right at home. My apartment is too small for guests so this was the perfect solution for us and very convenient (3 blocks from my apartment).
42373	823989	9.0	8.0	22027191	it was real convenient to check in and check out. Rooms are exactaly as the pictures. 
42374	823989	9.0	8.0	22596724	The property is described accurately.  The apartment was clean & welcoming.  Furnishings & linens were tasteful & appeared to be new.  It's a great spot to base out of when exploring the city.  Works fantastic for 2 couples.  Neighborhood is great.  Within one block from E Line, which takes you downtown & within walking distance to local neighborhood restaurants & breweries.  Check in & check out times are firm, no flexibility.  We asked to check in about 1 hour early so we could make our dinner reservations & were told no.  Overall, would highly recommend.  
42375	823989	9.0	8.0	22710026	"Place easy to find and everything was just as described. 

Communication was clear. Andrea's place suited our needs and fit 6 people comfortably."
42376	823989	9.0	8.0	22883895	Decent place to stay while in Seattle, this location is centrally located. If you're looking for a comfy space with basic amenities then this will be a great pick. For the price though, there were a few details that should be addressed such as a few light fixtures not working, dark dust on the kitchen towel, bathroom sink slightly clogged, and slight musty odor. I think one thing to be aware of is the pounding footsteps/running coming from the floor above.  If these minor issues are addressed I would stay here again. Lots of space and room. FYI the heater works well but it does take a few hours to warm up. The guest book with instructions was helpful. 
42377	823989	9.0	8.0	24008723	"This place is absolutely amazing! very cozy, very close to the E bus route which takes you straight to downtown. Her place is very neat and clean, equipped with everything you need, even supplies like washing liquids etc. The mall is very close too,which was great for groceries or even shopping.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
"
42378	823989	9.0	8.0	24805382	"We stayed here over Christmas whilst visiting family and it was just perfect for what we needed. It's in a great location to allow us to get out and about and to visit family and it was the perfect size for our family of 4 and for when family came to visit us.

It's really well looked after and has everything you need for your stay, all the basics are there ready for you.

Next time we go to Seattle, hopefully this apparent will be available."
42379	823989	9.0	8.0	25762178	"Andrea, 
We enjoyed staying at the apartment. It was as described in your posting and it fit our needs for the week, and was close to other relatives we were visiting. Thanks for a good stay in Seattle."
42380	823989	9.0	8.0	26397251	It was nice to have a place to ourselves and not just a room. 
42381	823989	9.0	8.0	26688696	We really enjoyed our stay in this cute place. It's very neat and clean. Andrea can solve our problem in a short time. Recommend this place!
42382	823989	9.0	8.0	28166687	The apartment is very vice and comfortable. We lived there for 4 nights. The host provided towels and other daily necessities. The only thing is that this apartment only has one bathroom. It's not enough for 6 people. Other than this, everything is great.
42383	823989	9.0	8.0	28351145	Clean and quiet. Will stay there if visiting Seattle again.
42384	823989	9.0	8.0	28802085	It's  a cozy place to stay over the spring break with my families. We love this suite! I didn't expect to have that many things in the kitchen. That was awesome! Andrea was so nice and very supportive to everything we needed during the stay.
42385	823989	9.0	8.0	29306761	This place was really comfortable. It suited our group perfectly. We loved being able to have a comfortable place to come back to after some stressful days of school work. I would definitely recommend this listing to someone in the future! 
42386	823989	9.0	8.0	30294201	This is an awesome spot in Shoreline! Super clean and stylish. We had a great time. Thanks Andrea!
42387	823989	9.0	8.0	32532869	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! It was comfortable, cozy and clean. Location is quiet and suited our needs. It has everything you need, but bring your own shampoo. It also only has 1 bathroom which is difficult with 5 people, but we made it work!
42388	823989	9.0	8.0	34616938	The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
42389	823989	9.0	8.0	37279752	Andrea was great to work with. The place is exactly as described and worked perfectly as a home base for our family  as we explored all over the Seattle and surrounding areas. It was easy to get downtown as well as northern communities and suburbs. We had a great stay.
42390	823989	9.0	8.0	38106236	Andrea was very clear in all her instructions about the apartment. It was a quiet neighborhood and was exactly as described. 
42391	823989	9.0	8.0	38496460	Very easy access & good directions given.  Apartment was as pictured & worked great for our short stay in Seattle.  Very convenient location right off of I5.  Would definitely stay again if we need a place in Seattle.
42392	823989	9.0	8.0	40086350	Great place! Clean, conveniently located. Host provided plenty of extra sheets and towels for use. Easy check-in and check-out. Would stay again
42393	823989	9.0	8.0	41186836	"neighborhood was great.  loved that the floors were updated to hardwood. the bathtub and counter could be upgraded to make a more nicer stay.  
liked the decor of the place.  would have welcomed more air circulation in all the rooms.  
"
42394	823989	9.0	8.0	42454508	It was amazing! So clean, no clutter, it was perfect!
42395	823989	9.0	8.0	43051106	We enjoyed our stay in the Whitman condo.  The Condo had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  Location was close to many restaurants and stores and we loved that most of the tourist attractions were within a reasonable distance. The beds were comfortable as was the living room couch.  It was nice to come home after a long day and relax in a comfortable setting.
42396	823989	9.0	8.0	45602047	large rooms, can easily accommodate more than 4 guests. Good access to the highways and downtown (by car). Maybe we were not lucky -  bed linen had to be changed after we arrived (not done before) and cleaning done only the day after we arrived    
42397	823989	9.0	8.0	46888567	We really enjoyed our stay here! The apartment was nice and clean. Andrea was also reachable and helpful. 
42398	823989	9.0	8.0	47655490	Very accommodating, the host was very helpful and responsive. The place looks exactly like the pictures.
42399	823989	9.0	8.0	49611018	The room is perfectly adequate - the chair and the coffee being nice touches - and the bed is (website hidden) came with everything we (website hidden) easy self-check-in and great price. It was sort I nice not having to interact with anyone, felt private. 
42400	823989	9.0	8.0	50279203	We had a very pleasant experience in this apartment. The beds were very comfortable and I was very glad to see how clean everything was. The neighborhood was also very quiet. We used the buses so it was nice to see there was a bus stop right at the corner. We will definitely use this apartment again when we go to Seattle.
42401	823989	9.0	8.0	50971204	it is a nice apartment with a reachable location. Even it is quite old building but it got everything we need. Special the parking area is just right in front of the building. Very convenient. If you want a budget trip and will rent a car I will recommend this apartment 
42402	823989	9.0	8.0	52476371	Andrea's apartment was cosy, clean and very comfortable.  Near very convenient bus stop for various locations and restaurants.  Apartment very well furnished and had all accessories for a very pleasant and relaxing stay.  Will hope to stay here again on our next trip to see family in Seattle.
42403	823989	9.0	8.0	55376886	Nice host. Positively helped us when we checked in. The house was a cozy one and was able to hold like 3-4 people. The sofa bed was super nice. Bedrooms were cozy and worm. The location of the house is like only 10 mins driving to university district and downtown. Recommended to all guests and visitors.
42436	9075558	5.0	8.0	53153820	Accommodation was alright, bed was ok and location very close to downtown. Unfortunately host wasn't at home when we arrived so the room was dirty after last guest and bathroom as well. We had to change our bed linen to clean one (not really sure if it was clean). Benefits are location and price but overall impression is below the average.
42437	9075558	5.0	8.0	53313026	The room was dirty and it appeared the sheets had not been changed or cleaned. The rest of the house was also not cleaned recently. I only needed a place to crash for the night so was not expecting much. Mostafa was very responsive when contacted or called upon. I would not stay here again nor recommend anyone else to do so. 
42438	9075558	5.0	8.0	53667699	Mostafa was always quick to respond and was there to greet us upon arrival.  The home is new and looks appealing from the outside.  It's tucked away and behind some other town homes so you can't see it from the street.  We picked this place because of the price and literally just needed a place to stay for one night.  This is all I would recommend this place for, a place to sleep and that's all.  The home is shared with young adults (maybe mid 20's) and the upstairs (living and kitchen area) is very cluttered and messy.  The bedroom itself had furniture stacked all around and a bike hanging out.  This room was apparently also used for storage.  It was very plain and not very welcoming.  The bathroom was dirty and messy, no towels were provided to us either.  I looked for some but there was only 1 used one, no others were to be found. 
42439	9075558	5.0	8.0	54564940	Mostafa's home was affordable and conveniently located in a quiet place of town near easy and quick access into downtown. Other reviews have mentioned that the room was clean, but this is my second time staying there and I've not had an issue. I've personally seen mostafa changing the linens. There's a bit of temporary clutter in the room, but for the price, it's hard to beat. 
42440	9075558	5.0	8.0	54682263	The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures. The townhouse is very new and spacious. We didn't get to meet Mostafa because we were out and about but he was available and helpful through e-mail. His roommates were also very helpful. 
42441	9075558	5.0	8.0	55669232	"Mostafa was really helpful during my stay. He responded promptly to my emails and made the ""check in"" process very efficient. He even let me store my food in his fridge. The room was very nice and looked just like the pictures. Even though there are some chairs stacked on the side and the closet was quite full, the space was just enough for my one night stay. The only thing that would have made the stay better was a thicker warmer blanket. The room can be quite chilly in the winter time so be prepared!"
42458	716829	6.0	8.0	4304953	"Very unique and funky space!  The hanging bed is comfortable and fun, you can rock yourself to sleep each night.  The garden and eclectic art around the shack is great. Nice privacy out back, great for relaxing.  The only downside is that there is no plumbing, but there is a garden hose hooked up to an outdoor sink, so if you're able to survive ""camp style"" - you'll be just fine!  There is also water cooler and full refrigerator / freezer, so it was not a problem for me.  Lisa is a very kind host and Steinway is the friendliest dog around!    "
42530	5931372	8.0	8.0	30169706	This is a great house and for a great deal. Tahoma hosted my family, visiting me from Iceland. They had a nice experience and enjoyed their stay very much. Tahoma responded quickly to my very late request and everything was nice and clean when they arrived. Thanks Tahoma, I will definitely recommend this North Seattle Home for guests.
42531	5931372	8.0	8.0	31023241	We loved our stay in the Townhouse. It was clean, cosy and welcoming. Thanks for everything.
42532	5931372	8.0	8.0	35297657	Really good price for 5-day stay in Seattle. Nice townhouse with garage. As long as you have a car, it is pretty convenient.
42533	5931372	8.0	8.0	37063108	Wonderful clean home, close to great coffee shops, restaurants. Would definitely recommend and rent again!
42534	5931372	8.0	8.0	37318513	It is nice and lovely house. The host kindly provide everything we need. We had a good time there. Thank you very much
42535	5931372	8.0	8.0	37709434	"Nice house -  modern, comfortable and, on the whole, clean. A pleasant place to stay. 

BUT the downside: if you aren't familiar with Seattle, then do be aware. This house is barely a block from Aurora, which is essentially Seattle's red light district. Streetwalkers tout for business just a few meters away from the house. It is located just behind a sex shop too! There is also a lot of noise at night both from Aurora and people hanging around on the dirt track outside the house. Because of the type of activity going on in the neighborhood, police presence is pretty high. There was a cop stationed outside the house when we were there keeping an eye on prostitutes and drug dealers. 

None of this bothered us as we know the area well and if you are sensible, you won't run into trouble. But some people may well have issues with all this.    "
42536	5931372	8.0	8.0	39741347	"This is a great little home!  My husband and I took 4 teens and had ample space with everything we needed. The owner provided a queen air mattress which was VERY helpful with the teen boys who wanted to sleep separately. :-) Be aware that the bathroom is shared with doors to the 2 bedrooms upstairs. Anyone wanting to get in to the shower would be walking through one of the bedrooms.

 I got the pleasure of meeting the owner and she is so helpful to answer any questions I had. She was thoughtful to bring me grocery bags as Seattle is plastic free and she knew we would need to do grocery shopping Thanks for that!  The area of town is older, but we didn't feel unsafe. It is noisy with traffic, which was noticeable because we slept with windows open...but the description tells you that. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks! "
42537	5931372	8.0	8.0	40894199	"The Good: My mother, husband, and 2-yr old, stayed at this house at the end of July 2015. It's located right off Aurora avenue and close to i-5, which made it very convenient to get downtown to Capitol Hill, downtown, lake Washington, and very easy to go any place west of the highways such as Fremont, Ballard, etc. The house has kitchen tools and dishes perfect for cooking easy meals. Even the knives were good. I loved that there was an electric kettle. We didn't use them but there was a coffee maker, French press, and rice maker too. The beds, sheets, and blankets were very comfortable. Lots of towels too. The sheets, bedrooms, and bathrooms were clean (other than the bathroom drain, see below). One reviewer said that aurora is the ""red light district"" this is not accurate. We were totally safe and although there were some people drinking during the day and one woman who seemed high this felt very normal for a city. Aurora had some great things on it like the drive-in burger place, a yoga studio, and the pcc natural market a five minute drive away. The Sex toy shop is no longer there.

The not-so-good: we arrived to a dirty house. Not unbearable but not up to par with what you'd expect for the price. There wasa layer of grease over the oven and microwave. The toaster and refrigerator had crumbs and food grime in them. The floor and stairs had dirt and dust in them. There were small cobwebs on the lights in the bathroom and the bathroom drain was clogged with a ton of hair. I actually pulled it out myself because I was so disgusted. We had Mary Ann come back the next day to clean the floors and kitchen again. She cleaned the second floor, toaster, and fridge but the microwave and oven were still greasy and the stairs still had dirt on them. It seemed like the house hadn't had a thorough cleaning in a long time. We would've been happy to pay a higher cleaning fee for a hotel quality clean.  We are from NYC so were used to street noise but definitely being off aurora was noisy and it was too hot to sleep with windows closed. There is no AC so you put the fan on at night and it cools down a lot. It also was a particularly hot summer for Seattle. 

Overall we had a great stay at this location and would return of we knew it would be cleaner next time. "
42538	5931372	8.0	8.0	43617525	House was just as it is listed! True, it is somewhat close to a noisy road and some non-family businesses, it is also close to a public transit stop - and we never felt unsafe. The house was clean and just the right size for our larger family. You can even see portions of downtown Seattle and Mt. Rainier from the upper floor!
42539	5931372	8.0	8.0	44746241	The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
44493	571640	9.0	8.0	1794492	Keith&Cherie were great hosts!Keith picked us up at the busstation and took us to town at night for a tour through the nightlife of Seattle. It was great!Cherie helped us with the laundry, we had it all washed and dryed in the evening, thank u very much!!!It was awesome, clean&uncomplicated, I would recommend to stay there any time!
44494	571640	9.0	8.0	1973260	Keith was flexible and pleasant to work with, though only through phone and emails.  I never met him -- he wasn't there when we arrived nor up when we arose the next morning.  Room was clean, bed comfortable, but place was in a bit of disrepair.  $80 seemed high for what it was.  
44495	571640	9.0	8.0	2087215	My family and I stayed w/ Keith for 2 nights while we were in Seattle, and had a great experience. Keith went above and beyond the call of being a good host. The rooms were clean and he was very respectful, friendly, and knowledgable about the city and what it had to offer. 
44496	571640	9.0	8.0	5132838	"Prez was a very kind and charismatic host! We had only stayed there for one night, but all our needs were met and everything went accordingly.
"
44497	571640	9.0	8.0	9837983	"First of all Prez is a nice host.
and the room we were staying in was very warm and comfortable. the kitchen, bathroom and living room was also cool. 
Although the location of the home is quite far from downtown, it's not a big deal. You can find a train station near their home."
44498	571640	9.0	8.0	9922240	We stayed at Prez & Cherie's for one night this weekend and both of us agree that it was the best AirBnb we've stayed at thus far.  From the moment we entered, Prez was very hospitable, offering us chicken soup and beverages.  He has a shuttle business and offered us a ride downtown, and even picked us up at the end of the night!  We were so grateful for that.  I highly recommend staying here if you're planning a trip to Seattle.
44499	571640	9.0	8.0	36496686	"Prez and Cherie were FANTASTIC. 

We ended up in a bind and needed a new place to stay super last minute. We found their listing and even though they were on vacation themselves they helped us out more then I ever thought possible.

We were able to access the place via keypad lock on the front door. The place was spotless and super clean. Downtown was about a 7 dollar uber. Could not have had a better experience!

Would definitely stay with them again and would highly recommend!!

"
44504	278192	8.0	8.0	1025259	This room is also clean and quiet. The host is really really nice. Recommend!
44505	278192	8.0	8.0	1168970	Keith & Cherie are great hosts. Great communication from booking to our arrival! Keith even stopped by to check on us and show us around and he even took the time to drive us to the Light Rail station so that we could catch a Mariners game in time, thanks!!
44506	278192	8.0	8.0	1269261	I was travelling around the US with a friend and we had a really nice stay in Seattle for a couple of nights. The place was simple, comfy and located in a very nice and calm neighbourhood. Keith and Cherie were extremely welcoming and easy going. I would highly recommend the place and the hosts.
44507	278192	8.0	8.0	1522908	Keith was a great host and made my trip a memorable one. Great location, short walk to transportation to the city. Keith even took me to see Jimi Hendrix's grave which would have been a long trip on the buses so I am thankful for that also. Overall a great host and I recommend him highly
44508	278192	8.0	8.0	1644241	When you travel to a place that you are unfamiliar with, one of the best feelings is having a friend there. That is exactly how Keith & Cherie made us feel. We loved our stay with them and their family made us feel right at home over the fourth of July holiday.
44509	278192	8.0	8.0	1725063	"This was exactly the weekend my girlfriend and I needed. Keith met us at the ferry and took us to his home. Nice quiet neighbourhood which was located close to the Lightrail system, a fresh market and liqour store. 

When we orginally contacted Keith and Cherie about our plans for Seattle we told them a little about ourselves and what we were looking for and then they filled in all the blanks. We had such a great time with the party bus, Keiths love for Seattle was apparent. He took us to a few hot spots & seemingly knew someone everywhere we went which only added to our experience! 

Cherie was really sweet and made sure we had everything we needed as if we were at home. They really made us feel welcome and we would definitly be back! 

Sarah and I couldn't stop giggling about our night and kept saying that had we not stayed with them we may not have had the fun and experiences we did! Thanks Guys! I'm sure we will see you again!

Melissa & Sarah"
44510	278192	8.0	8.0	1798953	My girlfriends & I LOVED staying at Keith & Cherie's!  They are super fun hosts... if you chose to stay with them, get ready to have a blast!  Their house is neat & clean, and feels very safe. Furthermore, both Keith & Cherie know all the fun spots in Seattle, and they gave us lots of great suggestions. PLUS they gave us rides to those places via their transportation business, which was great because we didn't have a car.  Overall, a wonderful experience!
44511	278192	8.0	8.0	1815319	I really enjoyed staying at Keith &Cherie's place! Cherie was nice, and Keith was SO HELPFUL!! The rooms are clean and so was the bathroom. We stayed in the upstairs bedroom with the bunk beds. I thought it was plenty for us. His Daughter was super sweet! loved seeing how they both are so proud of their city! And they know so much! The neighborhood is calm and its about a 5-10  min walk to the sound transit rail! Super easy to get into DT. Next time I go back I'd definitely try and stay here. The Asphy family is a great Host!
44512	278192	8.0	8.0	1833591	Keith & Cherie accommodated us last minute.  They were friendly and informative in regards to telling us what areas to go check out even though we were rushed.  Thanks Keith & Cherie!
44513	278192	8.0	8.0	7150305	"Prez and Cherie were very kind. I needed a place to stay at the last minute. They were prompt in their response and I felt accommodated through my whole experience. 

I stayed in the lower level of the house which was nice and cool during the hot summer week I was visiting Seattle. The kitchen and bathroom were both clean and nice. It was great to have a place to cook!
"
44514	278192	8.0	8.0	7571198	My sister and I stayed at Prez and Cherie's home while celebrating my birthday. They were great hosts and very sweet! Their home is located close to all the sights and they recommend places to go which was really nice! We'd love to stay with them again!
44515	278192	8.0	8.0	9844083	Prez and Cherie were great, extremely helpful in showing us around the house. They even offered us a ride to our destination to save us the hassle of travelling!
44516	278192	8.0	8.0	9947316	Our stay was really express (only one night) we were 4 people total and for what we wanted it was perfect! The place was really clean and in good conditions, it seemed really nice even for a longer stay. I will recommend it if you are looking for something more affordable!
44517	278192	8.0	8.0	16193833	We booked last minute and they responded right away. Prez met us in person and showed us the apartment. The bed was very comfortable and we were able to use the washer/dryer. Thanks for making our stay in Seattle pleasurable.
44518	571651	8.0	8.0	9223016	Clean and nice room in Seattle. Just met Prez, he was friendly and helpful. Thanks.
44519	571651	8.0	8.0	9356772	It was a great accomodation! We had a lot of fun with Prez & Cherie. They drove us often to the trainstation and we were also at the grocery store with them. First day they cooked with us and we had a great dinner. The Room was very clean and fine - the bed was also very comfortable. There is only one thing which was not so good - there was no heater in the bathroom - and it was reaaaally cold (It was snowing in seattle) - but i think it's not a big deal and you can see over it - especially in the summer. Thank ya guys! Was a lot of fun! 
44520	571651	8.0	8.0	10302754	Prez and Cherie were absolutely nice hosts. I was really lucky as I was in Seattle by the time of the Superbowl Parade and they took me there. The place itself is quite neat and tidy. Only word of advice for traveler using public transportation  is that the place is a little bit far from bus or train station. Other than that, I strongly recommend this place is you're visiting Seattle for either business or pleasure. Overall had a good experience staying in this place.
44521	571651	8.0	8.0	10642698	Prez and Cherie are great and welcoming people, and do their best to make their guests comfortable. I have seen them go out of their way to assist other guests when they needed help, and they are a great source of local information.  It was fun to talk to them when they had time. Prez has a great sense of humour and is a fun guy.  The bed is very comfortable though the wardrobe space is limited, but certainly ok for a few nights or a week.
44710	606297	8.0	8.0	1944452	"Keith is a wonderful host! Stayed with my brothers and there girlfriends along with my boyfriend. Only thing I'd say is there were a few spiders ;) 
But, other than that... It is a nice, warm and welcoming home! Thank you again Keith! "
44711	606297	8.0	8.0	2249005	Very spacious house. A great place to stay for a large party (we had nine). Keith was way cool. He allowed us check in early, gave us a lift to dinner and arranged for a party bus to take us all to an event on Friday night. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again the next time I'm in the Seattle area with a large group. Thanks again Keith for a being such a gracious host!
44712	606297	8.0	8.0	2387577	Keith is a very friendly owner I have ever met!!!
44713	606297	8.0	8.0	2432664	Keith  was and excellent host!  The house was perfect for our group of 9 people, and we really appreciated Keith's hospitality.  He was great with communication and even allowed our group a later checkout time!  We'd stay again in a heartbeat! 
44714	606297	8.0	8.0	2542383	Great, friendly service.  Offered up some discounted party bus fun.  Tons of space, very clean inside - would recommend. Thanks, Keith! 
44715	606297	8.0	8.0	3754851	I had the opportunity to stay at Keith and Cherie's earlier this month. The house definitely accommodated 10 people in the party. Besides the two parking spaces at the house there was also parking right across the street for all of my out of town guests. Keith was very kind, accommodating and helped us arrange party bus service for out night out!
44716	606297	8.0	8.0	3820796	Keith and Cherie were easy to deal with.  Seamless transaction, location was easy to get to and the hosts were super accommodating.  I would have no problems booking with them the next time we visit Seattle.  
44717	606297	8.0	8.0	4090603	Keith met us at the house and was a great host - the rooms were fantastic for what we needed (there were six of us and a baby) and we had absolutely no problems at all.
44718	606297	8.0	8.0	4168122	Keith and Cherie were really helpful and welcoming. They provided everything stated on their profile and communicated very well from the beginning to the end of our visit. We appreciated their concern on our travel by always checking up on us to make sure we are doing well. The house was less then 5 minutes away from Downtown Seattle and right next to the freeway, which made it easy to navigate. I would recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to Seattle. Great hospitality!  
44719	606297	8.0	8.0	4364809	We (a group of 6) recently stayed at this house for the weekend. Keith was a very welcoming and helpful host. He was very helpful with providing suggestions of things to do, quickly answering any questions we had, and giving us rides to and from downtown Seattle. He was available 24/7, and really made our stay as comfortable as possible! If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have been able to attend a great comedy show, and an after party at the See Sound Lounge, all on Sunday night. The house was spacious, very clean and definitely catered to our needs. The location is also ideal - everything is a short trip away. For those thinking about staying in Seattle, consider this place highly recommended.
44720	606297	8.0	8.0	4594087	We love our stay at Keith and Cherie's apartment! They are both very gracious and helpful hosts, their large apartment was perfect for our needs while we visited Seattle for a family wedding. Keith was quick to respond to any texts and would drop by to say 'hi' from time to time.When our flight was delayed, he graciously allowed us to stay past our checkout time. Their apartment was very well stocked, from large crockpots to board games and books for the little ones.  We highly recommend Keith and Cherie's apartment and will not hesitate to return the next time we are in Seattle!
44721	606297	8.0	8.0	5290977	Our group had an excellent time! Easy walking distance to grocery store and light rail station. Keith and Cherie were extremely welcoming and accommodating.
44722	606297	8.0	8.0	5342106	"Seriously!  We literally could not have had a better place to stay than with Prez and Cherie.  Everything was so perfect for us.  The house was in the perfect location for us to get there from Portland and really convenient to get around town.  Stocked with everything we needed to cook and have a nice time. Clean and comfortable.
We rented the entire space out for a bachelorette extravaganza fiesta weekend!  We are all mostly in our 30's and work in the service industry.  Keith (Prez) was so quick to respond and very accommodating while I was in a frenzy trying to plan out all the logistics for our weekend.  We really had the best time possible.   
Day 1:Our first night there we planned on a nice dinner in Capitol Hill and then drinks in the hood.  I had called us a few cabs (there were 12 of us then with 2 more joining (email hidden)e cab companies were ridiculous and I spent a half hour on the phone, only to find out they had dispatched to the wrong neighborhood.  Prez's dad Ali was out front chatting with some of my friends.  He was on his way to pick up some people in  a Party bus and he let us hop a ride with to dinner for a small fee.  We had a great time at dinner and out drinking and then we decided to call Prez and see if the party bus could possibly take us home. They came right by on their way home and let us dance the whole way home. We stayed up for a bit at the house and we had invited Prez to come by if he wanted.  He showed up with lovely Cherie and we had a nice time chatting with them on the balcony.  
Day 2: We were all pretty tired and hungry and as my friends were making breakfast Prez stopped by and offered to run to the store to get anything we needed.  He went and got us fixings for bloody mary's which i had completely forgotten to bring!  He saved the day!   We hung out all day at the house and felt very comfy and welcome.  
Day 3: we were packing up and getting ready to leave.  It was extremely convenient to clean up, do all our dishes, and put our towels in the hamper.  Everyone was so happy with our weekend.  Prez stopped by and chatted and we all exchanged numbers and now we have a new friend who we hope will come visit us in Portland.  This was one of the best experiences vacationing I have ever had.  They were so friendly and accommodating and made us feel at home.  Anytime I'm back in Seattle I hope that I can stay with them.  I wish that all people could be like them!"
44723	606297	8.0	8.0	5537839	We had 3 generations staying at the home. Prez and Cherie were awesome hosts. They were so accommodating with our last minuted requests for transportation. I would highly recommend staying at any of their properties. When we got back from the baseball game they had a feast of BBQ chicken and ribs, macaroni salad and all the fixins waiting for us! Super friendly people!
44724	606297	8.0	8.0	5905382	This is our 2nd time staying at this house and it has always been a good experience. Prez and Cherie have done some upgrades to the place and its a lot better! The deck is nice, has a spacious backyard and 5 bedrooms to accommodate a large group of people.  Prez was so accommodating and he made sure we were ok by checking up on us at night.  We stayed here during the Bite of Seattle and hopefully we will be staying here again whenever we are in town.  
44725	606297	8.0	8.0	5988086	Good location!  Easy access to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods!  The house has great community space for 10 adults to sit comfortably and hang out.  Thanks Prez & Cherie for being responsible, understanding and welcoming hosts!
44726	606297	8.0	8.0	6031261	We had a great stay in Seattle. Wish we could have stayed longer! Cherie was very helpful and the house was great for our large group.
44727	606297	8.0	8.0	6104621	Location, location, location! This house is located very close to a light rail station which got us downtown for special events such as a Mariners game, the Space Needle, and the big concert we went to Seattle for in the first place. It only took us 2 or 3 stops to get us to where we wanted to go. I spoke with Cherie on the phone and she was so amiable. The house is basic by design and was perfect for our large group of 11. The kids were able to entertain themselves for hours with the Wii and with the poker table provided. All in all, if you want a great location, this is the place for you.
44728	606297	8.0	8.0	6239284	"We spent a long weekend in Seattle and rented the house for an informal college reunion with a group of 10.  We certainly enjoyed our stay and Prez and Cherie were gracious hosts.  Prez was out of town but was responsive via text anytime we needed to reach him.  Cherie showed us the place when we arrived and was very interested throughout our stay in how our time in Seattle was going.  It was nice to have that personal touch, and made us feel welcome.  Also, we accidentally got locked out at 2am on our last night and both Prez and Cherie responded to our text messages within a few minutes!

There was plenty of room in the house for all 10 of us (we had both the lower and upper units) and the number of bathrooms and kitchen space meant that we didn't have any conflicts about taking showers or finding space in the fridge for our adult beverages.  

The location is nice because it is short 10 minute drive from downtown, and the house is very close to the light rail station, which you can take directly downtown in 15 minutes or to the airport.  The Beacon Hill area is a pretty typical Seattle neighborhood--nothing swanky but perfectly nice.  Similarly, the house was clean and definitely met all of our needs, but was not swanky.  For our group it worked very well because it was a very economical option near downtown with plenty of space, and the fact that Prez and Cherie were so responsive and interested in making sure we had a good time was a nice perk.  

We had a great weekend with our college friends in Seattle, everyone in our group was pleased with the accommodations, and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value in a location but who does not need a nice (but not fancy) place.  Thanks Prez and Cherie!"
44729	606297	8.0	8.0	6339216	We had such a great time in Seattle and a big part of it was because of Prez and Cherie, you won't find more better hosts then these two! We did a pub crawl with the party bus the first night we where there and Prez took us to the hottest spots to party in Seattle and boy did we have a blast! Best pub crawl ever! Prez was so much fun and fit into our group perfectly. The house was very clean and fit our needs, it was located close to the Train station so heading downtown was a sinch and very quick. Prez and Cherie always made sure we had everything we needed and they always answered all our questions quickly, communication was easy. When we head back to Seattle I would def stay in their home again! I highly recommend this house you won't be disapointed I promise. Thank you so much Prez and Cherie! 
44730	606297	8.0	8.0	6611345	Prez and Cherie provided a nice experience in their home, and were very accommodating and personal in that they were always in contact and made sure everything was all good to go! We didn't get to meet in person since I was too busy with my brother's wedding nearby in SODO and was occupied by our visiting relatives, but it felt like I knew them already based on their hospitality and contacting through texting. House is pretty spacious upstairs and just right downstairs. Would definitely stay again if the need arises! Thanks Prez and Cherie!
44731	606297	8.0	8.0	7004850	A great host. Would highly recommend 
44732	606297	8.0	8.0	7693205	"Prez and Cheri we kind enough to accommodate our huge group of 11 visiting from Los Angeles. We had an upstairs and downstairs unit. The place was so big it didn't even feel like there were that many of us staying there!  They house was fully stocked with everything we could need. On our first night there Prez stopped by to welcome us and offered our giant group a ride in his amazing party bus to Elysian Brewery. 

I would totally stay with them again, big or small group. "
44733	606297	8.0	8.0	8078723	I booked this house as a place for my family to be together while in town for a wedding.  The house is spacious and for our purposes well situated.  We had several cars so getting to the grocery three very steep blocks away was easy.  Public transit is also down the steep hill.  Walking in the neighborhood is pleasant with a nearby golf course and park.  The house itself has seen many parties and is showing the signs of wear.  The kitchen is stocked with necessities though the table ware is in short supply for such a big house.  A guest information book would be helpful as I did not meet our hosts at all during the four days and there are unexplained locks on some of the interior doors that caused some unnecessary frustration.
44734	606297	8.0	8.0	8524819	A group of us came down from Canada for the weekend, and this house was easily big enough for all of us. The upstairs kitchen is nice and big, although doesn't really have seating but we managed just fine. And there is tons of fridge space, which is great with big groups. Prez & Cherie were always available via phone, and responded right away.
44735	606297	8.0	8.0	8814245	Fantastic location for those wanting explore all of Seattle.  Light rail makes the trip from the airport a snap.  It is a short walk from both light rail stations to the house.  When wanting to go the city, it is only 20min or so on the light rail to get there.  We went to the market, the Seahawks game, the space needle, etc. all without a cab fare.
44736	606297	8.0	8.0	9439193	We rented the house for a family reunion/Christmas vacation and were disappointed with the condition of the house. From the pictures and reviews we thought it would be a good option for all of us (9 adults and 3 kids), but the house was much more worn and deteriorating than is portrayed in the pictures.  While the rest of the house was cleaned up okay, the kitchen was not clean and everything had a layer of grease on it (dishes, cupboards, oven).  We had to wash everything before we used it. While Prez was gracious in his response to some of our requests/issues (fixing the sink handle that had broken off), I think the experience would have been more positive if it had been professionally cleaned. I think the house needs some serious work/upgrades to accurately reflect what is portrayed online.
44737	606297	8.0	8.0	9890971	If you're a large group that needs a budget place to crash after a night of partying, this is the place for you. The hosts were warm and friendly. However, if you do not fall in that category, you would want to look elsewhere.  The condition of the house was very disappointing as it did not reflect the photos.  It is much older and run down than appears in the bright flash lit photos.  The basement has been converted into bedrooms, but it feels dark and dank. It has as much charm as an old motel. I've stayed a numerous AirBnBs over the years and this was the most disappointing. 
44738	606297	8.0	8.0	10048503	The place was extremely roomy and accommodating. We had a group of 9. Each couple had their own private bedroom and there were plenty of extra beds to spare. Clean sheets and bathrooms is all I really ask for and this place fit our budget nicely! Location is pretty close to downtown, just an uber ride away. The place could use some remodeling here and there but overall it was perfectly fine.

44740	606297	8.0	8.0	10547885	Prez & Cherie were wonderful, easy going hosts.  They did not hesitate to help us work around our large group of 18, and were extremely accommodating in all our requests!  The house was cozy and in fair condition, with enough common areas to bring the group closer together.  We had a great time here :)
44741	606297	8.0	8.0	10990452	"Our stay in Prez & Cherie's beautiful house couldn't have been better! 

First let me start off with how easy, quick and professional Prez was to deal with during the whole process of renting out his place. He was very straight forward about everything and there was no confusion whatsoever. He also accommodated our last minute reservation and even allowed our large group of 16 to stay on top of this.  

As far as the house goes…The place is amazing! My favorite feature of the home was how it was conveniently located a short, 6 minute drive from the heart of the city. So whether you're going to Pike Place, Fremont, C-link/Safeco, or wherever this wonderful city may take you.. it is just a hop, skip and a jump away! Besides the location, the condition of the house was immaculate and the property was very large (even with 16 people, there was a ton of space!). 

It's the little things that count, and i have to thank Prez for going above and beyond to make sure we had the best time possible. There were maps, locations of popular attractions in the city, restaurants for you or the family to visit…and if you didn't want to go out, there were numbers Prez had set out for 3 different places that would deliver food right to you. He made sure there were the extra beds available for our large group, there was food in the fridge, and the bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens were in tip-top shape. 

A+ Customer Service & Hospitality!!!!


P.S. We had the luxury of using Prez's transportation service. Since we had a big group, we took the large party bus into the city! This was great for our group and everyone had an awesome time. I would look into this if you are considering booking the rental space, as there were plenty of options besides the party bus like a limo, town-car, or even a van if you needed it.


-We will definitely be staying here again next time we are out in Seattle, and i would recommend this home to anyone thinking about doing the same, you won't regret it!!!

44742	606297	8.0	8.0	11130552	Friendly, helpful and accommodating!
44743	606297	8.0	8.0	12848225	Had a great stay at this 5-bedroom house. We had a large party in town for a birthday and Cherie and Prez were very accommodating, sending restaurant recommendations and even offered complimentary party bus service! The place is in a residential area - 10 minute drive from downtown, and is a bit on the older side, but looks like the photos and was very clean and had everything we needed. The hosts were thorough and communication was very clear. Would definitely stay here again if we had a big group!
44744	606297	8.0	8.0	13953974	Great place!  Didn't really chat too much with Prez or Cherie but they seemed nice for the little we did talk.  Would visit again!
44745	606297	8.0	8.0	14148929	"- appreciate that the host had been very helpful & accomodating.
- love the speed of the washer n dryer
removing the carpet may be a good idea"
44746	606297	8.0	8.0	14872779	Prez and Cherie were very welcoming hosts, and the place was large enough to accommodate our party as well as two dogs. Prez was also very flexible, and refunded us for the additional guest fee when some of our party couldn't make it at the last minute. 
44747	606297	8.0	8.0	15386517	"

We rented Prez and Cherie's house for a group of 12 attending my sister's wedding. It was a great setup - we were able to comfortably accommodate 2 couples and one mother and baby in the 3 larger bedrooms (2 upstairs and one downstairs), and single guests stayed in the bunk beds and the downstairs rooms. It was nice to have several bathrooms and 2 kitchens so we could prep food for meals or picnics. 

We enjoyed hanging out on the deck or in the living room during downtime, and when we wanted privacy we could retreat to our room.  The location was great as all of our festivities took place in Beacon Hill or Mt. Baker neighborhoods. 

The hosts were good communicators and responsive when we had questions, even dropping off a package that came after I had checked out.


"
44748	606297	8.0	8.0	15673149	"Great experience. Prez and family are great hosts/Made us feel welcome.
There 14 of us - Grandparents, children, grandchildren - the house was laid
out as great place to bond. Centrally located, we we had access to all the local attractions, sleeping accommodations were great, parking was abundant to handle 4 cars. This house is not brand new but if you are a large family, a large bunch of college kids or similar I cannot think of a better place to stay. This was a family reunion, in 10 years we will be back!!
"
44749	606297	8.0	8.0	16619296	Our hosts Prez & Cherie were very welcoming and friendly as was our communication via email and airbnb. Their home was perfect fit for our family vacay with our big group of 13. :) The home itself is a little on the older side from what we expected in the photos, but everything works well and we had everything we needed--from full kitchen to laundry machines. We came in the summer so there were plenty of fans and windows that kept it relatively cool. We heard in the Winter it gets pretty chilly at night, so the heater is available around the home. It was really convenient distance to downtown Seattle - Pike's Market, Space Needle, Gum Wall, etc. We really were fascinated and impressed by the unique LED lights around the house (front door, door knobs, kitchen water faucet, etc.) and the programmable, digital door knobs. Loved the private spacious parking in front of the home to fit our 2 minivans and having two entrance doors both downstairs and upstairs.
44750	606297	8.0	8.0	17038764	"Our group of 5 women ranging from 40- to 60-something had a great weekend at Prez’ place.  I read the last 2 reviews, especially the very negative one.  We must have stayed at a different house & neighborhood because our experience was totally different. The house is older, so the furniture is not top of the line & the floors are scuffed, but everything was clean, not at all dingy & very serviceable. The patio was great & sturdy enough for 5 of us to sit up there every morning & evening. We never felt in danger from the structure. The blinds in the master bedroom have been replaced & are just fine. The kitchen is stocked with every cooking utensil you would need. There are cleaning utensils underneath the sink & in the room off the kitchen where the washer & dryer are stored.  The bathrooms are clean & signs are clearly posted where to put the dirty towels. There were numerous small bottles of shampoo under the sink in the master bedroom. The beds are comfortable.  The downstairs is a converted basement but nicely so.  It is 5 – 7 degrees cooler than the upper unit – a nice trade-off when the weather got hot during our stay.  There is no A/C, but plenty of fans, so sleeping was no problem.

The neighborhood is middle-class.  It was VERY quiet.  The house is located about 1 ½ - 2 miles from a major hospital in a major city, so hearing sirens would be understandable.  But we heard none.  I woke up at 2am one morning and it was dead quiet (the window was open).  No people went in & out because of the party bus. Use of the party bus is great.  Rates for the 2 times we used it (airport pick-up & a ride downtown) were extremely reasonable.  

Here are the negatives:  1) The master bathroom is small.  The door to the bathroom doesn’t open all the way.  The toilet blocks it.  So you have to open it ¾, go in and close the door to reach the shower.  2) At times, Prez did not respond to a text for several hours, but he did check in with us twice during our stay and prepared the fire pit for our use.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have any matches and there were none anywhere in the house, so be sure to bring some if you want to use the fire pit.  3) The stairs leading to the lower unit are steep and don’t have a banister, though you can hold on to the wall.  Not recommended for older people who are not steady on their feet.  However, there is easier access if they simply go outside and walk around.  None of these negatives was a deal-killer.  We had a good time, the house was a great value and we’d stay there again.

44751	606297	8.0	8.0	17616235	"We had a great time at this rental. The ad was correct. It was easy to find and a ten minute walk to the train station. The carpets were very clean which we liked. A few of the beds were either too hard or too soft and we would bring our own pillows next time.

It was nice to have a functioning kitchen as we were traveling with two babies. ThEre was eight of us and we had plenty of room."
44752	606297	8.0	8.0	17822999	"Prez & Ali were exceptional hosts. I cannot possibly emphasize how wonderful they were throughout our stay. If you are considering booking this house, stop now- just book it. Prez will ensure you will NOT be disappointed.

I booked this house for a bachelor party with 15 guys, and Prez made sure we were looked after the entire time. Without their help, I am doubtful the party would have gone half as well as it did. From transportation to recommendations about what to do, they were extremely helpful. The house is well stocked with everything you might need, and there are ample beds, couches, and even air mattresses if you are concerned about the capacity of this house.

The house is close to downtown and has a strip mall within walking distance so you can be sure that anything you need is nearby. As well, Prez owns and operates a transportation company so this is the airBNB equivalent of one stop shopping. This is the future of airBNB...fully integrated services, from accommodation to transportation."
44753	606297	8.0	8.0	18109410	I recently visited with a group of underprivileged teenagers to visit colleges in Seattle. Prez was impressed with our mission and gave our group a really good deal so that we could afford to stay in the house. He was attentive during our stay and even came over one night to fix the DVD player. Overall the house is comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked and has spices, condiments, and a few staples, and it was an easy walk to the light rail. 
44754	606297	8.0	8.0	18409225	"My friends and I were lucky enough to rent this home for our trip to Seattle. It was easy to find, conveniently located and offered up plenty of space for all of us. Prez was a gracious host and helped make this trip fun and easy. 
"
44755	606297	8.0	8.0	18597016	Prez & Cherie were very prompt with communication and made sure we were able to get help when needed. The check in process was easy and convenient as they had keyless entry and we had the whole house. The detailed instructions on their posting made everything easy to find and get. The rooms by the street can get a bit noisy at night as it is not inner streets. Overall good stay.
44756	606297	8.0	8.0	19117377	Host, not responsive to text's asking for early check-in, claimed phone problems. Not likely.  The photos on the Airbnb site depict this home beautifully however, not so beautiful in person.  Be careful with expectations.  This house has seen better days, e.g. drawers in kitchen with no bottoms, no hand railing going down some fairly steep stairs to the bottom level, no indoor table that seats more the 5 people, digital door looks did not work on arrival had to get a universal code from the host.  This host apparently also owns a transportation busiu grass and parking area of the house.  Cleaning of these vehicles will occur during your stay so don't be surprised, as we were.  The good thing is the house is centrally located with easy access to grocery, gas etc. as well as downtown seattle, westside and other common destinations
44757	606297	8.0	8.0	19430893	They were nice, flexible, and the place was clean. Would suggest it to anyone with a large group. 
44758	606297	8.0	8.0	20760996	location was good, easy access on and off freeways, not far from grocery and a couple of cute restaurants.  I have to agree with Greg on some things- kitchen not particularly clean ( I had to clean up a spill and the rag was black when I was finished, not from our water spill), there are only a few eating utensils, the dishes felt greasy so we rewashed them.  I think it would be great to put in a dishwasher so all dishes could be equally clean.  Though there is a refrigerator for guests, the door was full of condiments of who knows what age.  I think it would be helpful to have the cleaning crew make new ice trays each time, some were so old there was barely a cube in the container.  I agree the access to the basement needs a rail, it is steep and circular.  While we were told the access to the house would be the last digits of the phone, it did not turn out to be so.  Luckily someone was there and could recode it for what we thought the code was, then it worked fine.  Parking not easy for more than one or two cars and when we left on sunday the Party Bus was so close to our car, access had to be across the passenger seat.   We did enjoy the limo ride to and from our destination- prompt service and nice to have.
44759	606297	8.0	8.0	20976394	Great time at Prez's place.  Great host and good vibes there.  
44760	606297	8.0	8.0	21156422	The house was great! The hosts were very accomodating and even let us check in early because no one was staying there the night before. Towels were provided for us so it was very convenient. We occupied the whole house so we were able to hang out without worrying about noise. There was plenty of space for lounging and the hosts made our stay very enjoyable. The neighborhood felt a little sketchy but location was easy to get around from. We rented one car and the hosts gave us one of their parking spots to park. We also used uber to get around to the city which isn't too bad.
44761	606297	8.0	8.0	21519461	This place was perfect for our needs.  We were a group of 13 people attending a friend's wedding, and this house had enough space for everybody.  It also had some nice central hang-out spaces so that we could all sit around and play games.  It is also not far from the light rail and a supermarket, which was nice.  Prez and his father were there to show us how things worked, and, leading up to it, Prez and Cherie were very responsive.  Overall, this booking was very successful, and I would recommend it.
44762	606297	8.0	8.0	21883697	"Prez and Cheri's place was very nice, and was exactly as described / pictured.  The house is nice and spacious, and is well-suited for a large group visiting Seattle.  It is a bit further south, and so not in the heart of the action, but a really great home base, and everything of interest is easily accessible.

Prez and Cheri were very communicative, and were easy to get ahold of.  They responded to my inquiry about booking the place within hours, and responded very quickly while my group was at the listing when we had questions.  Check-in was seamless, and the apartment was very clean.

Prez and Cheri have a lot of rules about staying in their place, which are visible on the listing's description.  I think they are all reasonable rules and totally understand why they would be laid out up front as they are - in fact, its definitely better for the guest and host to have clear expectations of each other before booking.  However, some of the penalties (e.g., for broken glassware or moved furniture) seemed a bit harsh, and made it a bit difficult for us to really relax and feel comfortable in the listing.

One last thing worth noting is that the 'registration' required of all guests before staying at the listing seemed a bit overreaching - for example, at the time of our stay guests were required to provide information such as home address and pictures of themselves.  There are somewhat reasonable motivations for asking for this information, but it seems like it could be achieved in a less intrusive way that has less friction by just asking for everyone's Airbnb profile or something.

Overall, I'd recommend Prez and Cheri's - especially if you have a big group.  We had a great time while staying there, and would recommend it to any friends traveling to Seattle in the future."
44763	606297	8.0	8.0	22227395	Great place and fantastic hosts. Thanks for being super accommodating and friendly!
44764	606297	8.0	8.0	22863537	This place was AWESOME. They were such friendly and welcoming hosts and made themselves available for all of our needs. The house had everything we needed and was perfect for our large group. This place could easily accommodate a large family or group of people. The location was awesome, clean neighborhood with stores right down the street. I would highly recommend this house for any group heading to Seattle. Easy access to freeways (I-5 and I-90) and downtown. They even have sufficient parking for a large group, which can be hard to do in Seattle! We are already looking forward to our next retreat :-)
44765	606297	8.0	8.0	25181375	Prez and Cherie were great hosts. Great communication and super easy check in!
44766	606297	8.0	8.0	26222615	It was a great experience staying here. Generous hosts, great house and amazing times!
44767	606297	8.0	8.0	26603483	Prez and Cherie's house was perfect in accommodating our large group of 11 people. We had a nice welcome on our first night when Prez popped in to say hello and an even nicer bon voyage as they threw us a little going away party. Prez was easy to get a hold of, helped answer our questions, and made our stay very pleasant and worry free!
44768	606297	8.0	8.0	27921992	Great stay! Great choice for large group who want access to downtown. House was very clean and towels/bedding/kitchen were all well supplied. Layout and kitchen worked well for our group of 12. Mattresses were in nice shape too. Nice neighborhood, house on quiet dead end street, close to shops and easy to get anywhere. Plenty of street parking. Also rented a bus which was super fun and a great price. Can’t say enough nice things about Prez – he was kind, generous, and very laid back. Will definitely rent from him again for Seattle gathering. Thanks Prez and Cherie!
44769	606297	8.0	8.0	28298824	"Prez was great with communication and allowed us to check in early, and was there to greet us upon arrival. The check in process was easy and convenient as they had keyless entry and we had the whole house. The detailed instructions on their posting made all expectations straight forward. The house was big enough to accommodate our large group and at an affordable price. It was located near the highway for short travel to/from airport, and also close to downtown. Off street parking available. Prez also gave us a comfortable and enjoyable ride to/from our wedding venue via his transportation service. 

Some things to note: the apartment basement was a bit musty and carpet damp, probably due to the rainy weather. I was concerned with some wear/stains on carpet and in kitchen as far as it impacting our security deposit but that wasn't a problem. I also wasn't 100% comfortable with the registration of all guests via their website; I felt like one person would be enough."
44770	606297	8.0	8.0	28575158	Large and clean house. Near downtown and pretty convenient.
44771	606297	8.0	8.0	31013426	"I booked this reservation on behalf of some Australian friends of mine who were going camping on the Olympic Peninsula. They had never been to Seattle and wanted to see the city before they explored the wilderness... so I put them up at Prez & Cherie's.

Prez & Cherie's Airbnb is in such a great location, just as promised. Everything was incredibly comfortable and convenient. What was especially nice was P&C's willingness to accommodate a one-night stay. They guys had a great time and enjoyed their hospitality. :)"
44772	606297	8.0	8.0	31761589	Prez was VERY reachable and went to great lengths to make sure that we were satisfied during our trip. The listing looked exactly like it was shown online and the neighborhood it was in was very nice!
44773	606297	8.0	8.0	34281097	"First the positive:
We only dealt with Prez during our stay and he was very nice. There was a case of water with our check in and what seemed to be a ""pay it forward"" pantry stocked with some basic essentials from previous guests such as pancake mix, syrup, butter etc. There were plenty of plates and utensils in the kitchen. Prez also runs a transportation company, so it was wonderful to be able to hire him from pier to door service for our cruise. The house was overall clean and comfortable. They also let us do an early check in which was great because we had a LOT of luggage, very laid back host.
Neutrals:
It didn't bother me, but the house is on a semi busy street and some folks in my party aren't used to street noise so they were unable to sleep. And while Cheri & Prez require guests to clean up after themselves, a few previous guests hid the fact that they didn't do the best job of cleaning pots, so just be sensible about giving things a rinse. To note, I don't hold the hosts AT ALL responsible for the last 2, just a word for future guests.
Critique:
The house needs a number of small repairs. Holes in window screens, a cracked toilet seat, things like that. Nothing to seriously affect the enjoyment of the stay, or that we felt the need to have fixed right away, especially since we were only there for 2 nights. I should note that Prez was clearly making some repairs so these may just be things that he hadn't gotten around to yet.
**It is important to note that any issues we had were relatively minor. Having a place close to the light rail that was affordable and accommodated our large group was the main goal and this place fit the bill. I want to thank Prez & Cheri for hosting us!**"
44774	606297	8.0	8.0	35202645	"Thank you
Our family of 13 enjoyed our stay in your home "
44775	606297	8.0	8.0	36191498	"The house is in a very convenient neighborhood, central and quiet. It is is good condition.  Prez met our group at the door, walked us through and showed us how everything worked. The home had good WiFi, an excellent covered deck, and plenty of extra linens and towels.

Communication with the hosts was mixed. There were times when they got back to us immediately, and other times when our texts were not returned.  The house can easily sleep 7 or 8, and the condo 1 or 2. More than that is pretty tight."
44776	606297	8.0	8.0	36361752	We had a group of 10 stay at this house over a weekend.  From the beginning, it was easy to get in touch with Prez.  There was no guess work as everything was laid out in detail.  The whole stay, Prez was a available at all times to answer any questions or concerns.  He just made it easy.  The house was plenty spacious for our group, and never did anyone feel crowded.  It was an overall great stay!  We would definitely look Prez up for another stay!
44777	606297	8.0	8.0	36712093	We had a great, relaxing stay. Prez had ample space for our party of 8, all the amenities you could need, and a great space to hang out and chill. We would definitely stay again when next in Seattle.

44779	606297	8.0	8.0	41916676	Our stay in Seattle was wonderful.  Prez and Cherie were very helpful and accommodating.  Plenty of room for all 9 of us.  We enjoyed having dinner outdoors on the warm summer evening.  We cooked dinner both evenings and the kitchen was well supplied.  It was easy and convenient to walk to the Light Rail.  Thank you for giving us the hint about taking the Beacon Hill station.
44780	606297	8.0	8.0	43210251	Prez and Cherie could not have been better hosts. They were easy to work with and very accommodating. The apartment was convenient for our wedding venues but might not be as close to Seattle tourist spots. However, the house is darker and older than the photos suggest. Its set up is suitable for younger adults such as college kids but might not be appropriate for families and older adults. Renters should also know that, besides listing the names of each guest, a detailed registration form is required from every guest.
44781	606297	8.0	8.0	44529786	"Prez was really accommodating and very responsive for our needs.
We had a wonderful stay. "
44782	606297	8.0	8.0	45056280	"Prez was very responsive to our requests for changes and assistance with using the facility.  The location is close to Seattle downtown which made visiting sites easy.

We were expecting the property to be more upgraded. The carpeting was stained, in our opinion not clean, and the wood floor in another room in disrepair.  Prez said the carpets are regularly professionally cleaned. There were some other minor Improvements that Prez was willing to take under advisement. Prez indicated to us that they didn't represent the house as five star. The price reflects the quality of the home. If it was more upgraded, it would have cost more.

44783	606297	8.0	8.0	45661654	"Prez met us at the house when we arrived, we had an early flight and since we were hours earlier than our check in time Prez & Cherie made it possible for us to drop by and leave our luggage which was quite extensive, as we had 11 in our party.  The house was great and so conveniently located to everything we needed.  The spacious upstairs kitchen was perfect for a group our size and included everything we needed.  We couldn't have asked for a better home to share for our pre-cruise visit to Seattle.  Thank you for your hospitality, Prez & Cherie!

ps - highly recommend Prez & Cherie and this property!"
44784	606297	8.0	8.0	50457810	Prez houses good location, right next to the city center. Drive to the Space Needle need only 15 minutes. It is not big. It has five rooms, two downstairs, three upstairs. Perhaps it is because the house is too old, it does not quiet. If any one to use the bathroom, then all the people will hear the sound of water.
44785	606297	8.0	8.0	51278992	Had a great experience. The house was in a good location, it was a quick Uber to the stadiums or downtown. There was plenty of room and sleeping space for our large group. We felt the price was very fair for the home. Prez was very responsive and friendly throughout the whole process. I would highly recommend this home for a Seattle stay.
44786	606297	8.0	8.0	56331192	Prez and Cherie were great hosts. The house was perfect for a large group of our size (12). There were plenty of comfortable places to sleep and house was very spacious and well kept. It's 1o minute location from downtown Seattle and Capital Hill was prime. Cherie and Prez were great communicators and made sure we had everything we would need to make our stay the best, as well as providing us with any information they could and answered any questions we had. We had a great evening there and would recommend their services to anyone looking for a great weekend in Seattle.
44787	606297	8.0	8.0	57418339	Prez and Cherie helped our family out last minute due to snow and not being able to get over the pass for Christmas. They had the place ready for us within a few hours and let us check out a little later than normal because they were so accommodating. I would recommend to anyone that needed a big place in the area. 
45032	611500	9.0	8.0	1988037	"There are mainly five reasons why you should stay at Keith&Cherie's place if you were still wondering where to stay.

1. They have clean& big bedrooms with comfy beds
2. It's at very convenient location: between downtown Seattle and Sea-Tac
3. They help you with transportation to/from the city or to/from the airport
4. The host is very helpful, responsive, and responsible when you need help
5. Keith and Cherie are super chill!

There are more reasons, but I rather let you discover when you actually stay there:)

Thank you so much for your hospitality and friendliness!

"
45033	611500	9.0	8.0	2045142	Although our check-in time was uncertain, Keith made sure he was there to greet us for our late check-in and also took the time to show us around the place. The place was much more preferable to any hotel in Seattle and close to downtown. Had everything you may need for your stay, including Wi-Fi and a full kitchen. I'm not one to usually leave reviews, UNLESS someone truly deserves one (good or bad). This is one of those times, I give Keith and his place a very high recommendation. Wish other hosts/businesses could learn from him.
45034	611500	9.0	8.0	2101904	Keith and Cherie were very kind, helpful hosts! The location is good, a few blocks from the light rail (Mt. Baker station) and bus lines, which can bring you easily downtown. The beds were comfortable.
45035	611500	9.0	8.0	3218505	"We booked 3 nights over New Year for family of five and only stayed one night. The details on AirBnB sounded nice, however the apartment was of a very poor standard and would need a lot of work to bring it up to an acceptable level.  Issues included worn furniture, heavily marked carpets in all bedrooms, worn out flooring in kitchen and open study area next to lounge (study area was being used by owner for storage). No dining table or chairs in the apartment.  Kitchen old and needed a good clean, was poorly equipped and short of china, flatware, cooking utensils,  no kettle or coffee maker, (although coffee maker left on doorstep later that evening).  Odd collection of old mugs. There were disposable plates and cutlery that we could use. 

No sign of washer and dryer mentioned in description (but we did not ask about this). There was no place to hang up clothing in two of the bedrooms; doors to wardrobes were all locked.  Water did not run out of sink in one bathroom.  Description stated 3 bathrooms but there were only 2.  Bathrooms, bedding and towels were clean.   
 
The owner, Keith, does seem a nice approachable man and we did reach an agreement regarding a partial refund, and AirBnB helped expedite this.

Overall a big disappointment

45036	611500	9.0	8.0	4230161	"Keith is a warm and engaging entrepreneurial spirit with deep connections to his neighborhood in Seattle's wonderfully diverse and energetic south end. The accommodations were generous and perfectly situated for us, close to downtown and the Central District and every kind of shop and service we required.

Our group of three travelers were booked to perform at a nearby  music venue and the location could not have been more convenient. Keith was attentive and flexible with our schedule at check in and check out.

One tip, Keith's spot is about 6 blocks from the Beacon Hill light-rail station which provides frequent service downtown and to the airport from about 6am to 12am every day.  This is a great way to  get in and move about the town."
45037	611500	9.0	8.0	4908032	Kieth and Cherie made my trip to Seattle both dynamic and fun. I have no complaints and would recommend staying in their home.
45038	611500	9.0	8.0	5139444	In a fun neighborhood. Clean, private place to stay.
45039	611500	9.0	8.0	5828750	Reasonable price and good house. We were very comfortable there with our big family. The distance from all major sight seeing was surprisingly short. Very convenient location. Kids loved the fact that every room had a TV and Netflix. Thank you guys for hosting us!
45040	611500	9.0	8.0	6166929	The place was great, and perfect for our group of 8 people.  Cherie was an amazing host and stayed in contact with us throughout our stay even helping to make sure we all got our spare car keys after we left one set at the house.  Thank you for helping us to have a great night off.
45041	611500	9.0	8.0	6809190	great spot in an interesting neighborhood. Lots of space good for groups . very clean and easy check in . Prez and Cherie were real nice 
45042	611500	9.0	8.0	7135227	"There was a big group of us staying at Prez and Cherie's, and I know that can be a lot to handle.  Prez showed up early to let us in (we'd been on the road for quite a few hours), and showed us around.  We were ASTONISHED by how clean and well stocked the place was.  We have rented other places before, but we have NEVER, NEVER, NEVER had a place stocked with coffee, water, A HUGE BOWL OF CANDY (AWESOME!), amenities, and so many extras.  It was truly like being at home and a great experience after being on the road for so long.

The beds were super comfy, the extra bedding and linens were clean, and the bathroom was well stocked with anything we could have forgotten.  The bedrooms are tidy, there is tons of room to hang stuff, and a lot of provided hangers and places for shoes.  We had one person without a bed, and Prez brought over not one, but two air mattresses for us to choose from. 
There are tons of dishes for use, a blender, toaster, microwave, and every other appliance you can imagine, so this was great for breakfast in the morning, snacking, and preparing snacks for the road.  Also, there were FRESH FLOWERS on the table.  I wouldn't have been surprised to see fake ones, but the fresh flowers were such a great touch and showed that Prez and Cherie really cared.

We didn't get the pleasure of meeting Cherie, but we did meet Ali, Prez's dad, and he was the most dapper, sweet, and handsome gentleman.  He drove all of us ladies (and one guy) to a wedding, picked us up on time, and told us a bit about the city.  It was a fantastic experience and made our trip stress-free.
If you rent from Prez and Cherie, I would suggest Prez's towncar/party bus service for getting around.  

We had a fantastic time, and I plan on going back to Seattle soon.  I will never get a hotel again as long as Prez and Cherie have places listed to rent.

Thanks again, Prez and Cherie for a FANTASTIC place to stay.  We appreciate it greatly and would definitely recommend your place to anyone!

45043	611500	9.0	8.0	10965821	i stayed there with a group of friends for my spring break. It was a really easy process. prez got back to me really fast too. The place is very spacey and looks exactly the same as the pictures. plus, its really close to everywhere (around 5-10 mins to pikes place, 15mins to bellevue). Theres a grocery store nearby. they also provided us with necessities like towels and full equipped kitchen too! Overall, we had a good experience while we were there!
45044	611500	9.0	8.0	12043693	Our family enjoyed their stay at the rental place. The owners had everything prepared for us and were always checking if we needed anything else. The place was not only clean but spacious as well. There was free WIFI and parking space. The place was also accessible to grocery stores and restaurants.
45045	611500	9.0	8.0	13498133	The reservation was canceled 83 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
45046	611500	9.0	8.0	14405559	We stayed two nights at this property and overall were very pleased. The neighborhood looked a little concerning when we first pulled in but seemed to be fine. The house was very clean and had everything we needed and more. Prez and Cherie were very accommodating and helpful. 
45047	611500	9.0	8.0	15532240	This house has lots of space and the hosts are very nice.  The house is clean and well maintenaned.
45048	611500	9.0	8.0	15605226	The apt was as advertised, 3 BRs 2 full BRs, huge LR, DR and plenty of places to sleep. The air mattress was a bonus. Comcast cable, flat screens in every room. Our host Prez was super cool and accommodating, even greeting us with some Champagne! (Not sure if every guest gets that treatment but we did). The place is well stocked with plenty of towels etc and the washer dryer came in handy and was easy to use! Overall very nice stay. Wished we could have stayed and extra day but we booked late. 15 mins from downtown.  
45049	611500	9.0	8.0	15876638	Prez and Cherie's place was great for my trip. It was close to the light rail, which made getting to and from downtown Seattle super easy. The house was clean and cozy, and Prez was very communicative throughout our stay. Highly recommend!
45050	611500	9.0	8.0	16312587	We had a wonderful stay at prez's house. the apt is fully furnished with everything we needed, it's roomy, tidy and comfy. Also, Prez is a very helpful and friendly host, thanks again !
45051	611500	9.0	8.0	16783896	Well coordinated and great service.  Recommended! 
45052	611500	9.0	8.0	17540766	Staying with Prez and Cherie was a wonderful experience. They repaired quickly to any questions I had and even went above and beyond to help with a billing issue. If you are going to a game or to Seattle for any reason this is for sure the place to stay. I know we'll be back! 
45053	611500	9.0	8.0	19501347	My host was at the house to greet my son and his girlfriend when they arrived first. He was very pleasant and I got to meet him when I arrived. The house was located in a nice, safe neighborhood. It was easy to park and located about a 10 minute drive to SafeCo Field. We were celebrating my son's birthday and going to a game. I only wish I could have stayed 2 nights because the house was a good place to base activities from. The house looked very much like it is represented on the website. People rented the apartment below us and I never heard them until they were leaving the next morning. We all enjoyed our stay. Thank you Prez.
45054	611500	9.0	8.0	22517031	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
45055	611500	9.0	8.0	31152301	The neighbour was quiet. The house was big and clean, the kitchen was furnished, we enjoyed using it. 
45056	611500	9.0	8.0	32306221	The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
45057	611500	9.0	8.0	33406888	I booked this house for my team of brand ambassadors who were in town for training. They said check in was very easy and Prez was very helpful. The house was in a good location and they had zero complaints.
45058	611500	9.0	8.0	34094606	The listing was perfect for our purposes. It provided easy access to Bellevue and helped us avoid any potential traffic issues. There was plenty of space in the unit, and each of us had our own beds. Great spot for a quick business trip that substantially saved the company money on hotel rooms.
45059	611500	9.0	8.0	46779412	it is a fantastic house! clean and comfortable. you can find whatever you want there. the location is also great. quiet and convenient.
45060	611500	9.0	8.0	47573755	It was an enjoyable stay.  Prez was around to make sure there were no issues but not to much to feel like someone was watching you.  When ever I'm in Seattle I will be looking to stay w/ Prez and Cherie's.
45061	264829	8.0	8.0	779355	"Keith's place was great. He was very responsive and only one phone call or text away if I needed anything. The place is really close to downtown and in a very central location. There is a parking spot right in front of the location and if you take public transit the bus and light rail stations are close. Keith also operates car & shuttle services so he can pick you up and drop you off at the airport and many other locations. The listing is exactly as it looks like in the photos and def could fit 5 + people comfortably. You can even save money by cooking at home and utilizing the many utensils that Keith provides. I definitely recommend this place. 
"
45062	264829	8.0	8.0	799030	Keith was a gracious host who left me to my privacy after showing me around and passing off the keys. This is a nice private apartment on the downstairs level of his house with it's own private access. The living room is cozy with a comfortable couch and chair. I got great sleep on the full bed and waking up to a kitchen to make breakfast was really great. Nice neighborhood to walk my dog around and it's close to any amenity you may need. I would stay at Keith's place again and recommend it to a friend. 
45063	264829	8.0	8.0	813336	This was a nice place quiet and Keith was very friendly and helpful lots of room off street parking and great pressure in the shower. Thank you Keith.
45064	264829	8.0	8.0	848200	keith went out of his way to make sure we were set up in advance of the stay as well as during.  his place was clean and comfortable with all amenities provided.  we couldn't have asked for more.  you won't be disappointed with his place.   thanks again keith!
45065	264829	8.0	8.0	853544	"The place is really nice, loved the place.
I went there for weekend travel for my friends birthday party.
Since i had separate access, I didn't have to bother Keith at all when i came back at 2 in the morning.
His place is little off from the downtown, where touring area is, but it cost me only $15 including the tip for the drivier to get to the downtown where SAM is.:)"
45066	264829	8.0	8.0	865708	The place was great, clean and comfy. By far the best part of our stay was Keith. He offered great advice on the city and even gave us a ride downtown. I would recommend this place to anyone.
45067	264829	8.0	8.0	926191	Keith and Cherie's place is wonderful and so spacious!  I enjoyed it very much, and Keith was a very warm and hospitable host.  Much appreciated, and I will certainly be requesting to stay at their place aqain, the next time I am in Seattle.  Highly recommended.  
45068	264829	8.0	8.0	933169	Keith is a great host!  He is always available by phone whenever you need him.  His place is not far from downtown and pretty easy access to I-5 and 90.  My husband and I stayed there 3 nights with my parents and 2 babies.  For the cost and awesome service from Keith (who also has a transportation company that you can also use, btw...my parents LOVED!), it's a good deal and place!  I would definitely use again when needing more space while in Seattle!
45069	264829	8.0	8.0	975705	"The apartment was nice and very roomy with 2 bedrooms, a full kitched, a full bath and even a washer/dryer.  The cable TV was extensive and there was a strong wifi signal.  It also had a great location,  It was easy to get to downtown, capital hill,,the U district and to the eastside,  yet it was in a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood.  Keith and Cherie were great to deal with and responsive to our request.  
"
45070	264829	8.0	8.0	994590	The location was great and I hope to stay again. Keith was so friendly and we hope to take the bus tour with his party bus company next time, although we got a feel for it when he showed us around the inside :) They even supply a mini bar of sorts and toiletries to use. My girlfriend had a great time with the face masks and girlie stuff, thanks so much
45071	264829	8.0	8.0	1044792	"Went here for the weekend and took some of our friends with us as well.  Keith was such a great host.  Communication was awesome, you can text the guy anything and he will respond quickly.  Need more paper towels or TP?  Just shoot a text while your out and about and when you come back, everything is restocked!  He even had many suggestions on places to go and seemed to be tied in with many Seattle businesses that that know him and his party bus company.  While we were there we also took advantage of the party bus service.  It was awesome to cruise around Seattle DT in a decked out shuttle bus, the driver was totally a cool guy; even took us to 7-11 for a ""refill.""  We told Keith what nightclub we wanted to go to and he arranged EVERYTHING.  Pick up/drop off time/spot, getting us on the list at the club, etc.  Fully TURNKEY service.  Will def. use the party bus again if we are ever in Seattle, not to mention a return stay in the suite.  All of my friends had a blast, thanks so much Keith"
45072	264829	8.0	8.0	1346182	Great place to stay...Keith is really cool.  Very close to downtown.
45073	264829	8.0	8.0	1364270	My friends and I went to Seattle to watch the Mariner's Game and found this place. The place was nice and cozy.  Also, the neighborhood was quiet. Driving to downtown was not far at all. Keith & Cherie also offered us rides to downtown and to the mariner's game as well. Overall, great place to stay and wonderful hosts. I will definitely stay here again if its available next time we're in Seattle. 
45074	264829	8.0	8.0	1453933	The hosts were nice and the place was clean. The noise in the night from upstairs, particularly in the master bedroom, was horrendous. If you plan to be up for most of the night or if you are a heavy sleeper it would be fine. The kitchen was not well outfitted  so if you plan to cook anything you will need to ask ahead for specific equipment or make do with what is there. 
45075	264829	8.0	8.0	1720984	Keith and Cherie are great!  They were both so friendly and accomodating.  Keith kept checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed and that we were having a good time.   Keith and Cherie's place is in a very convenient location too since it is only a short drive away from downtown.  The Mount Baker Link rail station was only a 8 minute walk away  which is nice for when we didn't have a car.  I would definitely recommend staying with Keith and Cherie if you're going to visit Seattle.  The place is very cozy and has everything you would need to feel at home during your visit.
45076	264829	8.0	8.0	1739492	"The apartment was basic and nice, and enough for all our needs (family with 4 kids).
Keith and Cherie were lovely - they picked us up from the airport, and helped us get to the city center.
The only point to keep in mind is that it is far from the center - about half an hour each way.
Thank you for a lovely Seattle experience!"
45077	264829	8.0	8.0	1778198	We stayed in Keith and Cherie basement suite for 4 days and 3 nights and had a wonderful time! We fit seven people comfortably and were easily accommodated for any amenities that were not first available in the space. I would definitely recommend staying here! Also, it is quite close to the downtown core and is a really nice area of Seattle to stay (website hidden). They have scrabble. Who doesn't love scrabble?
45078	264829	8.0	8.0	1836037	I hosted a bachelorette party for 6 ladies and Keith and Cherie's basement suite was well euipped for our large group!  I loved that they had a sound system, computer, games and books!  It was really great to have a kitchen with knives/cups/all-the-things-we-didnt-think-about-bringing.  Keith kept in great contact with me and I got to meet he and Cherie.  They were so nice.  We also took advantage of their party bus which was SO FUN!  If you ever need a place or a party bus in Seattle, this is the place to stay!
45079	264829	8.0	8.0	1916619	Needs a very good cleaning and an upgrade to the falling apart furniture. The dresser in the master bedroom was falling to the side, the bunk bed in the 2nd bedroom swayed in the breeze, the shower curtain was full of mold, the kitchen and entire place needs an extensive scrubbing. It looks like someone lives there when its not being rented due to the amount of personal hygene items in the bathroom. The cleaning lady was there the day we checked in and if it was me she would be fired on the spot....what a horrible clean. We also had no cable which would have been nice to watch after long days with our kids taking in the sites and sounds of Seattle. After making a complaint Keith came down and tried to reset the cable box and then left saying he would come back down in a little bit to check, to which he did not. I sent a text the following morning after we had left stating it was disappointing. To his credit he did phone the cable company who was unable to fix the issue so he set up his computer and we were able to watch netflix when we came back that night. He also came down with a card and some cheesecake to appologize.  Now if that was the only issue with the place I could have accepted it, however it was just the icing on the cake. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said that I'd like to know what happens on Big brother that night, he said sure no problem. Needless to say I didnt hear anything from him. The pictures on the site need to be updated as the place looks different then the pictures on this site. There is no entertainment unit, there is no chair at what would appear to be a table. The yard was also littered in garbage and junk. We never did meet Cherie.  Keith was a very nice guy though and very personable. 
45080	264829	8.0	8.0	1968699	Keith & Cherie were very kind hosts - provided extra pillows when we requested them, arranged travel service for a night out and were very courteous of our privacy. The apartment itself was not quite the fully private experience I imagined - you definitely are living below a household and can hear it and the pictures are a bit deceiving as to the apartment's size & quality of furnishing - but it was a great value and in a convenient location for getting downtown. 
45081	264829	8.0	8.0	2190345	Great location (close to light rail), quiet neighborhood.
45082	264829	8.0	8.0	2639763	"Convenient location, nice quiet neighborhood. My first stay at an AirBnB so I wasn't sure what to expect. Not the 'Hotel experience"" if that's what you are looking for. The place is sort of a basement apartment, it's nice enough but still needs a little bit of work to be called a Suite. Great if you're going out on the town with a few friends but wasn't perfect for my six day stay with family. Would've liked the porch cleared of stored clutter so we could've possibly had a backyard BBQ. Just my personal preference I guess. Overall the hosts were accommodating and friendly."
45083	264829	8.0	8.0	2694777	The So Journ Sistas enjoyed our stay at the Asphy Inner City Suite.  The location is perfect it allowed us to drive wherever we desired easily.  The  host were very kind and helped us navigate Seattle.  The accomodations were clean and well stocked.  We recommend the Inner City Suite highly!!
45084	264829	8.0	8.0	2882205	We had an excellent time staying at the Private Inner City Suite. The space was clean and quiet. Keith and Cherie were very helpful, always ready with a recommendation of a place to eat and things to do while we were in town. It was about a 10 minute drive to downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill from the suite. We would definitely stay here again!
45085	264829	8.0	8.0	2917293	I and several friends stayed for the weekend. A great place to stay, quiet and clean, close to where we needed or wanted to be, kind and informative hosts. 
45086	264829	8.0	8.0	3162794	"Spent a week with the family in December - 2 parents, 2 adult children. Apartment was serviceable, and hosts were very friendly and accommodating. The only thing preventing a more favorable rating is the unit itself. 

The unit is the remodeled basement of a small house. The walls and ceilings are thin and poorly insulated, so privacy is an issue. The beds (especially the upper bunk bed) are uncomfortable. The thermostat is controlled by the upstairs unit, so any adjustments require a call to the hosts.

The unit is located in the Beacon Hill area, which is south of the city center. The nearest light rail station is a pretty good hike away, so plan on renting a car (and paying the outrageous Seattle parking rates).

With cable, wireless internet, plenty of hot water, a full kitchen, and separate bedrooms, this unit is a lot better than camping, but it's not the Ritz either."
45087	264829	8.0	8.0	3523537	Really cool couple, great place super close to the heart of Seattle and a good time! you feel private in your own space and if you need anything its just a text away. They are nice and welcoming, and very considerate and communicative. Thanks for all that! 
45088	264829	8.0	8.0	5105412	Prez and Cherie were great hosts and easily reachable. They even gave us a few beers on the house. The apartment is clean and comfortable and an easy drive into downtown Seattle.
45089	264829	8.0	8.0	5630548	"Prez & Cherie were very accommodating on such short notice.  Prez got back to me the same day and communicated with us throughout our stay. He even gave us some helpful tips to help us get around Seattle.  The place was spacious and clean with lots of great natural light! We'll def contact them when we visit Seattle again and hope they come stay at our place!
"
45090	264829	8.0	8.0	5806327	Prez was extremely accommodating and helpful.  He kept in touch with us throughout our visit.  The condo worked perfectly for our family of 5.  We enjoyed the walk through Beacon Hill to the light rail station.  Our favorite morning stop was the Station coffee shop.  Wish we could have stayed longer!
45091	264829	8.0	8.0	5873346	Great hosts, a perfect stay.
45092	264829	8.0	8.0	6141187	Cherie was a great host, very very helpful and prompt. Even helped us to arrange for transportation the next day as we needed to get somewhere. The apartment was good for a night's stay, clean and probably what you need for a comfortable sleep. Could use with an bigger fan though as it was an abnormally hotter summer than usual in Seattle (well, at least that was what i was told) Its about a 10 minute walk to the nearby train to town. That was a plus. Its a pretty quiet neighborhood and the paths aren't really well done, so its not somewhere to take walks and etc. But besides that, it was a good stay. 
45093	264829	8.0	8.0	6165176	Great place!  Pretty basic, but clean and comfortable, which is exactly what we were looking for.  Thanks so much
45094	264829	8.0	8.0	6926043	Prez and Cherie were awesome host! They definitely inspired us to step up our Airbnb hosting. Their place was comfortable and exactly what we expected. They were very responsive. We can tell they take great pride in their space. 
45095	264829	8.0	8.0	8177875	"Prez and Cherie were very gracious and friendly. The place is really nice and a short walk to the lite rail and convenient to buses. Prez is very generous in the apartment with accouterments. The drive into town isn't bad either. When we were in a pinch on having to wait six hours between his check out time and the check in time of our next location, he graciously gave us more time.
Our snafu was that we contracted for a different unit (3000 23rd)  for nine days through Airbnb, and Prez said that he had to put us in a different place on Stevens and that the unit was already rented for the weekend in the midst of our stay. He put us up in a motel (and a substandard one at that) for the weekend. My wife is receiving chemo, is blind and diabetic, and we came from out of town with our car loaded for a three-month stay. It was very hard on us to move so many times when we contracted one place for the duration of nine days. Prez was remorseful and refunded $100 dollars, helped us move in the second time, but it didn't seem to be worth the inconvenience. I don't understand how airbnb and the housing owner could not be on the same page. It was all last minute for us, so we felt we had no recourse but to go along with it."
45096	264829	8.0	8.0	14841811	Good location since it is close to the train. Everything was as expected.
45097	264829	8.0	8.0	15995325	Prez is a great host. The place was comfortable.
45098	264829	8.0	8.0	16276164	"Properties were as described. Prez had very clear communication and very thorough ""getting to know you"" process including filling out a guest registration for each guest. Very smart as an owner/manager but an extra step in the reservation process. Prez was timely, accommodating and completely professional. The lower level unit really can hear any tenants in the floors above (this is disclosed by Prez prior to rental). Did not bother me as I can sleep through anything but one of our guests had issue with being woken up. Prez, thank you for your hospitality."
45099	264829	8.0	8.0	19653777	The house was ready when arrived. The host was flexible with our arrival time and one we arrived there the check-in process was easy and straight forward. The neighborhood was convenient and comfortable for my family to stay in. The house was accurately described in the pictures available online.

45368	6416765	10.0	8.0	37979090	"Could be 5 star accross the board, with some small but significant improvements.     The townhouse is modern, clean, and comfortable and is in an excellent location.   New, quality major appliances in the kitchen, very comfortable beds and bedding.   

The home is located a short walk from the transit station and it's also an easy drive or even a bike to downtown on surface streets.

Communication with Kevin was mostly prompt and always cordial.   The check-in/check-out process was smooth and organized.

The only negative, which was significant for us, was that the unit is missing many basic conveniences.    No coffee maker, no toaster, no can/wine/bottle openers, no iron/ironing board, no serving bowls or platters, no pots or pans, no hand towels/bath mats/wash clothes.   

After finalizing the arrangements, we learned from Kevin that the stove and oven were off limits.   The Airbnb listing has since been modified to remove the Kitchen as a listed amenity and noted the limitation on using the stove and oven.   I commend Kevin for making that change, as that information will be very helpful to new prospective guests.   Better yet, a small investment could be made to outfit the townhouse more completely and allow use of the stove and oven to make this a top notch Airbnb accommodation.

One note regarding the location, being close to downtown, there are also some more unsavory individuals floating around.   That just goes with the territory , but one should be on their guard leaving valuables in cars and walking in the neighborhood at night."
45369	6416765	10.0	8.0	38283979	It's really a lovely and clean house . And it's also a good condition that just about 10 minutes to downtown by car ! Kevin is so friendly to welcome us and give quick response to my question ! It's a good choice to stay here !
45370	6416765	10.0	8.0	38847804	The home was beautiful and clean. Kevin was very responsive and friendly. The location was perfect, an easy walk to the light rail. Parking was easy on the side streets. Thank you!
45371	6416765	10.0	8.0	39386007	A beautiful and modern space that was a great home for a few days' vacation with 4 friends. Close to Capitol Hill neighborhood and many other areas to explore in Seattle. Kevin was extremely responsive, professional, reliable, and pleasant to communicate with! 
45372	6416765	10.0	8.0	39757525	"Kevin was an excellent host.  Communication was clear and covered everything we needed to know.  Kevin was responsive any time I messaged him, including during the stay.  It was all very painless.

The townhome is just as described in the listing.  Everything was nice, new and comfortable, including the fold-out bed in the living room which is totally suitable for an adult.  

The location is conveniently close to the light rail so access to downtown (and the rest of Seattle) is easy.  If you're going to a baseball/football/soccer game, the stadiums are within a comfortable (~30min) walking distance, which was perfect for us."
45373	6416765	10.0	8.0	41208184	Townhouse was in great shape, very clean.  the picture advertised shows a little more furniture than we found.  Had a small issue with a sink, but the owner was able to make accommodations quickly which satisfied us.  Location is good, very close to downtown, no issues with parking or problems with neighbors.  
45374	6416765	10.0	8.0	41597430	Kevin's unit is in a great part of Seattle -- lots of parking, easy access to the Lightrail, as well as a grocery and other necessities. The unit was clean, well kept, and much larger than the pictures indicate. We enjoyed our stay here.
45375	6416765	10.0	8.0	41760829	Great house in a great neighborhood! I stayed here for a night with my family and really loved the restaurants and parks in Beacon Hill.  The home itself was very clean and comfortable...I would be happy to go again.
45376	6416765	10.0	8.0	43486645	"The host:  Kevin was completely responsive and available when we needed to contact him.  He handles things calmly and professionally. Grade A
The townhome:  The house is very nice, with lots of room.  It's on 3 levels, with the living/dining/kitchen level on the 2nd floor.  It's clean and functionally appointed, but a little different than the pictures shown.  The beds were comfortable.  There are no window coverings in the kitchen and 1st level bedroom and bathroom.  We got to see the neighbors a lot...  We made temporary blinds for the bedroom and bathroom.  There is no bathroom on the 2nd floor, so that was a little inconvenient.  Overall, the house is great.  Grade B+
The location:  First impression was a little iffy.  The house faces a paved alley between 14th and 15th, and construction was happening next door on the corner.  The surrounding neighborhoods were a little mixed in terms of quality of housing.  Street parking was always available a short distance away.  We found that this was an excellent location from which to easily drive to different parts of the city.  Easy access to I5, and it seems like you can get anywhere on 15th street.  Downtown was 10-15 minutes away.  20 mins to the airport.  So, not much of a view, but a stellar base location to explore from.  Grade B+
Most importantly, we would want to stay here again the next time we go the Seattle.  We had a group of 4 people, and we found it very comfortable, safe and a good value."
45377	6416765	10.0	8.0	44374205	The townhouse was very cool! Large and airy, with lots of modern features. Location was awesome, too. Very easy to move around city. House didn't have extra blankets so may wanna bring your own, but Kevin was more than accommodating when I asked for extra items.
45378	6416765	10.0	8.0	44525241	"A good spot for our trip to Seattle to see a ballgame and check out the downtown area. Easy rail link into the city, with only a 7min walk to the station to get the train that drops you off at Safeco, Pike etc.

The apartment is good, plenty of space and a nice modern kitchen / lounge. The place is very clean and couldn't be faulted for what it is (other than missing a toaster for the breakfast part of BnB)."
45379	6416765	10.0	8.0	46471147	"We recently stayed a couple of nights in this lovely townhome.  Our host, Kevin Hsu, was easy to work with and very responsive to our questions while in town.  The accommodations were very nice and fresh.  The location is within walking distance of the local rail system and would call the neighborhood 'transitional'.   Some older houses but overall the area appears to be in a process of revitalization.  Will visit Seattle again!  Thanks.

K.B."
45380	6416765	10.0	8.0	46774127	"Staying at Kevin's house was a very good experience, the house is very beautiful, clean and exactly how it looks in the pictures, the beds are very comfortable.

There where some things that in my perspective where missing, there where no sheets extra for the sofa bed, and in the bathroom there where no shower mats and we didn't have hand towels.

Also the neighborhood isn't quiet as the description, it is farther than we thought from down town, and the restaurants near by aren't much.

But other than that it was a very nice house to stay and explore Seattle."
45381	6416765	10.0	8.0	47639016	The Beacon Hill townhouse is modern, exceptionally clean and well-situated to explore Seattle. I verified the location before arriving, so we anticipated the 7-minute walk to the Link. There is also a bus stop 1/2 block away that goes to the middle of Downtown, without requiring a transfer. We never felt unsafe in the neighborhood whether coming from the bus stop or Beacon Hill Station. However, I agree with other reviewers that a few additional essentials should be provided to make future guests’ stays more satisfactory. My experiences with other Airbnb stays have typically exceeded the comforts provided by a standard hotel, and there were a few deficiencies in that respect.  Also, while the beds were quite comfortable and the furniture on the second floor is adequate, it appears that the entire home has been refurnished since the photographs on the listing were taken. Communication with Kevin was quite easy as he responded immediately to any requests. All in all, a very nice stay. 
45382	6416765	10.0	8.0	48187532	"Kevins townhouse is pretty much as described. Its clean and comfortable and a way better option than a hotel room if you are travelling as a family or 2 couples.
Kevin is very responsive via email and gives very clear instructions for check-in/check out.
We were staying here with our 11month old baby and it worked out well for us, I would just warn of the stairs as its a townhouse so from the living area there are stairs going up and down.
Travel to downtown or the airport, as Kevin states, is easy via Light Rail "
45383	6416765	10.0	8.0	49457350	"I've used airbnb several times now but I would say Kevin's place was by far the most comfortable place I've stayed and the easiest place to check in and out. But what I love most was the location!

My group and I were literally 5-10 min away from everything we needed to go to, whether it was downtown, pikeplace, Chinatown... It was great! The neighbours were so quiet too! I wanted this place to be my own.

I would definitely stay here again, and I can't wait to do so, and have already started to recommend friends and family to this place."
45384	6416765	10.0	8.0	51327535	The townhouse was amazing, just like it was described. Close to different districts and some grocery stores. I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks Kevin! 
45385	6416765	10.0	8.0	53601427	"Kevin was very easy to work with.  We were a little disappointed in a few things associated with the townhouse:
1.  Location was difficult to find.  Entry was off an alley which was never communicated to us.
2.  Townhouse was pretty stark - no rugs as shown in the pix, no hand towels, no instructions for the TV or the fireplace.  Kevin responded when we called him, but we shouldn't have to call him.
3.  Location is not ideal.  Must use transportation to get anywhere - cannot walk to anything worthwhile.
4.  No shades on windows - no privacy from neighbors which are very close.
5.  Off street parking is available, but not very welcoming when it is raining."
45386	6416765	10.0	8.0	54151444	The place was great, it is clean, up to date and very modern. It is very close to downtown and everything is just a few minutes drive down the road. The only drawback was not getting to use the kitchen stove. If the stove was available for use, the experience would have been much better. 
45387	6416765	10.0	8.0	55381707	Kevin did a great job making us feel welcome.  When we had questions about the fireplace, he responded very quickly and was super helpful.  Regarding the neighborhood, Beacon Hill is interesting but you definitely have to walk INTO it from the house.  Once you do, it's worth exploring.  Also less than 60 min walk to downtown.  Would be helpful to have a one-sheeter about closest grocery (Red Apple), best coffee (Victrola), etc. Best part of this listing?  SUPER CLEAN and crisp linens! Thanks, Kevin!
45739	5365612	10.0	8.0	28734818	Jorge made us feel at home and was available via text and email, responding very quickly to our needs. The house was accurate to the description and didn't offer any surprises. 
45740	5365612	10.0	8.0	39712420	"Unfortunately, I couldn't see Jorge, but everything was well prepared. The room is little tiny but very clean, the views from a balcony and a living room are beautiful. I drank beer seeing a night view!!
Access is also good both to downtown and SeaTac Airport."
45741	5365612	10.0	8.0	41869442	"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I must say that staying with Jorge was like staying with a good friend that I haven't seen in a long time. Jorge is a very warm and welcoming person, and from the get-go we were having great conversation about the city and many of its attractions. He is definitely an A+ host, and I would recommend anyone to book with him if they are looking for a mix of great hospitality and friendliness.

Now on to the details:

- Jorge was more than helpful with giving me directions from the airport to his place, as well as telling me step by step instructions on how to use all of the available public transportation methods Seattle has to offer. He also informed me of the Seattle culture and way of life, and made me aware of certain state laws that I did not know about (such as the recycling/compost/trash laws). Being my first time in Seattle, I was greatly appreciative of this level of detail. 

- When I arrived at his place, Jorge left out some welcoming gifts for me, which was totally unexpected and eased me into staying with him for the week. I don't know if other hosts are as welcoming as Jorge is, but he has really set the bar high on what I will come to expect from other Airbnb hosts.

- Jorge checked in with me daily to ensure that I was comfortable with my room, the bedding, the temperature, the bathroom and shower, and even went as far as to give me a personal tour of the city on my first night in. He was also really informative as to what kinds of activities I could get myself into throughout the city, and gave me lots of tips on what days and nights to check out particular hot spots.

- Jorge gave me access to make use of his kitchen, as well as the living room TV and the washer and dryer. Although I did not cook or wash anything during my stay, it was nice to know that those options were available to me. 

- When it was time to pack up and leave the city, Jorge was kind enough to drive me to the light rail station to help ensure that I got to the airport with enough time to catch my flight. 

I definitely feel fortunate and grateful that I got Jorge as my first Airbnb host. I would definitely book with him again if I need a place in Seattle. "
45742	5365612	10.0	8.0	42369763	Jorge is a very welcoming host with a great place to offer to traveling guests! The bedroom and attached bathroom are very private and also cool in the hot summer months. I would definitely stay here again and I recommend Jorge's place to anyone visiting the Seattle area!
45743	5365612	10.0	8.0	45023016	Jorge was an excellent host! His place is just how it looks in the pictures if not better! My room was set up nicely upon arrival; San Pellegrino and chocolate included :). Perfect accommodations for a solo traveller looking to lay their head. Great public transportation to and from the airport and downtown Seattle. Jorge provided some great recommendations for things to do in the area, some great coffee shops, museums, etc. I will definitely be staying with Jorge again, next time I'm in Seattle!
46651	2586350	10.0	8.0	14131725	Akiko and Matt have a beautiful home and were absolutely lovely hosts. We had a perfect experience staying in Seattle in their basement suite. The location is awesome as it is within walking distance to the light rail station and the place itself is cozy with everything you could need. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle!
46652	2586350	10.0	8.0	14176241	"Great place to stay, Akiko and Matt were very friendly and helpful. We really loved the mattress, it's comfy!
Parking was very easy and light rail to DT and stadium just several blocks away. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended and thanks again Akiko & Matt! "
46653	2586350	10.0	8.0	14633211	Akiko and Matt were wonderful hosts and their in-law apartment is fantastic! My mom and I had a great experience staying for the week while house-hunting and we would definitely stay again. The property is close to everything / downtown Seattle but very quiet and tucked away on a nice side street. It was a very smooth process communicating with Akiko and Matt and they were very kind and thoughtful during our stay. What a great airbnb! 
46654	2586350	10.0	8.0	14844636	"The Hosts were great.  The place was well appointed, clean and spacious.  Very comfortable and private setting. The house was easy to get to from the freeway.  Not close to downtown but very accessible and quick to get there. The only drawback is the neighborhood is up and coming.

Thanks for the great stay!"
46655	2586350	10.0	8.0	14988855	Akiko and Matt were great hosts. Super easy to communicate with and they greeted us on check in.  The apartment was perfect.  It felt like a little sanctuary to a super busy weekend.  Lots of parking, apartment had everything you need and was super comfortable.

46657	2586350	10.0	8.0	15231651	all was good - hosts were helpful and friendly
46658	2586350	10.0	8.0	15335474	Akiko and Matt had an awesome apartment.  Upon arriving to the apartment, Akiko greeted us - she's super friendly!  The apartment was super clean and was complete with many amenities including: a welcome binder, coffee maker, fridge, etc.  The deck (pictured) was an beautiful and the perfect place to watch multiple 4th of July fireworks.  I would definitely consider staying at this place again if we need a place to stay in Seattle.  The apartment was within a decent distance from a lot of places.  We didn't have a car but we had friends who had no problem finding the place to pick us up and we also utilized transportation services to get around - which was not difficult at all.  
46659	2586350	10.0	8.0	15470260	My sisters and I loved the two nights we spent at Akiko and Matt's place! Our hosts were wonderful and accommodating and everything about the apartment was top-notch. My sisters raved about the comfort of the bed and I got a good night's sleep on the couch. The towels were thick and soft and the sheets were wonderfully fresh-smelling and comfortable. The toiletries provided far exceeded expectations. The kitchen was well-stocked with plenty of appliances, dishes, utensils, coffee, and tea. Akiko was more than happy to let us use her washer and dryer, but we were so busy touring Seattle that we decided to make do with the clothes we had. The location was convenient to the city yet away from the noise and hubbub. We would stay at Matt and Akiko's place again without a moment's hesitation!
46660	2586350	10.0	8.0	15542975	Matt & Akiko were amazing! We arrived early and stayed late and they were very accommodating. The place was everything we were looking for with a fully furnished kitchen and extra room to make ourselves feel at home. The bed was really comfortable with fresh linens, the bathrooms extra clean. Honestly couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!
46661	2586350	10.0	8.0	15825395	Matt and Akiko were terrific hosts, very easy to communicate with. We only had the opportunity to meet Matt during our stay. He was very friendly and showed obvious pride in ownership of his home. The apartment was beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable for three people in our family.The neighborhood had an interesting multicultural mix of people and appeared to be in the process of being redeveloped. It was convenient to downtown Seattle and close to the light rail. Matt and Akiko  provided a booklet that contained recommendations to area restaurants and we enjoyed a meal at a great local organic/vegan restaurant and the next day had lunch across the street! We would not hesitate to stay at Matt and Akiko's apartment if we return to Seattle.
46662	2586350	10.0	8.0	15899046	I enjoyed my stay with Akiko and Matt and would stay again. They welcomed me on short notice, and checkin and communication were excellent. The apartment was well-stocked, clean, and comfortable, as well as easy to find, and parking and access were a breeze. Akiko and Matt were there to greet me, and were very friendly and accommodating hosts. I would stay again for sure! 
46663	2586350	10.0	8.0	16105784	"Akiko & Matt are wondeful people and extremely accomadating. Akiko and Matt made us feel right at home. They did a great job making sure everything was fine and Matt provided some great tips for places to visit.
I'm just sorry we didn't get the chane to chat with them a little more prior to leaving.
Thanks again for a great stay!!!
"
46664	2586350	10.0	8.0	16193721	"This was a perfect place for us. We were ready to give up on Seattle after spending the night in a Wal-Mart parking lot. We had not made prior arrangements anywhere, it was late and for 6 hours we could not find any accommodations. The next morning we contacted this listing and they were very quick to respond with a reservation for that night so we decided to stay and tour Seattle.
Upon check in we found the apt just as pictured - clean, nicely decorated and the bed....oh the bed! Sweet! We loved it but what we loved even more was this couple, Matt and Akiko. They are sweet, warm and welcoming. They have a true gift of hospitality. We sat on the elevated deck and over a glass of wine they helped us with local suggestions. This was appreciated since we only had 24 hours before flying back to FL.
They made sure we saw the Space Needle and Pikes Place Market both of which are a treat.
Later that night they sent us to a totally unique restaurant called ""The Pink Door"". We would have never found this place on our own....and it's a gem. They even knew where to go for our chocolate martini desert - ""Tini Bigs"".
To top off the night they left, on our door step, a bottle of their favorite wine - in celebration of our 45th anniversary.
We loved this place, the hosts, and would highly recommend it!
By the way they even mailed us our laundry that we overlooked...oh and we do expect to hear when the little one is born...hint hint*

46665	2586350	10.0	8.0	16260239	"We just returned home after a wonderful visit at Akiko and Matt's Seattle home.  The neighborhood was a totally new area for us and we found it very rewarding!  It was culturally diverse, fascinating, worthy of future visiting.  Seward Park is wonderful and full of walking trails and beach waters. 

The apartment  was beautifully appointed and really was the best equipped kitchen we have ever visited!!  We loved that because we did cook!  Very spacious and cozy.  The hosts saw to every detail.  Impressive!

Akiko met us as we arrived and was very communicative during the booking process.  Easily a place to which we will return!  We look forward to investigating the light rail system so easily accessible from this interesting neighborhood.  Amy and Bill  "
46666	2586350	10.0	8.0	16529002	This experience taught me to not only research accomodations, but also surrounding areas and neighborhoods. It was not a good fit for us. Thats all i will say about that.
46667	2586350	10.0	8.0	16643433	Akiko and Matt's home was great. It is exactly as pictured. The rental is essentially a basement in-law suite. The rental was awesome inside; it featured a large flat screen TV with HBO, full kitchen with coffeee/teas, tempurpedic mattress, and Aveda hair products. The rental was very clean. Akiko and Matt provided us a binder that outlined local restaurants, grocery stores, and other amenities. Additionally, Akiko and Matt were very responsive hosts. My boyfriend and I highly recommend their home and hope to visit again in the future! 
46668	2586350	10.0	8.0	16694668	The house is in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood of Seattle a short drive from the airport.  As advertised the apartment is the lower (basement) floor of a small but charming house.  The apartment is illuminated by windows, so it doesn't seem like a basement, and the space is pleasant.  I did not meet the hosts but everything was very much in order and well thought out.
46669	2586350	10.0	8.0	17362199	We had an excellent experience at Akiko and Matt's home. They are great hosts and extremely friendly. They welcomed us with smiles and generosity. The home was very clean and comfortable. We all slept peacefully and everything was quiet. The backyard and balcony provide beautiful scenery. We had friends fly in from the east coast and the drive from the airport was quick. The home is very conveniently located for an optimal Seattle experience.  We made it to the waterfront and Pike Place market in less than 15 minutes. We had takeout Chinese food from downtown Seattle. Akiko and Matt provided a 3 ring binder of information that included places to eat and amenities. We had free WiFi access and cable television. The kitchen had all utensils and appliances (oven, stove, coffee maker, and fridge). We were able to iron our clothes. All bathroom supplies were provided. All of us had an excellent experience at Akiko and Matt's home. We would stay here again and recommend this home to friends and family. 
46670	2586350	10.0	8.0	17628359	Akiko and Matt's place was exactly what was pictured and a nice place for us. They were very accommodating when we request an additional guest for our stay. Communication before and during our stay was great and they were very friendly upon our arrival.   
46671	2586350	10.0	8.0	17951225	A great experience all around. The house is very clean and provided plenty if room for 3 people. The kitchen was well stocked. Grocery store is only 5 minutes away. We had two comfortable queen beds. Getting to downtown took about 20 minutes. Would recommend this place is you want to stay close to downtown Seattle. The neighborhood has a mix if different cultures. Absolutely no issues with outside noise. On street parking was easy to find. 
46672	2586350	10.0	8.0	18321124	"Matt and Akiko went out of their way to accommodate and make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.  Everything was as advertised, and then some.  The deck was the perfect place to a sunny afternoon; the apartment itself was the perfect place to spend a short getaway in Seattle.  
Many thanks Matt and Akiko!"
46673	2586350	10.0	8.0	18512494	While passing through Seattle, we spent a few nights to tourist around. The space is awesome and was much bigger and more luxurious than we were expecting. It had a large lounge room, full kitchen with all the cookware available, separate bedroom and private entrance. The biggest advantage was the 10ish min walk to the Othello train station, which makes visiting town very easy. We had a car with us and plenty of street parking made life a lot easier.
46674	2586350	10.0	8.0	19398687	"The apartment was very nice and just like it was pictured.  Definitely the nicest house on the block.

46675	2586350	10.0	8.0	19535275	"Matt and Akiko are extraordinary hosts, gracious, fully accommodating and authentically generous.  It was a bit like staying with family as we sat together, around the fire-pit, relaxing with a glass of wine on our first night.  

The apartment is elegant and spotless, well furnished and rather ideal.  At the end of a busy day, happily spent working and noshing on the elevated deck, retreating to the cushy bedroom and a hot bath was superb.

The property is a quiet, upscale, retreat in a pleasant urban setting.  Restaurants and services abound within easy walking distance."
46676	2586350	10.0	8.0	19894492	"Stayed a total of 4 nights and it was pleasant. Akiko was responsive and informative during the booking process. The place was exactly as pictured and noted and the check-in was very fast and smooth. Akiko was very sweet and welcoming, we even got to meet her baby and she is absolutely adorable! The place was very clean and comfortable. 

Besides the house and kind hosts, the neighborhood gave off a slight uncomfortable vibe. We weren't walking around at night and nothing happened to us but we did get a sketchy vibe. I'm only noting this because my boyfriend and I were planning on not renting a car and walking to the light rail close to the house, we decided to rent a car last minute and I'm glad we did! Please don't make this note the determining factor for your stay if you're interested, I'm only speaking about the neighborhood, we felt very comfortable and safe at the house and were very pleased. Thank you Akiko and Matt, you've made our first airbnb experience great!  "

46678	2586350	10.0	8.0	20623118	What a delightful find!  Matt and Akiko are great hosts.  The apartment is clean, quiet, private, and has the most comfy bed ever.  The sofa is comfy, nice big flat screen TV and DVD player for relaxing after a long day.  It was just 2 of us on business for a week.  We could spread out with 2 desks, nice kitchen.  All the comforts of home.  Extremely convenient location.  Lots of great ethnic restaurants plus easy access into downtown Seattle.  We'd love to go back.  
46679	2586350	10.0	8.0	21260358	Matt and Akiko's place is excellent. The location is an easy 10min walk to the light rail, which will take you straight into downtown Seattle. Pre-arrival arrangements were well-organised and Akiko was helpful and flexible with arrival time. The apartment is clean, spacious and has all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. I highly recommend this apartment if considering staying in Seattle for a few days.
46680	2586350	10.0	8.0	23176747	We had a great stay at Matt and Akiko's house. The bed was super comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped and also had a full size fridge which was important to us since we stayed for two weeks. I'm not sure what people mean by it being in a sketchy neighborhood because it didn't feel unsafe to us at all. I will say that the smoke detectors are extremely sensitive so be careful what you cook on the stove. You can hear them walking around upstairs during the day but it was never late at night and never loud enough to bother. The apartment is super cozy and comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone! 
46681	2586350	10.0	8.0	23957969	Very close to my adult children we were visiting. Loved the bed! Very quiet and clean.
46682	2586350	10.0	8.0	26564315	Matt and Akiko's place was exactly what we were looking for, and they were very welcoming. We could not have asked for better hosts! The space was very clean, comfortable and private. Access to the light rail was awesome and made it very easy to get to anywhere in the Seattle area. The bed was super comfy and the kitchen was fully equipped and HBO was a bonus. We would definitely stay there again!
46683	2586350	10.0	8.0	27984924	Very comfortable stay. It was clean and very quiet. I was able to stay on short notice and they were very accommodating. I'd definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.
46684	2586350	10.0	8.0	28270148	We were only at the house for about 7 hours just to sleep. greeted by a very nice man named Mat.  Great host.  One of the beds was an air mattress and was chilly but the other bed was awesome.  Very clean place.  It met our needs.
46685	2586350	10.0	8.0	28742114	We only stayed at Matt and Akiko's for one night, but it was an easy and pleasant time.  There was clear communication from the hosts, and we had complete autonomy to come and go as we pleased.  The basement apartment was pin-neat and anything we could have needed was made available.  Thank you!
46686	2586350	10.0	8.0	29738733	Great space--comfortable and clean, close to transit, and lots of food options nearby (including a taco bus!). Matt and Akiko were flexible with our check in and check out times, which we really appreciated since we were traveling with our toddler. Nice place to stay!
46687	2586350	10.0	8.0	31214482	Matt and Akiko were very friendly and made my family and I feel welcome. They also went out of their way to help with big and little things. Everything we needed was provided for. When we discovered the owners were out of saran wrap in the awesome kitchen of the unit, Matt went out of his way by coming back from a friend's house just to hand-deliver some. By the way, Akiko helped us to find Pho and directions! Great service, nice people!
46688	2586350	10.0	8.0	32039161	Akiko and Matt were very welcoming, and did everything they could to ensure our stay was enjoyable. The space was clean, tidy, and comfortable, and we would definitely consider coming back the next time we're in Seattle. Thank you, Akiko and Matt!
46689	2586350	10.0	8.0	32222010	Excellent stay. Like a private apartment. Hosts are super responsive.  Will stay again on my next trip down from Alaska.
46690	2586350	10.0	8.0	32380030	Akiko and Matt's place was perfect for meeting with my son and granddaughter in Seattle.  We stayed two nights with a all day trip to the zoo on the second day.  We were tired afterwards and enjoyed relaxing in the apartment.  There was plenty of room for my four-year-old granddaughter to play with her toys while we read.  The home was spotless and allowed us to stay in for dinner with the full kitchen.  
46691	2586350	10.0	8.0	33978053	This place was perfect for 2.  It was exactly as described and had everything and more you could want in the kitchen and plenty of seating throughout. The bed was very comfortable and we had 4 great nights sleep. The hosts Matt and Akiko were there when we wanted them and very helpful. We used the light rail to go to a baseball game at night and it was fast, clean and cheap. Unfortunately the weather was not good while we were there and so we were unable to use the great deck and yard. Most enjoyable stay.
46692	2586350	10.0	8.0	34728043	My husband and I stayed for three nights as we were awaiting a flight to Japan. Matt met us as we arrived and let us into the room. Just as their advertisement says, they will have as much or as little interaction with you as you would like. When we took advantage of sitting on their beautiful deck, Matt came out and chatted with us. He provided great restaurant recommendations and was very personable. We did not get to meet Akiko, but we did meet their little girl and babysitter. The space itself is more than ample for two people, complete with kitchenette (everything except an oven), full bathroom and queen size bed. I can also vouch for the confines of the couch as I took a couple of naps there. The location is conveniently located near Columbia City which is filled with restaurants, little bakeries, and bars. You could walk if you had to but we chose to drive. Overall a great stay for our last couple of days in the States for awhile. Highly recommended.
46693	2586350	10.0	8.0	35084442	My husband and I spent 3 nights hosted by Matt and Akiko.  The apartment exceeded our expectations.  The bed was superb, the neighborhood quiet, our hosts welcoming, accommodating and  gracious.  We shared wine on their beautiful deck with the fire pit ablaze and could have chatted for much longer.  We liked the accessibility to the light rail and buses (short walks). We would stay here again on our next trip to the Seattle area.
46694	2586350	10.0	8.0	35323336	Matt and Akiko's place was terrific and perfect for our short stay in Seattle. The space was a perfect size for our family of four, the beds were comfortable and the decor was well appointed. We arrived the same time that Matt was coming home, and he was able to give us great recommendations for dinner (in addition they have put together a thorough guide of the local restaurants they recommend.) The house was perfectly located near the bus and light rail, so we were able to use public transportation exclusively with our two small kids, around their house, into Downtown Seattle and to the airport.  We were only disappointed that our busy sight-seeing days in Seattle did not leave us more time to get to know Matt and Akiko and enjoy an evening on their shared porch. We would absolutely recommend their house for your next stay in Seattle.
46695	2586350	10.0	8.0	35802692	We had a good time staying with Akiko and Matt.  They were very friendly and helped with all the questions&needs we had.  The room is very suitable for a family under 6 people.  The location is very convenient.  We highly recommend you to stay here when travel to Seattle. 
46696	2586350	10.0	8.0	36072890	The place is clean and comfortable! Got the place for my family when they came to visit and they were delighted. Friendly hosts even though we didn't get to interact much as we were out most of the time. 
46697	2586350	10.0	8.0	36682265	"The best part of this Airbnb experience was the opportunity of meeting Matt and Akiko who shared their home with us.  They could not have been more gracious and welcoming. 

Here are just some of the other reasons you should stay here:
Immaculate - nicely appointed - comfortable despite the outside high temps - best mattress and pillows - close proximity to ""Link"". We could not have found a better place to stay.

Seattle appeared to be hillier than San Francisco, our home. We are happy we made this our choice because the hills could become a burden to climb to see the city. The Link brought us right into the action.  Tip for Seniors - order an ORCA card for $3 before you leave home dropping your transportation costs to $1 instead of $2.50. The Link can pick you up at the airport and makes several convenient stops along the way ending at the base of the Monorail, downtown. No need to rent a car.

In addition to socializing with Matt and Akiko, we met other happy travelers staying there who shared their travel stories with us. We want to thank Matt and Akiko for making their apartment available to us."
46698	2586350	10.0	8.0	37012345	Super clean and nice little place. The hosts have pretty much everything you'd need and it's really a place you can feel at home at.  The bed is great too! The apartment does get a little too warm in the summer but host said he'd address it. Matt is a very nice guy and good communicator as well!
46699	2586350	10.0	8.0	38428715	Akiko and Matt are the nicest host you'll ever meet. They met us at check-in. Introduced themselves and were nice and offer any assistance if necessary. We chatted briefly and then headed out. Nice, modern and spacious place. Very clean. Plenty of parking. Would definitely stay again should so find myself in Seattle. Thanks Akiko and Matt!!!
46700	2586350	10.0	8.0	38581395	The Appartement was very nice, clean and well equipped. It provided us with everything  we needed for a great Start of our family holiday. Thanks!
46701	2586350	10.0	8.0	38925610	"Arriving at their home, it was very cute and quiet. The basement apartment was nicely furnished, cozy and very comfortable. 
since I wanted to make some home cooked meals for my guest, I was pleased with the size of the kitchen and all the tools they had available. Proximity to the airport was also a plus because traffic can be crazy. 
All in all I loved it and would recommend it to anyone. "
46702	2586350	10.0	8.0	39445835	"The apartment was very warm and welcoming, exactly what we were looking for.  We have 3 children under 5 and we all felt very comfortable in the space. The backyard was perfect for our kids. Great location with parks close by and the light rail. Plenty of street parking. 
If your looking for a great breakfast check out Geraldine's Counter!!
Akiko and Matt were great to talk too!
"
46703	2586350	10.0	8.0	40084707	"The place is exactly as advertised. Absolutely perfect! Both the queen sized bed and air mattress were extremely comfortable. It's about  a 8 minute walk to the train which takes you downtown and can even take you right to the airport. Place is awesome for sports fans as it's about a 10-15 min ride to safeco and century link field.

Place in nicely furnished and I did not hear a peep from the hosts upstairs during our 5 night stay. Highly recommend staying here Matt was very welcoming when we arrived. 
"
46704	2586350	10.0	8.0	41074749	"What a lovely stay.  Short of providing great weather (which was perfect, by the way), Matt and Akiko did everything to ensure a cozy, comfortable stay for myself, husband and two older teens. 
Even before we arrived, Matt was in communication with me about a water festival nearby that we shouldn't miss!
  You can tell a lot of thought and preparation went into the apartment from the full kitchen, eating area and living area to the cleanliness of the entire place.
The apartment was a great home base for all of our wanderings in Seattle and we would highly recommend it to anyone who is visiting the area.

Thanks, Matt and Akiko!

  "
46705	2586350	10.0	8.0	42301067	"Akiko and Matt were fantastic hosts! They were prompt in responding to our inquiries and easy to communicate with, which was very helpful throughout the planning process. They have created a wonderful setting for travelers and we felt at home instantly. It was so great to have a clean, comfortable, organized space to come back to after exploring the city. The deck is also a great part of the home we enjoyed. 

While the location is not in the city center, but easily accessible, it was a pleasant to be in a neighborhood outside of the hectic touristy streets. Other reviews were slightly misleading to us in regards to the surroundings; the neighborhood is extremely diverse but in no way unsafe. We never felt it was an issue to walk around and explore. In fact, walking to nearby Columbia City was a pleasant experience and we really enjoyed that part of town for it's eclectic vibe and great dining scene. However, we are city dwellers, so that is our perspective. 

Akiko and Matt are very friendly and kind hosts, which made us feel at ease. We are so thankful they have chosen to welcome travellers to their lovely space! We look forward to returning soon!"
46706	2586350	10.0	8.0	43031974	Loved it! It was better than the photos. Matt and Akiko were very sweet and welcoming. 
46707	2586350	10.0	8.0	44141698	A BIG thank you to Matt and Akiko for our wonderful stay! This was our first airbnb experience and we are now hooked.  Our hosts were wonderful, friendly and accommodating.  The apt was clean, roomy and comfortable in every way.  We had everything we needed and more.  I  really appreciated the very comfortable bed and excellent bedding.  We asked for advice on where to buy a backpack and Matt quickly volunteered one of his for the duration of our trip.  Thank you so much for everything!!!
46708	2586350	10.0	8.0	45075858	This was actually the second time we stayed here, unfortunately I didn't know about the time limit on airbnb reviews last time. The location is perfect if you don't want to be downtown but only a short drive/light rail ride away. The space itself is clean, and though we only spent a few hours there each day we all found it to be very relaxing to come back to after our busy days.
46709	2586350	10.0	8.0	45588089	This home was comfortable and clean.  We enjoyed the TempurPedic bed since that's what we have in our home.  The Link ride into town was about 20 minutes and was an easy walk from the house.  A grocery store nearby provided us with all we needed for meals.  The hosts were gracious and allowed us our own privacy.
46710	2586350	10.0	8.0	45955676	We loved our stay in Seattle, it's a great apartment fully equipped with absolutely everything you need and more!  It's a very easy 10 minute walk to the Light Rail and takes about 30 mins to get into the city centre $2.75 single journey and 20 mins to the airport.  It was wonderfully quiet. Our hosts were lovely,  they quickly realised that we were pretty tired after 24 hrs of travel and no luggage! They made sure we had everything we needed, it was really lovely to be offered a glass of wine and receive a full bottle of local Washington wine,  it was fab and so unexpected but very much appreciated. We could easily have spent a week at this location. (Shampoo, shower gels, coffee tea,  toilet and kitchen roll all top quality)
46711	2586350	10.0	8.0	46759679	"We were warmly welcomed and had very helpful advice on location and getting around. We slept 4 adults comfortably, but didn't stick around the house much...we had full days in the city! The walk to the train was a solid 10 minutes (so consider weather and how many bags you have to carry)...and the ride on the train was about the same. It was perfect for us to see the city on foot before we left on an Alaskan cruise...but the ideal situation to enjoy and explore Seattle would for sure be to have a car! 

There was a very quick and easy laundromat right next to train station that we utilized on our way out...also close grocery and Starbucks and great Chinese food in shopping center near train! We didn't explore any other walkable areas in this neighborhood.  But did enjoy a nice breakfast on the beautiful deck one sunny morning. Thanks, guys! Would love to come back!"
46712	2586350	10.0	8.0	47426957	It was a decent, quiet little apartment; older, but clean.  The neighborhood was also older...  a few shabby houses here and there and a lot of remodeling.  It wasn't as close to the light rail as I'd hoped it was, but it wasn't a ridiculous distance; still walkable, albeit I wouldn't walk it after dark.      
46713	2586350	10.0	8.0	47755065	Amazing!!! It was a wonderful weekend gateway!! we loved every moment there! they were so welcoming and comforting and just great!!! I highly recommend them!!! 
46714	2586350	10.0	8.0	48014399	Akiko & Matt's place was very nice. The apartment setting was as described and very welcoming. They went out of their way to let us arrive early and leave our luggage ahead of check in time. Everything you need is there! It is just a couple blocks from light rail into city or to airport. It is a bit outside of the city, so about 15-20 minute train or can/uber ride. It was a great place to just relax after a long day walking around downtown. 
46715	2586350	10.0	8.0	48763403	Matt and Akiko have created a lovely, cozy and very comfortable space.  A light rail train station is conveniently located nearby for fast, cheap trips into Seattle. We would recommend this very pleasant place.
46716	2586350	10.0	8.0	50198923	"Akiko and Matt are some honestly nice people.  They were super helpful during our stay of over a week for a family of four.

Our needs were easily met by being close to the light rail for traveling into downtown Seattle or to SEA airport.  UberX never cost more than $20USD to get into Seattle downtown or back, either.  So getting around without the light rail was a snap.

We cooked almost every night at the residence.  There are some great markets in the area; not to mention grocery delivery was a breeze using Instacart and Amazon Fresh and Prime Now.

Evening entertainment was easily covered by streaming video over internet and using their large TV.  Our privacy was also enjoyed as our young kids have nap times and go to bed early."
46717	2586350	10.0	8.0	55225973	This was a very nice, crisply clean and well appointed abb.  Very highly recommended.  We only briefly met the hosts because we were not around much.  But they mad it clear they would help in any way we needed it.  We will return.
46988	4105081	9.0	8.0	21494751	Richard made us feel at home, helped familiarize us on how to get around, and even invited us out. I would definitely come back for a second visit! Friendly host, lovely home, and not too far from downtown! 
46989	4105081	9.0	8.0	36297679	Richard was inviting and engaging. Great guy. Neighborhood was as he described in his welcome letter.
47566	7013085	10.0	8.0	36843239	it's very nice to stay at dane and alanna's house. everything was perfect  when we walked in to the house. i would  recommend  it to my friends  for sure :)
47567	7013085	10.0	8.0	37607570	The home itself was nice and very clean, had everything we needed for a good stay. The host was friendly and made himself available but also let us have our privacy. The neighborhood was very noisy, which made it a bit hard to sleep after 7am.  
47568	7013085	10.0	8.0	37800289	The house is exactly as described, and I would love it in almost any other setting. Unfortunately, it is located in one of the worst neighborhoods in Seattle. I did not research this before booking, so it is my fault. It is one house over from the MLK, so you hear all of that traffic, plus the light rail train. Also, beware in the summer, as there is no air conditioning (again, my fault for not asking), and visiting during a 90+ degree heat wave was miserable. On my first night, I tried to cancel for my second day, but the owners were not flexible and wouldn't give me a refund, so I sweated it out. (they did give me a fan, which helped some) Also, during my last night, there was a drive by shooting two small blocks away. Since I had to have my windows open, I heard all 15 shots, and the cacophony of sirens that soon followed, and lasted well past 2am... Again, great little house, terrible neighborhood.
47569	7013085	10.0	8.0	38046110	The place was great and Dane and Alanna were very helpful. Before we even arrived they were keeping in touch with us and letting us know information about how to get around downtown on the light rail, since we were curious about getting around downtown, and just seem to be very caring people with plenty hospitality. We personally loved all the decorations around the house. It is decorated very fun and open minded with something new and different around every corner.  This place is perfect, because it's not far away from downtown at all, but is at a very discounted price in comparison to the downtown places we looked at. The light rail system is literally a couple minute walk from the house and got us to Safeco field in about 15 minutes without having to pay ridiculous parking prices. The place was very clean and good sized and I did not seem to have any negative issues whatsoever. Also, I am not from the area, but this area, from all we have seen, is far from the bad neighborhood that I had saw someone else post about. Very positive experience and definitely would recommend to anyone wanting to visit Seattle. 
47570	7013085	10.0	8.0	38185266	"Dane and Alanna hosted us for one night. We have to say that we were positively impressed! 
Communication before during and after our stay was very good. They gave us the house key, left a welcome letter and little notes to help us feel at home. The house was well furnished. Dane and Alanna are very meticulous hosts, they left a lot of useful goodies for clumsy travelers like us ( from extra toothbrushes to popsicles ). The house is spacious, well decorated, clean and organized. We actually spent a fair amount of time looking at all their collectibles.
Dane was kind enough to let us leave our backpacks at home (after we officially left the house ) so we didn't have to drag them around the city. He also offered to bring them to the train station on our way to the airport. 
A previous host mentioned that the house ""is located in one of the worst neighborhoods in Seattle"". We just want to say that the area was very quiet, people were nice to us and we felt safe walking around in the neighborhood (even late at night)."
47571	7013085	10.0	8.0	38329949	Both hosts were there to welcome us and are warm and friendly people. The listing was exactly as described, with slightly quirky, yet comfortable, furnishings. This is a quiet residential neighborhood. I would recommend this highly. My only reservation is not about either our hosts or the home, but about the challenge of finding a restaurant close by that's open on a Monday.
47572	7013085	10.0	8.0	38557031	Dane was an awesome host. We got into Seattle later than thought we would (2 hours later) and he still gave us a tour of the house! We asked if he knew where a store that was open 24 hours near by since we got in so late and he gave us addresses. Always kept in touch to see if we needed anything and he also left travel/tourist brochures on the table. We asked to meet their dog and he is so adorable, he was no problem at all. I would definitely recommend staying here! 
47573	7013085	10.0	8.0	38756752	Great place to stay!  Clean, roomy, complete with full kitchen and washer n dryer. Kid-friendly perks: otter pops in the freezer and Mexican jumping beans. :) Decor is interesting, fun to explore. Hosts were friendly, accommodating, and available. House is close to I-5, the airport, and public transportation.  Recommend!
47574	7013085	10.0	8.0	38894073	Very special designed house. It's definitely a amazing experience staying here. The host, Dane decorated the house with lots of collections, boys room and girls room are nice. Dane is a super nice host!! The living room and kitchen are so large, you feel like home all the time! Recommended for group of ppl to come!
47575	7013085	10.0	8.0	39327401	"Dane gave us a tour even though we got in pretty late. The house was exactly as described/pictured. A lot of nice touches in the details to make everything feel really homey. We had a very comfortable stay and Dane was always gracious enough to make sure we had what we needed. 

The neighborhood has a lot of really great markets and Ethiopian/Vietnamese restaurants, and is very conveniently located for both downtown and nearby Rainier Ave, home to quite a few lovely restaurants and smaller shops. You have to try Empire Espresso.

I would highly recommend staying here!"
47576	7013085	10.0	8.0	39563765	We arrived around 1:30 AM, but Dane was still willing to check us in and show us the place at that time. He was very nice and thoughtful, checking in on us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed and letting us borrow some things that we had forgotten to bring. The property was as advertised--interestingly decorated and clean! As other reviews stated, the neighborhood isn't the greatest. I wouldn't choose to walk from the light rail station back to the house when it's dark, even if it's a mere 10 minutes, but I was fine doing it anyways. That said, it is a convenient location to the light rail if you're looking for a close place to the airport and an easy way to downtown. Hassle-free stay with everything we needed!
47577	7013085	10.0	8.0	39802734	The house and neighbourhood was clean and quite. It was exactly as described. The close proximity to the Light Rail system was an extra bonus....very convenient access to Safeco Field.
47578	7013085	10.0	8.0	40356567	Dane and Alanna's place served our family very well. And they were the perfect kind of host; showed us what we needed to know, then faded out of view. The whole space is bigger than it looks in the photos, which allowed us to entertain additional family guests one evening. And the inclusion of a washer and dryer (with soap and fabric softener) was an unexpected plus, as was the selection of teas and snacks. The bathroom is rather tiny, though certainly functional. For the price and availability, the whole experience was very positive.
47579	7013085	10.0	8.0	41103091	I would recommend this affordable, unique space to anyone spending a few days in Seattle!  I met up with my sister and a friend, and both were extremely impressed with this great find!  The space is decorated wonderfully, with interesting conversation pieces that didn't get in the way.  It's close to the airport, downtown, and a quick walk to buses and trains to get around.  And most importantly, it's reasonably priced for Seattle!
47580	7013085	10.0	8.0	41632666	Dana was a good host let us check in early.  Checked in with us to see if we needed anything.  House was accurate as the pictures and description showed.
47581	7013085	10.0	8.0	42290496	"This is a great place to stay for the night or longer. Dane met us at the appointed time and walked us through the house. A lot of fun items in the house and nice little extras here and there, like a fully stocked washer and dryer. Being on the road for two days, it was nice to be able to do a couple loads while we rested.

VERY close to lightrail. We went downtown for dinner and were there in 20 minutes or so. About a 5-minute walk to the station from the house. Just a superb experience!"
47582	7013085	10.0	8.0	43250915	Despite delays due to traffic, Alana was available to let us in, give us a tour and make sure we had all that we needed. The neighborhood  was nice with public transit just a few blacks away.
47583	7013085	10.0	8.0	43427143	"""Uncommon Abode...?"" Yes, Uncommon Abode... At first glance, the place is quirky and whimsical. Odd artifact line the walls and occupy the rooms... then, without noticing when it happens, it just does... you just feel at home. Giant octopus tentacles in the shower? No Problem! Mexican Jumping Beans atop a player piano? Why NOT!?! 

My girlfriend and I had come in to Seattle from Portland on a bus (BOLT BUS) and needed to get to the shipyard to pick up our vehicle that had just come to port from Hawaii. ALL through out the day, we dealt with VERY constricting schedules and unforgiving agents from various businesses. Yet through ALL the stresses of the day, Dane was easy to communicate with and this one NON-STRESS part of the trip SAVED the trip! Dane was GREAT! He actually WAITED for us to arrive and didn't seem the slightest bit bothered that we had run a little late. (Truth: he didn't even carry on as if he'd noticed that we were late! Shhh! Don't tell him!)
Thanks, Dane, for being the one part of the trip that was COMPLETELY STRESS FREE!!!"
47584	7013085	10.0	8.0	44010169	Dane and Alanna were great hosts. Very easy to communicate with and happy to help with anything you might need. The house was clean and a lot bigger then what the pictures showed. I loved the octopus in bathroom! On site parking was a bonus. Location a bit misleading on the airbnb map, but easy access to down town with the train. Thanks again you two!
47585	7013085	10.0	8.0	44655571	We LOVED staying in this home.  It was spotless, spacious, and quiet.  There's a private driveway for parking, a small front porch and a back deck.  The washer and dryer really came in handy.  Dane was an excellent host and always available if we needed anything.  He supplied all essential cleaning, laundry, and bathroom supplies plus more.  The neighborhood is transitional, but we never felt unsafe.  It's walking distance to the light rail, though we were glad to have a car for grocery shopping and quick errands.  Hope to be back next summer and this property is available again!  Thanks Dane and Alanna!
47586	7013085	10.0	8.0	45177798	"The place was a nice place to stay. It is well decorated and with a good since of humor.

There are a few movies to watch and pamphlets to check out for things around town.

It was really close to the Link as well, which was really nice.

Dane was very good at getting back with us, when we reached out to him, and he did everything to help make the stay more pleasurable.

I would stay here again.
"
47587	7013085	10.0	8.0	45804596	"For my review, I found it easier for my train of thought to break it down into three categories as follows;

The Booking
While I was researching the area for total of 4 people, this location had a very competitive price point. The photos of the house looked really neat and eclectic. When I read the reviews and started asking questions, I believe Dane was the only person I corresponded with and he was extremely polite, patient and helpful (I asked a LOT of questions). He had told me he was working on some updates in the house and each bedroom would have an AC unit which was great since it was really hot in the weeks prior.

The House
The location of this place is super convenient. While it’s a short drive from the freeway, the location itself is prime because of all its access points. It took us 5 mins to reach the entrance to the 5 South, and about 5-10 min to reach the 5 North. You can walk a block from the house to the light rail also. There is enough parking for 2 cars in the driveway, but what you are renting is the top floor of the house. The house itself is full of fun things to see, and uniquely decorated indeed. Regretfully, we didn’t have a dining table during our stay, so meal times were a little uncomfortable. Dane did tell me later that they were working on that aspect so hopefully there will be one for the next house guest. There was a previous review about the light rail noise, and I will say that if your window is open on the west side of the house, you will hear it from time to time along with the dinging noise it makes to notify vehicles/passengers that a train is approaching. If you are bothered by light noises such as this, sleep in the bedroom whose window faces north. The person who slept in that room said they couldn’t didn’t hear anything from that side. 

The Area
While the house was great and in a convenient location, my personal feelings about the neighborhood was another matter. It seems like the general area is in the process of “redeveloping” and “upgrading”, so to the north of the house are newer builds and to the south of the house, I didn't prefer to go there. If you need to go to a grocery store, I liked the Safeway north of the house on MLK Way (Starbucks inside). Only once out of the 5 nights I was there did a neighbor across the street have a debacle that woke me up a couple times.

Thanks Dane for all your gracious help, and letting us stay in your lovely home."
47588	7013085	10.0	8.0	46528151	Wonderful place to stay! Alanna is such a sweet person and a wonderful host. The area is safe and lovely but further from the nightlife we were going for. We loved the decor especially...many pictures were taken. I defiantly hope to visit Seattle again soon and would love to stay at the Uncommon Abode again! 
47589	7013085	10.0	8.0	47008217	We got in late on a Sunday and Dane met us at the house to show us around. I was beyond impressed with how clean the house was. They had extra toiletries if we needed them, tea and coffee to use and he suggested a great Indian food restaurant that would deliver to the house. We had just been on a week long camping trip in the San Juan Islands and greatly appreciated the use of a washer and dryer. We did take an Uber to the house because we were getting in so late but were easily able to walk to the light rail the next morning. I would highly recommend staying here if it's available. 
47590	7013085	10.0	8.0	47392838	We just got back from 2 nights at the Uncommon Abode.  The location was perfect, as we had an all day meeting at the Museum of Flight at nearby Boeing Field.  (BTW, the Museum was fabulous!) We've been to Seattle many times, so didn't want to go downtown this trip.  I was surprised to see how close the light rail station was, though.  In response to a couple of earlier reviews: we didn't hear any noise from the light rail, though we slept in the bedroom facing that way.  Also, our bedroom had a window air conditioner, which we didn't need as the days were nice and the evenings cool.  I did enjoy looking at all the memorabilia, and wondering which play it might be connected to.  I am definitely going to have to Google more about the Grimaldis!  Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet our hosts.  They now have a lock box system, so we got our key by inputting the code.  They did nicely call to inquire if we needed anything, though.  Thanks for letting us stay there!
47591	7013085	10.0	8.0	47698215	My girlfriends flew in before I did and Dane was great at helping them settled in so super thankful for the extra accommodation on that end. The house had all the basics that we needed and had funky art work and art pieces that were fun to look at. The neighborhood was a quick drive to downtown and capital hill so great for someone who has a rental car. The only downside to our experience is on Saturday night Dane knocked on the door to ask us to be quiet because they were trying to sleep. It was 2am and my girlfriend and I were just talking in the kitchen. We are both loud talkers, I will give you that, but we were never informed that there were quiet hours and it was not like we had music on, or lots of people or were partying, just two girls talking. Overall it was a great experience, just a bummer to feel like our parents were yelling at us as adults on a great weekend getaway. Just wished the expectations were set and clear understanding how much noise carries through the house was expressed.
47592	7013085	10.0	8.0	48047559	Staying at the unconmon abode was an amazing experience, the house is super cool with all kinds of props and decorations and has everything you need including a fully equiped kitchen and laundry facilities. Dane was very welcoming and helpful during our stay. 5/5 would stay here again!
47593	7013085	10.0	8.0	48156981	The flat was as pictured, filled with lovely cinema memorabilia and roomy. It was tidy, clean and had just enough equipment in the kitchen for us to make breakfast. We were a family of four adults and a baby; with the futon mattress in the living room that Dane provided, there was enough space for everyone. We only stayed one night so it was enough for us, anyway. We didn't explore the immediate area so can't say what there was in terms of things to do but there were two Safeways within 5mins driving distance as well as various eateries and conveniences. The neighbourhood was safe during the day but again, we didn't walk around and we didn't spend time in it at night. One thing to note: the flat has busy streets on three sides and it's on the path of planes flying in and out of Seatac. The bedroom at the back of the house has a window air conditioner so sound comes in through the vents. As a result that room is quite noisy for normal-to-light sleepers. Also, there was a misunderstanding about check-in time: as we were in transit that day and didn't get Dane's email that was sent around 11am, we arrived at 3pm but weren't able to get into the suite until 4pm. That part of the booking could have been smoother.
47594	7013085	10.0	8.0	48771079	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
47595	7013085	10.0	8.0	48782952	Great little place! Very close to the light rail. The unit was very clean and the bed were extremely comfy :). Would stay here again!
47596	7013085	10.0	8.0	49022911	Dane's house is clean and tidy. And he prepared something we need. We can use the whole kitchen and the laundry. It's convenient. And we can take the link just walk 5mins,to the downtown just 20 mins. Everything is good.
47597	7013085	10.0	8.0	49781082	we felt very welcome, with responses to questions about what to expect and what light rail stop to get off .  neighborhood quiet and a great location between airport and downtown with a grocery store 1 light rail stop away.
47598	7013085	10.0	8.0	50347534	Alanna and Dane were very accommodating and understanding, especially when we ran into some issues with communicating with them when we were running late. They made sure we had all the information we needed and let us know that they were available if we had questions. The house was very clean and close to the light rail station which was really nice. Lots of interesting things to look at in the house! A great place to stay! 
47599	7013085	10.0	8.0	50966747	We had a great time staying here. Dane was flexible and accommodating with our schedule and the house itself was very entertaining with all of the props and things to look at. The house, bed linens and towels were clean and we felt right at home with all the amenities provided. It was close enough to walk to light rail so we didn't need a car and the neighborhood was pretty quiet. No complaints and we would stay again if ever in the area.
47600	7013085	10.0	8.0	51597443	We were very happy with our stay at the uncommon abode. Dane was kind enough to let us check in early so that we could spend the day in Seattle touring around. The house was clean and quiet. 
47601	7013085	10.0	8.0	52030320	The home was wildly decorated and awesome! It's on the main floor and the homeowners live/rent on the basement, ground level floor. It's a great home for a fun night!
47602	7013085	10.0	8.0	52504707	Dale welcomed us at the apartment and gave us a quick tour before letting us get settled in. The unit was bright and airy as well as conveniently located just two blocks from the light rail line.
47603	7013085	10.0	8.0	53359650	The house was very nice!  Dane was kind enough to let us drop off our luggage early our first day so that we didn't have to walk around with it. They provided us with towels, and had many necessities such as shampoo, body wash, etc available for use.  The location was very conveniently located close to the light rail, so it was very easy for us to go back and forth between downtown, albeit a bit long.  A very good experience overall :)
47604	7013085	10.0	8.0	54107176	Great hosts! The house was clean and had everything we needed..parking, washer, dryer, close to train station,  etc...and had great decor! Dane and Alanna answered all of our questions regarding the house and Seattle promptly and had thoughtful touches throughout the home that made us feel welcome and comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying here!
47605	7013085	10.0	8.0	54616281	"Dane and Alanna were really great hosts.  
They helped with some great suggestions on how to spend our weekend to get the most out of Seattle.  
The place is great.  Fun and interesting decor.  
Great location. Easy to access everything we wanted to get to.  
Thank you.  "
47606	7013085	10.0	8.0	55017723	My daughter and her classmates felt very happy in your house.I wish they can come again in future.
47607	7013085	10.0	8.0	55290264	The Uncommon Abode was a good stay for us. Didn't see Alanna or Dane except for the quick tour, but that's what I was looking for, so it worked out greatly. The place was homely, a little ways from Downtown Seattle, but wasn't too bad with a car. The place had everything one could possibly need, from full kitchen to washers and dryers, and the rooms themselves had quirks to them. Overall, the stay was good.
47608	7013085	10.0	8.0	56637749	The host were extremely helpful with their knowledge of Seattle and with the hospitality they gave to us. The listing on the website was extremely accurate and their house was very nice. The location is awesome because of the proximity to the airport and to the light rail. 
47609	7013085	10.0	8.0	56959698	Just checked out this morning from a weekend stay. We really enjoyed the home. Beds were very comfortable & loved the eclect design. Very fun!!  We were back at the house both evenings to hang out and would have liked another comfy chair in the living room. One couch really didn't work very well for 3 adult women. It also would have been nice to have a small dining table to sit at to eat. Hosts were responsive to our request for a couple more washcloths. We would definitely stay again & highly recommend to our friends. Great value & perfect location for us. Thanks so much. 
47610	7013085	10.0	8.0	57160443	We had a really good time, it was a really nice central area & the light rail is super convenient. We loved the house, it was very cute & cozy. The hosts were also very helpful and informative. 
47611	7013085	10.0	8.0	58629233	Staying in Dane and Alanna's place was a good experience for us. Rooms were clean and decorations are stylish.(My friend didn't like the decorations inside the house, he told me it is a little weird. But I like them.) The house is five minutes' walk from the light rail station, and it will take you to Seattle downtown within 20 minutes.
47641	1672979	9.0	8.0	9170762	Wonderful south Seattle hideaway. Heather and Jorge were warm, friendly, welcoming hosts. Our room was clean and the bed super comfy and the soft fuzzy robes were a really nice touch. Nice selection of breakfast foods. If you are lucky you might just get some of Heather's home-made brownies or zucchini bread. Highly recommended. 
47642	1672979	9.0	8.0	14057654	Charming and comfortable home on a quiet street.  We had a great experience.  Our hosts, Heather and Jeorge, went over the top to ensure that we were well fed and well connected to all the cool places in their neighbourhood.  Big thank you - we will be back.
47643	1672979	9.0	8.0	14214531	Heather and Jorge were very kind and hospitable. They looked after us well and we hope we will see them again in the future. The house was tidy and the bed comfy and the shower hot and powerful, great place to stay.
47644	1672979	9.0	8.0	14757252	This couple has the recipe for AirBnB success; providing all the comforts of a safe home .  The location is great and the hosts, Heather and Jorge, are very special folks, as are their two wonderful cats.
47645	1672979	9.0	8.0	15779967	We had an excellent stay in a nicely furnished and very clean home. Very much appreciated the hospitality and friendliness of our hosts who made us feel at home from the first day.
47646	1672979	9.0	8.0	16118760	"From the first day Heather and Jorge were like family. 
Their home were both welcoming and clean.
The neighborhood is nice to walk in.
We would love to stay there again."
47647	1672979	9.0	8.0	18092746	We had a very nice stay in Heather and Jorge's lovely home. Everything was as advertised with a comfy bed and a great shower. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Heather was very welcoming in providing a clean space and laying out breakfast each morning. Highly recommended!
47648	1672979	9.0	8.0	18757809	Heather was very accommodating during my trip to Seattle. I couldn't have asked for anything more.  
47649	1672979	9.0	8.0	18953795	Wow, what a great stay! Heather and Jorge were perfect hosts (along with Sammy & Ani). We had an early flight in and had no problem droppiny our bags off before the check in time. Jorge was also nice enough to let me borrow a rain jacket and use his Orca card for the duration of our stay! My friend and I got wonderful sleep (the bed was really comfy) and the bathroom had a relaxing shower. Coffee and light breakfast in the morning made it the PERFECT stay! Location wasn't too bad either! Thanks again Heather and Jorge!
47650	1672979	9.0	8.0	20123616	Jorge and Heather were really helpful with any issues I had. The bus was a few minute walk away—it was really easy to get to Chinatown and downtown.
47651	1672979	9.0	8.0	33166909	Heather and Jorge were wonderful! The house was very cute, and it was in a great location. Although our stay was fairly short, we had a relaxing stay and enjoyed exploring Seattle. The bed was comfortable and the cats (which they kept out of the guest bedroom) were sweet and playful. Heather and Jorge were even kind enough to leave breakfast, coffee, and tea out in the morning for us. They're very active and have great knowledge of all-things-outdoors in the Seattle area. I highly recommend staying with them, and will definitely try to stay here again on trips back to Seattle.
47652	1672979	9.0	8.0	36563438	Wow! Jorge and Heather were the best hosts i've stayed with so far and I use airbnb frequently. The kitchen was available and had a good variety of healty foods to pick from like fruits, yogurt, bagels coffee etc. One morning we all sat at the table, chatting as we ate breakfast which was awesome. The room I slept in was neat and there was a clean and dedicated bathroom just for me. They also parked on the street allowing me to use their driveway with meant a dedicated and ever available parking spot. Some people do this just for the money, but Heather and Jorge in addition actually enjoy hosting andbgetting to know people. This will be my first choice stay whenever i'm inbthe area. Heather and Jorge, thanks for a wonderful stay. 
47653	1672979	9.0	8.0	37359696	Heather& Jorge r such nice people. I felt like as if they my old friends. They r always ready for help and trying to understand guest's life style. The room size was enough for 3 of us ( me & 2 kids) and clean just like the same as the photos in Airbnb. The only issue was the hot weather. When I visited, the weather in Seattle was extremely hot, therefore my room which located upstairs were hot as well. Thankfully, they already set up a nice A/C in my room that I can control in my taste, but it still took couple of ours to cool down my room temperature. Sometimes I should turn on the AC whole night, witch was noisy and made my throat dry. But, the hot weather is not their fault. Who can even control the weather? The important thing was Heather & Jorge was always concerned of my hotness and trying to do their best to satisfy my stay!! I was so impressive of there hospitality! I can strongly recommend this house to anyone who wants to visit Seattle.  
47654	1672979	9.0	8.0	40341052	My wife and I stayed at Heather and Jorge's home. The home was comfortable and our stay very enjoyable. Both Heather and Jorge were outstanding hosts and made us feel very at home and part of the family. The bedroom was comfy as well as the sleeping arrangements. They even gave us use of the driveway for our rental car. We were even given access totheir wifi. I would recommend their home to any couple or single who happens to be in the Seattle area.
47655	1672979	9.0	8.0	41125446	"Heather and Jorge are amazing hosts that make you feel instantly welcome in their home! Very close to a bus that drives you straight downtown (take the 7 to Westlake, final stop)
The room is great, awesome bed and plenty of space. Exactly what we needed! They were extremely helpful and caring and we loved the cats (who were very affectionate, one of them almost hid in our luggage on the way home)
we'd come back if they'd have us! :) 
"
47656	1672979	9.0	8.0	41449712	"Heather was a wonderful host.  Our arrival was delayed, but she accommodated us well. Our room was great, bed comfortable. We were out visiting and sight seeing most of the time.  
Neighborhood was a good walk to the park for us - an insignificant jog for Heather!!!
Thanks for your great hospitality."
47657	1672979	9.0	8.0	43108021	"My mom and I had a great stay with Heather and Jorge. They have a very clean and quiet home, and coffee and breakfast was ready even though we are early risers. Heather made communication very easy and provided us with great recommendations. Bed was super comfy, and their cats are the cutest!
"
47658	7388899	9.0	8.0	41008892	Catherine is so sweet! The moment we arrived to the house (which was clean and very well decorated), she seemed genuinely happy to meet us, gave us something to drink and even offered to give us a ride downtown (15mins away) as she knew we'd be out drinking. The next morning she made us her famous home made waffles and they were delicious. We only stayed one night but I wish we could have stayed longer!
47659	7388899	9.0	8.0	42008277	Catherine's home was a great option for myself and my friend while visiting Seattle. The location was good, twin beds nice to have, and both Catherines are very friendly and helpful. I hope to see them again next time I visit Seattle!
47660	7388899	9.0	8.0	42638915	"Staying with Catherine was our very first Airbnb experience. We had no idea what to expect. The house is located close to the 'Ale House' in Columbia city where we had great food and beer before heading to our night's lodging. When we pulled up to the house Catherine was out on the street looking for us. It was a very warm welcome! We chatted for a while before we settled in to our room. Our room was very clean and the beds super comfortable. It was a very positive experience and I highly recommend staying with Catherine :)
"
47661	7388899	9.0	8.0	43399735	Catherine was so welcoming and kind! She made our stay in Seattle very special. The property has been decorated beautifully and our room had a nice fan that kept cool, fresh air moving all night. Thank you again for everything, Catherine!  p.s. To be on the safe side, arrive well before nightfall. The neighbourhood is fine (we met lots of lovely people) but not a great place to walk around after dark. On the plus side, the 106 bus runs directly from downtown to right across from Catherine's house, which is great.
47662	7388899	9.0	8.0	43719421	Great host & great house. Clean & beautiful living space with friendly people. 
47663	7388899	9.0	8.0	44016935	I feel well welcomed by the host all the time during the staying. And the room, including public area was pretty neat. The location is pretty close to I-5 High Way and the airport. I think it is a good option to stay at Catherine's place without too much budget.
47664	7388899	9.0	8.0	44217067	This was my first airbnb experience and Catherine did an awesome job in ensuring I enjoyed my stay. The individual who stayed in my room the night before checked out early and Catherine emailed me to let me know that I could check in early - which worked out well since my flight landed early. Her house is very welcoming and warming - she even gave me a glass of her kool-aid which was delicious and I have tried a lot of kool-aid. The room and house were clean and nice. I definitely will be staying here again next time I am visiting Seattle.  
47665	7388899	9.0	8.0	45277525	"Our stay in Seattle was amazing.

The host was very warm and welcoming and very friendly, there was a permanent resident living in the house. We spent many a good hour chatting to them when we they were about. The host made regular visits to the house and we did have some very nice chats. Lead to a nice feeling and welcoming presence.

The house was very nice, layout was good, and was easy enough to get to. The suburb was just like any suburb back home in Australia. There was a bus stop to Downtown Seattle a few metres from the house, which made it easier.

I would recommend anyone this house, and host, if I ever visit Seattle again, this is where I will choose to stay."
47666	7388899	9.0	8.0	45523482	"THE BREAKFAST!

Our stay was great, cute little home outside of the hustle and bustle was comfortable. We avoided the heavy Seattle traffic by taking Rainier into town. The bedroom is comfortable and the innkeeper is super nice. 

Catherine is a great host, so nice, cheerful and a great cook! She made us fried pancakes with eggs, potatoes, grits and fruit, mmmmmMMMMMmmmm. "
47667	7388899	9.0	8.0	45725209	Both Catherines were very accommodating and friendly. Catherine showed us around the place and to our room and gave us a wonderful recommendation on dinner options nearby. I would stay here again!
47668	7388899	9.0	8.0	46500907	"Catherine is so great host,she had everything ready when we arrived to her house. she is very kind and she helped us a lot. The house is what we expected warm, clean and comfy. We really enjoyed a lot staying in her house, thank you so much for your hospitality. Catherine  ! p.s thanks for your kool-aid and the hot dog were very tasty. Definitely, it is a really nice place to stay in Seattle.

47670	7388899	9.0	8.0	50418388	"We had a great stay at Catherine's place. We arrived in the evening when catherine was out but there was a number to call and we got into the house with no problem. The house was clean and as described. Catherine came to see us in the morning as we had got back late the previous night, to make sure she caught us before we left. We were offered breakfast but declined as we were running out but there was some cake left out for us all the same!

There were some other air bnb-ers staying so we were sharing the bathroom but that was no problem.

For a comfortable, easy stay in Seattle I would recommend Catherine's place. Thank you!"
47671	7388899	9.0	8.0	51415670	"Catharine was a wonderful host. She doesn't live on site but is readily available.  The house is very quite and Catharine came by and us a delicious breakfast! She also allowed us to store some of our groceries in the fridge and freezer during a stay. 

Just a side note, there is no TV or a hair dryer but there is wireless internet. The bus stop is just down the hill from the house near the Safeway (grocery store) and takes roughly 25-30 min to get to Pike Place Market/downtown area. Uber and Lyft are both in the area and will run you $40-$50 one way. "
47757	4708075	10.0	8.0	33203637	Catherine was the perfect host.  She made us feel welcome the second we stepped into the house.  It was immaculate and very homey.  We had the whole run of the place.  The property was a rental which was occupied by another Catherine who was equally hospitable.  We enjoyed talking with them.  Catherine not only gave us directions we needed for getting to the light rail but also drove us the various routes to get there.  She also offered us breakfast of waffles for the next day and even took us to the air port.  Best host ever.

My husband and I had just moved to Seattle and needed a place while we searched for an apartment. I don't think we could have gotten luckier! Their home is right by bus stops in Rainer Beach, the hosts are extremely comforting and sweet, and their house is so nice! The room you get is upstairs and has a comfy queen  bed and two chairs along with a dresser and a closet. They made us feel so at home! We had to cut our stay short because we did end up finding a place but we miss them and their home. This was a WONDERFUL introduction to Seattle!!"
47759	4708075	10.0	8.0	38829414	We stayed at Catherine's place for six weeks while my husband did an internship in the area. It was really a nice place, looks better in person than the pictures, the room had a lot of light. The room itself was nice, plenty of room plus closet and drawers. We had access to the kitchen and were sharing a bathroom with another person. Another Catherine lives in the home and she was wonderful and helpful. The host didn't live there but visits occasionally, has her own key. She was nice and cooked us waffles and gumbo, very hospitable. I would recommend this place as long as you're okay with being social. Best part was the  place was right on a few bus lines that take you straight to downtown Seattle.
47760	4708075	10.0	8.0	39353448	The host was very welcoming and offered us lots of tasty food. This was a last minute booking for us, and she was very accommodating. Seattle was oddly hot, but the host went out and bought a box fan just to make us more comfortable. The house looks as advertised and was clean. The neighborhood is about 15ish minutes outside of Seattle by car. The area wasn't the nicest, but that was our only complaint.
47761	4708075	10.0	8.0	39577052	Catherine was really welcoming, helpful, and full of energy. A pleasure to stay at her place. 
47762	4708075	10.0	8.0	39965960	Catherine was a lovely host! My friend and I enjoyed our stay in the room provided and would happily return. We were made some delicious waffles the first morning, and Catherine and Catherine were warm and friendly. The bus stop was just down the road which made our trips to downtown easy, and the neighbourhood seemed fine. Didn't spend a lot of time in the Rainier area, but next time we'll have to see the nearby Kubota Gardens which Catherine suggested to us! 
47763	4708075	10.0	8.0	42491047	Both Catherine's were very nice, social, and inviting.  The neighborhood wasn't great but it was near a very nice area with a pretty good pizza place that had a good view of the lake.  There was a small issue when I arrived regarding having someone there to let me in, but it was a happy accident because that allowed me time to explore the area on my motorcycle and what led to me finding a pretty solid pizza at a little joint down the road.  The house (and hosts) were very inviting and warm, and the room was very clean.  my only complaint about the room was the road noise due to being on a busy street and having to keep the window open because of the unusual heat wave.  Overall I very much enjoyed my stay, and my visit with the Catherine's, and will definitely stay here again.
47764	4708075	10.0	8.0	43167842	"Catherine was very welcoming. She answered all our questions, had some good tips and was very helpful. The room is nice and the house is just a few minutes from a bus stop and super markets. The bus ride takes a while, but the price is very accommodating for those looking for the ""Seattle experience"" without the ""Seattle money"" like ourselves. "
47765	4708075	10.0	8.0	44393043	Catherine is very kind. Wonderfully hospitable, introduced me to her family. She reminded me what real Soul Food tastes like. Thank you!
47766	4708075	10.0	8.0	44508782	Catherine was really nice! She was quite welcoming when we arrived and made us feel right at home. The home itself is very cozy. A nice dining room, a good kitchen, and two comfortable rooms upstairs. We only stayed for 1 night but would definitely stay here again when we're back in the neighborhood.
47767	4708075	10.0	8.0	45432425	Catherine was a lovely hostess. She cooked us a wonderful southern breakfast.
47768	4708075	10.0	8.0	49102914	My husband and I stayed at Catherine's for one month during our relocation to WA. It's always stressful to be 'in-between,' but we were lucky to pick the perfect place to spend that time! Our bed was comfortable, our closet had ample space for our extra belongings, the kitchen was well-equipped, and the location was great for travel both into Seattle and all points South/West. Catherine One (owner) was on top of her duties as a host -- we saw her every morning when she came to clean the house and set up for guests in the other room. Catherine Two was fun to hang out with over dinner and she was always bringing home treats for us to try. Both were warm, welcoming, generous, and flexible. This is a great, cheap place if you're just in town for the night, but I'd also recommend it to those who need something longer-term.
47769	4708075	10.0	8.0	50490576	nice host and warm house
47770	3859882	10.0	8.0	18834523	"Joan and Markos were the perfect host! The house itself is super cool, and it's situated right next to Lake Washington. Markos was a great host and made sure that we were comfortable at all times. He is an excellent Sculptor and gardener.  The garden was absolutely beautiful — it was relaxing to wake up and sit outside with a fresh cup of coffee before heading out for the day. Markos often joined us for breakfast and we had some great conversations.

The light rail and bus stations are relatively close to the house. Although, if possible, I would recommend renting a car. It's about a 25 minute walk to the light rail station; the bus stop is much closer. We ended up taking Uber the last two days to save time. Markos was very nice and picked us up from the light rail station  when we arrived (and we arrived around midnight)  and he also drove us to the station one of the days. 

Overall, I would recommend this house. The price is great and they're very accommodating. I only wish we could have stayed longer to see more of the city and enjoy the beautiful location!

Thanks again Joan and Markos!"
47771	3859882	10.0	8.0	35827998	Joan and Markos are longtime residents of the area, and were great about sharing their insider knowledge of good places to eat, and things to do and see. They were very warm, accommodating hosts, and made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived. Their spacious, stately home is perched on a hill with an excellent view of Lake Washington from the secluded backyard garden patio. The large room we rented had all the comforts: its own adjoining bathroom, speedy wireless, and a really comfortable bed. This was our first experience with Airbnb so we weren’t sure what to expect. Joan and Markos have certainly set a hospitality standard! It was a pleasure meeting you both and we look forward to staying with you again. Highly recommended!
47772	3859882	10.0	8.0	36294494	Great private room with large bathroom! With fresh coffees daily :) About a mile from light rail, with a car or lyft it's easy to get to all parts of Seattle! Thanks Joan and Markos! 
47773	3859882	10.0	8.0	36815494	I would never hesitate to recommend this place. Joan and Markos are the best host I have ever met. They are easy-going and quite helpful. We spent 4 nights there and I really enjoy staying with them, even more than the city itself. Beautiful yard, lovely puppy,  unforgettable lakeview and clean house. I would say this is absolutely anothet attraction in Seattle you should not miss. Thank you Joan and Markos!
47856	7902068	9.0	8.0	43597060	The most comfortable bed in Seattle! 
47857	7902068	9.0	8.0	43731937	It was good . 1 bathroom  for 3 rooms  but the breakfast was a good Bonus!!!!
47858	7902068	9.0	8.0	44842097	We stayed in his place for 6 nights and didn't meet Dario, just Armanda, his roommate. Room was nice and comfortable but there is just one bathroom for all in the house. Breakfast is a very good bonus and it's a good neighbourhood, recommend to stay here. Thanks.
47859	7902068	9.0	8.0	45183151	"The stay at Amanda's house was awsame. A late arrival was no problem for Dario and Amanda. They are so lovely hoest's and we could use everything in the house. 
The bus line 7 stops only a few meters next to the house and brings you straight to downtown. 
Amanda gave us a lot of tips for Seattle. 
Thanks for the beer... ;) "
47860	7902068	9.0	8.0	45909693	Comfortable, clean and quiet. 10 min drive from airport
47861	7902068	9.0	8.0	46078505	My room was beautiful and comfortable. Amanda was a great host and made me feel very welcome.  Being able to interact with host and guests made my stay better than any hotel could.  Would recommend this!
47862	7902068	9.0	8.0	46839924	Very nice place. I will return next time. 
47863	7902068	9.0	8.0	47865207	Good stay here. Recommended.
47864	7902068	9.0	8.0	47945112	I had a fantastic time!! Thank you so much!! I felt very welcome!! Amanda was very helpful!! What a sweetheart!! This place was exactly what i needed to end my long travels!! It was very relaxed, breakfast was great and atmosphere was fantastic!! I would love to come back some day!!
47865	7902068	9.0	8.0	48975008	Very comfortable and safe stay.
47866	7902068	9.0	8.0	49745732	Amanda, who works in the house was very helpful and welcoming. She made sure we had everything we needed during our stay and myself and a mate spent with the evening with her having a fire outside which was cool! The room was nice, the bed was great and it's so useful having a kitchen to cook, which was also stocked with breakfast items which was a great help!
47867	7902068	9.0	8.0	50042958	Clean place, decent location, comfortable bed and good kitchen.
47868	7902068	9.0	8.0	50715998	Dario's roommate, Amanda, was very friendly and helpful! The house has many rooms and guests, but everyone did their part to keep the common areas clean. I enjoyed my time there so much that I extended my stay twice.  
47869	7902068	9.0	8.0	50898311	Amanda was a helpful host. The room was cosy and clean, and the bed was really comfy. This home is in a quiet neighbourhood about a 20 minute drive from downtown. Note there are 4 rooms available for rent, and only one bathroom, but it all worked out fine, even when it was a full house. I would stay here again. Note address: it's a bit hard to read the last digit as a 7, looks more like a 1.
47870	7902068	9.0	8.0	51491799	The house is good and the location is good too, however we never get a chance to meet Dario which is quite a pity because we were both very busy.
47871	7902068	9.0	8.0	52186742	The listing was accurate. My host was great and the neighborhood was great.
47932	6249164	10.0	8.0	34481419	This was a really great experience! Great conversations and company. I would definitely recommend this bnb for anyone looking for pleasant people with unique interests.
47933	6249164	10.0	8.0	34994652	This was my first Airbnb stay, and it was absolutely wonderful. Judith was so welcoming and really just made me feel like one of the family. If you are new to Seattle, she will give you tons of suggestions for things to do, places to go, and how to get there. The room was exactly as described and pictured; the house is very colorful and full of art, literature, and light. Their dog, Mocha, is very sweet and easy to make friends with. I highly recommend this host!
47934	6249164	10.0	8.0	36224041	I really enjoyed my stay here. The hosts are both very kind and likeable people, the room feels very secluded and quiet, especially when you are the only guest, which was most of my stay, and everything was really clean. I can't emphasize enough what nice, interesting people the hosts are.
47935	6249164	10.0	8.0	36986147	I have absolutely loved staying with Judith and Gary this week! I am in the middle of a two week class in Seattle, and since I live about 100 miles away, I was looking for a quiet, cozy place to spend my nights  during the week. My first week was absolutely perfect, and I found the room to be just as described and pictured. The neighborhood is quiet and friendly, and I looked forward to reading and having a cup of tea in the yard every evening. Judith and Gary are hospitable and friendly, and my morning cup of coffee with Judith and sweet pup Mocha were filled with stimulating conversation and friendly exchanges. I really feel as though I've been staying with old friends! I have one week of school left and am looking forward to 4 more nights staying with these lovely people. 
47936	6249164	10.0	8.0	37771435	After my second week of staying with Judith and Gary, I stand by what I said in my earlier review. They are kind-hearted, welcoming, and friendly. I felt as though I could have my privacy after a long day of class, but also that they were there to have pleasant conversation with in the evenings and mornings. I would definitely stay here again, anytime. Comfortable bed, nice neighborhood, and great vibe. Hope to see you all again soon! 
47937	6249164	10.0	8.0	38212756	My first Airbnb experience was great, thanks to Judy and her husband. Their room had all that I needed. In addition, I was provided with plenty of guides/magazines for my stay in Seattle. It was also nice to have Judy give me tips to commuting to downtown. 
47938	6249164	10.0	8.0	39164448	"I had a fantastic time staying with Judith and Gary. They made me feel very welcome in their lovely home and I thoroughly enjoyed my time with them. My room was very comfortable with the bathroom right next door. 

Judith was very kind and picked me and my big bag up from the tram stop on a hot day. She gave me lots of suggestions for sightseeing  - it was nice to chat to her over the tasty breads and jams she set out in the morning.  

After a busy day downtown it was nice to share my experiences before chilling out in my room. I paticularly enjoyed watching a bit of tv with both of them one evening. 

Special mention to Mocha the dog - the supervisor of the house!
"
47939	6249164	10.0	8.0	41242226	This was a lovely stay.  The room is just as pictured with personal, homey touches, lots of local travel info and a great welcome binder.  Judith was a most welcoming, kind and caring host!  She stayed up late for my arrival and set up the coffeemaker (with a handy travel cup) so I could brew & take a along coffee when she heard I'd be leaving very early one morning.  Thank you Judith!
47940	6249164	10.0	8.0	41809741	Judith was very accommodating & sweet. Beautiful & comfortable home for a great price. Thank you!
47941	6249164	10.0	8.0	42332224	Very friendly and helpful hostess.  Described the area very well, places to visit and to eat.  Comfortable room.  Good bathroom.  Easy to access the house.  Coffee or tea available in the morning.
47942	6249164	10.0	8.0	43289158	"Staying here was the one of the best choice I made in this trip. Judith and Gary have a sweet and beautiful place in a quiet neighborhood. Home feeling comfortable bedding and bathroom's shiny. There was a closet space for me to hang my clothes. They know the city so well and they were giving so much useful advises. You'll have all the maps and and information like attraction guides in your room as well as the living room. 

I had perfect coffee every morning in their kitchen with a nice view. The house's filled with art pieces and great books, lights set with great atmosphere (of course). I felt more than welcomed with all the chatting we had and assistance they gave me during the stay, also the interactions with Mocha (the smart dog with a lovely character).

The location is good, I've tried buses to downtown and transportation with lightrail, both reliable. Uber pick up will be around 3~7mins. There are local restaurants and cafes on the way down to community center, recommend ""Jude's Old Town"" and ""Nate's Wings and Waffles"". It's a pity I never get the chance to try ""Red Wing Cafe"". The Kubota Garden nearby is a refreshing place to take a walk.

Thank you Judith and Gary (and Mocha) for treated me so well and sharing all the stuff with me, it was really nice and I appreciate it. Hope I can visit you again soon."
47943	6249164	10.0	8.0	43829843	Judith was an amazing host and I felt so welcomed in her home. She provided great tips that saved me from being late to a wedding. I wish I could have stayed there longer and I will definitely stay there again if I am in Seattle. 
47944	6249164	10.0	8.0	45383573	My hosts Judith & Gary were welcoming and kind, relaxed and authentic, generous and thoughtful. Got along pretty well with Mocha too! I loved staying in their cozy, comfortable home and enjoyed my time there, with the lake just minutes away. The neighborhood is up and coming, but feels pretty safe. With bus routes nearby, you can easily get to the city in well under an hour.
47945	6249164	10.0	8.0	47430125	Judith and her husband were wonderful host , it's so warm and comfortable to be there of their lovely home. They shared the house with welcome smile and many kind of details to treated me like a old friend, the delicious dinner the sweet cakes the wonderful communications, all of that made me feel that I had a great time to stay with them , it's a really nice place to stay when you are looking for a place in Seattle .
47946	6249164	10.0	8.0	48032763	"The room was just what I expected. The bathroom was convenient and I was the only person using it, since their other room wasn't rented.  
The hosts sleep on the lower level, so it felt very private. 
The house was clean and homey. Very creatively decorated with a lot of Judith's artwork.
The neighborhood was quiet and fairly safe."
47947	6249164	10.0	8.0	49148290	Judith and Gary were very warm and welcoming both before and upon my arrival. As I had been up since 3am, I immediately went to bed and did not really get a change to converse with them until two days later, and they were both delightful people. As I travel to the Seattle area often, I hope to stay with them again soon.
47948	6249164	10.0	8.0	53162904	This was my third time staying with Judith, Gary, and Mocha and of course they were as hospitable as ever. I felt very welcome and enjoyed the dynamic conversation and candlelight. The room is cozy and the bed comfortable. I will stay here again if I have the opportunity. Thank you! Can't wait to see you again soon :) 
49227	8952253	10.0	8.0	55135257	Great place for a first timer! Huge bang for your buck! Most hotels could not have accommodated us as well as they did. Host was very easy to communicate with and was very clear on expectations. The home looks exactly like the pictures, but the bedroom is bigger than pictured. Great location. Walking distance to the light rail. Very cozy and perfect for my family of four. It's a little drafty at night, but there were space heaters and extra blankets for us. So hospitable that I'd love to stay again in the near future. They really set the bar for any other air bnb we book from now on. 
49228	8952253	10.0	8.0	57577396	What a wonderful home. The kitchen is a cooks dream! We loved our stay!
49566	2980762	9.0	8.0	16132643	Lovely time in Kim's home! She was very hospitable and made sure I had the information I needed for a great stay. Her home and neighborhood were very quiet and restful.
49567	2980762	9.0	8.0	16192250	"Kim was a great host. The bedroom and bathroom were both clean and well kept. Her pets are both very relaxed and calm. She was very flexible in her schedule for when I arrived and left. 

Look in the neighborhood for Awash to get some yummy Ethiopian food. "
49568	2980762	9.0	8.0	16369023	Kim was a really great host, and the room and bed were good. Kim was helpful in giving us advice on places to visit, and she is a really good communicator in terms of how to get in/out, time of arrival, do's/dont's in the house, etc. The private bathroom and bedroom were both clean and supplied with things like kleenex, TP, towels, shampoo/conditioner/soap, and ample bedding/pillows. The room is indeed down some steep steps, but not a problem for most people. We would definitely stay with Kim again in the future.
49569	2980762	9.0	8.0	16527695	Kim was really accommodating. She gave us restaurant recommendations and was in touch to coordinate giving us a key on arrival. The room (with double-bed) and adjacent bathroom was very clean and tastefully decorated. Kim even gave us a lift to the bus stop on our way back. The house was about 30 minutes out of the city centre but there is a strip of cute restaurants which are about a 15 minute walk away and a bus that is fairly frequent. 
49570	2980762	9.0	8.0	16596756	I would absolutely recommend Kim's place to others, she was considerate and easy going.  The room was clean and had all the conveniences of home!
49571	2980762	9.0	8.0	17374401	"Kim has her hosting act well together, especially for a relative newcomer to AirBnB. Her space is exactly as described, it's thoughtfully organized for travelers and she has the type of chill personality that makes for a good ""innkeeper."" It's got a good location for SE Seattle, halfway between beautiful Seward Park and the hip Columbia City neighborhood. Her dog Olive is still getting used to visitors and does tend to announce your entry, but she's an old sweetie and isn't any trouble."
49572	2980762	9.0	8.0	17599598	Kim was great during our stay. We were out and about most of the time but the space was great. Clean and comfy!
49573	2980762	9.0	8.0	28003173	Kim greeted me and was kind, the house exactly as described.  The two pets were there but not intrusive, the bathroom and bedroom perfect.  I loved how cozy the bedroom was and the shower: nice and hot.  Very private and just as described.  The location was perfect for me and what a nice area of Seattle to be in and for exploring!
49574	2980762	9.0	8.0	34336279	I appreciated Kim's friendliness and communication throughout my stay.  The space was comfortable, quiet, and the pets were never, ever a problem.  
49575	2980762	9.0	8.0	34674538	We enjoyed our stay at Kim's house. The room is exactly as pictured and very comfy and spacious. Also the private bathroom just across the hall was very nice and clean. Kim's pets are sweethearts and very easy to be around. They leave their fur everywhere, so guests have to prepare for that. Other than that, the house is very clean. The area is nice and quiet, very close to a nice park surrounded by water. We had a car, so going to the city was easy. There are nice cafés and restaurants nearby. Kim is nice and easy going and happy to assist with recommendations. 
49576	2980762	9.0	8.0	35521070	Kim is a great host, clean place and is close to downtown and quite a few restaurants in the vicinity for dinner. Parking is handy at her place if you drive and have a car.
49577	2980762	9.0	8.0	35711162	Kim's place was just as described.  We found it very easy to get to the city by both bus and light rail.  Our bed was comfortable and everything was clean.  Kim was very accommodating and friendly.  
49578	2980762	9.0	8.0	37397155	Kim was a friendly and inviting host. I would not hesitate to stay again and I would recommend Kim's airbnb to all of my friends.  Our favorite aspect of Kim's accommodation for us was the privacy of the downstairs guest space. This was exactly as described and exactly what we were looking for.  Kim graciously made space for us when we purchased a few items at the grocery store. We enjoyed meeting Kim's pets too. They were perfectly behaved as described.
49579	2980762	9.0	8.0	38164589	Kim was a great host! The room and bathroom were updated, clean and well decorated. The location was great, just up the road from the main street with good coffee and food!
49580	2980762	9.0	8.0	38636642	"Me and my husband stayed at Kim´s place for four nights. The room was small, but nice and clean. Big plus is private bathroom and a parking place in front of the house. Most of our time we were out - hiking or exploring the city, so we met Kim only at the mornings and evenings. Kim is very friendly and welcoming. If we needed something she was always helpful.
We simply love her pets Olive & Rabbit !
Thank you for super time in Seattle :-)"
49581	2980762	9.0	8.0	38925536	Kim graciously hosted my girlfriend and I for two nights. Her location was wonderfully kept and quite private, just what we needed. We also enjoyed exploring the neighborhood thanks to her recommendations. Thank you Kim for q great base from which to explore Seattle and the surrounding areas!
49582	2980762	9.0	8.0	39813548	"Kim has a nice house in a nice quiet neighborhood. We stayed in the downstairs room with private bath, it was just as described. It was very nice and private. Kim was a great host and gave us a great dinner recommendation for Mexican food. 
"
49583	2980762	9.0	8.0	40846605	This was our first time staying at an Airbnb listing and we were completely happy with the experience.  The room is nicely situated and everything was great.  Kim is an excellent host and she made us feel right at home.
49584	2980762	9.0	8.0	41982682	Kim was very amicable and welcoming. We were in town for an event at the Key Arena and Kim let us drop off our luggage prior to check-in time.  We had our privacy and although we spent most of our time at the event, it was a pleasure chatting with Kim whenever we happened to meet.  The neighborhood is safe and there is a bus stop a block away which takes you on a 10 minute ride to the downtown area where you can find a variety of restaurants.   The room was very clean and spacious and had its own private bath and shower.  We had a very pleasant stay at Kim's and would definitely stay here again! 
49585	2980762	9.0	8.0	43533183	"Kim is a fantastic host. She is welcoming and helpful. Her animals are sweet and a nice bonus if you miss your furry friends at home. The cat and dog do not disturb nor did we see them in our area of the home. 
Kim's home is a short 3 min walk from public transportation (takes about 20 min via bus to downtown).  She provided parking for our rental car as well. There is a beautiful park on a peninsula in the lake within walking distance. 
The room and restroom are comfycozy (nice/clean/welcoming). There are plenty fresh linens in the restroom. Kim provides a great environment for a traveler. She is friendly while giving privacy as well. I would recommend this listing and would definitely stay here again."
49586	2980762	9.0	8.0	44374906	"Kim was an amazing hostess and made  my first Airbnb experience remarkable. Her house is very charming and extremely quiet while being close to bus and light rail stops. My bedroom was perfect.The furniture is a mix of eclectic art, vintage finds and extremely comfortable bedding. I had a giant closet to hang my clothes, and two windows that made the room very airy and bright despite being a half basement. Also my private bathroom was very nice, clean and well stocked with towels, soaps and other toiletries that travelers always forget. The dog and cat are very cute and well behaved, I hung out with them for a bit but were not intrusive at all in any way. The sunny yard was great for reading and notes, or for waiting for a ride. 

Most importantly was the hospitality of Kim, she was very flexible and accommodating. She also offered a lot of tips and recommendations and was very discreet. I felt I had the place to myself as my privacy was very highly respected. Communication was super easy at all times. Thank you Kim"
49587	2980762	9.0	8.0	45334961	The room was clean and and the neighborhood was great for us. It was a little under a mile walk to transit and nearby shops and restaurants. We loved Olive and Rabbit. Slightly expensive for what it was. The room is not attached to the bathroom, which was not a big deal, but with both doors being glass front, it feels a bit exposed. The house  is old so you are able to hear EVERYTHING. Just footsteps upstairs and the shower turning on was quite loud. Kim was welcoming and had lots of great insight on Seattle culture. 
49720	7420488	9.0	8.0	40994487	"Marin's place was tricky to find, but once I was there I was greeted by a home even more lovely than the pictures conveyed. I was happy to have chosen the smaller room since it was also the shadier one, and in this heat, that was a good thing. Despite the lack of a/c her home was very comfortable, as was the bed (important!). 
Marin herself could not possibly have been any more interesting to talk to, sweet and thoughtful, accommodating and welcoming. I had a great time with her and loved her place immensely. If you are staying or visiting downtown or the south end of Seattle, I cannot recommend her place enough."
49721	7420488	9.0	8.0	42018968	We rented the front room and this room and it was perfect for 3 people. We fell in love with the house, it's so cute and cozy. Everything is clean and traveler friendly. Definitely a good place to stay if you want to experience what it's like to live in Seattle! I would recommend Marin's property to anyone and would love the chance to visit and stay with her again. Thanks for everything Marin! 
49722	7420488	9.0	8.0	44033677	As pictured, beautiful house & comfortable room/bed. In a quiet neighborhood near bus lines & light rail. Marin was a wonderful host & I enjoyed my stay.
49723	7420488	9.0	8.0	46001791	Marin is a wonderful host.  She has placed a great deal of effort into making her home accommodating for her guests.  Could not be happier that I chose to stay at her home.  Thanks Marin!
49724	7420488	9.0	8.0	48909118	Marin's house is lovely and exactly like the pictures! The neighborhood has everything I needed within walking distance and good access to downtown and other neighborhoods. She was very friendly and helpful and an all-round fantastic host. So much so that I decided to extend my stay here while continuing to explore the city. 
49725	7420488	9.0	8.0	49825918	Marin's house was the perfect place to stay while I was apartment-hunting in the city. It was very cozy and comfortable and I absolutely recommend staying with her.
49726	7420488	9.0	8.0	50550930	Marin was completely accomodating when I needed to extend my stay. I was so lucky to stay in such a comfortable spot while apartment-hunting. 
49727	7420488	9.0	8.0	56914316	Marin was a terrific host, so sweet and kind, she made the time to talk to you and give you great recommendations of things to do in the area.  The house is even better in person that the pictures.  Very clean and it felt like home, I can honestly say I was a little saddened to leave at the end of my trip.  I would recommend staying at Marin's when you are in the Seattle area!
49789	693956	10.0	8.0	2986891	Stayed for a week & house was as gorgeous as pics indicate.  Owners were out of town but organized a nice neighbor contact for any issues (there were none).  Organization/communication was great.
49920	609610	10.0	8.0	1816640	Laura and Karlo were amazing hosts. The apartment I rented was clean and warm, with its own entrance, bathroom, a fully loaded kitchen and all the things you would need for a long term stay in Seattle (although I was there for only 3 days). What really made my stay in this B&B so nice was all the little details and the kindnesses of the hosts, from picking me up at the train station (only 5 minutes from their home - but nice when lost in a new city) to guiding me on efficient ways to travel (20 minutes by bus from downtown), free internet, fresh eggs from their own chickens, and even introductions to their friends who happen to be in my same industry. Overall I had a lovely stay and would return in a heartbeat.
49921	609610	10.0	8.0	1864976	"This was a great place to stay! It's in a more residential area, a place you might not head if you were just looking at downtown Seattle. The walk to the light rail station is quick and easy - we had no problem returning from downtown to drop our stuff before heading back out to dinner, for example. The light rail tickets are very inexpensive for a day pass back and forth.

The apartment itself was great - a full kitchen makes breakfast super-convenient before hitting the road (even more convenient if there are fresh eggs from their chickens, which we had one day!) Full size bed plus a couch that could fold down, plus another couch, so plenty of seating area and such. Wifi made life easy as well.

Our hosts were very helpful and informative, quick to provide any information we needed, etc, as well as being generally nice people."
49922	609610	10.0	8.0	1887001	Lovely place, lovely people. We felt at home right away--welcoming hosts,   small touches like fresh cut flowers, comfortable beds (with the best pillows ever), fully equipped kitchen, delightful garden,  We felt lucky to have such a beautiful place right in the city.
49923	609610	10.0	8.0	1918109	"Laura and Karl were fantastic hosts! We couldn't have asked for a more conveniently located and adorable place to stay in Seattle. Laura and Karl even made themselves available to give directions and ""tourist advice"" throughout our stay. They were super friendly and extremely accommodating (going as far as bringing us a fan in the hot weather)! The apartment is very cozy, spacious and clean! We, once again, had another amazing experience with airbnb.com! I hope to reconnect with Laura and Karl again in the future! ~Abbey and Adam

"
49924	609610	10.0	8.0	1964118	Laura has a wonderful warm and generous spirit and was quick to give us insider information on the local neighbourhood and immediately set us up with provisions for an impromptu sunset picnic. Who could ask for more? The only draw back was that we only stayed one night. Given more time, this would certainly have been a five star experience.
49925	609610	10.0	8.0	2003697	This review is a little overdue (sorry Laura that it took so long), but Laura and Karl were excellent hosts and were very accommodating during my stay. The apartment was clean, spacious and very pleasant. They also live a short walk away from a really cool and lesser known part of Seattle that I enjoyed exploring. The transportation to the downtown area is also easy. 
49926	609610	10.0	8.0	2175179	A nice, comfortable, and convenient place to stay near the city, but outside the bustle of downtown. It was nice to have a more homey feel, rather than a hotel. The host was very helpful and friendly! It was a good deal for the price. The backyard was pleasant and I loved the chicken coop! The area is full of nice little ethnic eateries and shops. We used a car for all our transportation, but taking public transit was an option. I am not sure I would feel comfortable walking around the neighborhood by myself at night however, being a woman and a more car-oriented community. The space was large enough to comfortably fit a few people. The fully stocked kitchen was a plus. Our only complaint was that although the shower was big, the shower head was difficult to use as there was no hook for it. 
49927	609610	10.0	8.0	45862065	Laura was a wonderful host, and made us feel very welcome.  She left a map of Seattle for us, a great supply of organic food for breakfast, and she was available to answer questions and generally make us feel at home.  She wonderfully anticipated all of our needs.  The suite was funky, eclectic and fully outfitted.  If was also in a fun neighbourhood, 15 minutes from downtown, with a grocery store only a block away.  My only regret is that we did not stay longer.  I also really appreciate Laura's focus on minimizing our ecological footprint through eco friendly products, and a focus on recycling.
49928	609610	10.0	8.0	46042475	Laura was such a joy! She has such a welcoming energy and her studio is so incredibly inviting. We felt so cozy for our short stay and thought their location was brilliant. We loved visiting neighborhoods she suggested and hearing about how she helped create the home she always wanted. I hope everyone gets a chance to stay with Laura!
49929	609610	10.0	8.0	46329292	My husband and I did not get a chance to meet Laura or her husband, but they had wonderful communication with us the entire time we were there. The apartment is roomy and has a private entrance. The kitchen is large, fully stocked and would be easy to make your own meals! My husband and I drove up the street a little bit and found a cute area with a lot of restaurants. We had a great dinner and stopped at the grocery store nearby to grab a bottle of wine. We had a nice time in the apartment drinking wine and playing games together. My only complaint would be that the walls are a little thin. We had a great stay though!
49930	609610	10.0	8.0	46647709	This is a very charming and spacious apartment. It was very easy (15 minutes) to get to downtown Seattle. But the best part was the old town feel of nearby (1 mile away) Columbia City. A small-town-neighborhood near a large urban center--pretty ideal!
49931	609610	10.0	8.0	46949815	Our host made us feel very welcome.  They communicated with us to make sure we were ok.
49932	609610	10.0	8.0	47391283	A great place to stay in Seattle. Plenty a room with thoughtful amenities. There's plenty of light and a great energy at this place. I would definitely stay here again. 
49933	609610	10.0	8.0	47771048	The listing was very accurate to the place when we showed up. Clean, tidy and it felt like home when we walked in. Even though we didn't see the owner or the care taker as she was working, it was nice because we had our privacy.
49934	609610	10.0	8.0	48906976	The description was very accurate and the neighborhood was very cool. Nothing I've ever been to before 
49994	2016613	9.0	8.0	9525200	We really enjoyed our time in Seattle.  The house is nice and comfortable so we could totally relax and feel like home in there.  Rick is very thoughtful for our family.  He prepared everything we need before our arrival.  He also provided any information that we might be interested.  The house is close to the city and convenient to food stores and supermarket.  
49995	2016613	9.0	8.0	9564465	Rick was an awesome host, very responsive and accommodating. The house was even better than the pictures show! Extremely spacious with great views of the surrounding areas! I rented this home for a New Years Eve get together with friends it was it perfect space for entertaining and we had plenty of room for all the guests. 
49996	2016613	9.0	8.0	11636136	Rick's house is great and communicating with him was easy.  The home is clean and well-appointed.  The kitchen is top-notch.  The house located about 4 miles from downtown.  We will contact Rick again for other trips to Seattle.
49997	2016613	9.0	8.0	11806756	5 stars!  Rick was such a great host!  My family of 6 stayed for 5 nights and couldn't have asked for anything nicer.  Very nicely decorated and the hot tub was so relaxing after a day of trekking around downtown Seattle (less than 5 mi / 15min drive away); very Zen!  The area has a very rustic feel and surrounded by foliage while still conveniently located in the hip/gentrified Columbia City district of Seattle with shopping and dining only minutes away.  The kitchen was just amazing and fully appointed with all the tools a gourmet chef would need.  I would not hesitate to stay at Rick's home again when in Seattle.
49998	2016613	9.0	8.0	15300323	Beautiful home and furnishings. The owner obviously took care into making it a luxury vacation feel. The unique rugs & flooring along with the many balconies gave us a beachfront feel.   Louis
49999	2016613	9.0	8.0	15666761	This was our first Airbnb experience.   We could not be happier.   The accommodations were even better than promoted.   The host was fantastic.  Communications were timely, house preparations were unbeatable, and overall provided a feeling of being at home.   For all future travels to Seattle, we will pursue this rental and airbnb, before looking into hotels.  
50000	2016613	9.0	8.0	16733377	"House was perfect for our needs and exceeded our expectations. We had a group from Portland going to a concert in Seattle at safeco field and didn't want to drive back late. Ended up getting a limo, but it's not to far away. Also, I would highly recommend Amy's limo service. She accommodated our last minute needs when another company tried to pull a fast one.

The house was clean. Rick left the keys in a lock box so we were able to arrive at different times without issue. Parking was a little tricky, just b/c I drove my big work truck. In the end it worked out. I would recommend it to anyone, family or groups looking to be in Seattle without being downtown. He also gave recommendations for some local restaurants."
50001	2016613	9.0	8.0	16889818	"Rick was gracious, responsive, and very easy to work with.  The home is beautiful -- all the essentials, lovely landscaping and views, and lots of space for our large group of adults to spread out! 

(Note - It is a 3-story home in a very hilly neighborhood, so I would only recommend this home to those with good mobility.) "
50002	2016613	9.0	8.0	41404175	"We stayed in this house for four nights and we really felt comfortable and like home. The owner had really put a lot of attention to details and everything was as described in the listing.
The house is over three levels and allowed our group to have enough to space to rest, read, barbecue, play, and sleep. 
I had forgotten couple of items when we left the house and Rick kindly sent them back to us. 
Thank you very much for a nice prepared and welcoming house. Our trip to Seattle was a good experience and the house was an important part of it."
50003	2016613	9.0	8.0	43073659	We had a great experience dealing with the owner, Rick. The house work great for my family. Definitely recommended.
50004	2016613	9.0	8.0	43978644	"Staying at Rick's house in Seattle was incredible. It has ample space for a lot of people and the house is set up in a really cool way, with lots of balconies, living rooms, patios, and common space. The house is also beautiful and has everything that you'd want. Check-in and check-out was super easy and Rick was responsive to any questions we had, including allowing us to check-out super late. 

It looks like it would be pretty easy to get to a train line, and there was a grocery store and a few restaurants within easy walking distance. 

Fantastic place and great value for a large group. We would really recommend this house. "
50005	2016613	9.0	8.0	47048917	Rick was very nice and welcoming.  The house was wonderful and a quick shot to downtown Seattle.  Would recommend to a friend.  Everything posted is accurate. 
50006	2016613	9.0	8.0	49895772	"Rick is a very good host.  He was responsive, with a very detailed check-in packet, and was very flexible on our arrival and departure times.  He even had some breakfast treats waiting for us at check-in.

The house location was very nice.  Without traffic, you're within 15 minutes of downtown, and you're also within a short drive of many other parts of the city (as well as 2 hours from Mt. Rainier NP, with an easy exit from the city during AM rush).  Beautiful sunrise view from the kitchen and dining/living room, looking out to the mountains over the eastern part of the city .

The kitchen was very well appointed, and there is ample seating for meals (and there are both good grocery and carry-out options nearby).  We had a very easy time preparing dinners at the house.  The house has lots of room, and is certainly well-sized for a larger group.  If you plan to use more than two bedrooms, though, it should be noted that the other two bedrooms and three beds are futon-cushion fold-downs, rather than traditional mattress/box-spring beds.

Agree with another reviewer that good mobility for guests is a must.  Zero issue for us, but the house and the walk from the street parking to the front door include a number of steps."
50007	2016613	9.0	8.0	51473348	My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay here with my kids. The home is beautifully decorated and very well-maintained. Rick is a great host; he met us at the property and gave us a thorough tour of the home.  There is plenty of room, very comfortable beds and a fun hot tub!  
50008	2016613	9.0	8.0	55008592	We arrived later than anticipated so we did not get to meet Rick. But our exchanges with him were all friendly and helpful. The home is a very nice home. It sleeps 6 comfortably, with the other 2 on futons in the basement, which tended to be chilly at the end of Nov. There is some minor TLC needed to the hot tub area but overall the property is beautiful The neighborhood is no the nicest but dining, shopping and entertainment were very close (walking distance). That said, this house provided a great venue for a wonderful Thanksgiving with friends. 
50009	2016613	9.0	8.0	55428617	"Great house!  Good walk to nice restaurants and easy walk to Light Rail - which made life really easy as we were there for a Seahawks game!
Loved the number of bathrooms, easy parking out back, good system for security and kitchen well stocked!!"
50028	7922663	10.0	8.0	58068751	"Mehrit's place was great. Everything was convenient and clean The room number 2 is very pretty, with soft sheets on the bed and a good heater that made the winter nights very comfortable. Unfortunately there was a regular noise, probably made by household appliances.
If you need to be well taken care of, Mehrit and Roko are the perfect hosts for you."
50722	3849918	9.0	8.0	34798344	Lovely spacious place, comfy beds, quiet nights. Excellent communication!  Staying again this August! Thank you for having us:)
50723	3849918	9.0	8.0	36649769	We arrived to a wonderfully clean unit and a pretty bouquet of flowers.  The host was helpful about providing some extra supplies since we were there for a longer period of time.  We communicated via text, and the responses were almost instantaneous.  The beds were comfortable, and there were adequate kitchen utensils for meals, etc. The property is in a lovely but hilly neighborhood with a charming mix of modern and older homes.
50724	3849918	9.0	8.0	37289296	We found Sunset Splender very neat and clean. The beds were very comfortable including the foldout in the living room. The free wi fi was helpful. The weather in Seattle was quite warm and the host had provided us with extra fans and bottled water in the frigerator. 
50725	3849918	9.0	8.0	40085938	"The rental property company did their best to add nice furnishings and the apartment had everything we needed to cook, etc. It was tidy upon arrival and access into the apartment was easy.  The parking space provided was great, as was access to different areas of Seattle. The rental property people were quick to answer questions, which was helpful. Water in the fridge was also appreciated. All in all, everything you need is here.

We stay in Seattle every summer, but usually in Ballard or Fremont.  If you are not looking to be in one of the more trendy, hip Seattle neighborhoods, then this place would be a sound choice.  The apartment itself is older, with indoor/outdoor carpeting, older linoleum (the small bit of wood flooring was nice), older window shades, a very small bathroom and an under performing shower. The fluffy  towels provided are adequate if you plan to stay for a shorter amount of time, but otherwise if you stay with four people as we did for a week, then you might have to use the coin operated/shared laundry. The internet did not consistently work.  I found that the pictures on the site made the apartment look newer and bigger than it really is. I would say this is best for two people, but it would be a very tight fit for 6, as we felt it was small with two adults and two children. 
But we tend to look for very modern places to stay in more trendy neighborhoods, so if you are looking for a solid place to stay in the Seattle area and aren't picky about the things I mention, then this would be a good choice."
50726	3849918	9.0	8.0	40578390	"
The apartment was clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bonus was the parking under the apt. structure and the balcony with a nice breeze. There are no houses across the street, just trees. I had a question about the WIFI so I emailed Denise and she immediately got back to me with the answer. The neighborhood is quiet, and there is a park down and across the street from the apt.  You're about 15 minutes from the airport and tourist attractions are not far. The apartment looked like the picture in the posting."
50727	3849918	9.0	8.0	41732339	It was an awesome place. Very peaceful and safe. The house had everything we need. Would stay again and I recommend it. 
50728	3849918	9.0	8.0	42609914	"Sunset Splendor was a great place for my family and I to stay while on vacation in Seattle. When we arrived, I had misplaced the arrival information, and the host was helpful at getting in. The next day they printed the information and left it outside the door before 7:00 am. The home was nicely appointed and there were plenty of dishes and clean towels for our stay of almost a week. It was great to have off-street parking. 
The neighborhood was fine. There was really no dining close by, but a Safeway and and a QFC were within a couple of miles. "
50729	3849918	9.0	8.0	47864436	This listing was just as bright, roomy and clean as it looks.  Access was so easy with the door code, garage parking even with a topper on a suv was more than adequate. The views were spectacular as were the colors of fall.  The neighborhood was better than we hoped for and I would stay again and again.  The beds were super comfortable, kitchen was fully equipped with some necessities left by the host.(coffee) And lastly the host was so flexible with an extended day.  Thank you for a  lovely experience.
50755	5376433	10.0	8.0	28690424	We arrived around 7:30pm, Marshall came to pick us up, his house was very lovely, very inviting atmosphere. He was friendly, had good travel tips, the price was fair. In the morning he provided a great breakfast spread with the works. He really opened his home to us, we would definitely stay there again.
50756	5376433	10.0	8.0	32995902	Marshall is a great host. He truly tries to  help us to enjoy seattle. He gave us breakfast and sometime if the timing is good gave us a ride. He also paints and garden for a hobby which makes his house awsome
50757	5376433	10.0	8.0	33602649	Marshall was a lovely host, he picked/dropped us off at the airport. He is very friendly, but will give you your space. He gave us tips on where to go around Seattle. His place is near a bus that takes you to downtown. He also provided breakfast and went out of his way to buy some breakfast foods for my vegan friend. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and comfy. He let us use his sauna and he's planning on building a Japanese hot tub. If we come back to Seattle, we'll definitely stay here!
50758	5376433	10.0	8.0	34982402	Marshall was a wonderful host, very kind and considerate. The house was clean, easy-to-access, and close walking distance to downtown Columbia City. 
50759	5376433	10.0	8.0	35168172	Marshall was nice but the room was extremely hot. Even with the windows open and the fan on it was uncomfortable. However in the winter this would be a great stay. 
50760	5376433	10.0	8.0	35955979	Comfortable. Homly and much better than photos. Easy to aceess downtown. And during the weekend, We went nature reserve hiking with Marshall. After hiking we had a BBQ together.  Thanks for everything. :)
50761	5376433	10.0	8.0	41101533	We only stayed at Marshall's place for 1 night, but it was a nice stay. Marshall was a good host and the place was nice and clean. There were plenty of amenities provided. If you have a car, or you're ok with taking public transit to downtown Seattle, the location is not far. Overall we had a pleasant stay. Thanks!
50762	5376433	10.0	8.0	42873656	"Marshall was really helpful and we enjoyed our stay with him. 
He even offered to pick us up from the train station during his lunch break.
Since we stayed with him during the weekend he made breakfast for us which was really nice. 
The room was just as described and his home is well located to get in and out of the city!
"
50763	5376433	10.0	8.0	43804310	"Marshall was a incredible host!  His house is cute & comfortable, and his cat made us feel at home too!  This location is exactly as described, and very close to the city center.  Buses made it easy to get where we wanted to go, and it was always nice returning to his home after a day in the city.  I don't how most hosts are, but Marshall was very welcoming and it was a pleasure sharing a bottle of wine with him as part of our Seattle experience.

If you want to stay in a cozy neighborhood close to the Seattle attractions, this is where you want to be."
50764	5376433	10.0	8.0	44013705	It was a great stay at Marshall's place. We felt very comfortable and Marshall gave us some good advice about where to go and how to get there in our short time in Seattle. Thanks a lot!
50765	5376433	10.0	8.0	44599751	"We had a great stay at Marshall's. He was friendly and was very helpful in regards to where and how to get to some great local spots. 
Also if you are a cat lover then you are in luck; his cat is more than ready to lavish attention on you or you on to him. I would stay here again and I would recommend his place to friends venturing out to Seattle :)   "
50766	5376433	10.0	8.0	44921371	Marshall was a great host during our two-night stay in Seattle. He made us feel very much at home and was fun to hang out with too!
50767	5376433	10.0	8.0	45968867	"Marshall's place is absolutely fantastic! We loved staying with him, he made us feel right at home. Marshall gave us all kinds of advice on what to check out and he was always absolutely friendly. While we were there, he cooked a Filipino soup and slow cooked chicken and rice and shared with us. He's an incredible cook!

Marshall's place is easy to get to anywhere from. We picked it because it was about halfway between the airport and downtown, but we really got to know the neighborhood and ate at the Ethiopian restaurant nearby - it is delicious. 

The room is huge, very cozy, and clean. No complaints at all! Be sure to check out the garden and hang out with his cat, Dwayne, too."
50768	5376433	10.0	8.0	46458361	Marshall was a wonderful host. He accepted my rather last minute request and made me feel right at home. His house is spacious and thoughtfully decorated. The location is great, only a few minutes walking to the up and coming places of Columbia City and a few blocks away from the bus that takes you to Downtown.
50769	5376433	10.0	8.0	46840875	The space was cozy and inviting, Marshall was very nice and made us feel at home. By far the best deal to stay in Seattle that I have found. We had a great trip :)
50770	5376433	10.0	8.0	47757306	Beautiful and cozy house. Welcoming and nice host.
50771	5376433	10.0	8.0	48336850	"Marshall's room was comfortable, and the location is convenient to bus line #7; also a 15-minute walk to a LINK light rail station.  

The only problem I had was on first arriving.  We had exchanged emails in which I told him the time when I would be arriving, and he said he would be at home waiting for me.  When I got to his front door, it looked to me like a garage door, and lights were on inside.  There was a keypad next to the door.  I knocked several times and waited outside 10-15 minutes.  There is a gate, closed when I arrived, to the right of the door.  The gate leads into the back yard, but I didn't think it right to open and look back there.  

At last, Marshall heard me knocking and came out from the back yard to let me in.  The entrance is from the back yard, and has its own keypad for guest entrance.  He did not inform me of this entrance before I arrived.   Perhaps he should let future guests know where the entrance is prior to arrival."
50772	5376433	10.0	8.0	48798558	"One of our best stays with airbnb! Everything was a bit better than what we were used to. Marshall is very friendly and really made us feel welcome! His house is very nice and clean. Our room was perfect with a comfortable bed! We were able to do our laundry, which was very helpful. We loved the ""help yourself"" breakfast with lots of delicious things!! We also loved Dwayne the cat :)
Ah and the location is convenient, close to bus number 7 which brings you downtown in less than half and hour. There is also a Walgreens nearby."
50773	5376433	10.0	8.0	49550614	Marshall is such a nice and welcoming host. I don't have a reason to not stay with him. He made us breakfast both mornings when he wasn't working and chatted at night with wine provided. His home was comfortable and we never felt bothered or in the way. It was in a great location also with grocery and delivery near so you could relax at night and go into the city during the day with one easy bus ride. Thanks Marshall! 
50774	5376433	10.0	8.0	50240515	We loved it! Great friendly and helpful host, lovely artsy house, good location. Awesome cat :-)
50775	5376433	10.0	8.0	53925118	Marshall had a great place and gave me a fantastic experience. Rooms and house was as described and everything I would have expected. Would recommend his place to anyone staying in the area.
50857	2520890	9.0	8.0	13126464	"We sent Amie a booking request while driving down from Vancouver and had received a response and confirmed the details before hitting the border! Amie was there to meet us when we arrived and had taken care of everything. 

The room is amazing, lovely lighting with plenty of windows and our own private bathroom and temperature controls. The bed was nice and comfortable with plenty of blankets, we slept really well and didn't wake up till late. The location was easy to get to from the I-5 and seemed close to lots of attractions, it is a quiet neighborhood so sleeping in was not an issue.

Amie was happy to recommend a local cafe for breakfast, Both Ways Cafe, I would eat there every day if I lived in Seattle.

Overall it was a 10/10 experience, great hospitality, great room.

 "
50858	2520890	9.0	8.0	13260858	Amie, Owen and Elza (what a cutie-pie!) prepared a fantastic getaway for us. From the sweet little vase of roses and apples in a bowl, to the coffee and tea - with organic stevia available! - and fluffy towels. I especially appreciated the clean sheets, towels and bath products without scents and chemicals, and the bins for recycling and compost. Such rare finds! There were books about Seattle trees, local hikes and foraging at the bedside. Many thoughtful touches and ideas for tiny house living. Amie was a delight to communicate and visit with, too. A great private retreat in the heart of a diverse Seattle neighborhood - we highly recommend it. 
50859	2520890	9.0	8.0	13384497	Amie was super gracious when my reservations needed to be changed. I look forward to booking with her in the future! 
50860	2520890	9.0	8.0	13497840	Amie was a kind and generous host and the apartment warm, cozy and private.  Sleeping with the night breezes wafting in and waking to the murmur of the chickens was a treat.  I would happily stay at Passiflora Farm again.
50861	2520890	9.0	8.0	13827198	"It was truly a blessing to have found Passiflora Farm and its beautiful inhabitants, hosts, Amie & Owen, Elza their one-year old, whose very presence lit up my world, Felix the gentle house cat (don't rev up your motor engines - it terrifies him), egg laying chickens that announce their egg delivery, almost instantly, and the great hospitality and warmth encompassed in this urban farm-like setting.   Amie was most helpful sending me website links prior to my arrival, which helped me prioritize my 9-day stay in Seattle an interesting, productive one.  Without her help, I might not quite have succeeded in accomplishing my primary goal of visiting the Hoh Rainforest on the Olympic Peninsula.  Owen had picked up bus schedules to ease my travel, and by the way, Passiflora Farm is very accessible to downtown and most places of interest. It is walking distance to  the grocery with interesting restaurants close by, and on clear days, you can even catch a view of the majestic Mt. Rainier riding back home on the very frequent bus #7.  

The private accommodation was ideal with its attached bath and the necessary comfort to find peace and respite after scouring the city sights.  Don't mind the chickens when they announce the egg(s) delivery, which also means it's time to get up to start the day for another adventure.

From the day I arrived, having been picked up with a truly warm welcome by Amie and Elza, who incidentally had been roused from her nap, yet wearing that most delightful, heart-melting smile, to the day they saw me off heading to the airport, my fond memories of this visit to Seattle will be etched as evergreen as the state of Washington.  It was worth the trip!"
50862	2520890	9.0	8.0	14130690	"Our experience with the host is biased just a little.  She is our daughter, and the mother off our newest grand daughter who turned one over our stay. Need we say a lot more.  It is all perfect.
My wife and I appreciate the privacy and intimacy of the room and surrounding common room as well as the casualness of the gardens of native flowers as well as cactus gardens she cultivates in an urban environment.
We know Seattle well and the proximity to the busses, light rail and major arterials make the location ideal for staying and playing anytime."
50863	2520890	9.0	8.0	14446371	I LOVED my stay here. If you don't mind walking, there are many things less than a mile away. Downtown Seattle was very easy to get to via the train, which is about a 10-15 minute walk away. The room was great and private. Amie was very accommodating. Due to my schedule, I didn't see her much, but when I did, she always asked how I was, how the room was, and how my trip was. I would recommend this to any one of my friends and anyone who reads this. You won't be disappointed. Also, try to make Elza laugh, it's one of the best things ever.
50864	2520890	9.0	8.0	15082928	Amie and family provided a delightful retreat, marred only by our not being able to stay longer. The guest room is in peaceful garden surroundings, with a fascinating neighborhood just around the corner.  We hope to return soon, and highly recommend this haven.
50865	2520890	9.0	8.0	15693921	We stayed for 3 nights at the Passiflora Farm Guest Room. Amie is a thoughtful host who is quick to respond to messages.  The room itself is quite cozy and comfortable. I loved that it was very airy and that the windows let a lot of light in.  The chickens are so cute, and they didn't make any noise (at least while we were there).  There is a cute sitting area in front of the guest room and the grounds are very peaceful. The location is great and we liked the fact that it was very close to some wonderful eateries - we had a delicious brunch close by in Columbia City. 
50866	2520890	9.0	8.0	15887179	We very much enjoyed our stay. Our host was very accommodating as we had a late arrival and departure. She was extremely responsive to any questions we had. And, we enjoyed the use of organic products used throughout the guest suite. 
50867	2520890	9.0	8.0	16067239	This was our first time booking a place through airb&b and our first time taking our 8 month old on a trip to Seattle. I picked Passiflora farm because it looked family friendly and sweet and it was close to our friend's wedding. We were so happy to find that not only was Passiflora farm beautiful but super cozy & comfy too. Amie & her family are lovely & thoughtful hosts. She even left our baby Henry a play crib to use with toys & a beautiful quilt just for him, so sweet! We were only in Seattle for one night but my husband said he would have loved to stay the week and I agreed. We'll be back for sure. 
50868	2520890	9.0	8.0	16417554	Amie was such a kind and welcoming host.  She has a beautiful family!  The farm guest room is just as it is described in the picture... we even met her 4 chickens on our way out.  It is private.  I would highly recommend Amie as a host, but the space itself had some issues.  I would be lying if I didn't mention that we felt limited to only our bedroom once inside.  The space itself is much larger but not fully finished to allow us to really enjoy the larger living area.  Our other bigger gripe just had to do with cleanliness and the layout of the bathroom... the toilet is in the shower!  This is a bit of a design flaw in our opinion as one person couldn't shower while the other was in the toilet, nor would you really want to shower after someone finished their business in there.  The water from the shower head goes directly to the toilet... so it's also entirely wet afterwards.  Other than that, the place is welcoming (books and organic shampoo/conditioner) and close enough (15 min hike) to the link rail stop.  Not the safest looking neighborhood, but a nice walk nonetheless.
50869	2520890	9.0	8.0	17511726	We loved our stay in the Passiflora guest room! Amie was such a genuinely kind and generous person who went out of her way to make our stay as comfortable and easy as possible. Communication with her was excellent and she provided us will all necessary information. The room itself was very adequate for myself and my two small children (ages 1 and 3). Amie provided us with a pack n play as well as a beautiful handmade quilt, toys, and books. Amie's little girl is just delightful and charmed all of us. The bathroom is a really interesting design and great for long showers. The organic amenities were greatly appreciated! We spent time outside either using the table and chairs, observing the chickens, or smelling the herbs. The neighborhood is full of diverse restaurants but also convenient for grocery stores, etc. It's also a quick and easy ride up to Capitol Hill. Overall, I highly recommend Passiflora Farm as your place to stay in Seattle!
50870	2520890	9.0	8.0	19104343	"It was pretty late in the evening, when We knocked at Amie's house. She was very kind and took us to the apartment. We really liked  it. It is cozy and cute, surrounded by trees, in a very good position: Downtown is only ten minutes driving.
The bed is comfortable.
The day We left Amie gave us some information to continue our trip.
A pretty nice experience."
50871	2520890	9.0	8.0	19287647	I booked this  for my father who was visiting us from out of town. Amie was easy to connect with and made Dad feel welcome, as did her partner. My dad was happy with the room, the privacy, the yard, and interested in the solar and chickens. He enjoyed his stay. Thank you!
50872	2520890	9.0	8.0	19707322	"Amie and Owen are excellent hosts and a very creative couple. The room is very comfortable (especially the futon bed) and beautifully decorated.
The location is slightly out of the center, but for this you get a unique farm-like experience in Seattle. Highly recommended!"
50873	2520890	9.0	8.0	19754183	Wonderful place to stay! Everything was just as described, if not better. Amie was a great host. Delicious complementary coffee as well. Only wish we stayed longer!
50874	2520890	9.0	8.0	20854437	Amie and Owen were excellent hosts! They were quick to respond to messages and very attentive during our stay. The farm was the perfect setting for our stay in Seattle, and we can't wait for our next chance to spend time here! The beautiful pictures in the listing only show a taste of how great this space really is. The guest room was well stocked and immaculate, and the farm itself always had interesting things to wonder about. Amie and Owen have created an urban oasis that shows they are very conscious, intentional individuals.
50875	2520890	9.0	8.0	25948616	Amie made us feel quite welcome despite our arrival in the dark. She gave excellent directions. Directions were important as there is an easy to unload entry, and then separate parking zone with steps to the location. The room was comfortable, we had hot pot, coffee, and fridge for our left overs! The combo shower toilet was of interest to us so we were fine with that, besides, the shower had in-floor heat which was so nice! The room was as described, separate yet inside a larger old garage that has been updated for various uses (artists, builders take note!) The extra space outside the enclosed bedroom was so helpful as my husband and I were at the end of our trip and needed to package up lots of goodies to ship out! Their internet worked great considering the room is a separate building from the main house. The garden was lush, even in January- rosemary and lavender, mmmm! Being a gardener myself, I wish I had more time to spend with Amie, but alas, so much to do in Seattle! The neighborhood is full of international food and easy to navigate to other parts of the city. It was also fairly quiet for being urban. One note to lighter sleepers, two blocks away is a Dairygold plant and distribution center. The trucks come and go all night and once I realized what it was, I rested well. (side note, their cream is great, just cream and milk, no extra thickeners!) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an easy going, garden in the city, decent parking, and homemade custom remodel experience. Amie and her family have some talent!
50876	2520890	9.0	8.0	31983257	Amie was super friendly and helpful with great suggestions on where to go. Enjoyed meeting Owen and cute Elza, too.  The Garden Guest Room was cozy and comfortable with many nice touches, including a heated bathroom floor.  Lovely patio and gardens just outside the room, too.  Within walking distance of many great Columbia City restaurants/cafe's.  We had a wonderful time!
50877	2520890	9.0	8.0	34787573	Amie was a wonderful host. She was very thoughtful in picking us up from the Starbucks located near her house. The room was exactly as described. Beautiful and comfortable. The heated floor in the bathroom was inviting after a day of sight seeing. She had replaced the futon with a very comfortable bed. Amie was great at sharing some of the highlights Seattle Has to offer. Link rail and public transportation was easy to master to navigate Seattle.  We would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to our friends!
50878	2520890	9.0	8.0	36239435	We had a lovely stay! The room was just as described and an added bonus was the anointing space with sofas and space for our toddler to run around. Perfect! Amie very kindly left out some toddler books and toys for our daughter. Our car broke down and Amie's husband came to the rescue and got us back on the road! Such a lovely family! 
50879	2520890	9.0	8.0	37209717	So this was our 1st AirBNB experience and we weren't sure what to expect. SOOO glad we did it and stayed here! They were amazing in every way. First the private room & shower; very easy to get to, very neat and clean, and SUPER comfortable bed. The shower was really nice with a heated floor too. The best part was that we could come and go anytime without disturbing them because it's a separate building right of their house. They have a fridge and microwave in there as well as some really good coffee & coffee pot. While we were there they said if we needed anything they would help out, or if we want to be left alone, they would give us space. We sat and talked for a while a few days. I would highly recommend staying here if you come to Seattle. They sure made us feel comfortable in every way and we would come back again.
50880	2520890	9.0	8.0	39634684	Amie and Owen are very warm and hospitable hosts. They are very friendly and very helpful on the logistics of getting around. They are full of great ideas of things to do and see in and around the Seattle area and beyond.
50881	2520890	9.0	8.0	41618724	This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldn’t have been better. The room is great, and the privacy of having the entire barn to ourselves was an added bonus. The bed was very comfortable and large enough for two tall persons. Amie was a great, kind and helpful host. It also was quite easy to get to downtown Seattle with the train. A huge supermarket and Lake Washington are both within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again.
50882	2520890	9.0	8.0	42411167	"I stayed in the Passiflora Garden Guest Room while attending a conference in downtown Seattle. 

I didn't rent a car, and so relied entirely on public transit. The nearest light rail stop to the room is the Columbia City station; it's a hilly 0.8 miles to the room from the station. The light rail gets you to downtown or to the airport in less than 20min and trains arrive frequently. I also rented a bicycle from (website hidden) (highly recommend, their rates are good and they deliver/pickup).

The neighborhood is nice enough. There are a lot of restaurants in walking distance. It's not too far from the water.

The space is lovely. It's in a barn with a couple couches and plenty of open floor space. The room itself is just off the main barn room. It has a bed big enough for two, a mini fridge, a coffee maker (I think there was coffee in the fridge), and a bathroom/shower stall. The floor of the bathroom is heated, which might be a nice thing in the colder months, but isn't super useful when the weather is really warm. The toilet is located in the shower stall, which I guess might make some things more convenient and some things less convenient. 

My interactions with Amie and Owen were minimal and pleasant. Their wireless router went down shortly after I arrived and they made sure I had access to an alternate network for all of my netflixing needs.

The only gripe I can come up with is that, because the room catches the afternoon sun, it gets fairly warm in the evenings, and while I saw what looked like a little heater in the room, I didn't see an AC unit. Not a huge issue though, especially in the cooler/cloudier months of the year.

I would definitely stay there again."
50883	2520890	9.0	8.0	43255295	It was a really lovely place to stay at. Good access to various transportation. I would recommend to stay at Amie's place if anyone is visiting in Seattle. 
50884	2520890	9.0	8.0	45325028	It was really easy to get the keys (zero interaction with owner), so that was great.  I should note that the house number is printed on the mailbox outside the place (I had trouble finding it initially).  Very interesting decorations inside the place too.
50885	2520890	9.0	8.0	46176949	Your place worked perfectly for us. Very convenient location for all the business we had to do. Comfortable and relaxing while we were there. Sorry that we never actually got to meet you. When in Seattle would like to stay again. 
50886	2520890	9.0	8.0	47073347	We had a fantastic stay in Amies garden guest room. It's a very beautiful and spacious room and our hosts were nothing but helpful, generous and kind. 
50887	2520890	9.0	8.0	50657628	"Amie and her partner were excellent hosts! Amie welcomed us and showed us around when we got there and was always in communication with us if we needed anything. 

The room was clean and cozy and perfect for the two of us (especially after a long day of exploring Seattle)! It was in a great location: close to the airport and within easy access of the freeway (perfect for our adventures to the - relatively local - national parks).

We would certainly stay again the next time we travel to Seattle!"
50888	2520890	9.0	8.0	54287336	Exceeded expectations. Really very comfortable and cozy, all you need. We especially loved the recreational rock wall and super yummy tea choices! Only a couple blocks to the Lightrail was wicked convenient. Very quiet and private. 
51247	3904056	9.0	8.0	21970105	"The place is clean and is located near the lake.  It's a block away from Coffee, and it's in a nice area.  

Shontina made it easy for me to get in / find the place.  She also left a nice note with a simple guide to the area.  

Thanks Shontina! "
51248	3904056	9.0	8.0	23723161	Shontina was an excellent host. Although we did not meet her, she made sure check in was a breeze. The bed and furniture was comfortable. She provided some freezer foods, snacks, laundry detergent, toiletry items and books as well as a card detailing the neighborhood. You can see the lake when outside and there is a great cafe and pizza place right across the street. A great place to stay and a terrific host!
51249	3904056	9.0	8.0	34721013	Nice place, close to the lake and 20 minutes from downtown, cozy and quiet.
51250	3904056	9.0	8.0	40091978	We had a lovely time in Seattle at Shontina's apartment.  Shontina made sure everything was in place.  It is just a short walk to Lake Washington.  There are so many beautiful places to walk. 
51251	3904056	9.0	8.0	43783513	Although we did not get to meet Shontina, she was always available through email and replied to any of our questions promptly. We felt comfortable knowing she was in touch, and comfortable in her neighborhood. It was very near a good pizza place, and next to a Kung Fu studio which was really fun to watch in the evenings. The apartment was clean and it was a short walk to Lake Washington. We had a wonderful time, and I would highly recommend Shontina for her hospitality and for the ease of our stay. Thanks Shontina!
51252	3904056	9.0	8.0	46001801	Shontina is a wonderful hostess. Her cozy apartment was perfect for my girlfriend and I. It is merely a 15 minute drive into downtown. Her place is next to (2) great restaurants, literally a block away! When I come back to Seattle, I am definitely going to request Shontina's place again!
51253	3904056	9.0	8.0	53588817	The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
51480	5424448	10.0	8.0	39000504	Susannah, our host, was so lovely and helpful. We didn't have any questions or problems with the house and her instructions were clear and easy to follow. The house itself is quaint and adorable and fit our girls getaway weekend plans perfectly. Beds were comfortable and the house was clean. Columbia City is a $20 Cab/Uber ride to Belltown/Downtown. It is a safe, up and coming neighbourhood and we would definitely stay here again! 
51810	9170870	10.0	8.0	55154150	"I have stayed in many AirBnB around the world - Rachel's is one of the best.  The home looks just like the photos - squeaky clean and neat.  The HUGE HD TV on the wall gives the impression of being THERE for the big game, anywhere in the room.  A few blocks walk to Lake Washington, quaint coffee shops, food and bars.  Off the main streets and away from busy sections of Seattle, quiet and peaceful, friendly neighbors walking their dogs greet you with a Hello and a smile.  Street parking in front of the house was always easy, any time of day.  Put Rachel, and her rental, at the top of your list of Seattle area's ""Home away from Home"" choices..."
51898	3726391	10.0	8.0	17396764	Donna was great. She replied to questions promptly and was very accommodating to our needs. The house was perfect - clean, nice deck and yard, fully equipped kitchen. She even left her charcoal grill out for us to use. Donna left clear instructions for everything. We were in town for a wedding and met other out of town family at Seward Park a couple times to swim and play. The last morning we had time to take the kayaks to paddle in Lake Washington - so fun!
54021	2056276	10.0	8.0	17599541	"Grace is a great host: super available and was very easy to find an agreement for my stay.
The room was very big, simply furnished, clean and light. I had my own bathroom and access to a fully equipped kitchen, that I didn't had the chance to use.
Very nice house in a very nice neighbour, quite and safe. 
Walking 5 minutes you can reach the bus stop that brings you to the city centre in 20-30 minutes. While you have the University District and the WU campus at walking distance.
I definitely recommend this room and this host."
54593	7934356	7.0	8.0	43886788	"My teammate and I made a quick over night trip to Seattle for an outrigger canoe race on Lake Washington.  Fortunately, Jenny's pad was still available when I got around to looking.  The location was 5 minutes from the race site, up on a hill in a quiet neighborhood, and Jenny was quick to accept my request.
The daylight basement 2 bedroom apartment was quite larger than what we needed but we appreciated looking out into the garden and being able to look down over the city below.
The apartment had just been finished the day we arrived and Jenny hadn't had time to stock it with pots and pans but she had put in the basics. Jenny asked if we needed some pots or pans because she said she would get them. I said I would just use the microwave but then realized that there wasn't one so I said a pot would work fine but when we returned from our outing Jenny had brought us a microwave for my breakfast.
As you can see, Jenny is a great host and the large apartment was great.
Thanks, Jenny!

Travis"
54594	7934356	7.0	8.0	44385369	Jenny is very kind and helpful. She wait us until 8pm in the first day. We had a happy holiday in her place.
54595	7934356	7.0	8.0	45009467	Host was welcoming. The accommodations were simple. The location was great
54610	6907671	9.0	8.0	38419012	"Kristina's cottage has a great location & communicating with her was quick and easy, even though she was out of town.
Beautiful flowers, lemonade and granola bars were a nice welcoming treat. Also appreciated the refreshing pitcher of water with lemon slices in the refrigerator. Really nice deck with grill and comfortable outdoor furniture.
Wish though, the place was a little cleaner. It was awkward to see the hosts clothing still hanging in the bathroom. The window next to shower made for an embarrassing morning shower as you hoped that you did not expose yourself to the next door neighbors.
The bed was comfortable, nice bedding, except for the splotchy duvet insert (without cover).
We had booked 2 nights, but decided to leave after the first night.
"
54611	6907671	9.0	8.0	38884824	We enjoyed our stay at this precious cottage.  The location is fabulous, convenient to lots of Seattle activities and sight-seeing.  Kristina was prompt in responding to any questions and she left us some lemonade and granola bars, which were really appreciated after our late arriving flight.  The cottage is adorable, open (no doors, aside from bathroom), cozy, and fashionably decorated.  We were truly using the cottage for a place to sleep as our days were busy with visiting friends while dining and taking in the gorgeous scenery of the city.  The deck was awesome with a nice large outdoor sofa and grill- we only wished we had enough time that we could have spent an evening with a bottle of rose out there!  The landscaping is also quite well done and beautiful to be surrounded by while enjoying the outdoor space.  On this particular weekend, it was pretty hot for Seattle standards and this home, like most it seems in Seattle, does not have air conditioning.  We knew this (as it is stated in the profile) before arriving and were prepared, but when it is in the 90's during the day, the house gets quite hot and only one window opens.  We left the doors open while we were at home, but it only did so much to cool the place down and we did not feel comfortable leaving them open at night.  On our last night, when it was the warmest, we were drenched in sweat throughout the night.  We are spoiled in NYC and Texas (where us visitors are from) and are used to moving from one a/c space to another when it is this hot out.  This shouldn't be a big deal most of the year in Seattle as the weather seems pretty perfect- we just happened to be there during a particularly warm weekend.  One note to visitors, if you are planning to use the blow-up mattress or couch for sleeping, you need to bring an extra set of sheets as there are not extras available.  This may change, but it is something to be aware of when planning and packing.  Other than the unusually warm weather, we had an amazing time staying in this charming cottage!  The price is right and you get more of a Seattle experience than you would in a hotel stay.  We recommend!      
54612	6907671	9.0	8.0	40762797	I'm going to start with the positive. This place is in a good location and fairly close to the city. Secondly, it was cute and clean. I do have a couple warnings for anyone staying here. First, the ad for this place says it accommodates up to 4 people. Realistically, it accommodates 1. There is no practical furniture to put anything away! No dressers, nowhere to put toiletries, nothing. Second, the pictures in the ad show a living room full of windows. They DONT open! There is only 1 window that actually opens which means if your out exploring the city all day, your going to come back to a house that is hotter than hell. It was so hot in the house at night, I had to sleep outside on the lovely decorated patio. It was a surprise that the place didn't have A/C but it was a SHOCK to find that none of the windows opened. If I didn't have upcoming reservations, I would have left a lot earlier. My best advice is do not stay here during the summer
54613	6907671	9.0	8.0	42910282	Such a cute cottage! Perfect size for two people. Made us feel so welcome with a gift basket full of essentials! Loved this stay in Seattle! Perfect location too. 
54614	6907671	9.0	8.0	44829802	We had a very nice time at Kristina's cottage. Access was easy. Everything was clean and wifi was a since. I would definitely stay there again. 
54615	6907671	9.0	8.0	46165673	The house was great. We spent all day out and about so it was nice to come home to a quiet neighborhood. The bus was close and 5 doors down was a nice upscale bar. It took about 15 minutes to get to pike market. Loved it. Thanks. 
54767	5471427	9.0	8.0	30981992	"First of all this host is new to Airbnb so has some glitches that more experienced hosts have found out about and do not do. These are mostly newbie mistakes that other hosts have had enough experience to rectify so they are no longer experienced by guests.

One problem I had that  is not the hosts fault but I will mention anyways is my vehicle had a side window broken while parked where I was told to park and a computer stolen. This has cost me over 1000.00 to rectify, a new computer being the bulk of this cost.

The host through feedback has been better able to explain his dwelling on his AirBnb site.

On his site he describes 10:00 PM being the beginning of quiet time. From the day I got there till I felt the need to go to a hotel for 1 night it was loud. The loudness was solved for me by my host providing a fan to create white noise when I came back even though he insisted that different people have different levels that they think are loud. At the end of my month stay there AirBnb investigated and reimbursed me on my credit card for the night I had to leave near  1:00 AM to get some sleep. If fan noise bothers you, you may want to take this into consideration. 

2 weeks prior to my stay I was informed by my host there would be no kitchen rights. I agreed to this since I felt I had not enough time to research and find another place. When I arrived I found out that the home was full of college and post college kids and my room was in the basement next to the washer/dryer. I am an older adult. I also found out my host would not be in the home but his business partner would sometimes be there and sometimes not. One time when I was talking in the basement with one of the young adults there the business partner sleepily showed up to join the conversation and when the young adult commented he did not know he was there he replied ""You can never  know when I am here."" Not something I would expect someone to say in a business. Something you say to children so they behave. The young adults except for the other AirBnb guest have long term leases. Everybody but me had kitchen rights, even the other AirBnb guest. A more experienced host would not give everybody kitchen rights except for one person. I never got kitchen rights.

The host did not believe in paper towels but I was able to talk him into allowing me to buy them to cover my inroom microwave food so it would not splash and then taking them for a walk to dispose of them in public trash can. He eventually bought plastic covers after I had already bought paper towels, and dusters.

I wish him well and success.

54768	5471427	9.0	8.0	38620947	Daniel is incredibly welcoming, perhaps the best Airbnb host I've had! He frequently texted with ideas of Seattle attractions and special events to check out while I was in town. The apartment was easy to access, and arrival/departure instructions were clear and painless. Located in a great area, this spot is ideal for travelers who want access to the U District and surrounding neighborhoods. The room was clean and comfortable, and outfitted with a few nice luxuries. All-in-all, a great place at a very reasonable rate.
54769	5471427	9.0	8.0	40489135	My stay at Daniel's was seamless! I stayed for about ~2 weeks. The house is in a great area, and easy to locate. Semi-private access to the finished basement in the back. Pictures well represented what the room actually looks like. I never did run into Daniel, but met other roommates in the house and they were very pleasant. Daniel offered great advice and suggestions to do/see. Overall a really great experience! 
54770	5471427	9.0	8.0	47675114	Ravena is a beautiful, quiet neighborhood with lots of greenery. The nearby Ravena park offers a bit of nature for those so inclined. (And great running, too!) A bus stop with two lines is just a block away, and a stop with even more lines is five blocks away. Daniel was a great host and has a nice place. My room (in the basement) was quite clean and looked as advertised. 
54771	5471427	9.0	8.0	48802300	I really enjoyed my stay. The place was well run and quiet. The location is great - 30 minutes to downtown by bus. Buses run until 1 am, and there is a late night bus (83) from downtown at 2am and 3:30 am. Daniel was very helpful and the check in process went smoothly.
54772	5471427	9.0	8.0	50129346	"The room is ok. It is a private room full furniture and home electronics
 Dan is very nice and friendly."
54773	5471427	9.0	8.0	52618798	I stayed here for about 2 weeks while apartment hunting. I found it generally pretty quiet and extremely private as you are in the basement of the house. The people I did meet were really nice, I wish I had more time to spend with them! The kitchen is pretty messy so I did not cook hardly at all, but there is a microwave and fridge in the room that are clean. All in all it was totally worth it. 
54774	5471427	9.0	8.0	55434555	Daniel was super nice and every once in a while gave me info on stuff that was happening around the city as well as check in on how my stay was going. As for the listing it was all accurate but I didn't realize that it would be similar to a hostel but on a smaller scale. Not sure if that is because of me reading the description incorrectly or if all airbnb's are like this. Also before booking I did my own research for how safe the area was and needless to say it checked a lot of my boxes for low crime rates.
54800	5340242	8.0	8.0	43915604	Nice place. Conveniently located near a bus stop and a small grocery store.
55172	7500000	10.0	8.0	42976435	"We loved our stay at Mandy's town home! We were surprised to see that her place is even nicer in person than it is in the photos. 

Mandy is really responsive and was flexible on our check in/out times. The whole process was hassle-free.

Couldn't ask for more! Much appreciated."
55173	7500000	10.0	8.0	44021861	"We enjoyed our stay at Mandy's house  and definitely recommend it to visit Seattle! 

We didn't meet Mandy though everything was perfectly arranged, she emailed all the information before arrival, the key was available in a box, and she left us a sheet of paper with all the indication. We felt like at home, finding easily all that we needed, including breakfast with fresh bagels that Mandy had prepared for us!

The house is located south of Seattle and it worked out well to visit the city. We took bus 120 that goes directly to downtown (it takes only 20min) and from the airport we took a Lyft, the ride was $26. 

The house itself was great, like on the pictures, very clean and comfortable for 4 people, Mandy even prepared an extra air mattress for us!"
55174	7500000	10.0	8.0	44972102	"Mandy was a great hostess! She responded to all my inquiries immediately. I took my fiancé to Seattle for his birthday weekend getaway, and Mandy welcomed us with a piece of chocolate cake. She also welcomed us to eat whatever she had in the fridge, but we had already bought groceries when we arrived. She also gave us many great suggestions on what to check out and provided a lot of tourist pamphlets for us look at. 

Her home was so clean, cute and cozy, with lots of windows for natural light. It was also very easy to get to. It was only 15 min to drive to downtown. It was raining this past weekend, so we made use of the nice gas fireplace. Mandy also provided us with umbrellas. The bed and pillows were a little too soft for us though. Every time my fiance moved, I got awoken because I was bouncing around! There was also a futon downstairs that we should've tried.

The neighborhood was a little interesting. There were brand new homes surrounded by fixer uppers, and there was an apartment complex next door. But we felt pretty safe. 

Overall, we would stay here again because Mandy was amazing and her home was really lovely. Thanks Mandy!"
55175	7500000	10.0	8.0	46015412	"Mandy's home is absolutely charming just like the description. She is a master of ultilizing space and making it cozy with color texture and design. The loft style house was open, intimate, very clean and decorated with the perfect minimal northwest style. The master bed and bedding were a dream to sleep in and the kitchen easy to move about and cook. The gift of coffee, orange juice, bagels and cream cheese were perfect because I checked in at 11pm and did not make it to the store.  Mandy provided ideas of sights and tourism around the emerald city, which came in handy when the skies opened up and decided to pour changing our plans. Her home is located on a quiet street, but a close eight minutes away a full size grocery and the beautiful view of Seattle awaits. I felt very welcomed, thank you for the experience!

55176	7500000	10.0	8.0	48583134	We had the most wonderful stay here. My boyfriend and I brought my parents and our small dog and it was plenty spacious. Very cute, clean, nicely decorated, comfortable and accessible to downtown Seattle. 
55700	4340410	7.0	8.0	21930725	Andrew's place was very clean, and welcoming! It was very comfortable  and we felt right at home! The condo is located in a great neighborhood with great restaurants within walking distance, and was a very short distance from downtown Seattle. Also, there is a lot of public transportation nearby and a bike rental right across the street. We would definitely recommend it and stay again!
55701	4340410	7.0	8.0	40759191	The location was great for where I needed to be. It was easy to get to with a lot of street parking. Andrew was also super accommodating since we arrived really early that day and he let us check in early. He also checked in with me a lot to make sure we had everything we needed. Great host!
55702	4340410	7.0	8.0	40931176	Location is directly below major freeway #5.  No air conditioning, and suite was 86 degrees when we arrived.  Opened the window to cool it down but had to shout at each other with the window open due to freeway noise.  There is a tower fan provided.  One towel and one facecloth was provided for my wife and I.  The shower curtain is extremely dirty at the bottom from.  There appears to be a dog that resides in the residence as there was hair found on night stand and dog food present.  I should have inquired about this more carefully with my (website hidden) is being acquired off of Amazon, i think, and channel reception was so very poor we could not watch any.  This was our first time having experienced coming into someone's home where they typically live every day and simply moved out for the night to allow us to stay there.  We will be more selective in the future.
55703	4340410	7.0	8.0	48970120	"Location is great for us (2 adults and 1 child), it's right outside downtown, roughly about 3.5 miles, so we avoid all the traffic but close enough to get in and out of the city. Place is located just north of downtown. 

The living area is nice and cozy. It is located under a freeway though. You can hear it in the living room but it's pretty silent in the bedroom. If you plan on sleeping in the living room couch and a light sleeper this won't be the ideal place for you. Bedroom is nice and quiet. I slept well throughout my stay. 

Everything was described in full detail and exact to the tee so there's no confusion at all. There were some minor issues with the sink but we were notified before hand and didn't effect us at all. Our overall experience was great and will book again if we come back to the Seattle area. Great communication before and throughout our stay. "
55704	4340410	7.0	8.0	57933328	"The place was neat and comfortable. The place smelled musty, like sweaty feet when we walked in. We opened the window in the living room but it was so loud from the traffic since the place is right under the 15 freeway. Was hard to hear one another. The fridge was dirty. The bathroom shower is very little and small flow.  Parking was on the street under the freeway because the host had his car parked in the space in the parking garage. Our car was safe. But there is a homeless camp right there. 

The location was great and convenient. We had a late lunch at the cafe across the street when we first arrived and watched the Seahawks game. We are runners, so we ran from the place to nearby parks and trails. That was nice. The description also says right on the Lake, it's not. It's across the street with businesses and residential in between. No view of the lake from the place. "
56186	2610187	9.0	8.0	12672853	Had a lovely long weekend in Seattle, Melissa was a great host and was there to help with whatever was needed. 
56187	2610187	9.0	8.0	17131715	"Great spot for the price! Melissa was a very good host overall. We searched Seattle for places to rent and this one was very well priced. With that said, do not expect 4/5 star accommodations. 
When we arrived we were skeptical because the outside looks less then desirable. But the inside was clean and a large space for a studio.
If you are planning to get around all of Seattle you will need a car for this place. Nothing special about this area, but we had day trips planned all around Seattle so that didn't matter to us.
If you want to stay in a trendier area with lots to walk to, this is not your place. If you want that you will also pay a lot more money. 
No A/C, which is fine for most Seattle days. We happened to be there on an odd week with days reaching 85 degrees. Melissa was very accommodating and bought us a fan. "
56188	2610187	9.0	8.0	17535566	A great place to stay. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Melissa was kind and helpful.
56189	2610187	9.0	8.0	17792134	Great neighborhood and a really great location relative to bus stops and the parts of the city I wanted to visit. Had a bit of confusion getting into the unit and getting sorted as Melissa wasn't able to meet me there, and I would have preferred a bit more clarity in how check-in was supposed to work. Things were a bit out of sorts when we arrived, but a quick call to Melissa got that sorted out as she sent the cleaning guy over to handle things within 10 minutes. The bed was comfy, the view was great, and the place was nice and quiet. Overall, would definitely stay here again!
56482	9519968	7.0	8.0	56761097	"Do NOT rent this house if you are not the cleanest person of all the people you know. The host will ask you for extra money to clean the house. We are fairly clean people but still had issue. The host was not there when we arrived and was not there when we left. Never showed up. However, after we left, he sent messages to accuse us for damage and dirtiness which he did not see them himself but only heard from the cleaner who can barely write English (the host forwarded the email to us). The email was very hard to understand because the whole email was a bunch of words paled together and barely make any sense. The host accused us with this email as evidence.  Lol
The host denied that the bed has smell but it really does, to a point that I do not want to shower before I sleep in it because I feel it would waste the water that I use to shower. Also, the carpets do not look clean but since the host was not there and we could not point it out, and he used it to accuse us.
The host is also very mean. He said he regret rent his place to someone who does not have review, guess what, it is our first time trying airbnb. If you are new, do not rent this place because the host will have excuse to ask for extra money. Even if you do not care money like us, it may ruin your mood. We gave the host $80 as he wanted it desperately but it ruin our experience with airbnb and we decide not to use airbnb anymore."
56483	9519968	7.0	8.0	56985328	I had a great time staying in this beautiful home.  Paul made us feel very welcomed and was very accommodating.  The house was very clean and we comfortable. I would be happy to stay here again!
56484	9519968	7.0	8.0	57169042	Paul and Connie's home is inviting and spacious. The fireplace and the kitchen are the standouts and really defined our stay. Location is wonderful and convenient. Communication with Paul was excellent and clear. 
56485	9519968	7.0	8.0	58592368	Paul provided an amazing house for me and my parents. The house is well heated in the coldest time in Seattle and the mattresses are super comfy. Recommend for family stays.
56988	385438	8.0	8.0	1717973	The home is lovely, but the pictures make it look much larger than it is. It is ideal for 4 people. The extra mattress to put on the floor of the living room can accommodate one additional person. The garage is useful for keeping vehicle safe, and it is important to know the number of the space to occupy. I was initially nervous because I did not have a number of a local person for emergencies, but we did not have any emergencies, so that was not a problem. We were not able to figure out how to operate the TV, though it did work, it was just too confusing for us. We could not get the coffeemaker to operate either, though I believe it did work. The ice water from the fridge was delicious. We enjoyed using the nice cutlery to prepare fresh fruit purchased at Pike Market. We made eggs one morning for breakfast. There were no instructions for us in the kitchen, so we were not sure what was for our use. The beds were very comfortable. They had air conditioning which was nice in the warm weather. It was not within walking distance of any grocery stores or restaurants that we could find. It would have been great to have had a list of recommended grocery stores and restaurants nearest. I wasn't sure how to operate the broiler, and we chose not to use the grill outside, so we did not cook supper there. Since we were their first AirBnB guests, and it was our first time to be AirBnB guests, it all was really great in the end. Thanks for sharing your home with us!
56989	385438	8.0	8.0	1754639	We stayed here for 3 nights while visitng Seattle.  The condo had everything we needed including a parking spot for our car and was very close to the Space Needle and Downtown.  
56990	385438	8.0	8.0	45154263	The condo was amazing, really great location and great place.  The host had the best communication I have ever experienced, everything was perfect.
56991	385438	8.0	8.0	46187468	Our stay was quite nice, the condo was clean and welcoming. Also, the host was very helpful and easy to work with.  The location of this listing is great- Within walking distance of many cool stores and restaurants and easy access to the highway. Parking was a little bit of a struggle after 5pm. There is a parking lot in front of the building however it fills up quickly so once you park try not to move. This is when we relied on other services to get around. 
59500	6325283	10.0	8.0	34650458	"LaKell sent me the keys ahead of time so that I could just walk in when I got off the plane. She was out of town. There was an issue with her spare key for her building door not working, but she rectified it immediately. 
Her apt was adorable and exactly as shown. Very neat/tidy. The building itself is on the older side, and it's hard to believe her apt is inside it. The apt building 2 buildings down always had a group of guys drinking in front and I would walk down the road perpendicular to her house.  
Her apt was so close to the convention center and convenient to all of downtown Seattle with tons of restaurants and coffee shops at her doorstep. You really can't beat that. Overall a great find!"
59501	6325283	10.0	8.0	34720193	Cozy apartment in a great location - walkable to convention center.  LaKell was very nice and easy to make arrangements with.  Neighborhood has bars, coffeeshops, restaurants.  Building exterior is bland, but the apartment was clean and inviting.
59502	6325283	10.0	8.0	34980620	This was my first time staying in an airbnb and it was awesome! The apartment was perfectly cute and cozy and in such a cool walkable area. 
59503	6325283	10.0	8.0	37631153	Listing was accurate! Very last minute booking and I was impressed that she could respond to such short notice. The neighborhood is near a lot of nice Cap Hill spots but the street itself was a little sketchy. The apt itself seemed to be kept well.
59504	6325283	10.0	8.0	37720486	"Made a last minute reservation with LaKell. She couldn't accept both nights, but I was glad she reached out and modified my request for one night. Her apartment is in a really great area. We walked to a lot of awesome spots. The street itself is a strange pocket of characters that made me a little uneasy. But the building was secure and I felt safe once inside. 

Her space is adorable, exactly as pictured. Soft bed, cozy sheets, good water pressure, everything my husband and I needed for my quick trip in Seattle and LaKell was a great host."
59505	6325283	10.0	8.0	46406815	LaKell's apartment was great! Don't be fooled by the building- Very cute and charming and in a great location close to coffee shops and restaurants, and easy to walk downtown or take a bus.

59506	6325283	10.0	8.0	50584344	Good location. Place was exactly how it was descriped. Easy to get the keys and check in. Nice little apartment!
60016	6545246	8.0	8.0	45307387	There is a pretty nice welcoming community of people staying here. It is a hostel-esque level of accommodations -- you sleep in tight quarters with other travelers & you make your own bed. Pretty good location. The cancellation policy is very strict: I found a real apartment earlier than expected so my room sat empty for over a week.
62382	8934054	5.0	8.0	53012943	This accommodation is great for privacy and for having the space to relax. The hosts were welcoming and very friendly, allowing us to make ourselves at home. The hosts were not there for our two day stay even though it is advertised as a private room. 
62383	8934054	5.0	8.0	57002490	The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
64497	9507115	10.0	8.0	57390048	"       The onsite manager Alan was really helpful during the time my friend and I stayed in Eric's place. He helped us to move our big and heavy suitcases when we arrived at and leaved the studio. Also, he replay messages promptly. 
       The studio is fairly close to the downtown area that it takes about twenty-minutes by taking the bus. 
        Overall, it was a great experience to stay in the studio. However, the studio is quite small for two people to stay I have to say. And if you have lots of luggage, it can be really crowded. "
64816	6425652	8.0	8.0	38602225	"Our hosts were very nice.  The neighborhood was different than expected, but not bad.  It's a long trek up to Broadway, and a short trek down to the South end of Lake Union, where you can find a few restaurants.  However, the apartment is right next to a very loud freeway.  Perhaps this wouldn't matter much in the winter, but the place has no a/c, so we had to keep windows open, and the traffic was really too loud.
One other thing guests should know: the apartment is on the top floor of a four or five storey building with no elevator."
64817	6425652	8.0	8.0	42022301	Cameron was awesome! So friendly, kind and very easy going.  Great place! Comfortable, clean and quite large! The pics do not do the view justice.  I would definitely stay here again!
64818	6425652	8.0	8.0	43142347	A very nice clean apartment with a great view. There was some freeway noise that didn't bother us but might bother some people. Cameron was very easy to deal with.
64819	6425652	8.0	8.0	46202803	Hosts were kind and professional and timely. The apartment was clean and it was only a 4 dollar Uber ride to get to any part of capitol hill we wanted. The freeway noise was noticable, but we got used to it after the first night.

66309	4144767	9.0	8.0	33406979	Great spot! Comfortable for a stay in ballard. Loved the deck and the BBQ. Walking distance from a QFC and the main drag in Ballard.
66310	4144767	9.0	8.0	36394710	Upon arrival at the unit, I had a lot of trouble getting the door to unlock. It appears that the doors had swelled and the lock was not working properly. I made several calls to the rental company and eventually with much maneuvering and pounding the lock worked. It was difficult to use throughout my stay. The lock on the back door could not be opened after the first day. The knob was loose and the lock was stuck. I was told that maintenance was going to resolve it. It did not appear to be the case. The unit was much farther from downtown Ballard. Not really walking distance. The neighborhood was nice. The unit was decorated nicely. The bed was comfortable. 
66311	4144767	9.0	8.0	38570345	I made my reservation the day-of and Sea to Sky was quick to respond, and very easy to deal with. The cottage itself was in a great location, clean, and super cute. I would definitely stay here again!
66312	4144767	9.0	8.0	39306069	"Great little casita in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance from the center of Ballard. Rental required a lot of extra paperwork outside the airbnb system, which surprised me. However, the folks at Sea to Sky were very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again based on the house, but the extra hoops will probably deter me.

It was clean, bright, and full of artistic touches that made our one night stay full of inspiration and ideas for stories. She was easy and quick to get in touch with and very helpful and lenient in our connecting to get the key. We also loved the plants, her doll collection, the piano, and had dinner out on the balcony -- the weather was perfect and the neighborhood was quiet. Thank you Mariana!
66885	5219336	10.0	8.0	33055753	It was interesting staying at Mariana's. She obviously takes pride in her apartment, as well as an extensive doll collection. Her place was very clean. We did have a few communication errors, and as she rents out her entire apartment, she had to stop in a few times, which for me wasn't a problem, as I only needed the apartment for sleep and was gone most of my stay. The day I was supposed to arrive, she asked for more time to get the apartment clean, as she had guests checking out same day. I tried to give her the extra time but apparently gave her too much time. I wish she would have communicated that to me as she seemed annoyed about it when I did arrive. 
66886	5219336	10.0	8.0	33489308	The host canceled this reservation 36 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
66887	5219336	10.0	8.0	35229410	The apartment is charming and is just as listed.  The host welcomed me and I was able to check in pretty early so I could enjoy the rest of the day.  The neighborhood is nice - there are a lot of other apartments in the area.  It's only a block away from a main street that has lots of shops.
66888	5219336	10.0	8.0	35828788	Mariana was a very welcoming host. She communicated well and tried to make our visit a comfortable and enjoyable time.  She was especially accommodating to our daughter who at the last minute needed to stay with us.  We really appreciated her flexibility.  She was also staying in the same building so we were able to easily contact her.
66889	5219336	10.0	8.0	36551985	The place was really nice and clean.  It had a great patio with humming birds and plants.  Plus it was next to a few nice shops and a brewery with great food to help get my day started.
66890	5219336	10.0	8.0	37080595	Mariana's charming apartment was the perfect place to stay during a recent trip to Seattle to attend a wedding. Her apartment is spacious and sunny, full of happy plants and art. Mariana made us feel very welcome, and communication with her was clear and easy. We didn't have time to explore the immediate neighborhood, but we felt very safe and had easy access to the University District from the area. Wish we could've stayed longer!
66891	5219336	10.0	8.0	38761484	Mariana was very accommodating / flexible to my hectic schedule for check in / out purposes, which I found extremely helpful.  She was kind and always responded promptly.  I was actually very busy during my stay in Seattle, so I didn't spend much time in the rental apart from sleeping.  But the rental is exactly what I expected from the listing and pictures.  
66892	5219336	10.0	8.0	39640729	"Mariana was quite flexible in arranging time for check-in and check-out, the apt. was very clean, comfortable, quiet and accessible to all needs of travelers to the area of Seattle. All communications were responded to quickly. Mariana had basic staples for breakfast available in the fridge, although we were usually out the door early, and grabbed breakfast nearby. There is a Starbucks about a three-minute walk away, though in Seattle there are many other great local cafe alternatives to the Giant...
The Elliott Bay Brewhouse, only several blocks away, serves enormous portions of unique foods including sandwiches, dips, etc. not to mention a wide selection of local brews. Very friendly servers, too.
"
66893	5219336	10.0	8.0	50973366	Great host! Great place!
67098	1461971	10.0	8.0	12086050	"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle, at Eric's property. The photos only show some of the elegance of this Seattle cottage home. We had a great stay, the property is very comfortable - comfortable beds and sofas, and well equipped kitchen. We even had our own little easter egg hunt in the pretty garden.
The neighbourhood feels very safe, the off-road parking conveneinet, and overall location is well suited for visiting Seattle and surrounding sites."
67099	1461971	10.0	8.0	18350909	"Eric was a great host. He was responsive and checked in with me to make sure we arrived safely. 
It's a beautiful house and comfortable. The backyard and deck are great. For those with kids it's good to know bathroom is downstairs. We made it work fine and the beds were very comfortable. 
It's close to some good parks and easy to get to from the 5. Overall good experience!"
67100	1461971	10.0	8.0	18823623	This is a great (and huge) house with a beautiful backyard and deck.. the only issue we had was that the internet was broken during our stay.
67101	1461971	10.0	8.0	40127183	Great place to stay, especially for the price! The living spaces, kitchen and bathroom were clean and provided plenty of room for the time we spent at the house. The rooftop deck that overlooks the backyard, accessible from the master bedroom, was also pretty cool. I wish it hadn't rained so much while we were there so we could have hung out on it more. The backyard is also beautifully forested and peaceful. I'd recommend this place to anyone who will have a car and is looking for a house in a quiet neighborhood. It was only about a 15 minute drive to U District and 30 minutes to Capitol Hill.
67102	1461971	10.0	8.0	42127818	This house was perfect for us! Eric was great and made sure we were comfortable in his home upon arrival. The location is close to lots of food and stores. It's also an easy drive to downtown Seattle. The house was spacious enough for 4 adults and a toddler. Our favorite part of the house would have to be the huge, beautiful backyard. I'd absolutely recommend this property!
67103	1461971	10.0	8.0	44350039	Eric is a great host!  He is very communicative. His place is clean and comfortable. 
68868	8921924	10.0	8.0	55929498	Logan greets you with the warmest, biggest smile. The room and her home are clean and warm and cozy. She is super generous and a great conversationalist with a great sense of humor. We had some some fun talks and a couple movie nights. And....if you're lucky, she might let you sample some of her cooking- she's a gourmet chef! Having said that, the house is also set up so that you have your privacy and autonomy. Had a great time! I would definitely stay again.
68869	8921924	10.0	8.0	57247277	Logan was a great host and the room was cozy. She's very helpful and makes you feel welcomed into her home. Her 2 cats are adorable as well. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. 
69010	670021	7.0	8.0	2243336	Tiki's house was a clean, pretty and cozy place to stay. It has a full kitchen, a living room (with TV) and a small work place. I expected a small room to sleep in but it was definitely beyond that. And even if you don't have a car, there are several bus stops near house (0.4~1mile) where you can take a bus to downtown, UW, northgate, etc. I enjoyed staying there!
69011	670021	7.0	8.0	2581005	"They are just getting started in the BnB world so they have a few things they are still working on. My room was missing a few things to make me feel at home (like hangers, and a place to store by clothes, curtains- I let Darlene know and it was sorted out). A few things in the bathroom and kitchen needed some loving care like a constantly running toilet and leaking shower- again, Darlene tried her best to fix these things up. 

It's a bit far away from the city but there are numerous bus routes within 15 minutes walk (up and down hills). If you don't have luggage and don't mind dodging cars, it's a lovely walk on a sunny day. 

They are making more improvements to the property all the time so hopefully your stay will be nice. But where else can you be welcomed by a Native Indian-American at a few hours notice? Thanks again. "
69012	670021	7.0	8.0	3069686	"Very nice place to stay, and Tiki has added a coffeemaker and small dining table for those of us who can't use the high bistro table.  The room and bed are tight for two people, just right for one.  You will enjoy staying here if you don't mind sharing the house with a stranger.  It worked out fine for us.
"
69013	670021	7.0	8.0	15780051	"Darlene is great, she helped us a lot because we were new in town. The home is very comfy and there are everything that you need in the house.

"
69014	670021	7.0	8.0	16129311	Really enjoyed staying with Darlene!  Her location a little remove from did town really feels like you are in western Washington, not just another city! Stayed with my girlfriend for two nights and we were both very comfortable!
69015	670021	7.0	8.0	16870585	Darlene was great and her home is very nice and cozy. She was a great host
69016	670021	7.0	8.0	22066946	Good for its price. Close to hwy. many stores closed by. Internet was a bit slow. The house was kept clean,  it has its unique smell to it. The provided towels were a bit old. But then again, for the price it beats the hotel. Some snacks and juices were provided.  
69017	670021	7.0	8.0	28931565	"I and my wife spent 5 months at Darlene's place. The first 3 months we were paying cash directly to her. The last two months we were using the Airbnb service.
The location is acceptable, Lake City way is in 10 min walking distance. One disadvantage the location has is that the neighborhood is not save for walk after hours.
For the first 2 months leaving at Darlene’s place was good. After that we started having troubles with her. Since Darlene leaves at the garage, her presence at the house is constant, which fine–this is her house after all, but there were two occasions that she was drunk and she was behaving really bad. One of the times she was drunk, she unlocked and entered in second room, which was rented by another couple (they was not in the house at that moment). At that time I was at home and I told her that she is not supposed to enter in the room while the people are out, she answered me that she is the owner of the house and she can do whatever she wants, and she told me ”stupid boy”. One time she entered in our room without knock while my wife was there. So if you are looking for a place where the room you are renting has some level of privacy, maybe Darlene’s place is not the best.
There were cases, while we are at home, she came in and unplug the power adapter of our laptop. There were also cases when she was unplug the heater no matter that it was cold for us to save electric power.
About cleaning the house, in general she didn’t maintain the house clean, no matter that this was her responsibility. Sometimes it was taking more than 2 weeks for her to get us clean sheets and towels (again her every week responsibility).We would be very happy to wash and dry more frequently the sheets and towels by ourselves, but she didn’t allow us to use the washer and dryer for sheets and towels.
Two weeks before we left she came drunk and asked me what we'll do next month. I replied that we are looking for an apartment and we will not stay in her house. She got really angry, and started causing troubles. She turned off the fuse of the washer (the fuse box is in the garage) and asked us extra money to use washer and dryer. Therefore, we didn't use washer and dryer last two weeks.
The check-in to the house didn’t take time and was easy, but on the day we were checking-out Darlene came early in the morning and started cleaning the bathroom, we were not able to use the bathroom, and we should leave two hours earlier."
69018	670021	7.0	8.0	42377484	My parents came to Seattle to attend my college graduation ceremony. We stayed together at Tiki's house for one month, and after my parents left, I stayed for another month, during which I met several other nice tenants. Since Tiki converted her garage into a studio for herself, my parents and I lived next door but separately from Tiki. It was a wonderful experience for my parents and I, as the house provided us with enough privacy and Tiki was chill about a lot of things. When I went to work during weekdays, my parents took a walk around the neighborhood. It was a nice neighborhood with a lot of tall trees, which made it cool during hot days but also not much direct sunshine into the house. Tiki invited me to her daughter's party but unfortunately I didn't make it. The house was close to Safeway, QFC, gas stations, a bus stop to downtown Seattle and a bunch of restaurants. The only inconvenience was Tiki charged for laundry. Mostly my mom hand-washed our summer clothes, and I went to the nearby laundromat once. 
69019	670021	7.0	8.0	47294382	Darlene was a great host. Bed was comfortable and TV and wifi worked fine. 
69252	4825073	10.0	8.0	24208925	"Christina and Evan (and their dog, Mori!) are lovely, as is their house. They were so friendly and had a ton of recommendations for the area. The location is great -- quick access to the highway and pretty much all of Seattle. The neighborhoods in the area are so cute! 

The space is the entire basement and is really cozy. It's clean, comfortable and there's a lot of light, which isn't always the case in basements, and I loved the heated floors in the bathroom!

I would recommend Christina's place to anyone!"
71911	7219541	8.0	8.0	42778299	We had a nice stay at Mie's house.  The room was clean, quiet, and was in a good neighborhood.  We would stay there again.
72016	1340668	8.0	8.0	5688061	I had the honor of being the first Airbnb guest in the lovely home of Tahoma, Laura, and Spencer. They easily rose to the challenge of new hosts, thanks to their friendly, generous, thoughtful and positive attitudes. They kindly invited me to join their BBQ dinner party with their extended family. It was a blast! I highly recommend staying here if you have the chance.
72017	1340668	8.0	8.0	5858389	Easy to fine, easy parking.  Offered kitchen & laundry, far more than I needed.  Nice room and nice bed.
72018	1340668	8.0	8.0	5900710	"Tahoma and Laura are wonderful hosts and made me feel right at home. The room is spacious and very clean. Spencer and I hit it off right away. The location is convenient. There is a running trail in the neighborhood. Grocery and restaurants are all within walking distance. The bus works great and I got in downtown for my meeting in 30 minutes.
I would highly recommend Tahoma and Co. I will definitely stay with them again next time in town."
72019	1340668	8.0	8.0	5931980	Tahoma and Laura were really friendly and great at making sure I had everything I needed during my stay. 
72020	1340668	8.0	8.0	6199895	Tahoma, Laura, and Spencer were all great hosts. Very easy to talk to and super accommodating. The room was spacious and clean, (and the washer/dryer was seriously the fanciest washer/dryer I have ever seen). Unfortunately I was working the entire time I was there. I wish I had more time to spend with them. Bus stops were very conveniently located a block away, and I either took the bus or biked to work each day.
72021	1340668	8.0	8.0	6265475	Stayed one night with Tahoma and Laura and it was delightful! The room was clean and the bed was super cozy! It was super easy to get from the house right into downtown on the bus which was very helpful! I had a chance to chat with Laura, despite my short stay, and she was very welcoming and nice to talk with! I highly recommend staying with them!
72022	1340668	8.0	8.0	6314089	"Had a wonderful stay. The room was very spacious and clean. We were able wash our clothes which was perfect timing for us. 

Although we didn't get to meet to Tahoma on our check in, we were welcomed by laura who let us check in later in the day which was was perfect for us. She also gave us local recommendations and was very warm and welcoming!  We would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends!"
72023	1340668	8.0	8.0	6360535	I only stayed one night but the room was very nice, really clean and i felt safe and comfortable in the house. Tahoma was really nice and was more than ready to help out with anything i needed. Recommended. 
72024	1340668	8.0	8.0	6491548	My husband and I stayed here for a few days to explore Seattle. The location is very convenient and you can't beat the price. Laura, Tahoma's fiance is the one that handled everything in regards to our stay. She is extremely friendly and very accommodating. She asked if we would be cooking and brought down her cast iron skillet and small rice cooker for us to use. The bedroom is very clean with a large desk and was actually nicer than in the photo. She was very thoughtful and actually put in little items like Starbucks instant coffee, tea, sparkling water, a spare razor, shampoo and condition etc.  As I said above, her spot is very convenient for a few nights stay while exploring Seattle and you can't beat the price.
72025	1340668	8.0	8.0	6571012	"great stay at Tohoma and Linda place.
Linda and Tohoma gave us some good advices and were ready to help us when necessary

house is as described
easy with the bus 358 to be downtown Seattle"
72026	1340668	8.0	8.0	6702274	My stay was in a basement near the washer and dryer.  The room was nice but still needs a few things like a reading lamp.  The bed was excellent and the shared bath was decent.  A bike was promised but had a flat tire.  I think it's a bargain just needs some fine tuning.
72027	1340668	8.0	8.0	6893882	Tahoma was such a friendly host. Location was super convenient as    buses to downtown and the funky neighbourhoods of Freemont and Ballard can be caught from just around the corner. Roommate Trevor was barely around, but friendly when we did see him. Kitchen was pretty bare bones so if you're planning on doing your own cooking, scout it out first. Overall, this place worked for us.
72028	1340668	8.0	8.0	7019612	"I had a great time in Seattle and at Tahoma and Laura's house.
The place is quite and nice just a reading lamp is missing :-). It is very easy to get to downtown by bus. The stop is just 2 blocks down.
This place is a bargain and an I would come back anytime again."
72029	1340668	8.0	8.0	7253676	Laura, Tahoma and Spencer were great hosts! Their space is great, though I agree with the previous reviewer that it could use a reading lamp. Their home is clean, comfy and in a great location for exploring the city (gotta love the Aurora express bus!)  mahalo for letting us stay while we find our new home in Seattle!
72030	1340668	8.0	8.0	7475897	Staying with Tahoma, Laura and Spencer was an absolute delight. They are prompt with communication and made it easy for me to arrive when they weren't home. The bedroom space is perfectly private, yet a comfortable community feel when you open the door to the dining area and the bathroom. The room was clean and cozy, yet spacious. They are wonderful people. I would stay here many times over!
72031	1340668	8.0	8.0	7756746	The bed was epic.   Extremely comfortable.   Really quiet.   I was pretty much gone all day but you get a lot with this daily rate.   Kitchen, laundry, and the bus is right there.   I gave it three because of Northgate and not because of the home.    There really isn't much to do in the neighborhood and eating options are slim to none in the neighborhood.   BUT there is no way in hell you are going to get this deal closer to the city.  So there you have it.   
72032	1340668	8.0	8.0	8323391	The hosts were very nice and helpful, they had my puppy play with theirs upstairs while I was out and about. And I got to do laundry! 
72033	1340668	8.0	8.0	9065056	What a great place! I would recommend it to anyone coming to Seattle. Located near everything you need and Tahoma, Laura and Spencer couldn't been more welcoming and accommodating. 
72034	1340668	8.0	8.0	10358172	Staying with Tahoma and Laura has been great. I've had great conversation with Spencer, Laura, and Tahoma... and shared a few glasses of wine. Their place has fit just right for me and my needs. The bed is super comfy! Thanks all!
72035	1340668	8.0	8.0	16874655	We only needed a short stay and this space was great, clean, comfortable, convenient and friendly hosts. I would recommend it. 
72036	1340668	8.0	8.0	17071035	We enjoyed staying with Tahoma and Laura, they were excellent hosts and gave us a lot of good advice and good conversation. The room was comfortable, the description was accurate and the neighbourhood is very nice.  We were pleasantly surprised by the clean and comfortable room. The connections to downtown Seattle are very easy to use and conveniently located. 
72037	1340668	8.0	8.0	17633768	"My stay at Tahoma and Laura's place was enjoyable. 
The room is in the basement with a separated entry.
The room is a decent size, coming with a super comfy bed (double/queen size?), a big desk and a closet space.
There are a shower and also a small kitchen and dinning area. 
You would share the basement area (kitchen and shower) with Spencer who is super friendly guy. 
The washer and dryer are right outside the room. 
Overall, the room is pretty quiet. The house is at a quiet block so you cannot really hear the traffic. You can hear footsteps and sometimes the voices from up stair, but that's what you get living in a house. I'm pretty used to it. 
One little complain though is the wifi. The connection at kitchen area is great, but not in the room. If you are like me who like to enjoy some before bed TV streaming, it might be sightly difficult. After Tahoma got the company to fix it (thank you!), it got better but still not ideal. But this situation did make me quit facebook and tv shows for a week. I won't say it's a bad thing really. 

I didn't hire a car during this trip, and the location of this house made it very easy for me to get around. 
E-Line will take you to the north and down south through Green Lake, Seattle Center to downtown where you can easily make connections to other neighborhoods like Capital Hill. (Also, free wifi one RapidRide!)
40 will take you to Ballard and Northgate. 
There are also little gems even just around the walking distance around neighborhood.
For  example, about 5-10 mins north, there is one amazing Mexican food truck next to Home Depot's parking lot. 
5 mins south, you get the Burger Mater with nice onion rings and milkshakes. A bit further south, you can find the Boardroom cafe. Free refilled coffee (decent coffee) and awesome breakfast balls and burittos. 
Yup, the main purpose of my trip this time was food adventure, and this place made my life pretty easy. "
72038	1340668	8.0	8.0	17889775	I enjoyed my stay! Spencer was very nice and the bed was very comfortable. 
72039	1340668	8.0	8.0	18090864	What a terrific place to stay! The room is in the basement, no frills, but if you're just looking for a place to stay after wandering around Seattle all day, this is it. I met Tahoma, Spencer, and Laura, all wonderful, welcoming people.  It's really easy to get to the house by bus, just take the E line. It runs every 10 minutes or so and will have you downtown in 20. Highly recommend!
72040	1340668	8.0	8.0	32635853	We had a great stay. Cozy room, super sweet hosts and great location.
72041	1340668	8.0	8.0	40587457	"Tahoma has been a great host and is extremely warm and welcoming. I had an absolutely wonderful time at his apartment this summer. The connectivity to the local E-line buses (bus-stop is just a block away) is the best part. 
The wifi connectivity has some scope for improvement, otherwise the apartment description is accurate and there were no major glitches.
"
72042	1340668	8.0	8.0	49129356	Tahoma and his family made me feel very welcome. As far as the neighborhood goes it really is a short walk to Carkeek Park, and is relatively quiet. I found myself spending a lot of my spare time in Greenwood a short distance away. 
73775	8168876	10.0	8.0	48624981	"We had a great stay at the bungalow. It was very well appointed (especially being run by a rental company). We did feel that the place felt a small lack of life given that there are not people living there full time, but some people would consider that a plus. We personally like meeting with the hosts and talking to them about the area, their favorite spots to eat, etc. 

FWIW Sea to Sky had all this information available, and the check in was very straight forward. Location was great and the areas to relax were awesome, especially the backyard and the front porch. 

Thanks!"
74196	9473312	10.0	8.0	58376194	We had a fantastic time in Jamie's bungalow. The location was great - very cute neighborhood and close to downtown. The space was a good size and cutely decorated. The beds were really comfortable. Communication was prompt and thorough. We would definitely recommend them!
75558	9238818	10.0	8.0	54053068	The listing was accurate - pics were great! The neighborhood was safe, the place was clean and overall our experience was great.
75559	9238818	10.0	8.0	56861791	Cute little house! I stayed here for three weeks.  It was super clean and had everything I needed.  House is on a VERY busy street, but there was a driveway for parking.  Laundry was in the basement and entry was only accessible from outside.  The house manager was VERY responsive to my needs and questions via text.  
76287	4589654	9.0	8.0	25288340	The host was great, very responsive. The apartment was nice, and the neighborhood is an old favorite of mine. 
76288	4589654	9.0	8.0	28308586	Nice big space for a great price. Not too far of a drive from the heart of Seattle.
76289	4589654	9.0	8.0	28507832	We enjoyed the 'main floor' of this house at the edge of a pleasant neighborhood of older homes. The rooms were very comfortable, well supplied and very nicely decorated. A nice feature of this property is the multitude of interesting books available. Ms Brecht was always prompt and complete in communicating. A fair bit of aircraft noise might bother some at night depending on air traffic patterns.
76290	4589654	9.0	8.0	30155619	Cute spot. A bit further from downtown Seattle. The house is MUCH bigger than the photographs let on, and our host was very helpful. 
76291	4589654	9.0	8.0	32651989	"Travelling with our parents can be a challenge and My Mum could not stay at the loca, which I thought was fine. So we left before we use the house. 
Roda was incredible - she gave us a full discount. Service and kindness which I will incorporate into my own flat om Airbnb. 

Thank you Roda - we had a nice time in Seattle - and you have a big honour in that "
76292	4589654	9.0	8.0	33151694	The description is accurate - a sweet home away from home. Roda was quick and responsive, and though we did not meet,  let us check in early to drop our luggage since we had a morning arrival. That was incredibly kind and luxurious.The keycode access was convenient. The neighborhood definitely requires a car or public transit. It is apparent this is a pet-friendly place, (just faint pet smell) but everything was clean and the bathroom was spotless with fresh linens. Overall a great experience, very easy to book and a great base for our Seattle adventure!
76293	4589654	9.0	8.0	40058629	Roda was very kind and sweet over the phone and helpful with all my questions while she hosted me in her lovely house. Thank you so much for making my first experience in Seattle welcoming and easy. Roda is amazing and I would recommend her to everyone.
76294	4589654	9.0	8.0	45096807	The home was lovely, very comfortable, and in a good location to travel around Seattle. Roda was great with helping us to plan our trip and keeping in touch!
76295	4589654	9.0	8.0	47111966	Roda has been extremely responsive, always answered my messages almost immediately. Nice, bright, clean and spacious apartment located on a quiet street, around 15-20 minutes drive from downtown Seattle, depending on traffic. The neighbourhood isn't the glitziest part of the city, but we didn't encounter any problem. 
76296	4589654	9.0	8.0	47449668	Host was kind and welcoming. We only stayed for a couple nights but it was enjoyable. Easy access into the house but felt bad that my boyfriend and I forgot there are tenants downstairs and were watching the TV very loud the first night. Definitely kept that in mind during the second night and tried to be mindful of being respectful to the long-term tenants. Great price & location though since we were visiting family. Also loved the wine! Thank you Roda!
76297	4589654	9.0	8.0	48249996	It was clean comfortable and really easy to get to. Roda made everything great, and even threw in a bottle of wine! Great place to stay.
76298	4589654	9.0	8.0	48941245	What can I say?  My buddies and I were wowed by Roda's place!  To say that it was perfect for our trip to Seattle would be quite the understatement.  From the selection of beds to the warmth of the home and the location, we loved every aspect of our stay.  While the neighborhood may at first appear to be ho hum and maybe not the trendiest, it was quiet and a perfect distance from both the airport (about 15 minutes) and downtown (again... 15 minutes).  The proximity to highways and such was key.  We were in town to see our beloved Chicago Bears play the Seattle Seahawks, and ended up taking an uber to the stadium for next to nothing.  A 15-minute drive (if that).  All in all we had a great time, Roda was available to answer my questions, and the accommodations were as nice as they appears on the site.  This will be our place of choice if/when we come back.
76299	4589654	9.0	8.0	49526098	It's really a wonderful house. Everything is perfect. Environment is also good and there are many beautiful adornments in the house. What's more, it's also convenient if we want to go to spots. In conclusion, this house is really a good choice if you want to travel  to Seattle.
76300	4589654	9.0	8.0	53194157	Roda's apartment was perfect for us. First off, the location was great, we were working close by at Boeing. The interior is nicely done, the kitchen had all amenities and it was great returning here after a long work day. The place was very clean and communication with Roda and her husband was easy. I can highly recommend this apartment.
76301	4589654	9.0	8.0	54596430	I have to say Roda's place was nothing less than GREAT.  This old home in a historic neighborhood is so comfortable and convenient it rates A+.  Especially the hospitality Roda & Marvin give.  The little touches in this home make it a very inviting place to stay.  Cleanliness is above & beyond along with an ample supply of consumables to make the stay easy.  If there is another trip to Seattle I will check Roda's availability before checking for a flight.
76456	696004	10.0	8.0	2965846	My parents had a wonderful stay at Wendy's.  Not only is the apartment beautiful; it is warm, cozy and sparkling clean.  She has a wonderful gas fireplace that they really appreciated.  You can tell she put everything together with a lot of love.  It is very close to a lot of places which you can access by bus, i.e. downtown Seattle, South Center Shopping Mall and the happening spots in West Seattle.  They would definitely choose to stay there again on their next visit.   
76457	696004	10.0	8.0	5405691	Wendy is a great communicator, and listened to my needs and wants. She was present and friendly.  
76458	696004	10.0	8.0	5933083	Wendy's place was a nice cozy and spacious place.  It looks much more cozier in person, the pictures do not justify. I liked how it has a separate keyless passcode entry, so i didnt have to worry about checking in too late and needing to wake up the host (though she did come down to give us a warm welcome anyway!)  Wendy was a great host, the instruction book is a blueprint to everything in the house and she is thorough in explaining all amenities. She'll try her best to meet your needs for the stay if its not already accomplished. 
76459	696004	10.0	8.0	6089124	"We thought Wendy's place was quite nice. It gave us the opportunity to explore West Seattle, and still be close to the rest of the city.
She was extremely helpful in every way.Her place is very quiet, and well set up. "
76460	696004	10.0	8.0	6259261	"Staying with Wendy was amazing! She is a great and very helpful communicator. She was helpful with directions and gave us advice on what bus we should take to downtown Seattle. We had correspondence prior to our arrival and she was detailed and thorough with her answers, it felt like we knew the area already. We arrived after 9:00 pm and she came down to greet us. She is such a happy and enthusiastic person. She immediately made us feel at home. She even went through the trouble of looking up restaurants opened at that time because we had told her we were hungry.

The apartment was gorgeous! Couldn't have asked for something better. Private entrance, own living room, bathroom, and private bedroom. Everything private. It was unbeatable. Best airbnb experience we've had so far! And Wendy knew so much about the architecture of the apartment. Everything was so clean. Wendy really does know how to take care of her tenants. We weren't left wanting in any way. She had everything prepared for us.

It was a very pleasant stay! Thank you Wendy and we hope to see you soon, on our next trip to Seattle (whenever that may be).

Many thanks,

Wei & Daniel"
76461	696004	10.0	8.0	6401568	"Wendy's property was in a great location just a 15-minute drive from downtown Seattle.  It was nice to be slightly distanced since it made finding parking a lot easier.  Speaking of which, Wendy allows you to park in her driveway so you don't have to worry about parking on the street.

The unit itself was very clean and Wendy welcomed us with some fresh fruit as well as breakfast muffins and yogurt in the fridge.  The space is private and cozy, nicely renovated.  It's easy to access the unit with your own separate entrance with key code so you don't have to worry about losing a key.

I would recommend this place to someone staying in Seattle, it is much cheaper than the hotels in the city and is conveniently located and clean. "
76462	696004	10.0	8.0	6501258	We had a great stay! Wendy's place is beautiful and welcoming and she was a lovely host. The only downside was the location - very far from the downtown and other attractions. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend staying here!
76463	696004	10.0	8.0	7019103	I had a very nice stay. The apartment was very private and comfortable.
76464	696004	10.0	8.0	8122986	"We stayed at Wendy""s apartment on a visit to Seattle; West Seattle is a great place to stay, a little away from the hustle and bustle, but not to far away from the city.  Wendy's place is in the southern part of West Seattle, so it's a few minutes from the main part of West Seattle, but very easy to get on main highways.  The apt is very cozy,very beautifully furnished, and very handicapped accessible if that is needed.  Wendy was very helpful in answering questions and making sure we were settled."
76465	696004	10.0	8.0	12886712	My mom and I stayed in this delightful apartment together for a week. My mom arrived before I did and Wendy was very helpful in showing her around the apartment. This sweet apartment was more than I expected. High ceilings, lots of windows and very spacious. The apartment is completely private and very quiet. Wendy has outdone herself with the extra touches! A fully stocked kitchen including juice, milk, an assortment of keureg coffee, fruit, pots and pans for cooking. Even aluminum foil and olive oil. The bathroom is large and is also fully stocked with an assortment of shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste and organic hand cream. Why would you stay in a tiny hotel room when you can have an entire apartment? We have family in Seattle and come a couple of times a year and will be staying here again!
76466	696004	10.0	8.0	14431758	We traveled to Seattle recently to visit our son, daughter-in-law and grandson, soon to be 4 years old.  My wife is disabled and we were traveling on a budget.  When Airbnb was first suggested we were a little skeptical, but when we met Wendy, our hearts and minds were so relieved.  She was a marvel. Her apartment was beautiful and had all the amenities listed, plus much more.  Wendy's charm was engulfing from the very first time we met.  The apartment was immaculate, roomy, wonderfully appointed and full of locale advice.  Her hospitality and wisdom of the area would make this the perfect place for any traveler to stay when visiting Seattle.  We felt truly Blessed to have met and stayed with her.  We certainly hope that we may experience her company on a future trip. 
76467	696004	10.0	8.0	15069673	"Wendy was very friendly. We loved staying there. Private entrance and a private apartment with access to free wifi and a washing machine. A few blocks away we could catch the bus to downtown Seattle. The bus ride is about 40 min and just about 20 min by taxi. Taxi fare is about $30.

We would recommend asking Wendy as she knows about hidden pearls in Seattle. Thank you Wendy for our stay."
76468	696004	10.0	8.0	15325345	Wendy is a very responsible person. She replied my message very promptly whenever I have questions. 
76469	696004	10.0	8.0	15562502	The accommodations were exactly as described, very private (entire basement area with separate locking door) and spacious. Wendy was very gracious and even went out of her way to print us bus maps to help us navigate from West Seattle to downtown. The area is a little far from downtown if you do not have a car (~30 mins by bus) but this is clearly described in the listing and there are multiple bus options to get to and from Seattle from Wendy's house. Overall I would recommend staying at Wendy's apartment for anyone looking to enjoy the Seattle area.
76470	696004	10.0	8.0	15699345	My partner, her mom and I traveled to Seattle recently to attend a wedding.  The apartment was in a safe neighborhood, with friendly neighbors, conveniently located between downtown and the airport and was way more comfortable than staying at a hotel room.  We didn't have time to try the water taxi from West Seattle to Pier 50, but it seemed like a very nice alternative to driving.  Also, appreciated that Wendy's driveway was big enough for us to park our SUV rental.  Didn't need to worry about finding parking!  In addition, Wendy was very accomodating and allowed us to leave our luggage in the foyer prior to check in.  Lastly, with the keyless coded lock we didn't have to arrange a time to pick up keys.  Since we didn't know our schedule that was definitely a bonus.  Also, nice to not have to bring keys with us or worry about losing keys!
76471	696004	10.0	8.0	15894316	Beautiful place to stay.  Calling this space a basement doesn't do it justice, as it has full length windows and tall ceilings. Great space, great location, great host!
76472	696004	10.0	8.0	16020550	Wendy was a GREAT host. She was incredibly helpful and welcoming. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and had a lot of extra amenities that made us feel right at home. Thank you Wendy! 
76473	696004	10.0	8.0	16314577	"Wendy was a lifesaver!

We needed a last minute place to stay with our 4 and 2 year old while our floors are getting refinished.  Wendy's 1 bedroom worked out great for us.  

The 1 bedroom slept our 2 children and the apartment was the perfect size to accommodate us all.  While cable tv wasn't offered, the Wi-fi provided allowed us all the streaming content we needed on our iPad to keep our kids busy and occupied.  We had everything we needed during our stay and recommend this apartment for their stay in West Seattle."
76474	696004	10.0	8.0	16485994	Wendy was an awesome host. Even before we arrived she provided excellent references on where to ride our bikes as well as where to find gluten free food. We ended up riding her favorite ride which had excellent views of Seattle and other waterfronts. The apartment was very cute and clean. The location was very easy access to Seattle too. We will definitely stay with her again.
76475	696004	10.0	8.0	16732602	"The apartment was so large the kitchen efficient, toaster oven, induction stovetop, Miele refrigerator and freezer more then enough lighting throughout. Bath was large with all usual amenities you would find in a hotel, and more. bedroom large bed comfortable neighborhood was quiet and close to stores and restaurants. 

I would definately go back for another stay. Wendy was personable and made you feel really welcome even though she wasn't there her house sitter was helpful and extremely pleasant I give it 10 Stars **********!!!"
76476	696004	10.0	8.0	16910281	We had such a great experience in Seattle at Wendy's. She was so kind and communicative prior to our stay. She even asked if there was any baby proofing we needed done for our eight month old! The apartment was so clean and comfortable. Wendy welcomed us when we arrived. It was like staying with an old friend. We highly recommend staying here and will definitely stay again in the future.
76477	696004	10.0	8.0	17426884	Wendy's apartment is just as she lists it: beautiful and accessible.  We recently stayed there for almost a week for our daughter's wedding and it suited our purpose to a T.  It is quiet with great ventilation and very close to our daughter's home.  The shower is great!  We loved that the code to get in was a number that was easy for us to remember.  There are a couple of great breakfast places within walking distance. Our hosts were very welcoming and helpful with our extra requests.  We will definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.
76478	696004	10.0	8.0	17650295	"First off, the space is practical, attractive, clean, and quite roomy for a one bedroom. It is accessible, as advertised, and we also found it to be relatively safe for our one year old son who was just starting to walk. Parking for our vehicle was available in the driveway and we found the location to be convenient to access downtown Seattle, the freeway system, and Sea-Tac Airport. Another plus, we found the keyless entry to the suite to be particularly convenient - the last thing you want to worry about while on vacation is losing a key.

Second, Wendy was a hospitable and helpful host, going so far as to stock the fridge with some basics  and also providing a small snack for us upon arrival.  We didn't have a lot of direct interaction but Wendy was friendly and helpful, and made herself available if we required. 

We didn't get  much chance to explore the neighbourhood but there is a wide variety of restaurants nearby, some within walking distance. 

We would stay here again and would recommend the accomodations to friends without hesitation . "
76479	696004	10.0	8.0	17978890	Our stay at Wendy's was perfect! It was our first experience with airbnb and it could not have been better. The house was very comfortable, close to everything, and she had plenty of information on what to do. We didn't see her for the first couple nights, although check in was flawless, and when we did meet her she was a joy to talk to- a human encyclopedia of the area and wildlife! We would definitely recommend her house!! Much better than a hotel room for sure! (And plenty of coffee!!) Thanks Wendy!
76480	696004	10.0	8.0	18101337	We had a great, very comfortable stay! Wendy is very hospitable and so kind.  The apartment is extremely clean and convenient.  All in all a fantastic stay.
76481	696004	10.0	8.0	18865391	Good place, just the location wasn't perfect and the closest strip of shops was quite run down and shabby...our street was lovely though. The house sitter was lovely and welcoming.
76482	696004	10.0	8.0	19056263	"Wow.  What a nice treat!  The MIL apartment is an intelligently remodeled basement in a quiet South Seattle neighborhood. It is private and quite well appointed, with all the creature comforts of home. 

Wendy is a pleasant host,  full of knowledge and recommendations for things to do and places to go. I am happy to recommend her place for anyone passing through or coming to stay."
76483	696004	10.0	8.0	19428244	"Comfortable, Clean place. Great host, Nice Lady. I do recommend it. 
Thanks, Wendy. "
76484	696004	10.0	8.0	19983754	"We had a wonderful time at Wendy's place!  There was a separate entrance to the apartment so it felt very private and the area was very quiet.  Wendy had a house manual that described in detail everything we needed to know about the space.  She even left us a bottle of wine and a few pastries to welcome us!

The space was clean, spacious, and very comfortable.  Everything was exactly as described (even better!).  She even has a keurig coffee machine with a variety of coffee K-cups, which was perfect for us as we are definitely coffee addicts!"
76485	696004	10.0	8.0	21514906	"Wendy  – studio apt.

My wife and 6 year old daughter stayed at this location for 8 days in October. Everything was as we 

expected it from the airbnb ad. We enjoyed the convenience of being 10 miles from downtown Seattle 

and about the same distance to Sea-Tac but not actually being in the city. It was a great little area to 

come home to at night after a day of sightseeing. Wendy took care of any issues we had, which were 

limited to how to use the heating in the apartment and that was all. 

The only convenience which would have made it a touch nicer would be more TV channels especially for 

local sports. Not that we vacationed to Seattle to watch TV but it would have made catching up on all 

the sports news a little easier. We did have WiFi so logging into NetFlix wasn’t an issue for my family. 

No complaints... would highly recommend to anyone looking at visiting Seattle that doesn’t want to stay 

downtown but rather in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood within close proximity to all attractions. 

4.5 stars"
76486	696004	10.0	8.0	22703551	Wendy was a wonderful host and her place is great - cozy, located in a nice neighborhood and looks exactly as the photos. Hope to visit her again sometime :)
76487	696004	10.0	8.0	23344584	"Wendy's place was great; just as advertised: clean, comfortable and absolutely cozy. It was the perfect spot for my wife, 4-year old daughter and myself for the Thanksgiving holiday. Having a full kitchen and fridge was great - we could just go to the Safeway a few minutes away cook 3 meals a day (we didn't do that...but we could have, and you can if you stay here!). 
When we are back in Seattle, we would absolutely stay here again.

Also, the shower is incredible. 

Also also, Full Tilt Ice Cream Parlor on 16th street: small batch ice cream and pinball - does it get any better than that combination? 

But moving on...it's very easy to navigate all over the city and a breeze to get to and from the airport (we got an Uber in less than 10 minutes when I put in the order at 5:00 AM the morning we left). 

This was our first time using AirBnB and, thanks to the wonderful space our host provided for us, we are definitely true believers now. "
76488	696004	10.0	8.0	24481814	Wendy is absolutely an awesome host. The place she offers to us is exactly like how the picture show, smells good and the lights make the house so warm and so welcome. Thank you Wendy ! 
76489	696004	10.0	8.0	24896336	"We had a terrífic stay at Wendy's place! The flat looks just like the pictures! It a is a very comfortable place equipped with everything you need! Wendy was very prompt in responding to my requests, she stocked the fridge with food for us! She also has a Keurig machine with lost of K cups for breakfast!  And yes, the SHOWER is awesome! Look no further and stay at Wendy's! 

Thank you for your hospitality Wendy! "
76490	696004	10.0	8.0	26344637	Wendy is an awesome host, she is just incredibly helpful and friendly and a very natural and human person. She makes you feel like you are at home.
76491	696004	10.0	8.0	32160786	"The apartment is very nice and very comfortable. It is located in a neat and quiet neighborhood. Everything is true to the photos posted. There's also a beautiful garden in the backyard.  Wendi, the landlord, is a super nice person and always willing to help if needed! It was a pleasure to deal with her.
[23:22:06] Inna Balutina Levien: I would stay there again."
76492	696004	10.0	8.0	32619341	Great apartment, clean well set up, easy to drive to area of west Seattle. Worked perfectly for couple, daughter, grandson with a pack n play to sleep in. Wendy was very helpful in recommendations, instruction on using induction stove. Would highly recommend Wendy and her great apartment. 
76493	696004	10.0	8.0	32912383	"As soon as I walked through the doors I felt that ""at home"" vibe and Wendy has the personality to match. She is wonderfully kind and very informative from sights, to districts to even restaurants.  

The kitchen is perfectly sized if you want to do any of your own cooking. The bathroom is an amazing amenity. And the living room is very cozy.

I highly recommend to stay with Wendy for your next trip to Seattle!"
76494	696004	10.0	8.0	34037665	Wendy was a great host. We enjoyed staying at her cosy place that offered all  the amenities and is located just a 15 minutes car ride from downtown Seattle.
76495	696004	10.0	8.0	34255913	"This was a nice space, however it is in WEST Seattle. This threw a major kink in our plans, so if you're not local - it's not close to downtown.

Other than location, it's a nice space, albeit a little noisy since it's a downstairs apartment."
76496	696004	10.0	8.0	34468987	The apartment matched the listing very well from the beautiful wood floors to the great water pressure from the shower. We felt very much at home immediately once we walked into Wendy's apartment. Everything is nicely done in the apartment and very thoughtful in terms of providing what is needed. The unit is super clean with a nice kitchen fitting the four of us comfortably. 
76497	696004	10.0	8.0	34752580	Nice suburban neighborhood with great access to the airport and downtown.  Great little apartment with lots of coffee and everything else to make you feel comfortable.  Highly recommended
76498	696004	10.0	8.0	34961968	Wendy was a great host and the directions made it easy to find. We enjoyed out stay very much!
76499	696004	10.0	8.0	35327676	The apartment was clean and nice.  The shower was awesome.  The bed in the bedroom was very uncomfortable.  We were disappointed with the living room furniture and T.V.  No cable was a bummer.  After a day of touring the city, it would have been nice to relax and watch television on comfortable furniture.
76500	696004	10.0	8.0	35795769	"Wendy was a fabulous host.  Her accommodations were just what we needed for the four of us (all adults). It is very convenient to downtown Seattle and the SeaTac airport. We had a car,  so not 100% sure on the public transit,  but I am sure Wendy can help with that.  The apartment had a full kitchen and bathroom. We were able to cook some meals at ""home"" and save some money.  We would definitely stay here again,  we felt right at home."
76501	696004	10.0	8.0	36201966	This is a great location, close to lots of great dining sand parks. The apartment is comfortable with great kitchen and bathroom amenities. Wendy is a great host with tons of info that she is happy to share! Thanks Wendy!
76502	696004	10.0	8.0	36403096	Our stay at Wendy's was amazing. Her home was cozy and very welcoming. Her house is close to the freeway and just 15-20 minutes from downtown Seattle. We enjoyed the wonderful amenities she provided us and I would definitely stay there again. 
76503	696004	10.0	8.0	36878696	Wendy welcomed us and showed us around the apt.  She answered our questions about the area and about things to do.  The bed was comfortable and the walk-in shower was very nice.  Wonderful apartment!
76504	696004	10.0	8.0	37146454	Wendy and her place were AMAZING! It's definitely wheelchair accessible and friendly. We had 2 chairs in there and were able to maneuver perfectly. Wendy was super attentive, and got us everything we needed and then some. I would definitely stay again!
76505	696004	10.0	8.0	37488755	Wendy was a wonderful host! She was welcoming, knowledgable and accommodating. The apartment was lovely and clean. 
76506	696004	10.0	8.0	38191477	Well-appointed basement apartment. Very comfortable and very well designed. Wendy was a delight.
76507	696004	10.0	8.0	38607197	"Wendy was extremely welcoming, she provided an easy to use keyed that was super convenient to use during our stay. She came and introduced herself and asked us if we needed any help with any of the equipment in the apartment and let us know she was available if we had any questions. 

Her guidebook is amazing and thorough! She has a ton of info in it (i.e. places to eat, things to do, manuals for equipment in the apt). She was very inviting and offered up any food that was in the kitchen to us. We were also able to pick blackberries from her front yard, which the kids enjoyed.

The neighborhood isn't the fanciest area but it was safe and affordable and located close to freeways. 

The bed in the bedroom was comfortable and her place is setup so nicely for a rental. The apartment is beautiful and my husband enjoyed the ramp outside so he he didn't have to lug the luggage up and down any stairs. You could hear people walking upstairs at times but it wasn't too loud and didn't wake us up or anything. "
76508	696004	10.0	8.0	38877514	We arrived late and wendy was so kind that she was awake and ready to assist where necessary. We had a pleasant stay and the house is comfy. Its a bit out of town but, with a car, it was fine for us. Defenitely recommended.
76509	696004	10.0	8.0	39321391	Wendy's apartment is comfortable, quiet, and clean.  Its convenient to the city if you have a car or want to jump on a bus.  Wendy is friendly and welcoming.  This beats the high cost hotels in Seattle. 
76510	696004	10.0	8.0	40106753	Although we didn't meet Wendy in person, she made us feel very welcome by sending thoughtful text messages, including offering to change the schedule of her contractors so we could have a quiet experience.  We arrived a bit early and her housesitter and cleaners were accommodating in letting us in early, which was great as we have two small children.  The apartment was exactly what we were looking for: quiet, nice kitchen, easily accessible and convenient location.  A perfect stay for us.  Thank you, Wendy.
76511	696004	10.0	8.0	40463274	Enjoyed our stay. Apartment was spacious and comfortable. Great place to come to at the end of the day. Having a kitchen allowed us to have a sensible breakfast each morning before heading out for the day.  Wendy was easy to work with before arriving. We had no issues finding the apartment or a grocery store nearby.  Really enjoyed being out of the city a little. It was not difficult to get anywhere we needed. It's a great area to explore - White Center, Alki, Burien. 
76512	696004	10.0	8.0	40767255	"Wendy was out of town the day we arrived, but there was someone there to greet us and show us the ropes.  The apartment is so cozy and was perfect for the three of us.  We were attending an event in West Seattle so this was extremely convenient.   
There are plenty of thoughtful details in the apartment and it felt more like a home than a sterile hotel or other accommodations.  We had off-street parking which was comforting in an unfamiliar neighborhood. 
Wendy returned home from her trip on the second day of our stay and came down to check in when we arrived 'home,' and make sure we had everything we needed.   She was responsive before our arrival and explained everything very accurately so we had no issues getting settled in. 
Overall this was a great stay that suited our needs perfectly.  We felt welcome and found everything we needed in this home.  Thank you Wendy!"
76513	696004	10.0	8.0	41734795	Experience was great. The apartment was well setup and there was food available for cooking. The host did a quick intro of the place which was helpful. 
76514	696004	10.0	8.0	42296076	Wendy was great, she greeted us when we arrived, showed us around the place, gave us some tips for traveling through Seattle and had some food and drinks waiting for us and our family. The place was nice with a great bathroom and great kitchen amenities (e.g. induction stove top). 
76515	696004	10.0	8.0	42765984	"The place is quiet, clean, and comfortable. It is on the floor level but not underground, and the house is in a garden, so it is light. 
We staid there with our 2 young children, the apartment is big enough, and the sofa was comfortable to sleep on. The apartment is planned to be wheelchair accessible, we do not have a wheelchair but it means that there is enough space in every room and it is practical with young children. The open kitchen is well equipped. You can use the laundry washer and dryer.
The area is calm, individual houses with gardens. This location is great if you want to rest after a day in the (very busy and noisy) city center, less so if you want to go out at night then walk back home. 
You can park your car besides the house. We reached Seattle center by direct bus in slightly more than a half hour (planning our departure hour with google maps), and by car a little faster. 
Wendy was very friendly and helpful at all times. 
I would definitely advise to my friends and family to stay there. Highly recommended."
76516	696004	10.0	8.0	43232094	Our staying was so nice. I was there with my wife and my son of 8. Wendy received us with a warm hello. She is very kind. The house is as shows in the photo, even better. Wendy told us a lot of information and her book of guest (where she inserts every information about house and Seattle) is unbeatable. Never see in my trips. We never forget her and the house. 
76517	696004	10.0	8.0	44777941	Wendy home was so comfortable for my family and I while we were in Seattle . The place was stock with towels and extra food she had offered us to use if we liked . Place was quite and very clean with a cozy vibe . She lots of reading material and always offered suggestion if we needed . Our beds were super comfy and clean with everything we could need ( ironing boards and night lights . She had breakfast options and tons of hot drinks for breakfast . 
76518	696004	10.0	8.0	46325799	This place was nice and cozy with easy access to downtown Seattle. There was a lot of fun stuff available in the neighborhood as well, although parts of it were rougher than we expected. Overall a great experience though. 
76641	6133684	9.0	8.0	32417416	"Janice was very easy to communicate with and very helpful with all of our needs. The space is very clean and big, more than enough for my boyfriend and I and all of our bags, and very private and cozy. There is parking and easy access all over the city!

Great experience!"
76642	6133684	9.0	8.0	37468402	The apartment was exactly as described, and was very comfortable. The location is quite convenient; next to two bus stops and fairly close to a shopping plaza. Janice was very welcoming and helpful, and let us bring our two cats with us, which was great. I would definitely recommend this apartment/host.
76643	6133684	9.0	8.0	48460397	The apartment was very comfortable, incredibly quite, and private.  It was very convenient for our West Seattle activities.  Janice had no problem accommodating our extremely late arrival.  Janice let us use the fireplace and she even let us run a load of laundry.  Amazingly we never crossed paths.  We look forward to staying with Janice again on one of our future trips to West Seattle.    
76644	6133684	9.0	8.0	48852129	"I stayed at Janice's place for one night. Great place to stay for a couple nights. She was quick to respond to my last-minute booking request and was generally quick to respond which I really appreciated. There's a pizza place, bakery and other shops about a fifteen minute walk away, but otherwise it's mostly houses. So, a quite neighborhood. It is a basement apartment, so you can hear people walking around and talking upstairs but I never found it overly loud during my stay. Downtown isn't too far a commute by bus. 

The apartment was spacious and nicely decorated... exactly how it looks in the pictures. It was a very private room with its own room key and an exterior key to a side entrance, so I didn't have to exit and enter through the house's front door. Some nice touches I didn't expect were the boardgames in the shelf and a basket full of all sorts of bathroom things like floss, q-tips, shampoo, conditioner and much more which was nice. Janice, herself, was friendly and seemed like an interesting person to talk to if I had more time.

76645	6133684	9.0	8.0	51357452	Janice was great and very welcoming. We were able to get into the room as soon as we got there and found everything really neat and clean. There was a much-needed coffee maker, a microwave, and a small fridge with a freezer unit. The bathroom was very well equipped and had a giant mirror. There is a door with a lock on it for people who want privacy and the room is heated and had two thermostats for heating different parts of the room. There is a great bed and a really comfortable couch if you are with a partner who is bothered by your snoring. The room also has plenty of outlets for those who enjoy their electronics.
76656	2508065	10.0	8.0	13615172	Fritz and Jody have a very nice home.  It is artistic and stylish.  They were very welcoming and communicated promptly.  They live in a quiet neighborhood that was perfect for our stay in Seattle.
76657	2508065	10.0	8.0	13681990	"This was an excellent place to stay.  We found the house to be in a neat and clean condition, and it's in a lovely quiet neighborhood.  Fritz and Jody were easy to communicate with, and they were friendly and helpful.  They clearly wanted us to have a pleasant experience, which we did.  This is a ""best of"" listing."
76658	2508065	10.0	8.0	15673163	"We loved our stay in this warm home in an older neighbourhood.  Jody and Fritz have decorated the house in a very warm and artistic manner which we enjoyed immensely.  The bouquet of sunflowers on the grand piano was the final touch.  The kitchen was very well equipped with high end cookware and all the kitchen 'tools' needed for creating meals.  

Jody and Fritz were very welcoming; checking with us to ensure we had arrived, that we had no questions or needs and that we were enjoying our stay in their home. They had a printed booklet of suggested restaurants, bars, places of interest, etc along with maps and their comments about each place.  Several newspapers and magazines about the Seattle area and current happenings were on the coffee table. 

We would definitely stay here on return visits to Seattle.

76659	2508065	10.0	8.0	16822679	"Fritz and Jody have a clean house, located in a nice and quiet  neighbourhood. The car can always be  parked at the backside of the house. It is a private spot, belonging to their house. 

For planning trips or eating out in Seattle they compiled a nice little list of information. Some of the things we did as advised by them worked out perfect.  Especially the ice cream parlour nearby, TILT, is great.  
About 500 yards from the house there are several small shops where you can buy basic groceries. For bigger stores, count on a ride of a few more minutes. 

Jody and Fritz were available for advice just on the first day of our visit. The other days they made a trip themselves, but it's no problem to get around in their house on your own. Fritz stopped by for a couple of minutes the second day, to get some things for their trip. During those minutes he had good advice for the day trip we planned to Fremont, a nice neighbourhood in the northern part of Seattle.

We all had a great time the days we spent here!

76660	2508065	10.0	8.0	18883771	Jody & Fritz were great at making us feel welcome by providing us with great recommendations specific to our trip and around their neighborhood. Our group enjoyed our stay at their clean and comfortable home. My favorite part of their house was admiring how well they have utilized their space for storage and seating, while not compromising on design. The location also made it easy to get to anywhere we needed to go over the weekend. Thank you both for letting us stay here!
79573	8799588	10.0	8.0	54553722	This is a nice place! The neighborhood is really unique, with lots of trees and neat alleyways. The house it very quiet at night, the room is relaxing, nicely decorated, extremely clean, and it is super convenient having the second full bathroom, considering only two people live in the house permanently (I think). Your hosts are very nice also. There are bus routes in every direction. I will definitely be staying here again.
