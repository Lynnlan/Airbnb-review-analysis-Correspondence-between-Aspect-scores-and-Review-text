4136	4550099	7.0	9.0	23350930	"Mike and Laura really made our Thanksgiving special as they opened up their home to our family on such short notice over a holiday that could've been a disaster. Their kitchen is wonderful and spacious enough to prepare dinner for 10 or more.  
       They are very gracious and easy to work with I highly recommend their place as it is located in a perfect spot to explore Seattle without even having a car. The view on the deck upstairs is breathtaking.  Located near the bus line as well.
        Highly recommend."
4137	4550099	7.0	9.0	24481439	Mike and Laura were incredibly gracious hosts, having a welcome gift and kind note waiting for us upon our arrival. Their home was very well kept, spacious, and aligned perfectly with their description. It was within walking distance to the great amenities that Ballard has to offer.  Mike and Laura made themselves available via phone/text for any issues we may have had (which we didn't!), but were otherwise respectful of the time our family had together. Their space afforded my family a wonderful holiday experience. Highly recommended. 
4138	4550099	7.0	9.0	33251679	We really enjoyed our stay at Mike and Laura's home. Well-stocked kitchen and comfortable rooms. Ballard is a great location for visiting many areas of Seattle, especially while visiting SPU. 
4176	2769088	6.0	9.0	13382470	"The apartment offers a view of Seattle as a resident and local. It doesn't offer luxury but that's not always what someone is seeking. We found the location to be a little too far from downtown but Wendy gave us all the details we needed to get around so that made things easier. The area is nice and the next door coffee is amazing. You can drive to Ballard easily and the airport isn't a bad drive in the morning before traffic. You're not far from city necessities and Wendy offers advice as you need it. 

There is a big dog that will sometimes hang out in the yard but it's very friendly and sweet. "
4177	2769088	6.0	9.0	14530340	Nice place. A little too expensive. Bathroom was dirty and seemed like the bed sheets were slept in. Great patio view though. The location was perfect for going to pike market.
4178	2769088	6.0	9.0	14638211	We had a lovely stay at Wendy's place. This is a quirky attic apartment with a lot of personality.  It's a cozy, affordable option, clean enough, in a fantastic neighborhood. This listing is what Airbnb is all about. Would definitely stay there again!
4179	2769088	6.0	9.0	16474576	"Needed to find an affordable place to stay in Seattle for a kickball tournament.  This place worked out great for my husband and I and two of our teammates. Communication with Wendy was easy and prompt. Beautiful view of the Olympics!! We all really liked the funky decor and even posed with the manikins for some photos.  Beds were comfortable.  You get what you see in the pics. We thought the location was perfect for us and was  in close proximity to Green Lake park where our games were. We also took some of Wendy's recommendations and checked out some local spots that were in walking distance.  The only cons: Floors looked like they needed a good vacuuming but everything else was pretty clean.  I would have even done it myself but didn't see a vacuum. It was a hot weekend in Seattle so a fan would have been nice, especially for my husband that sleeps super hot. (We normally bring a small fan for him but forgot to bring ours) But we made due and it is was
still not a deal breaker for me. "

4181	2769088	6.0	9.0	18311652	Listing description was accurate. Pictures need to be updated as I think the bathroom was remodeled and no motorized couch :(
4182	2769088	6.0	9.0	18735704	"Wendy was out of town when we arrived, but did provide us with an alternate contact during our stay. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the cleanliness level of the house. The pictures online didn't match the reality. While there were lots of differences, the main ones that caused us to leave were that there were no towels available, the beds weren't made (and looked slept in!), and there was dirt and debris on the floor. We ended up leaving and getting a hotel elsewhere. The next morning when we returned to take pictures (to submit to Airbnb), there were towels left (on the dirty floor!) for us. 
We are currently working with airbnb and wendy to get a refund on our reservation and are hopeful that we can reach a reasonable and fair resolution. "
4183	2769088	6.0	9.0	18880644	"Wendy made the experience super easy. She was on point, communicative, and even though she was out of town during our stay we had no problem navigating the space, access, or house rules.  

The neighborhood, btw, is incredible.  Best coffee shop ever next door and a really cool restaurant/ bar on the same block.  Really no problems getting into town - it helps to get to know the bus schedule.  

All in all a great stay - the place is certainly quaint but turned out to be an ideal spot to explore the city like a local. "
4184	2769088	6.0	9.0	33119259	Nice neighborhood. Everything was accurate according to description. Balcony is a big plus!!

4187	2769088	6.0	9.0	42211505	Thank you, Wendy, for sharing your lovely home. Every aspect of our stay was exactly as we'd hoped.
5258	3052151	7.0	9.0	13636607	Rad stay. Wendy is cool, place is great, no complaints. 
5259	3052151	7.0	9.0	14406428	Wendy was so great! Her place is neat, tidy and cozy and is located in a cool area with lots of fun things close by. She was incredibly welcoming and accommodating and full of good advice for activities and places to explore. I highly recommend staying with Wendy. She truly did everything possible to help make my trip easy, convenient and fun. 
5260	3052151	7.0	9.0	14991818	Staying with Wendy Morrison was a very pleasant experience. She was very accommodating and went out of her way to give us advice for our stay in Seattle. The room was on the small side but more than enough. Cute kitchen, even though we didn't have time to use it. The apartment was under renovation but Wendy was kind enough to subsidize our bill in compensation. Great location and great stay!
5261	3052151	7.0	9.0	16120504	Everything was as expected. The location of the house is very good to get fast to the city centre.
5262	3052151	7.0	9.0	16279466	Nice quiet and green suburban neighborhood, but still close to good restaurants and parks. Relaxed, friendly place to stay.
5263	3052151	7.0	9.0	16748824	Nice stay in Ballard at Wendy's place! She was very accommodating with our flight schedules and gave us great tips for finding an apartment in Ballard. The patio is really cute and it's a great location :)
5264	3052151	7.0	9.0	16921006	Place was very nice & cute and in an amazing location. Slate coffee a real bonus! Wendy was pleasant and communicative although we only saw her briefly a few times.
5265	3052151	7.0	9.0	17225565	Nice neighborhood and host.
5266	3052151	7.0	9.0	17542528	Wendy was a great host. Cool location with easy bus access. She also had great recommendations!
5267	3052151	7.0	9.0	17709434	Cute neighborhood. Accurate photos and description of the apartment. Wendy was welcoming and friendly, but did her own thing which was exactly what I was looking for.
5268	3052151	7.0	9.0	26319151	We never met Wendy, as she was out of town for our stay. The neighborhood was nice and within walking distance of Ballard. The only downside was that we were asked to bring our own towels which was fairly inconvenient. 
5269	3052151	7.0	9.0	32031461	Great location and walking distance to many local bars and good food! 
5270	3052151	7.0	9.0	32643155	Great host! Wendy was super sweet and not imposing whatsoever.  Neighborhood was super central and the deck was so great!  My bf and I were very comfortable.  Thanks Wendy!

5272	3052151	7.0	9.0	35852824	I didn't get to meet Wendy, but her roommate Kerri was there, and she was awesome! The place was overall very cute and they have a really really nice shower. It's next door to slate coffee, which is one of my favorite places in seattle. 10/10!
5273	3052151	7.0	9.0	37424379	Wendy's place was great! The location was perfect, very easy to explore around the great neighborhood of ballard and easy access to downtown and other parts of seattle. She gave us our privacy and was always there to answer our questions! 
5274	3052151	7.0	9.0	38002462	Wendy was helpful with directions before our arrival. Bed was comfortable, however room was not very clean and the door didn't shut properly.

8681	3424242	7.0	10.0	16124907	This is a great place. The people were friendly and the house manager Matthew was pleasant and accommodating. He took initiative to move me into a room that happened to be empty that weekend instead of leaving me in the shared room, so I had a little more space  during my stay. The house itself is nice, comfortable, and clean, with awesome views of the water. It's in a nice neighborhood with some trendy bars and shops within walking distance. On Sundays there is also a street market on Freemont. Overall, a great stay!
8682	3424242	7.0	10.0	17112032	I stayed at the Cor36 hacker house for two weeks. The house has a very fast Internet connection and the only problem I had was figuring out the bus routes. The house captain (Aaron) was very helpful.
8683	3424242	7.0	10.0	18911036	"This hacker's retreat was a joyful welcome to Seattle for the PAXPrime conference.  Its like a youth hostile, but less backpacks ;-). However, it is the simple and clean accommodations that make traveling economically nice. Its over looking the ""Gasworks"" park and the bay, backed by the skyline of Seattle, which makes the views spectacular from the dining room table and big porches.  The host was engaging and enjoyable.  As an older hippie, I like the simplicity, but very different than staying in the homes of other AirBnB hosts.  The rooms are high-capcity dorms with two bunks (four people) per room and I worry if its at peak capacity.  No lock boxes, but there is street parking and you can use your car trunk for your lock box.  Thanks for a very successful stay and enjoyed walks in the park and breakfast at the Essential Bakery up the street. There is a cool old Varsity Dinner also.  Thanks, Chris"
8684	3424242	7.0	10.0	28238743	Love this house!  The location is magnificent, the house is awesome, and the people are great!  This trip was even better than the last--I had forgotten how comfortable the beds are.  Also of note, one of the 25 best new restaurants in America happens to be across the street.  No big deal. . .
8685	3424242	7.0	10.0	36383372	"Stayed at cor36@LkUnion for 4 weeks. Overall, great location for a short-term stay near the UW district, at reasonable rates. 
People were friendly and the house captain Paul very helpful and accommodating. The house has room for up to about 15 people, so at peak capacity in summer it can get somewhat crowded at times."
8686	3424242	7.0	10.0	43451863	I met some very interesting people here. I hope to come back here for an extended stay in the future.
8687	3424242	7.0	10.0	45114697	Stay here if you are looking for the chance to meet really smart engineers/entrepreneurs in Seattle. The location is really perfect for Seattle. Great views of the city from the upper levels. Buses nearby to get you downtown. Bikes on the lower level are free to use .. which is really perfect given the waterfront trail in front of the house which acts as a major artery between U of W and business campuses such as Google. During the day the house is very quiet.. most will be at work. At night you can socialize with other hackers or listen to one of the talks.  A lot of the guests are fairly long term (several months) so you can also get great advice on the city. The 4 person room lifestyle is not for everyone. Indeed, the house is in need of a few repairs which I believe are soon to be made.  But I wouldn't say that any of this made me uncomfortable. I really recommend this place for anyone working in tech new to the Seattle area.
8688	7985714	6.0	10.0	48212690	This is a house of very intelligent men.  The conversations are very heady and I appreciate it for that reason.
9572	5126365	7.0	9.0	27566108	Claire and Michael's house was wonderful and especially convenient if you have business at WSU. They were great, accommodating hosts. We had just driven for over 3 hours, so we didn't have much energy to hang out, but I can't imagine that they would be anything less than awesome people to talk to. Their dog was curious and friendly and well controlled. Claire made sure that we were OK with dogs before confirming our reservation; a great display of empathy. The bed was on the firm firmer side. Overall, A+ experience and would definitely stay here again.
9573	5126365	7.0	9.0	28550464	Claire and Michael were wonderful hosts who went out of their way to accommodate my needs!  They made me feel welcome and took the time to ensure my stay was enjoyable.  Their home, room and neighborhood were as advertised and I certainly recommend them for any travelers looking to plug into all things Seattle.
9574	5126365	7.0	9.0	29784122	"Both Claire and Michael are very friendly, and their dog Franklin was sweet.
     The house is beautiful in a convenient location only a block from my son’s home in the Wallingford neighborhood. The area is wonderful, lots of shops, restaurants and parks, and a great place to go on walks.  The bedroom was spacious, and the bed was very nice and comfortable, with a firm mattress. Because I was spending my waking time with my family, I was only sleeping and showering there, so I wanted a clean and quiet place to spend three nights. 
     There did turn out to be a few problems. The first was when I arrived at the agreed upon time (8:00 – 8:30pm) the first evening.  Nobody answered the doorbell or phone, so I left after waiting 40 minutes, returned later that night a second time with still no answer at the door, and finally ended up on my son’s couch the because it was late and I was tired.  The next night, Claire apologized sincerely and I was able to stay for two nights instead of three.
     The other two issues were the cleanliness and noise levels.  I’ve hostelled quite a bit, so I am used to sharing bathrooms, but I thought the bathroom was not acceptably clean.  In addition, there were times during the night and early mornings when it was very noisy in the house. I think the noise was due in part to someone arriving home late at night, and getting up early in the morning and just not being quiet. And some was attributable to Franklin running around and getting into things like the garbage in the metal step-can in the bathroom adjacent to my room (very loud), and jumping into piles of packing paper and other things lying on the floor in a room across from me in the early morning. After two nights of too little sleep, I left there very tired because of the noise both late each night and early each morning.
"
10088	3889050	6.0	9.0	18845093	"I had a very pleasant stay at Andrew's place (c/o Aaron/Math&Co) ... The Hostel-like setting offers a very relaxed and creative atmosphere. One that you can only get from a slowly but constantly fluctuating flat-share allowing for short spikes of 4-night-visitors like me.
Fremont being a very nice neighborhood is situated in walking distance to UW which came in very handy for me as I had to visit a lab over there. That I happened to visit at the weekend of Bumbershoot was good luck with Bootsy Collins rocking the stage! Make sure to visit the Troll under Fremont Bridge and the Fremont Sunday Market is a good place to grab a little snack and take a stroll... What I appreciated a lot was the possibility to use a bike to get around - this came in really handy.
Somehow I really hope to see some of the people again - same place, other place - I would go for it again!"
10089	3889050	6.0	9.0	45179652	This is a great house. The atmosphere is welcoming and fun, while also professional. The place is clean and amenities are accessible. Everyone is very friendly, and Paul was a great house captain. He really helped me out by letting me extend for a night when my other plans fell through. Connecting with the other housemates was also valuable.
10090	3889050	6.0	9.0	46514608	"I'll start with the good: the atmosphere was really nice. People were friendly and welcoming, and there was a genuine feeling of community amongst the residents.

Now for the bad:

First of all I must state that it seems I stayed at the place when lots of renovation was happening. I'm hoping this is not the norm, so your mileage may vary...
I was in a 2 person room on the bottom floor. The shower was being renovated (thus non-existing), so the closest shower was one floor up, shared by the residents of both floors. The renovations were not stated in the listing.
My room was adjacent to the work, thus it was impossible to sleep in, since noisy construction started early in the morning. The construction noise also meant that most people preferred to leave the house in order to get some work done. In the room there was an exposed water pipe, and very loud dripping noise started every time that pipe was used. The room had no ""luxuries"" like a hook to hang my wet towel on.

During my stay the entire house lost water for two days. Walking 20 minutes in the morning (to my workplace) just to brush my teeth and take a shower was not a pleasant experience. I can see how this sort of thing can happen, and the host was very gracious about it, trying to find solutions for the residents. Normally I would not comment about such an unforeseen event, but along with the rest of the renovation, this was a bit too much. We were promised a refund for the 2 days, I'm still waiting for mine.

I can see how this place can be great if no renovation is taking place. I think the host should have either shut-down during the renovation, or at least make it explicit in the listing.

Giving it 3 starts, as an average between my 1 star experience and the 5 starts it could have been.

When I left, they just started tearing apart the upstairs kitchen..."
10192	3732094	7.0	9.0	17653993	It was very inspiring and creative atmosphere. All the guests are briliant innovators and very friendly. It also has beautiful view toward union lake, so very relaxing. I had really great time.
10193	3732094	7.0	9.0	18144100	Had a fantastic time at this house, people were super friendly, and social, very clean, and lots of space. Beautiful view of Lake Union, and within easy walking distance to buses to get anywhere. Aaron was a great host! Would definitely recommend for anyone needing temp accommodation :) 
10194	3732094	7.0	9.0	20990764	"It's a beautiful home, with beautiful people, in a beautiful location. 

Plus, Aaron, the house captain, was really great."
10195	3732094	7.0	9.0	42659229	"Pros: location, people, collaborative environment

Cons (Note: all of these things were in line to be fixed but I didn't see them fixed before I left so I felt it deceitful to leave them out of a review) : laundry machine is semi-functional, stoves have some broken burners. Kitchens are missing decent knives and some cookware.

Considerations: this is a collaborative space so do not expect quiet. If you cannot sleep with some noise this is not the place for you."
10196	3732094	7.0	9.0	48885466	Loved the residents, house captain, as well as the proprietor. Great environment of mutual respect and friendship. 
11001	3888924	7.0	9.0	30980531	Great experience. The cor36 is just as advertised, great young tech talent sharing a big, beautiful house. 
11002	3888924	7.0	9.0	41578653	"It was my first time in the US, and I had a lot of fun staying at cor36. The place is decently close to a bus stop, which helps a lot. The supermarket was about 12 blocks away, but in the long run it didn't matter much. The neighborhood seems pretty safe, and is close to Fremont and University District. The Burke Gilman trail is right in front of the house, so you can go on a long bike ride or a decent run around the Lake Union, or you could go kayaking there.
This place is a hacker house, which meant staying with a lot of like minded people. Being from tech background, I had lots of fun interacting with some business people. The house caption happens to be an MIT and UW grad, and is a very smart guy. We'd have weekly talks by all the amazing people we had on stay at cor36, or the sister IO House.
One downside was bunk beds which the portfolio didn't specify. Also there's one washroom on 6 people, so that might be bothersome. For me it all worked out quite comfortably. I was getting an amazing experience hanging out with such cool people, and I'd recommend the place to anybody looking for a stay in the summers."
11003	3888924	7.0	9.0	55712165	I stayed here for about 3 months while I was on an internship.  It was very good housing for a short term stay.  The place was very quiet while I was there so I had no problems being able to sleep.  The people there are very friendly and most of them are employed so everyone is very professional.  If you are a tech inclined person I highly recommend staying here.  It's good for networking and was a great community to be a part of.  If I were to come back to Seattle, I'm sure I would stay here longer.
13780	1145590	7.0	9.0	5117777	Pam was a terrific hostess.  We had some overlapping dates, and she was extremely unobtrusive in her own home! The place is perfectly situated which makes it very easy to get around Seattle, and some neighborhoods are in walking distance (Queen Anne, Fremont, SLU)-though you must like hills! The place has everything one needs with w/d in unit, full kitchen with dishwasher and the like, and parking.  And the best thing is the deck-which is truly expansive and a lovely place to spend some time in the sun.  Pam was also gracious, when I needed to extend my dates by 2 days, in allowing me to re-up.  And, as mentioned before, she is a fantastic cook.  So while our schedules overlapped for those few days, I was able to enjoy both breakfast and tapas.  Overall, a really wonderful experience.
13781	1145590	7.0	9.0	5245146	Great host and a great place! Balcony was out of this world. Quite calm but easy to get everywhere with busses. The Italian place one street down is really nice. 
13782	1145590	7.0	9.0	5316177	"Pam was a very accommodating host. She was very helpful and her place was left in great condition for our arrival. She had left us a lovely note with instructions and books on Seattle to make our trip as easy as possible. Her house is in a great spot and a walkable distance from downtown. We walked into downtown everyday along the lake which was beautiful and after a busy day we enjoyed wine on her amazing patio.

I would recommend this apartment to all of my friends and family and would certainly stay again.
Kate "
13783	1145590	7.0	9.0	5679498	"We visited Seattle with our 5-year-old daughter.  We all loved the deck and having the privacy of our own bedroom was great.  If you've been to Seattle before, or wish to explore beyond Pikes Place Market, this is a perfect.  You are within a 20 minute walk of just about everything with some effort (not a flat surface for more than 2 blocks in Seattle).  

The only downside I can think of is that I was terribly worried about the floors at all time.  They are very soft dark wood and very easily scratched.  NO SHOES ALLOWED.  

Pam was very accommodating and my daughter already calls it her Seattle home.
"
13784	1145590	7.0	9.0	16244242	"This apartment does indeed have an amazingly large patio, and enough space to technically sleep 6 people. Our party of 5 stayed here feeling a tad cramped though, as the 5th person's ""bedroom"" was basically the livingroom.

A few days before our arrival, I asked for check-in instructions, and Pam politely informed us that she would be out of town, and that friends would be taking care of us instead.  I was also told that the apartment did not have enough towels for 5 people, meaning that there were no extras at all.

While the apartment was *well-furnished*, it was not *well-appointed*. Various essentials were missing, including toilet paper, and like the towels, there weren't any extras of anything to go around, but it was just enough for a 7-day stay.

It is also a rather noisy location, as sea planes are constantly taking off and landing throughout the day, so we rarely made use of that large and fantastic patio."
13785	1145590	7.0	9.0	17194347	The reservation was canceled 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13786	1145590	7.0	9.0	17557269	"The apartment has a lot of potential, with a huge deck and view of south lake union, 2 bedrooms each with their own bathroom, and off street parking. Other than the tv which we couldn't get working the place was as advertised.

Pam was nice over the phone and very responsive to our  inquiries.

"
13787	1145590	7.0	9.0	18892601	We had a great stay at Pam's place. She met us there to show us the ropes, left a bottle of wine, and then left us to make ourselves at home. The neighborhood is central to everything, has several good eating/coffee/bar options, and is very accessible by public transport/car/bike. (However, if you are looking to stay in a quaint Seattle neighborhood, this is probably not it.) The apartment was clean, comfortable, quiet. The best part - the decks are huge with great views!
14694	6864319	6.0	8.0	44240923	Kevin was an excellent host, both flexible and full of neighborhood recommendations.
15463	639130	7.0	10.0	40090287	This was our first time using airbnb.  The house was the perfect size for our group.  Close to all downtown has to offer.  The owners do have 2 cats that need to be fed twice a day.  Taz and Reece.  Taz is a bit hyper and I would worry if there were small children staying.  He was laying on me and when I slowly went to move him off he bit my cheek.  Just left a red mark but could have been worse.    There were no blinds/shades in the hall bathroom.  We could see people in a house when we were in the bathroom.  If you can see them odds are they can see you in the bathroom.   We got to the house later than we originally had planned.  I felt like they pretty much handed the the keys over and were out the door.  I would have liked a little more info on the house and the cats.  Like I said this was our first time renting so maybe this is all normal. 
15464	639130	7.0	10.0	45919783	"In Seattle we found a delightful host, home and neighborhood.
Ann was prompt to reply to emails and personable upon arrival. She helped welcome us and got us oriented to both home and neighborhood.
The 4-bedroom home is spacious, well lighted and featuring comfortable beds. It isn’t a full-time rental. It’s Ann’s home, but she arranged things so that we could stay there very nicely for four nights. She even found a place for her two cats to stay since some in our party don’t do particularly well with pets. That was much appreciated.
The established Madrona neighborhood is a great one to explore. We took sets of public stairs down past hillside homes and streets until we entered a short trail that led to the shores of expansive Lake Washington. We ate breakfast, along with many locals, at the yummy Hi Spot Café, an easy walk from the house. And we enjoyed being about 15 minutes away from Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.
I highly recommend this home.

16249	8594059	7.0	9.0	55410419	"Everything was neat and tidy.

It was a very nice and comfortable stay.

The heating worked just great and the beds were very comfortable.

We really enjoyed the hosts recommended café.

We would stay again.
"
16250	8594059	7.0	9.0	58245369	Great place if you want to be close to the U district. The place had everything we needed for our short stay. Owner was quick to respond to any questions. The house was exactly as the pictures. There were 5 of us and it was comfortable.
16324	6250399	6.0	4.0	44034411	The apartment itself was totally fine - about what we expected, based on the photos and description. The space was a great size for 2 people and it was nice to have the kitchenette as an option while visiting Seattle. Melissa was a very easy host to work with - she allowed us to check in early and was very responsive when we had questions throughout our stay. The one major issue with the apartment that we were not expecting was just outside - when we walked in on the first day, we peeked out the kitchen window into an alley (fine) that was apparently a hot spot for drug use (not fine). Throughout our entire stay, every time we looked out the window people were in the alley partaking in some very hardcore using. It was very unsettling to know that was so close to us and while no one ever bothered us in the neighborhood, it was a major concern. Again, the apartment itself was great and exactly what we were looking for, but my fiance and I agreed the alley view was something that needed to be mentioned.
16433	6623079	7.0	9.0	37724101	Sofwa was very friendly.
16434	6623079	7.0	9.0	37917663	Location was perfect for what I needed, a place to stay close to the university. Amenities were very basic but it comes with the price. However, arrival time could have been coordinated better as I had to wait for Sofwa for half an hour to let me in, and it was very late at night. I would have also appreciated if they kept the noise down in the  living room evening.
16435	6623079	7.0	9.0	38082536	It was good.
16436	6623079	7.0	9.0	38342530	Sofwa was very welcoming. She is a great communicator both in advance and during my stay. The room was very tidy and the bed comfortable. The location was great for me, right around the corner from the University of Washington specialty medical center.
16437	6623079	7.0	9.0	38765620	My friend and I came up to Seattle for a concert and just to visit for the first time. Sofwa was a great host and very welcoming!  She gave great directions and her apartment is near several bus stops so we never had to wait more than 10 minutes for  a bus.  The area is near campus so there was lots of options and it was also only a 15 minute walk to Gas Works park which we went to several times.  The beds were super comfortable and she even had a fan in case it was warm for us.  The bathroom was shared so we just had to communicate about schedules. Whenever she had company over, they were all very friendly and helpful as well.  She was very accommodating with our travel schedule and we had a great, hassle free time!
16438	6623079	7.0	9.0	39668463	Sofwa was quite welcoming and helpful--she was accommodating to our late flight arrival and gave us advice on bus transportation and street parking.  The space was clean and the room/beds were comfortable.  Neighborhood was in the university area and felt pretty safe. I'd stay with Sofwa again.
16439	6623079	7.0	9.0	39814884	Fantastic hostess! Me and my two friends stayed with her for a night and she was very gracious and flexible. She gave us tips about local places to visit and made us feel comfortable and safe. Would definitely reccomend!!
16440	6623079	7.0	9.0	40251685	"Sofwa was great. 
This is very simple bedroom, which is all I needed. She was very gracious. I had a wonderful stay. "
16441	6623079	7.0	9.0	41995999	"Sofwa was a wonderful and very kind host. She was very communicative about the way we could arrive and when we had issues coming to terms with our arrival time, she turned out to be very flexible and helpful.

She gave us a lot of space, but made it very obvious that she was willing to help us get around and talking to her was a lot of fun as well. I actually fell sick during my stay with her and she even helped me get better.

The apt. is small, two bedrooms. The bedroom we stayed in had two beds, a desk and a closet, with enough space for both of us to hang our stuff in. The beds were comfortable and Sofwa even provided us with towels for the bathroom. 

It is really easy to get to her place and a bus stop is a minute down the road. I would stay with Sofwa anytime again!"
16847	3770248	7.0	9.0	17601580	The place was really easy to find and close to bus stations coming from downtown/Capitol Hill. The University town nearby is a nice place to take walks around. The building was really quiet, except of course for the garbage truck each morning, but that was indicated in the listing and I didn't mind much either way. Beds are comfortable, but wifi signal not strong enough for anything more substantial than checking messages. I never met my host in person but she helped me out over intercom whenever I had questions.
16848	3770248	7.0	9.0	17903015	"The location of this place was great, near UW and lots of shops/cafes/restaurants within walking distance. There's a bus stop right around the corner. I never met Melissa in person, but she was accommodating about early check-in. 

The place was large (w/walk-in closet) and mostly clean and quiet. There was a used/cracked bar of soap in the bathtub and a previous guest's food was still in the fridge. The studio is in the back of the building, facing a parking lot. The garbage truck woke me up around 5:30 am once during my stay. 

If you're looking for a convenient, affordable place to stay near UW, this fits the bill.
"
16849	3770248	7.0	9.0	28924787	Melissa was helpful and answered all our questions promptly. The space worked well for our needs.
16850	3770248	7.0	9.0	42378721	"The location of the apartment is in a prime spot next to the university, which is beautiful and a major landmark in the city. The University District always has a lot going on, which made it a great location in the city for the summer. There were tons of restaurants on the Ave and downtown was just a quick bus ride away. 

In addition, this apartment is located just one or a few blocks away from bus stops that can take you to all the popular neighborhoods within the city, such as Fremont, Capitol Hill, Ballard, East Lake, South Lake Union, Seattle Center, and Pike/Pine.

The apartment itself is clean and well laid out. No repairs needed to be made to the apartment during our three months there. Melissa is responsive to any texts or calls that we had about the apartment. 

The kitchen is small but well equipped for any food that you would want to cook. The beds are also comfortable but be warned that the couch is not comfortable enough for someone to sleep on. The closet is massive and will be able to hold all your clothes for sure as two of us kept all our clothes we needed for three months in it. The bathroom is small but had enough storage space. Shower has good water pressure and we never ran out of hot water like the listing had warned us. The neighbors are also quiet and friendly.

The dump truck mentioned in a previous post is a real concern if you are not a heavy sleeper. It came for us only once a week early in the morning so it wasn't as big of a concern for us but it is loud as the apartment window is directly above the dumpster.

Melissa also helped us get parking spots for our time at the apartment. This was crucial for us because parking is especially difficult and expensive in the city of Seattle. Since we were there for three months, it was very assuring that we had safe, affordable, and accessible spots for the whole time there.

"
16851	3770248	7.0	9.0	48421876	"Before i begin, this review is not for the original apartment but for 4145 11th ave ne apt38. My apartment was changed by the host at the very last moment.

The good stuff. The apartment is very near to the university of washington. It was clean, has adequate parking and melissa was friendly enough. The not so good thing. The apartment needs a television and some minor maintenance. The kitchen tap handle was detached as was the door handle of the bed room. It was a rather old apartment."
17077	3291777	6.0	8.0	14255940	"I was in a pinch looking for a last minute place to stay while in town for a work trip during the time of UW and the other Universities graduations in the area. It was great to find a place to stay that was not ""marked up"" during a time of high demand. My 3 night stay was less than what the hotels were asking for a one night stay. The unit is a close walk to restaurants and the UW. The unit was clean and worked well for my needs, at a great price. I did not have any issues finding parking in the immediate area or the street in front of the building. My initial inquiry to Melissa was very late in the evening (actually early am) on the needed day of arrival. Melissa was extremely quick in her response at such a late hour, as well as the couple inquiries I had during my stay. I really appreciated that she arranged for my late evening arrival after a night hosting some clients at a Mariners game. I would definitely stay at this unit if I have the need to be in the area again.  "
17078	3291777	6.0	8.0	14760768	"Melissa replied to our request and approved but by the time we booked it she gave away the apartment to someone else. We had no choice but to book another apartment in the same building. The price we paid was way too high for the room ($129 @ day) because there were a lot of issues which we experienced during our stay. The coffee pot was left dirty with garbage still in the bins from the previous guests. The kitchen faucet was broken and after several emails and 2 days later Melissa did come by and get it fixed. There were used soap bars and shampoo left in the bathroom which raises hygiene risks. My question is why did I pay for cleaning fees if the apartment was dirty.

The apartment building was in very poor condition and the apartment had a disgusting smell with no ventilation. The apartment decor was poor and furniture was old and uncoordinated. Although the carpet was vacuumed that's what Melissa told us but it was very old and stained. The mattress of sofa bed was disgustingly dirty - we only came across because the sofa was so uncomfortable and we checked underneath. The kitchen had left over food items such as coffee, tea bags, raisins etc and utensils were old. There was only 1 small tea cup for an apartment which is suppose to host up to 4 people. Since my partner and I had no choice, but to go out and buy our own disposable utensils. The bathroom has one rusted mirror with stains and the bottom of bath tub has been painted over which became very slippery after one day use. We had to clean the bath tub to ensure we didn't have any accidents. The toilet tank would also drain water constantly because of loose valve. We had to fix it constantly after every use.

The only thing that worked well was the (website hidden) had limited channels and many channels were in Spanish including the sports channel which had the World Cup running. Quite a disappointment for my partner.

The location was the reason we booked the apartment. While the location was great, close to UW and shops etc, the building and apartment needs lots of work to bring it to habitable condition. Unfortunately, it wasn't like we could check out since we had booked for 4 nights and had no choice but to stay. Overall, we were disappointed with the place and since this was our first ever airbnb, we will be very cautious on what we book in the future."
17079	3291777	6.0	8.0	15278962	"I cancelled the reservation first when I got to see the apt. It was not what i was expecting, because the place is more like a hotel. No one actually lives there but, more like a hotel, people come and go for short stays. 
After saying that, the place is not taken care off like if an actual person live there. So most of he furniture is cheap. The bedroom does not have a window(although there is no pic of the bedroom). The smell is of cheap cleaning liquid, combined with the several people that stay there per month. 
In conclusion, overall the place looks cheap, but it can be habitated if one is looking for a cheap short stay.
BTW, the host showed us another place in the same bldg that was 10 dollars more expensive per night but looked like new. So just be careful which apt you choose because some are better than others."
17080	3291777	6.0	8.0	15590881	"Though this place isn't super fancy, it's certainly comfortable for crashing in while exploring Seattle, and the location in the U-district is convenient both in terms of immediate access to restaurants in the neighborhood as well as multiple bus lines running downtown.

The host Melissa was very quick to respond to booking requests and upon check-in made sure we had what we needed ... we didn't make a lot of contact beyond that, but she seemed very kind and willing to be accommodating if we had needed something.

The one thing I feel people should realize about this apartment is that its only window (the one in the living room) is directly adjacent to an alleyway that cars cut across quite frequently. There are steel plates on the pavement there, so they clatter loudly every time someone drives by, which starts pretty early in the morning. Also on two mornings there was non-stop and very loud construction noise, preventing any opportunity to sleep late. On top of that, the upstairs neighbor has a habit of loudly pacing (stomping?) back and forth for hours on end, late at night ... this happened without fail 6 nights in a row. I've lived in various apartments for over a decade (including NYC) and understand they all come with noise, but I'd have to say that for a vacation spot, all this combined was a bit annoying.

Noise aside, which arguably Melissa can't do anything about, the place was fine. The building is on the older side, but the apartment interior is clean if not full of frills. The bed mattress is brand new and very comfortable; the sofa less so. I'd maybe compare it to a college student's first apartment in terms of quality.

Again, if you're using this as a ""home base"" to basically shower and sleep while during the day you're out exploring Seattle, I think it's suitable, and the location in the U-district and quick bus access to downtown are its main positive features."
17081	3291777	6.0	8.0	15920870	The apartment worked out well for me; I was attending a conference for the majority of my time in Seattle but needed a home base to wind down and sleep in the evenings, and get ready in the mornings.  This is not a fancy or modern apartment, but it was quiet,  affordable, a great location, and very convenient.  UW is within walking distance including University Ave with tons of restaurants.   Melissa was a great host.  It was unusually hot in Seattle that week (~90) and she was able to find me a fan to use which I def needed.  She is a very responsive and friendly host.  I would stay again if I came for another conference.  
17082	3291777	6.0	8.0	19295884	Place was great, just as photographed. Melissa was great and very accommodating in getting me set up for the place. I was very happy with the whole experience.
17083	3291777	6.0	8.0	44309765	The location is very close to UW campus and easy to take the bus to downtown. I will choose it when visiting Seattle next time.
17084	3096191	7.0	9.0	15455036	We didn't have good experience at all. There was no tea or coffee kettle, no toaster. Hot water problem in the bathtub, really have to jigle to get water. Shower faucet was not working. Sink drain was clogged. Rug was dirty. Bedroom door had whole. There was smell in the building. This house is very cheap furnished. Apt. Is on 3rd floor but ne elevator. There was water in soap bottle instead soap in the bathroom. Kitchen utensils were bad. I never met host but my friends met them. We were very unhappy.
17085	3096191	7.0	9.0	15698055	The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood and was very clean. The description mentioned it was upgraded, which I would expect to mean newer kitchen and baths. There was nothing wrong with them, they were just older and definitely not upgraded. The only problem we encountered was they didn't leave enough towels. We let them know there would be 4 staying but we were only left 2 towels. I emailed around midnight when we realized and they brought us additional towels around noon the next day.
17086	3096191	7.0	9.0	16407418	It was a pleasant place in a quiet building. As advertised. The host did a nice job trying to accommodate us and bring in extra bedding because we had 4 unrelated people trying to stay there.
17087	3096191	7.0	9.0	16836413	Apartment is in an excellent location, especially if one wants to be close to the UW campus and the University District with its many restaurants and shops. The apartment is very pleasant, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant. Upon arrival, we thought that parking might be a challenge but we had no problem parking right in front of the building all four nights that we were there. It is on the fourth floor and is a walk-up so that could be a challenge for some.  
17088	3096191	7.0	9.0	17352654	"Following are the positives:
- two full bathrooms and two bedrooms with comfortable beds;
- it's in a quiet neighborhood and walking distance to upscale shops, a large grocery store and a variety of good restaurants;
-it has wifi.
- there is a security lock at front entrance.

The negatives:
- the apartment is bare bones. The kitchen has a few unmatched plates, bowls, cups, silverware and only 2 glasses.  There are a few pots & pans but we had to ask for a coffee maker;
- there are no waste baskets, just a garbage container in the kitchen;
- we had 3 towels for 3 of us & had to ask for wash cloths and hand towels but never got the hand towels.  No rug or shower mat in bathroom either;
- no broom/dustpan;
- it's on the 4th floor & the entrance, stairs and hallways were very dirty;
-there is a view but it's not gorgeous, mostly the tops of buildings through some trees.

Our main complaint was at check in.  We had arranged with Ren, the host, to call him 30 minutes prior to our arrival (about 9:39 am) and he or his wife would meet us there.  I left several voicemails, emails & texts for Ren with no reply over 7 hours.  His wife's VM box was full.  When I finally reached his wife, she first said she didn't know we had a reservation, then said we were expected at 2:00 or 3:00, then told us we couldn't get in for a couple of hours because the apartment was being cleaned!  We drove over to the apt.  She was there, gave us the keys but said we couldn't move in until the cleaning was done. We left and were finally able to settle in 9 hours after our agreed-upon time.  I have high praise of Airbnb's Caelen S. the customer service staff who was responsive and efficient.  She told us the Airbnb would put us in a hotel that night & find us housing for the remaining 6 days and offered to pay for our meals we ate while waiting to get into the apt.

Paula & Doug"
17089	3096191	7.0	9.0	18338882	"The location of this apartment is quiet and convenient -- centrally located in the University District and a short drive to many areas include downtown Seattle and Ballard. The interior is simple but got the job done.

However, there were several communication mishaps with the host which could have been avoided and created much confusion during check in. Also, the wireless network had a tendency to go down every once in a while which isn't a big deal if you're out a lot, but was a hassle for us."
17090	3096191	7.0	9.0	18595025	This apartment is near WU on a hidden and quiet dead-end street with very little traffic and lots of trees. The 4-story building is functional, but not particularly attractive or clean. The apartment is very large and can comfortably accommodate 2 couples. I guess it caters to students and university visitors. It was very quiet while I was there. There is no elevator, so mobility-impaired guests would have difficulty getting to the 4th floor. The apartment was functional. Everything (kitchen, bathroom, shower, towels, fans, lights) worked adequately. Cleanliness is an issue. There is ingrained dirt and stains on walls and carpets in the building and even in the apartment, that makes one question whether it is real dirt or the remnants of past dirt. And it makes one question the cleanliness of sheets and towels, though I had no particular reason to doubt that those were clean. The host was available and responsive to emails, and they were there when I arrived and helped me with my bags. All in all, I had a good experience there.
17091	3096191	7.0	9.0	18889152	"The apartment was fine for our stay and had everything we (website hidden) responded quickly each time I sent a message.

Positives:
* Host was responsive to our messages
* Parking right in front on the street was easy
* Drive to downtown was usually about 15m
* There is a nice open air mall s better than some, but nothing gorgeous."
19898	4773614	6.0	10.0	24506534	Great location and the perfect size for two people. Very clean and tidy! 
19899	4773614	6.0	10.0	28374619	The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20664	670009	7.0	9.0	28473894	Qing was a good host. The place wasn't anything special, but it was functional for the amount of people we had in the place. 
20665	670009	7.0	9.0	28825367	My guests felt very welcomed in the space. The neighborhood was perfect for their stay because it was just a few blocks from where they were rehearsing and they were able to walk down to Capital Hill for the entire Seattle experience. 
20666	670009	7.0	9.0	29921957	There is a manager which is really nice. The entrance is on the side of the house which I wasn't aware of. It was perfectly suitable for my family. It's in a very good area if your at a conference. $5 uber to the conference centre! 
20667	670009	7.0	9.0	30410860	Communication before arriving was somewhat vague but all the information needed was provided before we arrived.  The house was definitely comfortable for the 6 people we brought.  I would say it wasn't immaculately clean but not necessarily dirty.  Very bare but the basics were supplied (towels, soap, toilet paper). Great place for a quick stay. 
20668	670009	7.0	9.0	32636191	Nice part of town very walkable.
20669	670009	7.0	9.0	35783769	The whole place was clean and organized. We got in with no problem and had no issues contacting Qing with any questions. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again next time we're in Seattle!
20670	670009	7.0	9.0	36763324	"We were welcomed quite nicely, and were given several recommendations for places to go, and things to see during our visit. 

It was uncharacteristically hot for Seattle during our visit, so we called to see if there was a fan for our room. The host showed up within a couple of hours with a large fan for us. "
20671	670009	7.0	9.0	41217041	House was not as nice as it looked in the pictures. No AC either. 
20672	670009	7.0	9.0	41632900	"I stayed at this location for three nights with my wife and her parents.   On the whole we had a good experience, there were lots of pluses but also a few serious minuses.  Depending on what you're in Seattle for and what your expectations are I'd recommend staying at this location.

On the pluses:
The apartment was very spacious, which was great for us.  And there was a lot of really beautiful natural light.  The location was good, very close to downtown (a reasonable walk or very cheap Uber ride).  The patios were also nice (though one had some kind of animal infestation so we didn't really use it).  It was also really nice having a caretaker on site (especially when the power failed and she had the keys to the basement so could flip the fuse).  She was really really friendly.

On the minuses:
We'd hoped to use the kitchen to cook; but that wasn't really possible.  There were plates, mugs, and silverware.  But there were no bowls, pots, pans, knives, or utensils (ladle, spatula, etc).  So if you plan to cook I'd recommend bringing those.  The sheets and towels were provided which was great, but they were all rather old and uncomfortably musty.  The building had a lot of character, but it also needed some serious maintenance.  The shower curtain kept falling down and we couldn't get it back up.  Not having a smoke alarm felt kind of sketchy.  And there was no A/C  or ceiling fans (we were there in August, but Seattle is normally much cooler).

On the whole we really enjoyed our stay, but the place could do with some improvements."
20673	670009	7.0	9.0	42110758	"I recently stayed in the unit with 6 people total.  There was plenty of room for us, but not enough towels or blankets.  The neighborhood was very convenient - there was a bus right to downtown or Ubers were always only 5 minutes away and it was very affordable to get around that way.  There are restaurants and bars .5 to 1 miles away that are easy to walk to.  There were a lot of amenities, like a/c, but it worked out since we weren't spending a lot of time in the house.  The wifi was reliable. 
"
20674	670009	7.0	9.0	45367866	Well the place was under construction when we arrived, it was lacking wash cloths and had a limited number of towels. the place was dusty and had no cookware. the wifi was not in our apartment and could not reset it when it stopped working.
20675	670009	7.0	9.0	48692245	"These are all facts: 
1. This is not a review for Sunny 3BDhome, but rather ""Fantastic View"", Qing's other property. That is because the day before we were to check in, we were given the address to ""Fantastic View"". When I pointed out the mistake, Qing informed us he had moved us due to repairs, acted like he was doing us a favor and asked if we wanted to cancel. We really had no other choice but to accept even though it was another part of the city.
2. On the last night we were staying there, we came home at 2am. We were listening to music and talking. It wasn't party music but it was likely too loud for 2am. Definitely our fault. The person who lives there normally, was staying below. She came to our door and yelled at us at around 2:20am. We immediately turned off the music, apologized profusely and went to bed. Dead silence in the house. At 4am, we received a text message from the caretaker demanded we immediately leave her house (not Qing's so don't know what's going on there). We explained it was 4am and had nowhere to go and once again apologized. She again demanded we leave, contacted Airbnb, threatened to call the police and generally acted unstable. We agreed to exit but needed to get our things in order and finally left around 7:20am. During that time she came into the apartment and was unhinged (on video) screaming at us (broken English). We were polite during this entire crazy middle of the night escapade.
3. After checking out, later that day, we got a demand for $420 damage we had done. Pictures were provided by the host as proof of damage. What the pictures show is the cheap plastic bar lock for the sliding door leading to the patio. During our stay we had gone out onto the patio. This bar lock had a screw that fell out as we tried to unlock it, or remove it to go out onto the patio (a bar lock prevents people coming in from outside). It fell out because it was cheap and well worn. If we had a screwdriver we could have fixed it. If the host has a screwdriver they could fix it. Instead, in an act of retribution for 15-20 of loud music that was politely and immediately shut off, Qing has attempted to extort us for $420. That is unresolved but I hope Airbnb does the right thing.
4. The hand soap in the bathroom was full of soapy water, I guess to maximize the life of the soap like my mom used to do. "
21014	666897	6.0	8.0	30999680	Great place in a quiet location, prefect if you are going for work as I was. There are nice bars and restaurants not too far away, probably 20 minutes walking. Qing was very helpful during my stay and I would definitely stay here again
21015	666897	6.0	8.0	31821969	Charming cottage, centrally located.  It was convenient for us to visit our daughter and walk or bus to many great sights.  Onsite parking was very helpful because of two hour parking restriction in the neighborhood.  Looking forward to future visits.
21016	666897	6.0	8.0	32582989	We stayed at Qing's cottage for a belated honeymoon, and it was just perfect! Easy walking distance to the Pine/Pike street attractions, and close to a couple of bus routes. Tucked away in a fenced in yard with gorgeous flowering trees. We were greeted by a woman staying in the front house. She gave us some suggestions for restaurants nearby, and then gave us our privacy. The house was very comfortable, and we enjoyed our stay very much.
21017	666897	6.0	8.0	32792846	This was a lovely little cottage and was exactly as described. The neighbourhood was nice and quiet and we had easy access to the city. Having the space for our car was great too. Our host was very lovely and attended to all our needs promptly. Only issue we had was the toilet blocking quite easily.
21018	666897	6.0	8.0	33554299	My scheduled host did not show up and Nina (Qing's mother) was kind enough to host me on very short notice. The place is cozy and comfortable, good internet, a bit spare in the kitchen but I was able to cook my meals just fine. The area is quiet and centrally located. You can bus or walk most anywhere. I enjoyed the whirlpool tub. I slept well there. I was happy to have a place to stay.
21019	666897	6.0	8.0	34147619	"This cottage was just the right size and the right location....enough out of downtown to be quiet--great café, Broadcast Coffee, within walking distance to downtown Pioneer Square, etc.  I liked the location.  Did rent a car and walked so I don't know about access to public transportation.

Cottage was nicely decorated and stocked with all that might be needed for a basic stay."
21020	666897	6.0	8.0	35470879	The appt was cute and the house manager, Lena, was very helpful and patient; we arrived later in the evening and had many questions.  
21021	666897	6.0	8.0	35928452	The cottage was nice for the price but definitely needs a bit of work. We arrived 20 minutes early, but luckily after a few tries, we found the house manager who said that the place was available for early access which was wonderful. The grounds are not well kept up and there was a random fridge sitting on our porch. Besides needing to be fully cleaned (there was a lot of dust and spiderwebs in some areas) it was a nice place. The bedroom is located upstairs via a narrow spiral staircase. The bedroom has skylights (windows in the ceilings) that allows A LOT of natural sunlight in. It's very nice, but not when you want to sleep in. The kitchen and all around house amenities are extremely limited, but we made it work. We didn't meet or speak to Qing, but talked to the house manager (who is really hard to get a hold of) .. There weren't any big issues that needed to be addressed. 
21022	666897	6.0	8.0	39562205	Checking in and arriving was very easy. The location was great and had parking access and just a quick drive from a lot of things in the Cap Hill area, and not too far from downtown. Definitely near a lot of restaurants and great things to see/do/eat.
21023	666897	6.0	8.0	40493682	Qing’s place was a great place for my brother’s visit to Seattle. It is spacious and convenient to public transportation and is situated in a quiet neighborhood not far from where I live. The kitchen and bathroom are modern and clean. The wifi worked well and Nina, Qing’s mom, was very helpful. There was a slight delay at check-in as the host said the previous guests departed hours later than expected and left a mess. Nina had just steam cleaned the carpet and was trying to get it dry when we arrived. Afterwards, everything went very smoothly. As my brother was packing to leave for the airport, he noticed a trail of ants in the loft space. I called Nina and she responded as we reached the airport. She apologized and said she’d take care of it. Overall, my brother’s stay at Qing’s place was positive and I would request to stay at Qing’s place again in the future.
21024	666897	6.0	8.0	40968939	Good value but could use a little attention to make it outstanding.  Lena was very welcoming and accommodating.  We appreciated her letting us keep our sea kayaks inside the gate. Super cute cottage with a really nice little deck.  It was unusually hot, so a fan would have been nice (as the sleeping area is in the loft.)  Conveniently close to public transportation. Since we had just camped and kayaked for 4 days, the laundry machines came in really handy.  There are sugar ants though and, while they put out ant traps, I didn't like having to dodge them on the bathroom counter.
21025	666897	6.0	8.0	44125952	My boyfriend and I stayed four nights here. The door is locked by a key code so we were able to arrive late at night, which was great. However, we almost couldn't find the place! There's a tall fence with a latched gate around the property and no lights were on. Once we found our way inside we both thought the house was cute and the bed was comfortable. The house is in a convenient location (25 minutes walking or a very short uber to Pioneer Square). We had to improvise a bit to make food as the kitchen's pots, pans, and knives were limited. The kitchen and bedroom were clean, but the rest of the place could've used a little more attention. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. 
21026	666897	6.0	8.0	44841760	"There was a keypad for access so never checked with anyone.  The neighbor hood was typical of that area, close to Seattle U.
The entrance didn't look so ""lovely"" with an old refrigerator on one side of the door and an old futon couch on the other side.  The inside was ok, not the best cleaning job, dishes were in the sink!  Had to plug the dishwasher in to wash all the dishes.  Bed upstairs was comfortable and the location was great.  The futon in front of the tv had a definite dip not for sleeping!"
21027	666897	6.0	8.0	45793414	The cottage was ok. The wifi was solid, and the place had towels, which was nice. Could have used some more kitchenware, and we couldn't get the heat to work. Great location, fair price, and it was nice and quiet. All in all pretty solid.
21028	666897	6.0	8.0	50001198	"This cottage was absolutely perfect for our stay. It's in a lovely neighborhood and getting around was easy. The back patio had a grill which was great for enjoying the nice weather. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment was clean. The pictures show exactly what the place looks like. Also, Lena let us check in early, which was great.
"
21029	666897	6.0	8.0	50777916	My husband and I really enjoyed Qing's place. It's in a great location and is the perfect size for two people. 
21030	666897	6.0	8.0	57470630	Qing was very welcoming and the property was lovely. The location was perfect for our needs, and there was plenty of street parking with the supplied neighborhood parking pass. The space was private and secluded. I'd definitely stay here again.
21643	7093910	6.0	9.0	44582120	My partner and I really enjoyed staying at Ted's place in Seattle. Quite centrally located, it's about a 10-15 minute drive from lots of major sites and neighbourhoods in the city -  Capitol Hill, downtown, and the sports stadiums. The home itself is incredibly comfortable, clean, and tastefully furnished, and very private - an extra plus was the bed - very comfy and welcoming after a long day touring the city! Ted was very responsive to my (many) questions which was very much appreciated. We hope to stay here again on our next visit!
21644	7093910	6.0	9.0	47537979	"Ted's modern home is definitely that. It is in the minimalist style and yet has many fancy gadgets. Ted offers a third separate bedroom ans well as a whole house. The house is centrally located, but ensure you mention Martin King Luther Jr Way SOUTH. There are two such ways.
As the room was not cleaned for our benefit we expect a refund of the cleaning fee of $44.00. Plus as there was no breakfast provided, we expect a refund of $12.50 per person per night allowance for the duration of our stay. We have accepted no clean towels on the first night as a mistake on our behalf. The refund we expect is (phone number hidden)."
21910	5078244	7.0	9.0	29589234	When I'll go back to Seattle, I'll stay for sure at Alberto's place. He's such a nice host! 
21911	5078244	7.0	9.0	29884715	The neighbourhood was fine. However we didn't really get to see the neighbourhood. But for the price, this is a steal! :)
21912	5078244	7.0	9.0	30113047	Alberto was a very nice and helpful host. The room in his apartment is not very large but sufficient if you only need a place to crash during the night. However, you get what you pay for.. The kitchen and the restroom could be cleaner though. 
21913	5078244	7.0	9.0	31754851	Alberto was a very friendly and welcoming host! Clean and nice apartment, great location in a nice area!
21914	5078244	7.0	9.0	31991893	Alberto was very welcoming and accomodating when we arrived earlier than expected. We were easily able to park and buses were only a 5-10 min walk so we had that option too. The sofa bed is comfy and the accomodation was all we had hoped for. Alberto was available to answer questions if we needed but also gave us space and privacy. Thank you Alberto. 
21915	5078244	7.0	9.0	32558684	Alberto was a perfect host. This is a perfect crash pad for anyone who wants to take in the city all day and get a good night's rest to do it all over again the next day. Neighborhood was awesome. It's a straight shot for about 20 blocks to downtown, with easy bus access too! Will definitely stay again when I decide to return.
21916	5078244	7.0	9.0	32726487	Second time I stayed at Alberto, he is a great host!
21917	5078244	7.0	9.0	33143311	Alberto was a great host! He gave us great recommendations and spend a lovely night playing chess and drinking sake
21918	5078244	7.0	9.0	34319662	Alberto made us feel very welcomed when we arrived. He allowed us to come a little earlier to check in an drop off our luggage. His neighborhood is very nice and quiet and is close to downtown. He was very knowledgeable about the area and different things to do in the Seattle area. I would stay at Alberto's place again when I'm in the Seattle area. 
21919	5078244	7.0	9.0	34605525	This was a very good deal for the price. Very close to Capitol Hill and the International District. Alberto was very nice. The apartment is cleaned to... bachelor standards, which I didn't mind, but fussier people might. I liked the place.
21920	5078244	7.0	9.0	34834185	Great host! had an interesting conversation with Alberto in the evening. He made our stay very easy. Nice, quiet location, easy reach to downtown with constant public transportation. Alberto is 100 % recommended
21921	5078244	7.0	9.0	35227590	Alberto was super helpful and easy to deal with. The neighborhood was nice and it was easy to get around. the room was fin and the place was clean.  
21922	5078244	7.0	9.0	35317884	Place is ok if you stay only for one night.
21923	5078244	7.0	9.0	36197270	Alberto was very welcoming.  Room was fine and just as advertised.  A very big plus to have  such an economical place to stay so close to downtown.
21924	5078244	7.0	9.0	36415578	The host made us feel welcome by introducing himself and touring us around the apartment. The listing description was accurate and the neighbourhood was great! It was close to where we were visiting.
21925	5078244	7.0	9.0	37002773	Had a good stay with Alberto. Friendly and the apartment is clean. I stayed for 1 night (which is his minimum as of when searched and booked). After booking he said he doesn't normally accept 1 night stays and prefers two or more. Listing needs to be updated of his preferences. Other than that I had a good stay. 
21926	5078244	7.0	9.0	37998854	Alberto made me feel very welcome and took the time to show me around parts of the city. He's a great host and a friendly guy. The room has a sofa bed and is comfortable and clean, there's a bus stop right outside the apartment building so you can be downtown in 20 minutes.
21927	5078244	7.0	9.0	38313420	Alberto is a very nice and welcoming host. His apartment is in a nice area and not far from downtown. I would totally recommend his place!
21928	5078244	7.0	9.0	38876426	Albert is a very nice host, and always answer back quickly with my question. we enjoyed the time at Seattle very much.
21929	5078244	7.0	9.0	39021454	Alberto was a nice host, room was OK, and there was no problems. Transport to city was close, and convenient. Thanks Alberto for having us.
21930	5078244	7.0	9.0	39948684	Thankyou alberto
21931	5078244	7.0	9.0	40352406	The house condition was not up to our expectation. We wish it was cleaner, larger, and better location, but owner is willing to offer refund immediately after we expressed our concern.
21932	5078244	7.0	9.0	40695241	Good experience, great price. Would recommend. 
21933	5078244	7.0	9.0	44619479	Alberto had us to stay very last minute and was more than accommodating. There are a couple bus stops right outside which makes things really straight forward for getting into the city. Would recommend! 
21934	5078244	7.0	9.0	45103647	Had a wonderful stay with Alberto. My friend and I were out most of the time, so we didn't get to know Alberto too well.  However, he was welcoming upon arrival, and respected our privacy when we were staying in the room. If you are looking for a place to crash at night after a full day out exploring Seattle, look no further than this private room.  The bus stop in front of the apartment is very convenient. 
21935	5078244	7.0	9.0	46487732	This is a cheap, clean private room in a good location. Alberto was easy to coordinate with. We recommend this rental. 
21936	5078244	7.0	9.0	46752486	"The information and listing details were accurate. However, host stated that it is a flexible time check in. But a day before, i was told that im not allowed to check in before 6pm.

Of cause i wasnt happy about it and, in the end it was worked out and i was able to still check in on my desirable time.

After checking in. The room was in a MESS! Bed sheets that were given to me by the host was dirty and filled with hair. I double confirmed with the host, and he claims that its washed and cleaned.

The bathroom condition was bad too. Bath tub was slippery and not cleaned.

But still have to thank the host for the effort to allow me to check in on my desirable time. "
21937	5078244	7.0	9.0	47014656	Alberto was very friendly and accommodating. His place is quite cozy and tidy. We felt very welcome, our stay was reminiscent to crashing at a friends place. The sofa bed is a little creeky, as a heavy sleeper I was fine, but my friend woke up a few times.  Overall I would recommend it for an affordable place to stay.
21938	5078244	7.0	9.0	47217504	If you're looking for a cheap and safe place to stay in Seattle, that is exactly what you'll get here. Don't expect much more.
21939	5078244	7.0	9.0	47331864	Simple living and easy stay
21940	5078244	7.0	9.0	47407320	Host is nice. However, just a little bit late check in. It was say 6pm check in but end up 9pm for me to check in. The bed sheet is not really clean and wondering hasn't wash from previous guest. Bathroom is not really clean and full of trash in the dustbin. Kitchen is messy too. Personally, I'm not recommended unless you really prefer for a cheaper price that's it.
21941	5078244	7.0	9.0	48395122	Good location, easy free-parking on the road, nice host, no problem that we checked in late (9pm).
21942	5078244	7.0	9.0	48659070	The neighborhood is good and well connected to downtown. If the room was a bit more cleaner, it would have been a great stay. I appreciate Alberto's quick response to emails. 
21943	5078244	7.0	9.0	48973202	Big thanks for allowing me to check in at 2:30am after my travel was significantly delayed!! Lesser hosts would have said no. Nice guy, good communication, accurate listing, everything was fine and the location was good value too.
21944	5078244	7.0	9.0	49642813	"We enjoyed our stay with Alberto very much. He was extremely accommodating, allowing us to check in early and leave late. We didn't see too much of him (as we were out all day, every day), but when we did see him, he was always very friendly.

The apartment has a very convenient location with a bus stop right in front of the building--and the ride to downtown is only 15-20 minutes. 

We slept well (although the mattress is a bit soft), and it was very quiet. And we loved being able to make breakfast in the kitchen, and leave a few items in the refrigerator.

All in all, it was an excellent experience."
21945	5078244	7.0	9.0	49863573	It was easy to check in.
21946	5078244	7.0	9.0	49965816	Big thanks for Alberto, everything was good a great location at a great price!!
21947	5078244	7.0	9.0	50150815	"Alberto is a busy man, yet he made me feel at home.  His is a great location at a great price.  Yet, more importantly, I did not feel like a ""guest"" in his home."
21948	5078244	7.0	9.0	50363558	Alberto was really nice. The room is as described and only 10 minutes away from downtown by bus.
21949	5078244	7.0	9.0	50805046	"We really have a great time in Seattle~
And Alberto gave us everything we want. And made us feel welcome! The room is as described. Small but good enough."
21950	5078244	7.0	9.0	51258892	"Alberto was very helpful and welcoming, even though we only contacted him last minute due to a cancellation. 
"
21951	5078244	7.0	9.0	51672197	Alberto was very courteous and hospitable. Apartment has plenty of available street parking nearby, and food and drink within walking distance.  Neighborhood was close to other areas of the city.
21952	5078244	7.0	9.0	52129400	Alberto was very friendly and accommodating, even to the point of loaning me a couple of things I'd neglected to pack. His apartment is small but very clean, orderly and quiet. The apartment faces the small parking lot in back of the building, not the street. You get your own room, as opposed to crashing in somebody's living room with a curtain divider. The fold-a-bed couch was more comfortable to sleep on than I'd expected. Public transit access is good: a 2-minute walk to frequent bus connections to downtown and the Metro (12 minutes), U. of Washington (25 minutes), etc.
21953	5078244	7.0	9.0	54351569	About what you would expect for the price. No complaints.
21954	5078244	7.0	9.0	54449766	Alberto was very nice; he seemed busy but still very accomodating. The flat is great and in a nice area.
21955	5078244	7.0	9.0	54751984	Small but adequate room in a quiet surroundings. Bus takes you in 15min to downtown. Alberto was friendly and had towels and bedding for US. I would recommend this to someone who looks for a cheap place to stay
21956	5078244	7.0	9.0	54905887	awesome host had a great time there .
21957	5078244	7.0	9.0	56271905	Alberto is really nice. No complaints for the room.
21958	5078244	7.0	9.0	56730869	The room was right next to a bus stop going to downtown and quiet. Albert was friendly, and he recommended us places to go. The sofa bed was comfortable than I thought.
21959	5078244	7.0	9.0	57375335	"There are convenient transportations right in front  of the house. The place is so cozy and clean.
We spent good time during our trip in Seattle.
"
24710	6363779	7.0	10.0	35183707	Zach was a friendly host. There were him and his gf living at the apartment. The best part about Zach's place is the location because it is close to downtown and multiple bus routes serve the area. A 2-minute walk gives a view of the lake. The least I liked about the place is that the room was not as neat/clean as I would expect at my own home. There were about 2 dozens of females shoes hanging on the door. The shelves were full with personal belonging so I had nowhere to put my personal items. Lastly the bed sheets did not smell fresh. Perhaps I just have a higher standard of hygiene and neatness compared to most guys. 
24711	6363779	7.0	10.0	35981842	Zach was a great host, very accommodating. Zach offerred lots of suggestions for easy ways to get around Seattle, along with things to see, local watering holes, and great places to eat, that won't cost a fortune.  He also has a cool little dog named Bacon that will treat you like a king. 
24801	7844444	6.0	9.0	43577811	Tara was very accomodating! We had a change of schedule and she was willing to work with us. Thanks, Tara!
24802	7844444	6.0	9.0	43734115	Tara was very friendly and welcoming and gave excellent instructions on how to get into the place.  Made herself available for any questions/concerns.  Location is really pretty stellar.  
24803	7844444	6.0	9.0	43878853	Tara was very responsive with my questions and directions on getting to the apt. We stayed only one night and the apt was sufficient. Street parking is relatively easy to find.
24804	7844444	6.0	9.0	44361874	Great, cozy apartment with a helpful host. Tara was very nice and had a well thought out plan ahead of time for me to obtain the key, as well as to return it after my stay. The apartment was great for a single person or a group, very homey. Also in a nice neighborhood - right by the lake and with a local bar and convenience shop around the corner.  Pleasant walk to downtown. Stay here, have a great time!
24805	7844444	6.0	9.0	44486391	Tara's apartment is in an amazing place in Seattle. Less than a block from Voxx Coffee and near beautiful Lake Union it really is in a fantastic location. The apartment has a great deal of potential to be a very fine place as well.
24806	7844444	6.0	9.0	45350795	Tara was very quick to respond and the directions for entry and access was easy to understand. The studio was VERY basic and description should possibly be revised. 
24941	5353512	7.0	7.0	55092224	Anna and her place were great! I booked this for my two good friends who had multiple flight delays, and she was awesome about being flexible to meet up with us. Place was nice and clean and very welcoming. 
24942	5353512	7.0	7.0	56358455	"Nicest things I can say:

1.Anna is a nice girl and friendly.
2.She was prompt to answer all emails and texts in the booking process.
3.The room and home basically looked like the photos.
4.Anna gave us a key so we could come and go
5.When Anna was unable to fulfill the first night, she responsibly took care of the refund from AirBNB.


Room for improvement: 
1.Anna is still new to the AirBNB hosting process and is in a learning curve as to having a system of how clean a rented room and bathroom should be. She’s not up to hotel standards yet.
2.Although the room “looked” as advertised, it was actually a tiny space carefully photographed to look the size of a normal bedroom.
3.The neighborhood: She’s directly across the street from a fenced elementary school playground which made navigating nearly impossible when school let out. Street parking could be unpredictable but we found a spot. 
4.Most of all, she should put on her description that she is in one small apartment in a four-plex and has no control of talking, banging and music from the upstairs neighbors at any hour of the night, directly above your bed.
"
24943	5353512	7.0	7.0	56468156	"I was waiting until the last minute to book a room, and Anna accepted my room request at 10:59 PM. Within  30 minutes she had tidy room, clean towels, and options for breakfast. The next day she suggested several places I should go see in the city and even offered to let me leave my bags there and go explore. I would highly recommend staying with Anna!

Her dog and cat were also very friendly!"
24944	5353512	7.0	7.0	56822225	Anna made us feel welcome! Her place is in a perfect spot for the buses that go around Seattle. Her dog and cat are very friendly, and the room is cozy! Her pastries are delicious btw :)
25189	8083242	5.0	7.0	46984179	This is my first time using Airbnb. i am a mother sending son to college  that is located 20-30mins by bus/driving to the college. but we still stayed in the property for a week hoping it won't quite be a problem as we wanted to enjoy the downtown seattle before moving to closer neighbourhood. The neighbourhood of Bryan's is not quite close to the downtown itself. it's  approx 10 blocks from the clubs, cafes and downtown area. But Bryan has been very helpful to us that we could directly spot some great restaurants in downtown. Overall Amazing stay but I just didn't expect that a cat lives in the house and i am very allergic to the lovely creature. Bryan also moved in when we expected that it's entire apartment with one empty second bedroom so we would have a little bit privacy. i tried to be tolerable with the cat although Bryan moved her to his girlfriend's house but because i am also a housemother so i can't tolerate furry and dust left behind by the cat. Last few days of our stays i feel a bit hard to breathe. Overall we had great First experience because we can cook just like at home
25190	8083242	5.0	7.0	47823143	This was my first time using Airbnb and I have to say, Bryan made it a great and worry free experience. Though we hardly interacted due to my schedule, he gave me the privacy I needed and made me feel welcome to used his apartment. The location was safe and minutes away from South Lake Union. 
25191	8083242	5.0	7.0	48922560	"Bryan was very nice eh en we arrived! Je give as advice an toked as to the gas station that was near by.
The apartment was big but dirty. He left ine of the two bedroom in total disorder, even with two empty bottles of beer and clothes!
Under the bed and the sofá it was full of dirt!
The apartment is walking distance to downtown."
25241	7203765	6.0	8.0	41820722	"This was our first time in Seattle and first airbnb experience; Iulia made it a great one! Despite the last minute booking arrangements Iulia was a wonderful host for our trip to Seattle. She made us feel very welcome in her home and made our arrival and departure very smooth.
The studio apartment was an excellent home base for our walking excursions to Key Arena, in the Seattle Center as well as a visit to Capitol Hill.  The apartment was a little cozy, but there was plenty of room for the 2 of us. 
I would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone looking to avoid the bustle of the downtown core.
Thanks for a great trip, Iulia!"
25666	6959336	7.0	7.0	37512474	Check in was extremely easy and Nikki's home was very comfortable.  It was a little warm around mid day but cooled off nicely at night.  Temperatures were unusually high for Seattle so I don't think it would be a problem.  It was about 20 mins from the city.  Discovery Park was a great place to take walks in.  Thanks Nikki!
25667	6959336	7.0	7.0	38314432	Altough we didn't meet Nikki, she was very efficient and nice to us. Her house is very comfy and the local is VERY good!!! The park in front is a great for whom want to stay in the city and feel like in country side. Recommended.
25668	6959336	7.0	7.0	39051585	Nikki has a great little house about 12 minutes from downtown Seattle. Beds in both bedrooms were comfortable and the shower has excellent pressure and water coverage - a definite plus for me.  We stayed on a very hot weekend and the home is not air conditioned, so we toasted a bit, but Nikki has fans in every room and we were all so tired after all our activities every day, nobody seemed to have too much trouble sleeping. There is a very large park directly across the street, which we didn't explore much, but provides an absolutely sensational view at sunset. We also discovered Chinooks, a ridiculously good seafood restaurant on the water only a mile and a half away from the house.  Finally, Nikki was kind enough to let my son play one f her guitars when we were there, which we couldn't get at any hotel. We paid less than half what we would have staying downtown, got the space of a Presidential Suite, peaceful, quiet nights and easy access to everywhere.  Tip: we tried Uber for the first time. They pick you up in minutes, get you where you need to be and cost a third of the price of parking downtown for a couple hours.
26018	3697351	7.0	10.0	16532717	Jakub was a very nice host. He is super friendly and he is willing to either show you around or leave you alone completely, however you wish. He is a talkative guy and the room is exactly what he advertised. You can use the kitchen and fridge if you wanted to and also the bathroom is spotless. The appartment is located around 5-10 minutes by foot from space needle and also 5-10 minutes from the pike place market. The neighbourhood is very nice and seems safe to me. 
26019	3697351	7.0	10.0	16599250	Jakub was very accommodating of my last-minute request to stay at his place. It's a nice apartment building in a great location. Jakub couldn't be any nicer or enthusiastic. I enjoyed my brief stay and appreciated the good night's sleep.
26020	3697351	7.0	10.0	16643841	I had the opportunity to stay with Jakub for one night (which amounted to approximately 7-8 hrs total. I flew into Seattle at night and had plans to leave early the next morning for the Olympic National Forest to do some hiking. I did not want to spend a ton of money on a hotel so I chose to stay with Jakub. His apartment is as advertised…minimalistic. However this fit my needs perfectly. Jakub was extremely gracious and friendly. He allowed me to sleep on his floor mattress while he slept on the floor with a sleeping bag. I felt like I got to know him fairly well considering I was only there for about an hour of waking time. Jakub also lives in a very nice part of the city within close proximity to bars and restaurants. He is not far from Pikes Place and there is a view of the space needle from his window. If an inexpensive crash pad in a nice neighborhood with a gracious host is what you are looking for than this is the place for you!
26021	3697351	7.0	10.0	16692049	Great location! Clean apartment! Excellent company! Jakub's apartment is a gem located in the heart of the Seattle downtown area. Easy access to all the great Seattle spots as well as transportation. Jakub is an excellent host. He was timely with his responses and made me feel very comfortable in his apartment. I will definitely stay here again, and I highly recommend his place to others that are interested in visiting Seattle!
26022	3697351	7.0	10.0	17016978	Jakub is the best! Really great guy and very generous with his place. Very very good price and a prime location. Jakub was very flexible with our hours and taught us a great card game called Flux. Would definitely go back and stay if I were in Seattle. 10/10.
26023	3697351	7.0	10.0	17121705	Staying with Jakub was awesome. It was exactly as described and the Japanese style mat was very comfortable. He was very hospitable, offered us food etc. He also laid out a foam mat and sleeping bag for my sister. We all ended up hanging out together and going to a mariners game. I would definitely recommend Jakub place to people who want to have an awesome experience in Seattle!
26024	3697351	7.0	10.0	17237109	Jakub was very friendly and accommodating. His place is clean and comfortable and the location is great for exploring downtown Seattle. 
26025	3697351	7.0	10.0	17322470	"Jakub's place was exactly as described - minimalist and comfortable. It's in a very convenient downtown location close to Pike Place market and you can see the space needle from the window.

The best part was Jakub. He took his evening to give me a personalized tour of Seattle with some amazing views (and trolls!) and made for some great conversation. Thanks again!"
26026	3697351	7.0	10.0	17388005	Jakub is a nice and helpful host. His apartment is very close to every attraction in downtown. The great view of Space Needle in the apartment is a bonus. 
26027	3697351	7.0	10.0	17527771	Jakub is a very nice and helpful host. The location is perfect which is walkable to most of the downtown attractions. In the apartment we can enjoy the beautiful view of Space Needle. I really enjoy my stay here. 
26028	3697351	7.0	10.0	18345114	"Jakub was a great host! Since his place just has one main room where we slept, we had quite a bit of conversation and even played Dominion a few times. He was very kind and hospitable.

His place is conveniently located in Belltown, close to a number of nice restaurants, among other things like the original Starbucks, the Space Needle, etc. I was surprised how many times I mapped something and realized how close it was. Walking to Seattle's international district on the other side of downtown is easily doable as well. The photo on his listing is accurate, and the bed (futon?) he provides is quite comfy.

Would definitely stay again."
26029	3697351	7.0	10.0	18891179	Jakub was very friendly and accommodating. The location is amazing and close to everything. Better than a hostel.
26030	3697351	7.0	10.0	19276646	The room is exactly like it is depicted on the Website and it is in a great location. Both downtown and the Space Needle Area are about 10-15 minutes away by foot. Jakub is a friendly Host that will help you out with directions and other questions that you may have. also the wifi is fantastic.
26031	3697351	7.0	10.0	19482868	The apart is in a in a perfect location, close to almost everywhere like pike market space needle and many museums. Jakob are really friendly and helps me a lot .He even took me to explore a great park and we saw a super beautiful view. I will recommend anyone who try to visit Seattle to live in his place.
26032	3697351	7.0	10.0	19543462	Jakub was an awesome host! Very flexible, and went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable. Thanks!
26033	3697351	7.0	10.0	19613333	Jakub's place is exactly as advertised.  My boyfriend and I slept on the floor - one of us got a mattress and the other a sleeping bag. Both of us had no trouble sleeping. Jakub was responsive via email prior to the trip and met us at the door when we arrived, as promised. He recommended a great place to grab a coffee and donut. That was about the extent to our trip - short and sweet. Thanks for the place to crash, Jakub!
26034	3697351	7.0	10.0	19702780	I had a short one night stay at Jakub's place. He was a great host and was really friendly.
26035	3697351	7.0	10.0	19892172	"A nice home base to explore Seattle since it as about 4 blocks (10-15 min walk) away from pubic transportation. It is also really just 5 blocks away from the Pike Place Market. 

However, the room was really small and there was an additional 2 people and 2 dogs staying there that we did not know of. The host failed to inform us of that earlier. Also, the tenant before us only left after 7pm that day. Which meant that we pretty much spent day 1 with no key access to the place. 

Also, the sheets were not fresh. After the previous tenants left, we used the same ones (not washed) and it seemed to be the same for the next tenants that arrived after us. 

The bathroom also seemed like it wasn't washed for a really long while. The stains on the sink and the tub seemed to indicated so. "
26036	3697351	7.0	10.0	20261187	Jakub was a good host. The place was as expected, and super close to downtown. I was slightly surprised when there was 2 other people crashing there when I arrived, but they were Jakub's friends and were really friendly so wasn't a problem.
26037	3697351	7.0	10.0	20391479	I had an enjoyable time hanging out with Jakub and his room-mates!
26038	3697351	7.0	10.0	20690786	great location. 
26039	3697351	7.0	10.0	20751427	Perfect location. It was exactly what I needed. Jakub is a great host!
26040	3697351	7.0	10.0	20960270	Good location, accurate listing description. Jakub is a great host - accommodating, friendly, easy to talk to. This wasn't an issue but it would have been nice to know he had another roommate and two dogs. I definitely recommend!
26041	3697351	7.0	10.0	21008412	Jakub is a nice guy. I was at his place for 1 night. I walked to almost everywhere. Some of the places are pike market, space needle, downtown, the showbox (concert area) and many more. 
26042	3697351	7.0	10.0	21290752	Jakub is friendly. He is very nice to accommodate you and make you feel comfortable. The location is awesome. You can see the space needle from the window and 5 min away to the Pike Place Market. BTW, he has 2 little dogs. So if you are afraid of dogs, that might be a small problem. But other part is good!
26043	3697351	7.0	10.0	21948404	Jakub was a super host, very helpful, accommodating and was always up for a chat.
26044	3697351	7.0	10.0	22090691	It was my great pleasure to stay in Jakub's place. He is a very nice and friendly person, his apartment is on the heart of Seattle. Almost every places are walking distance, seeing Space Needle from his place was one of the advatages.
26045	3697351	7.0	10.0	22425122	Jakub and Kelsey were friendly, helpful and accommodating and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with them. A short walk from the light rail and downtown, nightlife within a block or two. You couldn't ask for a better location. I'd also like to point out that Jakub really does take his reviews seriously - he's acted on improvement suggestions from other reviewers and I believe the photos and his thorough listing details are fair descriptions of what you should expect. You must have some expectation management though - don't expect a 5* ensuite hotel room with maid service. Instead, expect a friendly experience that a hotel couldn't provide.
26046	3697351	7.0	10.0	22540146	Jakub and Kelsey were wonderful hosts. Their location near Pike Place cannot be beat. Our sheets and sleeping bag were freshly cleaned when we arrived. We were able to come and go from the apartment as we pleased. 
26047	3697351	7.0	10.0	22791609	Jakub was so, so, so nice and unbelievably accommodating! We were in town for a concert and unfortunately we didn't have much time to chat due to time  constraints that night, but Jakub's home is lovely and the sleeping arrangements he provided made for an overwhelmingly comfortable stay. It was incredibly brief but it was absolutely perfect for what we needed--we couldn't be more grateful! 
26048	3697351	7.0	10.0	22921481	"Good host, Good location
He is so kind."
26049	3697351	7.0	10.0	23047823	I had an amazing time staying with Jakub and his roommate Kelsey. They are two very kind hearted, helpful and friendly people. The conversations were amazing and the atmosphere was relaxed. Each night I felt like I was at a friends house for a sleepover. It was always friendly and lighthearted,their cute dogs helped too! I will definitely be back to Seattle to stay there again! I arrived early and it was no issue and One night, I came home late and they waited up to make sure I was comfortable to get into bed without waking them. Perfect location and perfect hosts. Way better than any hotel! :) Thanks again guys!
26050	3697351	7.0	10.0	23160307	Wish Jaukub would've gave us prior knowledge that he was sick as well as had two little dogs. The shared room was very messy and the smell was atrocious. Tried to stay out of apartment as long as possible to avoid the mess and smell. However, on the positive side, Jakub is very nice. 
26051	3697351	7.0	10.0	23492268	Cosy apartment in a great part of town. Close to everything you'll want to see. Jakub was a kind and friendly host, who was happy to help with anything a asked. Anyone would be happy to have Jakub as a host.
26052	3697351	7.0	10.0	23548913	Jakob was an excellent host. I flew in rather late and he was more than accommodating. He and his roommate were both interesting and excellent conversationalists, and I very much felt at ease with them. The place was comfortable and well situated in the city.  
26053	3697351	7.0	10.0	23672413	The space was intimate.  Jakub was very accommodating in the sharing of food.  I slept well.
26054	3697351	7.0	10.0	23761266	"My aunt and I stayed at Jakub's during the beginning of December for two nights. Jakub greeted us at the door and was friendly and accommodating. 

PROS: Great location. Jakub's place was in the center of downtown and was walking distance to pike's place which we walked to every morning. We were also walking distance to west lake mall and space needle. Although we used uber when it was dark out. 

Jakub and his housemate were nice although we didn't spend much time at his place. He provided us with a twin bed and a sleeping bag just as stated. 

CONS: My aunt loves dogs but not where she sleeps. Jakub's roommate has two small dogs. There was a slight dog smell upon opening the door and she wasn't too happy with it. Half the time they were locked up but the other half they were running around. I didn't mind too much. 

Other that that, great location friendly host! If you don't mind dogs, I would recommend his place for a short stay. 


"
26055	3697351	7.0	10.0	23806978	The host is easy to communicate,  room have smell to me. Location is great! Roommates are quiet and easy going. 
26056	3697351	7.0	10.0	23915475	Jakub was very nice. The location of his apartment was good because it was close to a lot of the tourist attraction sites. This place is good for someone who doesn't plan on staying indoors and is looking for a cheap place to crash after a long day. 
26057	3697351	7.0	10.0	24042173	"Awesome stay ! Jakub accepted me in a very short notice without any problem. The place is comfortable and very well located.

Jakub is really nice and interresting.
Definitly a place where I could come back. "
26058	3697351	7.0	10.0	24205645	The location is very convenient for travelers to sightsee and the price is reasonable, so I could enjoy my stay in Seattle and save my money! Also, Jakub is friendly and his roommate is quiet. There were two small lovely dogs. That was never problems for me.
26059	3697351	7.0	10.0	24256054	Exactly what I was looking for for one night. Gave me his Wi-Fi-password. All in all really friendly!
26060	3697351	7.0	10.0	24465345	Jakub is very easy to communicate and also fun to talk with.  The location of the apartment is also very close to all of the tourist attraction places and the public transportation as well. The only difficulty for me is the sleeping bag that i found difficult to sleep with without a pillow, else everything is perfect! My friend got the futon with the pillow but i got the sleeping bag. If you ever travel along with a friend, one of you would have to sleep with the sleeping bag. Jakub has also 2 dogs in the apartment and a roommate.
26061	3697351	7.0	10.0	25035281	Jakub and his roommate were great hosts. His place is in an awesome location for the price. We were three sleeping in the same room and I didn't have any problem with noises. There are two small dogs in the apartment that are lovely. If you want to save money in a short stay in Seattle Jakub's is perfect.
26062	3697351	7.0	10.0	25184278	Great location and great price.
26063	3697351	7.0	10.0	25352612	"Jakub is a really great host! Very kind, friendly and hospitable. His apartment is ideal for a short stay, its clean and comfortable and you get full use of the kitchen. Really well located if your planning to do the tourist thing in Seattle, so close to the market and surrounded by great bars, shops, restaurants. Also super close to Westlake station if your travelling from SeaTac. 

Its a great little spot and its super cheap. Would definitely recommend staying with Jakub! "
26064	3697351	7.0	10.0	25480512	Great place to stay. My friend slept on the mattress and I used the sleeping bag. The dogs were really cute. In a very walkable part of town close to many things to see perfect as a place to crash for the price. Jakub and his roommate were very friendly and accommodating.
26065	3697351	7.0	10.0	25531952	"Jakub does his best to make you comfortable and hosts people like they are friends, he will do his best to accommodate you even if you are requesting last minute. I am glad I stayed there. Plus, the price is fair and the location is amazing!
Everyone sleeping on the same floor was not nearly as weird as I thought it might be, since everyone is so nice and the bed and room is so comfy. I recommend staying here!"
26066	3697351	7.0	10.0	25640660	"Jakub and his roommate are very nice people. They help me and dinner with me. I love them.
Thanks a lot! My friend!"
26067	3697351	7.0	10.0	25665072	Great location and gracious host! My only regret is not having more time chatting with Jakub.
26068	3697351	7.0	10.0	25786934	"The location of Jacobs flat is fantastic, close to all of Seattle's attractions and near to public transport- a really good price considering! Jacob was very helpful at organising our check in, as he was out for the day. 
The bed was comfy, a little of a squeeze for 2 people but there is also a foam mattress if you are traveling in a 2. 
The only downside is the cleanliness of the bathroom, it needs improving!
Perfect for a nights stay to visit Seattle, thanks Jacob."
26069	3697351	7.0	10.0	25905482	"Actually, I was nice to me who did not understand English well.
It was a trip to very good Seattle.
英語が分からない私でも、とても親切にしてくれました。とても良い方です！"
26070	3697351	7.0	10.0	26100973	"Great location and unbeatable price. Jacob and his roommate were super accommodating and nice. I'm a classical musician and was in town over the weekend for an audition. On the day of my audition Jacob let me practice in the room all morning and he and his roommate went out to give me some privacy. 
If you don't mind sharing a room with two more people and don't seek the privacy go ahead and book. "
26071	3697351	7.0	10.0	26166398	Jakub and his roommate were hospitable and helpful for my boyfriend and I who were visiting the city. They gave us great suggestions and we always felt welcome. We loved the dogs too!
26072	3697351	7.0	10.0	26329365	This was a great location downtown. For the price you could not ask for more. Jakub was great to communicate with and made getting into his apartment very easy. 
26073	3697351	7.0	10.0	26492133	Jakub's place is conveniently located in downtown Seattle, close to Belltown and Pike Place market.
26074	3697351	7.0	10.0	26871352	Really good location and very nice host !! Good experience
26075	3697351	7.0	10.0	26966867	Jakub and his roommate were both friendly and accommodating. And the doggies were super cute :) The shikibuton was super comfortable!
26076	3697351	7.0	10.0	27400470	I had a great time. Jakub and Kelsey are a lot of fun, and the puppies are adorable. The location is ideal for exploring downtown Seattle. The mattress is surprisingly comfy. I slept well every night. I would 100% rent if I were in Seattle again.
26077	3697351	7.0	10.0	27741764	Perfect location for walking around the city. Jakub made my check-in extremely easy and stress free. The bed was also super comfortable and his roommate was nice enough to aid in tips for enjoying the city. I would highly recommend this place and, if willing, hopefully stay at Jakub's again.
26078	3697351	7.0	10.0	27842179	I had an excellent stay at Jakub's place. I was warmly welcomed to the apartment and immediately given a key to the place. The location is very central, close to major attractions and light rail station. The studio apartment is cozy and the mattress comfortable. The two small dogs are very friendly and stay in their cage when needed. I definitely recommend.
26079	3697351	7.0	10.0	27971734	Great location. Apartment is minimal but that was perfect for us! Dogs were cute and hosts were friendly. Four is a bit of a squeeze but totally worth it.
26080	3697351	7.0	10.0	28304006	It was my first time and it was really good he is friendly and helped me a lot to get some information about seattle I recommend you to stay here
26081	3697351	7.0	10.0	29473060	It's very cheap and reasonable at this price point.  It is a mattress on a floor in what feels like a college dorm room.  Nothing wrong with that as long as you know it's what you're getting.  Never met Jakub but he was very responsive via text.
26082	3697351	7.0	10.0	29908922	My stay was fine. The location is very good (can't get much better than that). If you like dogs, is OK with not having a clean and organized place, and don't care about sleeping on a mattress on the floor, this is THE airbnb option for you. If you are looking for a on-a-budget place, this is also a good airbnb option for you.
26083	3697351	7.0	10.0	30113506	Jakub was very friendly and responsive and welcomed us with a some cookies. Although the room needs a clean and looked much tidier on the picture. I didn't used the kitchen, because I had no need for it; neither I used the bathroom, because I didn't felt hygienic enough for my usually rather low demands. And guys, you gotta do something about that smell!
26084	3697351	7.0	10.0	30874790	This is a great place for a great price. If you are looking for just the basics. Jakub is a great guy!!!
26085	3697351	7.0	10.0	31186048	"Jakub and his roommate was very friendly and helpful.I had a excellent stay in 
his apartment.Close to major attraction just a few mins walk.Recommend to you for a great place & great price"
26086	3697351	7.0	10.0	31613012	Jakub was very gracious in his accommodations and was very easy to talk to. His apartment also has a great view of the space needle and access to a lot of nightlife nearby. Would definitely stay here again.
26087	3697351	7.0	10.0	31728550	It was a really pleasant experience staying w Jakub while I was in Seattle. He's a really friendly guy and will do his utmost to make you comfortable at his place. And the location of his apartment is really superb, it takes only 5 mins to walk to Pike Place Market. Definitely a good bang for the buck!
26088	3697351	7.0	10.0	32517331	I had a great time staying at Jakub's. Him and his roommate were very friendly and provided a lot of privacy despite the close living quarters. The space is cheap and simple but it's in a boss neighbourhood (walking distance of everything in downtown) with a fantastic view of the space needle so if that's what you're looking for I would certainly recommend you!
26089	3697351	7.0	10.0	32695119	"Jakub replies timely and professionally to all communications and is such a nice guy - fixed me a bowl of his pecan granola with blueberries and bananas!
Great location - walking distance to many of Seattle's finest."
26090	3697351	7.0	10.0	33474360	Jakub is a very nice and pleasant guy. It was a pleasure to meet him. The flat is in the perfect area for exploring the city. Everything was very uncomplicated like getting the key and coming and going whenever you want.
26091	3697351	7.0	10.0	33906315	I felt very welcome by the host and his roommate; and the location is great.
26092	3697351	7.0	10.0	34284824	The room was as advertised, very cozy and in a great location for an amazing price. Jakub and his roommate are extremely nice and accommodating. I found the puppies adorable since I've owned pets, but if you are someone who never owned pets or does not like animal smells,  you may be a bit bothered.
26093	3697351	7.0	10.0	34655300	This is a solid bare essential place. If you're ok with dogs, a funky smell, and a dirty college roommate feel. Be aware if what you're getting yourself into! His roommate was friendly and provided a lot of privacy despite the close living quarters and the location is unbeatable!
26094	3697351	7.0	10.0	35456880	The location of a place is excellent and it's very easy to go around Seattle from there. Jacob wasn't present when i arrived and the place was really messy. He came back after 2 days and had put efforts to clean it up. Both Jacob his roommate are really very friendly and welcoming. I had a good stay and have no complains apart from the fact that the place was very messy. 
26095	3697351	7.0	10.0	35657566	The place was exactly as described. Some might call it squishy, as it is only a studio and there are 3 mattresses on the ground, but it didn't bother us. It is perfect if you are looking for a simple, inexpensive place to sleep in a super convienent location. :-)
26096	3697351	7.0	10.0	38562878	Jakub's roommates were friendly and accommodating when I got there. If you don't mind sharing a small efficiency with a couple of other people, this is a good deal for the location ...
26097	3697351	7.0	10.0	38598782	"very nice place to stay, very well located!
we didn't meet Jakub but he made everithing so that we feel at home!"
26098	3697351	7.0	10.0	38794358	Very communicative about check-in/check-out. Perfectly friendly and helpful - no complaints. 
26099	3697351	7.0	10.0	39092813	It was exactly what the photos and description said it was going to be. He is an awesome host! I would recommend staying here. Plus, there's a cool view of the Space Needle! 
26100	3697351	7.0	10.0	40139485	Jakub was a friendly and informative host.   The place was just as described.  
26101	3697351	7.0	10.0	40592980	everything was great and clean. the bed was comfortable.
26102	3697351	7.0	10.0	41122206	Jakob was very easy to work with, always accessible and the apartment was as shown in the picture. Two other guests stayed while I was there and they had 2 dogs. As such, there were some issues with cleanliness from the pets, but other than that everything was as expected. I even forgot an item at the apartment and Jakob let me get it hours after check-out, which I really appreciated. 
26103	3697351	7.0	10.0	41351347	Jakub was away while we stayed, but his roommates were very helpful and welcoming. The place is in a great location, we walked everywhere! The roommates had great suggestions for food and things to do. There's plenty of maps and info for guests. I stayed here with my friend and we both fit comfortably on the bed. The dogs are a definite plus- they are so adorable!! 
26104	3697351	7.0	10.0	42319204	I wanted a nice place to stay just a few nights and this was perfect. It's right next to several main attractions like Pike's Place and the Space Needle. A place to sleep and shower were provided and that's all I needed!
26105	3697351	7.0	10.0	42563511	The room was very small and cozy. There's no privacy except in the bathroom, but that worked out well because Jakub and his roommates take their time to know their guests. Both Jakub and his roommates were very friendly and inviting. They answered any questions we had and were both interesting to talk to. Jakub was very accommodating to our travel needs. He was flexible and allowed us store our luggage past the check out time.  Overall, it was a pleasant stay.
26106	3697351	7.0	10.0	44160931	This was a wonderful place to stay. Located right in downtown, everything was close by. Jakub was very warm and welcoming and helped out very much. He had print outs of tourist attractions and points of interest. 12/10 would stay again!
26107	3697351	7.0	10.0	45365931	Nice, minimal space in an ideal location downtown. Great host, great value.
26108	3697351	7.0	10.0	45703470	Jakubs places was perfect for what we were looking for. He provided all the basics. We just need a place to sleep for 1 night and it was fine. Location couldn't have been any better, and Jakub coudnt have been more on point. Very nice and helpful.
26109	3697351	7.0	10.0	45904235	Jakub was welcoming and his apartment is quite well represented by his photos. He was friendly and talked with us about Seattle and provided helpful suggestions.
26110	3697351	7.0	10.0	46263182	Jakub was a great host and the accomodation was exactly as advertised.  We slept on one side of the room on a dense mattress on the floor, and Jakub slept on the other side of the room.  He had helpful signs placed here and there that let us know the location of clean towels and dishes etc.  The location in Belltown is fantastic.  The neighbourhood felt safe.  Jakub's place was clean and he was very accommodating with our schedule.  He had no problem with our coming and going at any hour.  We will request to book Jakub's place again in the future.
26111	3697351	7.0	10.0	48297897	Jakub was a perfect host. Very good location :)
26112	3697351	7.0	10.0	49317529	We had a lovely time at Jakub's place, it's right in between Pike Place and the Space Needle and even close enough to walk to Safeco Field.
26113	3697351	7.0	10.0	50185028	Great location! Extremely central & close to major attractions (i.e. Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, Pike Place Market, 1st Starbucks, Kerry Park & Grey's Anatomy's Meredith Gray's fictional home). Place was clean and just as advertised in the posting. Jakub was great in having the apartment labeled accordingly, making it easy to identify your areas of use. Also, he was very easy to communicate with and made our stay incredibly easy and comfortable. If you are looking for a place to crash while you are in Seattle, I highly recommend that you give Jakub's place a try!
26114	3697351	7.0	10.0	50639391	My boyfriend and I stayed with Jakub for one night. Everything was exactly as it appeared in the listing and Jakub was very welcoming and accommodating!
26115	3697351	7.0	10.0	50821117	Jakub was very welcoming and helpful. Ideal place to stay given its location. 
26116	3697351	7.0	10.0	50892919	Jakub's apartment was in a great location and is advertised exactly as is. Everything in the apartment was easy to find and it had a beautiful view! Three of us fit very comfortably there and when we woke up in the morning we could walk to many amazing places. Also, Jakub was a great guy and we had fun talking to him.
26117	3697351	7.0	10.0	50940658	Great location and super comfortable mattress! If you are looking for a place to sleep and not anything more, Jakub's place is a good option in Seattle. 
26118	3697351	7.0	10.0	51073421	Great location and place to crash.
26119	3697351	7.0	10.0	51458840	Great place to stay in downtown! My friend and I both slept comfortably at jakub's place. Perfect for if you just need a place to sleep. Perfect location for sightseeing - it was easy to walk from here to anything we wanted to see downtown, and close to transit around the city and from the airport.
26120	3697351	7.0	10.0	52968778	My two friends and I stayed at Jakub's over the Halloween weekend. It was a great location and was accurate as described. 
26121	3697351	7.0	10.0	54530932	Jakub gives really awesome and clear directions on how to check-in. It was really easy. The arrangement is exactly as his post says. Really convenient location!
26122	3697351	7.0	10.0	54614096	Felt very welcome, just like home. Perfect downtown location, easy to find and navigate being unfamiliar with Seattle. 
26123	3697351	7.0	10.0	55206645	It was great such a good location!
26124	3697351	7.0	10.0	55822341	The listing was completely accurate and Jakub was kind enough to let us check in significantly later than we had initially projected. Both hosts are excellent conversation partners! The water pressure was great in the shower. All in all, it was totally worth it, a great stay!
26125	6958436	5.0	10.0	41116044	It was a lovely experience. I kinda wish I could've stayed longer. The area was full of great restaurants and within walking distance to everything. The place had a great airy vibe. The hosts were organized, affable and accommodating. 
26126	6958436	5.0	10.0	51857699	Cool position, pretty apt, terrific host! 
26128	3534364	7.0	10.0	15740867	Nice location, centrally located.  Great view!  Host was very helpful and communicated well.  Room was simple and clean with full kitchen.  Would stay here again.
26129	3534364	7.0	10.0	15807509	The reservation was canceled 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
26130	3534364	7.0	10.0	16425334	Good place! Great location! Host was accessible and accommodating. 
26131	3534364	7.0	10.0	17243128	Awesome location, especially if you don't have a car. Calvin was a great host, who made sure we had everything we needed. Thanks so much!
26132	3534364	7.0	10.0	17398506	"We had the privilege of absolutely gorgeous  weather while visiting Seattle for a quick weekend trip. We spent most of our time walking to nearby restaurants, bars, jogging to Kerry Park and checking out Pike Street Market. The location was perfect! We also spent an entire afternoon on the rooftop deck enjoying wine and snacks while taking in the incredible views of the water. Turn around- there's the Space Needle! The location and the roof top deck are the two glowing characteristics of this studio.
It is an extremely sleepy building- we didn't run into another tenant the entire weekend.

It is a stereotypical bachelor pad. It lacked basic things like a can-opener, toaster, decent cookware or knives. If you're planning to cook it is not ideal.
It was also pretty dirty in my opinion. The kitchen garbage was left full, shower was dirty, grimey kitchen towels, old & warn bath towels, etc.
The studio doesn't have air conditioning, but he has on small fan available for air flow.

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our trip, but would have preferred a cleaner space.


"
26133	3534364	7.0	10.0	18825898	Calvin's loft was clean, convenient, and exactly as advertised. It was in a great location- quiet but close enough to walk to interesting food, drinks, and attractions. The rooftop deck is gorgeous. Thanks, Calvin, for a great weekend!
26134	3534364	7.0	10.0	29124817	Apt was great location, walking distance to pikes place and space needle. No tv which didn't matter since we were busy anyway. I worked from apt at small desk using wifi, it was peaceful watching bay and birds. Bed was clean and comfy. Grocery store isn't that close so be prepared to walk a bit of you don't have a rental and plan on cooking a lot. All in all it was perfect for our stay and we would book again. Calvin is very helpful and easy going. Oh, and there's a fireplace that's operated by a lightswitch which make the chilly and rainy days feel nice and cozy!
26135	3534364	7.0	10.0	34359080	This was a wonderful stay. Calvin's apparently has a breathtaking view and everything was as described. The location and roof top deck were the best parts. It is just a short walk away from a cute coffee shop, numerous restaurants (the Innkeeper was my fav) and of course Pikes Place Market. The only small downside was that there is no air conditioning which was tough one night, and the apartment could be a little cleaner as a whole. Otherwise, 5 stars!!
26136	3534364	7.0	10.0	41860677	"Calvin's apt has incredible view! You can see Seattle harbor from the window. The apt is located in downtown Seattle. It takes 5-10 mins walk from his place to Space Needle, and 10 mins drive to Pike Place. There are many nice restaurants nearby, and some of them open until 2am. It's very convenient if you don't have a car. There is a bus stop around his apt. 

Calvin is very friendly and helpful. He replies my message very fast and gives me a lot of advice.   "
26137	3534364	7.0	10.0	47085734	Calvin's place was awesome the location is great, centrally located between Pike Place and the Seattle Center. The is view is phenomenal! I was amazed! From the bed you can look out on Elliot Bay and the surrounding mountains. Calvin was a great host, he was out of town when we arrived but his communication was almost instant over the phone! Would love to stay here again! Thanks again Calvin you rock!
26166	6370313	7.0	10.0	44159543	"Description was accurate.  The apartment building was in an excellent location, and the unit was quite comfortable, with excellent views.  The building pool and common areas are quite nice as well.

The most inconvenient thing was parking - the unit does not come with a dedicated parking pass, and the apartment building had no parking passes to rent for the stay.  However, there is ample free street parking in the neighborhood at night (8pm-8am) and weekends, and during the day, there are neighborhood lots, although they are all quite expensive."
26167	6370313	7.0	10.0	45312689	An absolutely amazing appartment with a fantastic view. The price is great for it, too. Always again!
26168	6370313	7.0	10.0	46980860	The apartment was nice and the listing description was accurate, however this apartment is rented by Global Serviced Apartments and is not a person-to-person rental. They were inflexible when it came to making reservation changes withing 24 hours of booking. Communication was impossible. Our confirmation was not consistent with the reservation we had agreed upon. As a result, we tried to contact Kara Smith and the company, but only ever reached a messaging center and we never received a response. Ultimately, we resolved the issue with the property manager on-site who was extremely responsive. In fact, I recommend contacting Metropolitan Towers directly for rentals, as they are very accommodating and more affordable. Finally, we were charged for five nights , even though we only stayed two, and though promised reimbursement, two weeks later, we still have not received it. As I mentioned above, the building was lovely but working with Global Serviced Apartments was far more challenging than I ever imagined and not the welcoming, personal Airbnb experience I am accustomed to or the experience I expected when planning a trip through Airbnb.
26169	6370313	7.0	10.0	50462040	"I have very mix felling about my experience in this accommodation. 
After reaching Seattle after more then 24 Hours of flying and connection at the airport , I check-in to the reception of Metropolitan Tower at the concierge they have no idea about my reservation No key No information they have no idea about the name of the host Kara Smith and try to call her mobile number which I have before I travel and Like always answer machine and not able to leave a massage.
After 30 minutes of trying to figure any information ( the concierge people were extremely helpful) we find out the apartment was open (not locked) and the keys were inside. THE BIG SURPERISED the apartment was not ready (the linen in the bed and towels in the bathroom were all used and dirty and there was no clean one to used) and No one to contact NO Company to call NO host this KARA to answer and we (my wife and my son and myself) were extremely tired from the trip and the only solution was to find any place to sleep and by the help of the concierge lady we find two rooms in Hotel Max which is few steps from the building . Next morning we found out the whole company is off for some Jewish holiday and there be No cleaning because of the holiday and they will try to send the cleaning people by Wed. 16 Sept. so we have to stay another night in the Hotel ( it coast me more than $900 )
Finally by Wed Sept 16 at 3:00 p.m. we checked in the apartment. This is my bad start at this accommodation 
The good side was the location is super , the people working are very nice and helpful.
The only two good things that the company did trying to compensate me 1) get me the parking fob for the garage ( although the concierge people offer me a fob for the whole period (28 days) for only $200) .
2) They exchange the sofa bed   with new one after complaint about the old one 
This is my story I am not happy and I dont think I will use your service again.          "
26191	9183838	4.0	6.0	55880754	"Unfortunately my experience with the Belltown apartment in Seattle is very very disappointing :(  I hate to complain or write negative reviews, however I have to do it.
The first, this apartment we booked for 3 guests. There is a king size bed for 2 people and for a third person  a very small, tiny and narrow sofa, that is good enough to have a short nap!!!!  When I called to a property management and told that... The answer was : we can deliver a air bed for 50$ delivery fee ?!?!? Why ?!? We paid for a night 319$ US. 
The second one, there is NO internet ! We again, called to the property managemnet and asked if there is a wireless or wired Internet ! The man on the phone said,he would call to the owner and asked for a WIFI password and log in. Never called  us back :( 
The third, it was very cold in the appartment ! There is no an instruction or a guest info book or so... 
We at our own risk, opened the hitter's vents and eventually it was little bit warmer! 
One more thing... The building is very old so it is very smelly :( .. 
The next one, we also paid a cleaning fee 84$. But all hitters are dusty.
The last,  but also very stressful... The address of the building  is 304 Bell street , and there should be a lock with an apartment's key, but the lock was attached to the 308 Bell street building's door :( who knew it ?!? :( 
to figure out all these issues I had to call to the property management several times by using my cell with roaming rate and now I can imagine my Fido bill !   stay away from this place ! I am  a Airbnb member since 2011, I am not picky at all,  but this time it was to much :( "
26313	6992696	6.0	9.0	37804652	"The room was exactly as pictured. I also had free reign of the shared living space most of the day. The internet was fast and Xfinity was nice. 
The location is great to explore the city from because there are two different bus stops right outside the front and back doors. Matt was always polite and asked me if I needed anything. For the price, I would stay here again."
26314	6992696	6.0	9.0	37915284	Matt was great! Super nice guy, really wanted to make us feel at home (and we did) and very easy going. Was very flexible about arrival time, too, and willing to let us use everything from his television to his coffee. Extra points for laying out clean towels for us (I forgot my towel, despite Douglas Adams' advice).
26315	6992696	6.0	9.0	38062345	Matt was super friendly and accommodating. Very helpful about the surrounding area. The location and host cannot be beat! I would certainly stay with Matt again.
26316	6992696	6.0	9.0	38331414	Matt was great and the apartment was conveniently located. He was a great host and made me feel very comfortable. I enjoyed Belltown and Pike's Place (both were pretty easy to get to). The apartment was very reasonably priced and the bed was very clean.
26317	6992696	6.0	9.0	42805334	The location was great. It is perfect for a group of friends who want to go to Belltown or Lower Queen Anne.  We were disappointed by the cleanliness. The bathroom and kitchen could really use a deep clean (tub and toilet were stained and the mirror and sink weren't super clean). I think the problem was that we booked last minute (the night before we checked in), so it may not have been enough time for Matt to really do a deep clean.  Besides the cleanliness it's an older building and there isn't much that Matt can do about it, but the carpet really needs to be replaced and the entire apartment could use a really good scrub, especially the bathroom.  Overall, I thought $199/nt + fees and taxes was too expensive for the apartment.   We had some problems with check-in, but Matt called an hour later to ensure we were able to check-in, which was really nice. 
28771	3226793	7.0	10.0	15076685	This was my second experience with AirBnB on my trip up the Western Coast of the United States via train. My stay with Ravendar was excellent, we corresponded between eMails and text and coordinated my arrival, which was several hours later than expected. Despite my final arrival time of 3am, Ravendar was there to open the door and let me in :-) The listing was accurate and there were no surprises. Underground Parking was an option for a reasonable fee, which I chose. The residence was on the fourth floor with both elevator and stair access. I found this location to be very convenient to everything I wanted to see. Only blocks away from the Space Needle/Science Center, Music Museum and more! I found myself away from the property most of the time but when I was there, it was pleasant and comfortable.
28772	3226793	7.0	10.0	17914111	"This was my first experience with Airbnb and overall was a good one! I was at a work event 45 minutes away and decided last minute to stay in Seattle for a night and explore. I reached out to Rav on a Wednesday and heard from him the next day that I could have the room for Saturday night. We made arrangements for me to let him know when I was on my way into Seattle, and he overall seemed very friendly and accommodating. 

On Saturday morning he texted me to let me know he had to go out of town unexpectedly but arranged to have a friend meet me with the keys. He was very apologetic that he would not be there to show me around, and his friend was very nice and helpful with information about the Seattle area. Rav came back Sunday afternoon and was nice enough to give me a ride back from Ballard, an area a bit outside of the main downtown. I didn't spend much time with him but he was very friendly and open and willing to share about Seattle and his life. As a female traveling alone I was a little wary about staying in an apartment with a stranger, but Rav is a genuinely nice and friendly person, and I would have been perfectly comfortable if he was at the apartment on Saturday night like planned! 

As for the apartment, it is in a very nice apartment complex on a nice quiet street right in the middle of Downtown, and the Space Needle really is just a couple blocks away! There are also some amazing restaurants within a five minute walk of the place. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bed must have been some sort of memory foam, as it was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on! The bathroom and the kitchen were a bit untidy, but not anything too bad, and as I was only there for sleeping, and was out and wandering around most of the day, it was just perfect. 

Overall would definitely stay here again on another trip to Seattle! "
28773	3226793	7.0	10.0	18823249	"The experience was wonderful and the host was really warm and respectful. Location is in a very safe neighborhood and there are a lot of nice restaurants, coffee shops, and other places to visit within walking distance. Space needle is within 5 min walking as well as many other Seattle landmarks. 
"
28774	3226793	7.0	10.0	20463911	"I had a great first Airbnb experience with Ravendar. He messaged me before I got in to confirm my arrival, met me downstairs of his place and helped with my bags. He led me straight to my room and showed me where everything I needed was. He even took me to this AMAZING Thai restaurant my first evening which was very nice of Ravendar. I did not expect that, but it was very welcoming and hospitable of him. 

The listing description is very accurate in the location, walk-ability, room size, apartment and amenities. The neighborhood was great with local shops and cafes nearby, VERY walk-able to everything. Even a bike rental spot two blocks down. Very clean and safe area. 

The apartment overall could use a good clean/scrub, but overall, I would stay there again in the future. "
28775	3226793	7.0	10.0	21493106	Ravi is a great host, very friendly and helpful. The apartment was comfortable. Private room and private bath. The apartment is small, no dining room table, so the space is tight. There's a fairly good gym within the building. And the location is fantastic - reasonable walking distance to Pike Place Market, and other locations. Great cafe on teh gound floor with good wifi. Easy access to good running trail on the water.
30448	8922554	6.0	10.0	56542581	This condo is gorgeous. The decor is modern and tasteful, very charming. And the Views??/ OH MY G - breath taking. Everything on my weekend plan was within walking distance. Pike Place Market is a minute or two away on foot.  Austin is very nice, super accommodating and responsive. He went above and beyond to make sure I checked in early. I can't wait to come back and enjoy Seattle in the Summer! 
32523	7965184	7.0	7.0	52654864	Great location!  charming place!  Thanks a lot!
32524	7965184	7.0	7.0	53388298	"The host was MIA and I was left without a place to stay at 5:30 pm on the night I was trying to check in. Not sure what happened but I would definitely not recommend booking this location. Buyer beware. 
"
32525	7965184	7.0	7.0	54285138	This was a great place and in a great location. It was easy to walk to Pike Place Market, around downtown for shopping, and to belltown for dinner and night life. The furniture was new and the place was very clean. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again. The only advise for the next travelers, is to bring all of your toiletries as there is only hand soap in the bathroom.  Just something to think about since you are not staying in a hotel. 
33244	7732071	4.0	10.0	46400504	Elena (the person who was coordinating with us) was wonderful. She must work 24 hours a day because she was so often available. This was one of their first times renting for airbnb and our experience with the actual place wasn't great. This location is best for those not traveling with a car and who want to explore all that Seattle has to offer. The location is amazing, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and the Symphony, one block from the light rail station, kitty corner from the art museum, etc. The place is great esp if you plant to spend most of your time out in the city. Note: There is no AC for the summer time and even with the fan provided it was very uncomfortable. 
36891	9151374	6.0	8.0	53543652	"TL;DR - This place has a ton of potential, but I can't recommend it due to the complete lack of responsiveness of the host (never once responded to any of our concerns in the 4 nights we stayed), the lack of WiFi when it was promised, the bath tub drain was clogged, and the total lack of basic essentials like toilet paper and hand soap.       


PROS: 
The location was great and the apartment was nice.       


CONS:
However, after dropping the keys, the host mentioned she didn't have the wifi password on her, and that she'd run to the office and message me later. She then left to let us settle in. We first noticed there was no hand soap or toilet paper in the bathroom. So I messaged her, and got no response. I messaged her later about the WiFi, which looked like the modem wasn't connected to the Comcast backbone, and never got a response. We ended up going to Target to stock up on TP and soap.       


The next morning, when we used the shower, the bath tub drain was almost completely clogged, and there was a residue on the bath tub floor. I texted the host again, and got no response.

42436	9075558	5.0	8.0	53153820	Accommodation was alright, bed was ok and location very close to downtown. Unfortunately host wasn't at home when we arrived so the room was dirty after last guest and bathroom as well. We had to change our bed linen to clean one (not really sure if it was clean). Benefits are location and price but overall impression is below the average.
42437	9075558	5.0	8.0	53313026	The room was dirty and it appeared the sheets had not been changed or cleaned. The rest of the house was also not cleaned recently. I only needed a place to crash for the night so was not expecting much. Mostafa was very responsive when contacted or called upon. I would not stay here again nor recommend anyone else to do so. 
42438	9075558	5.0	8.0	53667699	Mostafa was always quick to respond and was there to greet us upon arrival.  The home is new and looks appealing from the outside.  It's tucked away and behind some other town homes so you can't see it from the street.  We picked this place because of the price and literally just needed a place to stay for one night.  This is all I would recommend this place for, a place to sleep and that's all.  The home is shared with young adults (maybe mid 20's) and the upstairs (living and kitchen area) is very cluttered and messy.  The bedroom itself had furniture stacked all around and a bike hanging out.  This room was apparently also used for storage.  It was very plain and not very welcoming.  The bathroom was dirty and messy, no towels were provided to us either.  I looked for some but there was only 1 used one, no others were to be found. 
42439	9075558	5.0	8.0	54564940	Mostafa's home was affordable and conveniently located in a quiet place of town near easy and quick access into downtown. Other reviews have mentioned that the room was clean, but this is my second time staying there and I've not had an issue. I've personally seen mostafa changing the linens. There's a bit of temporary clutter in the room, but for the price, it's hard to beat. 
42440	9075558	5.0	8.0	54682263	The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures. The townhouse is very new and spacious. We didn't get to meet Mostafa because we were out and about but he was available and helpful through e-mail. His roommates were also very helpful. 
42441	9075558	5.0	8.0	55669232	"Mostafa was really helpful during my stay. He responded promptly to my emails and made the ""check in"" process very efficient. He even let me store my food in his fridge. The room was very nice and looked just like the pictures. Even though there are some chairs stacked on the side and the closet was quite full, the space was just enough for my one night stay. The only thing that would have made the stay better was a thicker warmer blanket. The room can be quite chilly in the winter time so be prepared!"
42458	716829	6.0	8.0	4304953	"Very unique and funky space!  The hanging bed is comfortable and fun, you can rock yourself to sleep each night.  The garden and eclectic art around the shack is great. Nice privacy out back, great for relaxing.  The only downside is that there is no plumbing, but there is a garden hose hooked up to an outdoor sink, so if you're able to survive ""camp style"" - you'll be just fine!  There is also water cooler and full refrigerator / freezer, so it was not a problem for me.  Lisa is a very kind host and Steinway is the friendliest dog around!    "
44500	613151	7.0	7.0	2032379	I rented the lowered floor apartment,  the day before arrival Keith told me I got the upper level apartment. It was much older, smellier, hotter, dirtier than the space below. I was very disappointed with the outcome. Although The owner was very nice and welcoming, he was always coming in and out of the place, which took away a lot of our privacy, especially late at night.  I would just recommend renting the lower apartment, unless you like dirty old grundgy rentals!
44501	613151	7.0	7.0	5697704	The place was exactly what we needed.  Plenty of places for us all to stay.  Getting in was very easy and the price was great.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  
44502	613151	7.0	7.0	6755667	Quite far from center but it's ok.
44503	613151	7.0	7.0	9075958	We enjoyed the wonderful house for three days. Thanks a lot to Prez & Cherie. We are so happy and will recommend this house to our friends. 
45967	8067053	6.0	9.0	46050760	We didn't meet him, but he organized everything. Can't complain. Nice house.
45968	8067053	6.0	9.0	46816543	I was looking for an affordable place in a close-in location with a comfy bed and I found it. The room was spacious, basic, and frills free. Bed was comfy. Location was residential but a quick drive downtown. I didn't meet Jared but he was nice over the phone and got me situated for check in. His dogs are lovely. 
45969	8067053	6.0	9.0	47069963	The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
46214	3593582	6.0	10.0	35566937	"Tony was very communicative and helpful and responded quickly to our questions. He let us check in a little early which was huge for us and we really appreciate it.  We were in town to see our Giants play the Mariners and Tony was very helpful letting us know how to get around.

The beds were very comfortable. The town home is in a fantastic location, close to downtown and very quiet.  We didn't get to meet Tony as he was out of town. 
No complaints just a heads up this unit has a lot of stairs so older or folks that have difficulty with stairs may want to select a different unit. 
We had no issues with them but thought it would be good to mention this.  Also it was obvious that there was a little dog that lived there. We and our friends have pets so was not a problem but again some folk may have allergies.  The home was clean and had a lived in feel.  We appreciate Tony opening his home to us and would recommend this unit to others.  Also parking was easy and close. We felt very safe in the neighborhood and again appreciated the close proximity to Downtown Seattle. A very good value."
47540	8754180	6.0	10.0	57304435	The hosts were easy to contact and were able to resolve issues quickly. The home was ok. It had a nice modern look to it.  The heater seemed to get way too hot upstairs. The downstairs was not insulated too well. The towels seemed dirty and had a bad smell. Besides this, everything was ok. The owners have a nice handbook with things to do in the area. 
47541	8754180	6.0	10.0	57776158	"We loved this Viewridge house.  It was spacious and open, giving us and grandkids plenty of room.  That was crucial.  As a family unit, it was great to have the playroom with toys and books.  We especially liked the master bedroom and the main bathroom.  The extra touches of fresh coffee beans and Pike Street Market tea, the organic scented hand soap and body lotion were very nice.  We used the kitchen so the plentiful cooking/eating dishes really helped.  Weather didn't permit us to enjoy the garden, but loved seeing the carrots still growing!

Both the owners and the house manager were super attentive.  They checked in with us and responded to a phone call question within minutes.  Thanks for all of that.  It was a great place to stay."
49229	4041868	7.0	6.0	26435469	The place was perfect for our group(5 guys) we go around and work everywhere and it's always nice to come back to comfortable beds. Also nice enough to deal with our ever changing schedules. Thanks again
49230	4041868	7.0	6.0	28330813	"I will preface this review by saying the communications I had with Kim and Alan were pleasant.  They were quick in their communications and accomodating.  As hosts, I think they were very good to deal with, however, the condition of the property was not what we expected from the pictures.

The pictures make the property look sparkling, but it definitely requires some TLC, especially the outside, front porch/door, etc.  Indoors the unit appears to be partially renovated, and partially in need of renovation.  

Saying that, I want to be fair in my review.  It was definitely liveable and comfortable inside, however, because it was an older property we did have to deal with a couple of bugs, spiders, etc.  Not a huge deal, but these are things I consider when looking at reviews which is why I include them.

There is a lot of space, the beds were comfortable, and the living room was well put together.  The place is about 20 minutes out of downtown.  We would take an uber car into downtown and without traffic were paying less than $15.  With traffic it would be about $20, not bad at all.

The neighborhood is described as an ""up and coming"" neighborhood which means there is a range of nice and rundown houses.  We felt safe but it still has a ways to go before it becomes as trendy as it's predicted to be."
49231	4041868	7.0	6.0	29341565	My crew had a great experience at this property. Great communication from the host and everything was as described. I would stay in the future.
49232	4041868	7.0	6.0	32962605	The location was very good for us, within walking distance of family.  The neighborhood is run-down, but we felt safe.  I agree with the other reviewer that the house needs some attention inside and out.   Email communications with the host were prompt.  
49233	4041868	7.0	6.0	35947973	The place was perfect for our group, and it's always nice to come back to comfortable beds. The place was accessible to all of Seattle attractions. The owner is easy to talk to. Thanks Kim.
49234	4041868	7.0	6.0	45065638	"Kim was very responsive and answered my messages promptly. The entrance door was a pin lock, and we were given the access code the day before we arrived. We didn't have to arrange a time to meet with the owners, and could check-in anytime during the day, which was very convenient. 

The home was located at a small street in a older neighborhood that has seen better times. We arrived in the evening, and it was a little difficult navigating through dark streets. However, during our stay, we didn't experience any issues with the neighbors.

The entrance to the driveway is pretty narrow and steep, so vehicles with lower ground clearance should proceed with caution. There were 2 parking spaces inside the garage and a large drive way that can fit 2 or 3 more cars, which was great because we had 3 cars.

The house was clean and tidy. Two rooms up stairs with 3 beds, and 1 bedroom downstairs with 2 more beds. It was a tidy but old home, and the home really shows its age. There were many little things here and there that needs to be fixed up. Two out of the three room's window/bug screen were missing, and the screens in the dinning area + washroom had holes in it. The dishwasher was not functioning, and there was yellow water pooling at the bottom. It was fine when we closed it, but it smelled pretty bad when we first opened it.

It was great value for the distance from downtown Seattle considering the general cost of the area. There was nothing that happened during our stay where we needed to contact Kim. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay."
49786	2856806	7.0	9.0	13158923	We had a wonderful experience at Nat's property. We loved the location and stunning views. This is definitely a place I would rent again. Highly recommend! 
49787	2856806	7.0	9.0	13625691	We had a lovely stay at Nat's place. It is a wonderful bright house with a nice view and Nat was very easy to communicate with and he replied fast. He made sure everything was ok for us. We stayed with 4 people - the bedroom upstairs has a great view and balcony. Good selection of nice music.
49788	2856806	7.0	9.0	21168830	"This is an incredible space! Perfectly placed in Columbia City...just minutes from a quaint little downtown area and very quick light rail ride to the heart of Seattle. The rail also stops in the stadium district, so it is a great place to stay of you are looking to take in a Mariners or Seahawks game. The house is perfectly appointed and very modern. 

Nat rocked. He was in immediate communication and made sure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend Nat's place to anyone looking for a great place to stay right on the outskirts of the awesome city of Seattle. The views are incredible. "
53024	8555304	6.0	10.0	54060094	I did feel welcome.  It was great to stay in her home.  They have a lovely and friendly dog was present and no concern at all.   The master was great with the bathroom in it.  They put out towels and toiletries.  There were a couple others staying there but we were all quiet and I never saw them.  Very peaceful.  Sadly I did get a parking ticket one night so be careful not to be too close to that fire hydrant in front.
53969	1764233	6.0	9.0	8936966	My stay with Melissa was fine, the cable TV did not work, but otherwise everything was functioning fine.  I would rate the place as tidy, but I wouldn't say it was super clean.  I did have an issue with locking my keys in my room and Melissa was helpful in getting the door open as soon as possible.  
53970	1764233	6.0	9.0	9599898	"Melissa was a very friendly, nice and helpful host. 
I liked her very much. If I didn't like something, she would be willing to work with me to help. "
53971	1764233	6.0	9.0	12742763	The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. Near by is big shopping centre (5 min walking). UW isn't far away either. The house is shared with six other people but there is not much contact between them. I found it very convenient that Melissa provided a bike to rent. WiFi was fast and stable, TV didn't work. All in all I felt comfortbale for a 2 week stay.
53972	1764233	6.0	9.0	17196702	"I stayed here for ~90 days while interning at a downtown tech company.

General comments: Almost exactly what you'll expect from the other reviews and pictures. My additions: The wifi was fast enough to stream HD movies. Mass transit to downtown isn't great on the weekends, but there's a bus stop 3 minutes away for an express bus (74) to downtown but only during rush hour, and a local bus (30) to U District with connections to downtown all the time. There are a lot of other buses a bit farther away, too. The U Village mall (5 minute walk away) has grocery stores, restaurants, Starbucks, etc, as does U District which is 25 minutes on foot or 10 minutes by bus. There aren't many late-night food options. Papa Johns (2 AM), McDonalds (24 hours), Safeway (1 AM) and Starbucks (2 AM) seemed to be the only places with locations open much past 10 PM.

Particular to this room: It's in a sort of half-basement (the window's at ground level), so it was 10-15 degrees cooler than the rest of the house and much of the city during the mid-summer heat wave. There's a bathroom just down the hall, and laundry facilities in the next room. There isn't really any good place to work in the room or the houses's public spaces (and, in fairness, the listing didn't claim there'd be any), so I just went to the U Village mall Starbucks when I needed to be productive. "
53973	1764233	6.0	9.0	17980137	Melissa came and greeted me shortly after my arrival. The room was exactly as pictured - the neighborhood was charming and quiet. It was a pleasant and very private space to stay in. 
53974	1764233	6.0	9.0	20741908	The location of this house is formidable. I wish I could have seen Melissa more often. The room is big and if you do not mind some humidity and thin walls, then you will be happy. 
53975	1764233	6.0	9.0	23781816	The place was as described, quiet and one to UW village. No issues.
53976	1764233	6.0	9.0	28034545	This was the first time I stayed in a private room so I wasn't sure what to expect. Though there were a number of other rooms in the house, it was surprisingly very quiet.  It was great to have onsite parking, because street parking was bumper to bumper.  Had company business nearby, so the location was perfect; easy to find and near to some great restaurants and bars. Would stay again if I needed to be in that area. 
53977	1764233	6.0	9.0	42666242	The neighborhood was very nice, close to the bike trail and cafe. My time there didn't start off so smoothly however. When I first reserved, Melissa wrote me back and suggested that I might prefer another room, one upstairs. I wrote and said that I would like that if it wasn't more expensive. She didn't reply. I assumed that meant I was still in the basement. I arrived almost two hours after the check-in time and the room in the basement was not ready. There was dirty linen on the bed and the carpet needed to be vacuumed, with some white stuff spilled all over it. There was a strong smell in the house, a smell like a bathroom that needed cleaning and old food. Because the basement room wasn't ready, I assumed that I was supposed to be upstairs so I went up and took possession of the room she had offered me in her email-- this room was ready.  I wrote her an email telling her what I had done. It was not a quiet night, as a man woke me at around 10:00 talking loudly on the phone outside my window. I had to get dressed and go outside to ask him to please be quiet. The next morning, I found three emails from Melissa, telling me that I was not supposed to be in that room and apologizing for being late to clean my room. She also told me that the man who had just left my room had taken the keys with him and I would not have my keys until the next day. I took the sheets I had slept in and swapped them with the sheets in the basement room, and repacked my clothes and toiletries and moved myself downstairs. I also went out and bought a fan, for white noise. So it was a difficult start to my stay. I also have to say that I did my showering at my daughter's apartment because I was uneasy with the lack of cleanliness in the basement bathroom (the upstairs bathroom was much cleaner). Also, people did do laundry  (right next to my room) after 9pm and the people next door were very fond of singing happy birthday at midnight (twice it happened!)-- but they also played some very nice flute in the early evening! That is all to be expected in a city, however, and I was happy to have my fan.
53978	1764233	6.0	9.0	43146247	Melissa was very helpful and responsive. The room was as described in a nice neighborhood of Seattle, right next to the university.
53979	1764233	6.0	9.0	45258888	The room was exactly as pictured, and very close to U village mall. The WIFI didn't work properly twice during my stay, and Melissa was very helpful in solving the problems. I will recommend it to those who are seeking a room with an inexpensive rent and a compatible quality. 
54593	7934356	7.0	8.0	43886788	"My teammate and I made a quick over night trip to Seattle for an outrigger canoe race on Lake Washington.  Fortunately, Jenny's pad was still available when I got around to looking.  The location was 5 minutes from the race site, up on a hill in a quiet neighborhood, and Jenny was quick to accept my request.
The daylight basement 2 bedroom apartment was quite larger than what we needed but we appreciated looking out into the garden and being able to look down over the city below.
The apartment had just been finished the day we arrived and Jenny hadn't had time to stock it with pots and pans but she had put in the basics. Jenny asked if we needed some pots or pans because she said she would get them. I said I would just use the microwave but then realized that there wasn't one so I said a pot would work fine but when we returned from our outing Jenny had brought us a microwave for my breakfast.
As you can see, Jenny is a great host and the large apartment was great.
Thanks, Jenny!

Travis"
54594	7934356	7.0	8.0	44385369	Jenny is very kind and helpful. She wait us until 8pm in the first day. We had a happy holiday in her place.
54595	7934356	7.0	8.0	45009467	Host was welcoming. The accommodations were simple. The location was great
54686	4892529	7.0	9.0	38013293	Grace was very responsive with my inquires and requests. The layout was perfect for our group as we were starting a bike race in the morning and having easy access to the garage was ideal. Neighborhood was quite, but easy to walk a few blocks to get food or shop at Wholefoods
54687	4892529	7.0	9.0	39070477	"The neighbourhood was very nice but that is honestly all I can say about my experience. My friends and I (7 of us in total) stayed here for a total of two nights. We checked in late on the first night and were horrified to find spiderwebs and spiders in over 8 corners of the basement suite. We immediately contacted Grace via text to address our concerns - my girlfriend especially has a phobia of spiders and was freaking out during our entire stay there. Given that it was close to midnight there was not much that Grace could do which was understandable. However we mentioned that we would like to check out immediately the next day and she acknowledged that via text.

The next morning we immediately contacted Grace to see if we could get a refund for the second night. It was not a cheap stay as we had paid close to $800 for the two nights. It took us while to reach her (she may have been at work) but her son finally called us back. We addressed our concerns but he insisted that he had cleaned the place and didn't believe what we had said. He would not discuss a refund unless we had evidence to show him. I thought that was extremely outrageous given that we had to get rid of all the spiders in the living quarter ourselves. It was a very uncomfortable stay as is and we were very offended to be questioned about our claims. After a while Grace came by personally and we showed her some of the remaining spiderwebs left behind. She acknowledged the situation but did not stay to properly address our concerns because her mother was waiting in the car (granted she was a senior and it was an extremely hot day). We tried to negotiate a refund with her (Airbnb's policy is 50%) for the single day but all she offered was $100, which felt like a huge slap in the face given the uncomfortable situation that we had to stay in. It really didn't make sense for us financially at that point so we had to swallow our pride and finish our stay. 

All in all, it honestly was one of the most disappointing Airbnb experiences that I have ever had. The posting shows 1,650sf and the  entire basement was nowhere close to that size (even counting for the garage). Two of the pictures posted were clearly not from the basement because they were not there (fireplace, dining table with a window). If you can show me where they are located in the basement I will rescind this entire review. The pillows were stained yellow with no covers and none of the bed sheets resembled anything as seen in the posting.  We PAID $800 for this place and we honestly feel very cheated from this experience. Not trying to bash on Grace but this is how all 7 of us felt..."
54688	4892529	7.0	9.0	40107693	Good neighbourhood some tea left 
54952	7245586	4.0	9.0	42340312	The stay was good even if the host seem quite new on Airbnb. Some routines like how to check out could be good and also there is a need for shaping up the place, some cleaning could be good, especially the shower. On the other hand the host really tried to make it a good stay for us, the location is good in a nice neighbor and the prices is really good if you compare similar locations. Also the separate entre is really nice! The place really have potential! 
54953	7245586	4.0	9.0	48540689	I stayed at this location for a month. I never met Tania but I did meet her father twice. They rent out all the rooms in the house. There were only a couple of people there when I was there. I stayed in a basement room. There was a bathroom on the same floor but the kitchen was upstairs. There was a minifridge by the room. The basement has a private side entrance that they recently added a keycode deadbolt in. The door to the room itself wasn't that great, it didn't feel very secure but I had the only key and nothing was taken. The neighborhood is nice, it was a short bus ride away from the university and hospital so it was what I needed. The room itself was unremarkable, it is as pictured with a full size bed. The room had a peculiar odor that reminded me of cat litter and felt damp at times. I asked for air freshener and was told to buy some at the local store. My stay had ups and downs and I can't say that I would do it again given the choice. The bathroom shower was short and cramped and the smell was off putting. However given the location it suited my needs. 
55700	4340410	7.0	8.0	21930725	Andrew's place was very clean, and welcoming! It was very comfortable  and we felt right at home! The condo is located in a great neighborhood with great restaurants within walking distance, and was a very short distance from downtown Seattle. Also, there is a lot of public transportation nearby and a bike rental right across the street. We would definitely recommend it and stay again!
55701	4340410	7.0	8.0	40759191	The location was great for where I needed to be. It was easy to get to with a lot of street parking. Andrew was also super accommodating since we arrived really early that day and he let us check in early. He also checked in with me a lot to make sure we had everything we needed. Great host!
55702	4340410	7.0	8.0	40931176	Location is directly below major freeway #5.  No air conditioning, and suite was 86 degrees when we arrived.  Opened the window to cool it down but had to shout at each other with the window open due to freeway noise.  There is a tower fan provided.  One towel and one facecloth was provided for my wife and I.  The shower curtain is extremely dirty at the bottom from.  There appears to be a dog that resides in the residence as there was hair found on night stand and dog food present.  I should have inquired about this more carefully with my (website hidden) is being acquired off of Amazon, i think, and channel reception was so very poor we could not watch any.  This was our first time having experienced coming into someone's home where they typically live every day and simply moved out for the night to allow us to stay there.  We will be more selective in the future.
55703	4340410	7.0	8.0	48970120	"Location is great for us (2 adults and 1 child), it's right outside downtown, roughly about 3.5 miles, so we avoid all the traffic but close enough to get in and out of the city. Place is located just north of downtown. 

The living area is nice and cozy. It is located under a freeway though. You can hear it in the living room but it's pretty silent in the bedroom. If you plan on sleeping in the living room couch and a light sleeper this won't be the ideal place for you. Bedroom is nice and quiet. I slept well throughout my stay. 

Everything was described in full detail and exact to the tee so there's no confusion at all. There were some minor issues with the sink but we were notified before hand and didn't effect us at all. Our overall experience was great and will book again if we come back to the Seattle area. Great communication before and throughout our stay. "
55704	4340410	7.0	8.0	57933328	"The place was neat and comfortable. The place smelled musty, like sweaty feet when we walked in. We opened the window in the living room but it was so loud from the traffic since the place is right under the 15 freeway. Was hard to hear one another. The fridge was dirty. The bathroom shower is very little and small flow.  Parking was on the street under the freeway because the host had his car parked in the space in the parking garage. Our car was safe. But there is a homeless camp right there. 

The location was great and convenient. We had a late lunch at the cafe across the street when we first arrived and watched the Seahawks game. We are runners, so we ran from the place to nearby parks and trails. That was nice. The description also says right on the Lake, it's not. It's across the street with businesses and residential in between. No view of the lake from the place. "
56482	9519968	7.0	8.0	56761097	"Do NOT rent this house if you are not the cleanest person of all the people you know. The host will ask you for extra money to clean the house. We are fairly clean people but still had issue. The host was not there when we arrived and was not there when we left. Never showed up. However, after we left, he sent messages to accuse us for damage and dirtiness which he did not see them himself but only heard from the cleaner who can barely write English (the host forwarded the email to us). The email was very hard to understand because the whole email was a bunch of words paled together and barely make any sense. The host accused us with this email as evidence.  Lol
The host denied that the bed has smell but it really does, to a point that I do not want to shower before I sleep in it because I feel it would waste the water that I use to shower. Also, the carpets do not look clean but since the host was not there and we could not point it out, and he used it to accuse us.
The host is also very mean. He said he regret rent his place to someone who does not have review, guess what, it is our first time trying airbnb. If you are new, do not rent this place because the host will have excuse to ask for extra money. Even if you do not care money like us, it may ruin your mood. We gave the host $80 as he wanted it desperately but it ruin our experience with airbnb and we decide not to use airbnb anymore."

57252	2357110	7.0	9.0	41675373	Andrew is very welcoming and helpful.. his place was very clean and location is quite good. Lot of eating options right on the same street.. I would recommend his place to others
57253	2357110	7.0	9.0	48855148	Andrew let me make a last minute reservation, as I was headed into town.  I had the place to myself, which was great.  He made sure I had everything I needed for my stay and quickly answered any questions I had.  The neighborhood was great, with many food and drink places within walking distance.  
58595	6865200	7.0	9.0	46413898	"Aaron was very through in providing information about his apartment well in advance of our arrival. He checked in with us a couple days before to welcome us to Seattle and make sure everything was good to go. During our stay he responded to questions in a timely manner. 
The apartment was clean and was located in the super cute and hot Capitol Hill area. Great restaurants and drinks were only a couple blocks away. 
The one gripe is that the floors are creaky and we could hear the neighbors walking around and even hear their cell phone vibrating. If I brought ear plugs I would of slept a little better. "
58596	6865200	7.0	9.0	46909242	My girlfriend and I had a great experience staying at Aaron's place in Seattle.  First off, his place is in an excellent location.  It is close to downtown, and the neighborhood offers many great restaurants and places to go out.  We did not need to use a car during our weekend visit, and everything we wanted to see was easy to get to.  We ended up renting bikes to use for the weeking (company= peddle anywhere) and that worked out extremely well.  Aaron's place has character and he keeps it relatively clean.  It was a very comfortable home base.  We had plenty of space for all of our stuff, and he had everything laid out for us, and we were welcome to use any household items if we wished- it truly was like visiting a friend in the city.  He provided information and suggestions about the city, fresh towels and linens, washer detergent and dryer sheets... all the details which make staying somewhere enjoyable.  His directions for arrival, stay and departure were clear and easy to follow.  He was easy to contact (I spoke with before visitng and during my stay).  When considering location, price and the integrity/vibe of the host, I would say that I was more than satsified with my stay in Seattle and would definitely recommend staying here.
58597	6865200	7.0	9.0	47704481	Aaron's place was very neatly out together and in a convenient location in Cap Hill. Checking in and out were both very easy with the directions provided. While Aaron's place was organized and everything was put away it was still not the cleanest place, particularly the bathroom. Hopefully this will be given extra attention the next time it's used for Airbnb!
58598	6865200	7.0	9.0	47988583	It was a nice apartment in a great area of Seattle. Very walkable neighborhood. Host was very fast at responding, and was friendly. Apartment was tidy but could have been a bit cleaner. Overall, I would stay again. Good value. 
58599	6865200	7.0	9.0	48198415	"I could not stay here. The building (which is an enclosed apartment building) reeks of mildew/mold and other cat-like odors. This is most likely due to the heavily (can't emphasize enough) stained carpet in all of the hallways and stairwells. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I walked in. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and went up to the apartment but the smell was still too strong. I am allergic to mold/mildew and it was making very difficult to breathe. I understand that this is not the host's fault, necessarily, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that the building was pretty dank (not just ""old""). However, even if I had stayed and not had to pay $250 /night to stay in a hotel instead, I still would not have been very comfortable staying here. While it was tidy, it was not very clean. The bathtub had smudges that I was not prepared to risk bathing in and there was a noticeable amount of hair on the bathroom sink. I didn't spend more than five minutes in the home so I can't give more details than that. I have not been offered a refund either. "
59357	1520593	6.0	10.0	7702141	"This is a very clean and enjoyable stay. Just a minute away from public transportation and local eateries. 

This house allows for an effortless and self-sufficient check-in process and any questions/answers are just a text away with their house captain.

Would stay again. Thank you Io House."
59358	1520593	6.0	10.0	8359073	"The house is set-up for medium-length stays by nerds working on projects or with local incubators: if this is you, it'll work great, as it's close to the tech companies and the house is full of nerds :-)

I was a tourist, and for me the location is absolutely great -- there's great food and nightlife in Capitol Hill, and downtown was a 30-minute downhill stroll (I caught cabs back!). 

One caveat: if you're particularly picky about cleanliness, keep in mind that this is a house where several 20-something straight males share a kitchen and a bathroom."
59359	1520593	6.0	10.0	8929719	Great house with great people. Everyone was very friendly and there were more than enough spots to do some coding. The only downside of the house was its cleanness, which was not really good.
59360	1520593	6.0	10.0	18228902	"For the first 2 months I was there, there weren't any cleaning people like the listing said... so the place was really dirty. It was a warmer summer than usual and the kitchen had a constant SWARM of fruit flies, making it pretty much unusable. Finally the fruit flies got so bad that they finally got a cleaning lady to come once a week, which helped. There was nothing in the backyard (no benches or table like the photo) so that made it hard to enjoy. And there were barely ever any ""demo nights"" or anything like that. So the listing was inaccurate in many ways when I saw it.

I liked the other people that lived there. I liked Matt, the house manager. The location is AMAZING. But for the price I paid, it was barely worth it. It's probably a lot better in the fall/winter. I would try to find somewhere else in the summer. "
59361	1520593	6.0	10.0	25128288	"Was welcomed with a tour of the house on arrival. My Room was quite nice with a wardrobe, comfy bed, shelves and bedside table. 

The house is kept quite clean. The house facilities are all very useable with a large dryer + washing machine and a reasonable kitchen (however I ate most nights). The internet is of a very high quality. Occasionally would drop out but only for a couple of seconds.

There is plenty of desk space available to work at. 

I had very little contact with other house guests for the most part but they all seem nice. They didn't make much noise so it's a good environment to work in."
59362	1520593	6.0	10.0	28953042	"Pros:
The house captain, Aaron, was very nice and welcoming. The location was excellent – very close to everything I could've needed. High-speed Internet was decent. The house was reasonably clean and the bed was surprisingly comfortable.

Cons:
The house is ancient. The floor was SO squeaky, I felt guilty for (I can only assume) waking everyone up just to get out of bed to use the bathroom. It was mentioned to me that the house is being leased, so they can't make changes, however, the electrical seemed questionable; I was instructed which breaker switches to turn back on in the basement in case the circuit got overloaded. And for the price, a pull-string closet light was a bit ridiculous. Also, no locks on bedroom doors, so nowhere to securely store valuables."
59363	1520593	6.0	10.0	41718102	I had an amazing time staying in the IO House for 3 months. The location is great, just a block away from Broadway with tons of coffee shops, thrift stores, and a 24-hour grocery store. Even though there are lots of people in the house, I found it to always be very quiet at night and in the morning. All of my housemates were interesting and friendly, and I spending time with them quickly became my favourite thing to do in my free time. I can't wait to go back.
59364	1520593	6.0	10.0	42442687	This place is the best. Andrew gave all of the info I needed and everyone was incredibly friendly. The whole experience was a blast and I recommend anyone traveling through the area who wants to stay with like minded hackers to sign up for this one.
59365	1520593	6.0	10.0	42756536	The host was nice. He understood why we could not stay at his place. It is just not an enviroent suitable for females. 
59366	1520593	6.0	10.0	45678666	The Io House has a great location, in the heart of trendy capitol hill great food/drinks and volunteer park. The other people living in the house were very friendly and nice. While I was there professional cleaning services came and did a thorough and much needed job of cleaning the kitchen, bathrooms and living area. The room I was in, which was the larger private one on the second floor, was completely bare bones and quite frankly depressing in appearance, a bed, a rickety tiny desk and a folding chair. Overall, I would say my experience was positive.

60712	4701205	7.0	10.0	26568042	Brent's a nice guy and his place is as advertised. Just a futon in his living room but if you're looking to save a buck Brent is a nice guy and really helped me out when I stayed with him. Thanks Brent
60713	4701205	7.0	10.0	26803228	Brent was a great host. Very chill and willing to help anyway he could. 
60714	4701205	7.0	10.0	26853454	Brent was very nice and helpful. The sleeping space was as described. Thanks for accommodating me!
60715	4701205	7.0	10.0	27024547	Brent is an awesome host. He shows you all the insider tips for eating, clubbing and must-see's if you ask him. The couch is exactly as shown at the pictures. It's not the biggest comfort, but if you need a cheap place near downtown then go and visit Brent!
60716	4701205	7.0	10.0	27360681	Brent took good care of me and even took me to get some excellent Malaysian food right across the street- chill guy and I definitely recommend his place. 
60717	4701205	7.0	10.0	27508907	The bathroom was dirty and the pillows and sleeping bags that were provided were also dirty. Room spelled like spam and pot. 
60718	4701205	7.0	10.0	27550142	Brent was a wonderful host. He went beyond what I expected by showing me a great place to eat and the nightlife in Capitol Hill. It was just like staying with a friend. He was also flexible with check in/check out time which I greatly appreciated. Communication was easy via text. Futon was as described. Location was excellent for checking out the hip neighborhood. Thank you Brent!
60719	4701205	7.0	10.0	27743384	Brent was an awesome host. He showed me around town, showed me how he makes music and we talked about a lot of things. This place is definitely more than a Crashing Pad.
60720	4701205	7.0	10.0	28192446	"It was fine.
"
60721	4701205	7.0	10.0	28218668	Brent's place was as expected - small inner city studio. Ideal and economical option if you are just looking for a place to crash on a short trip to Seattle and to only be there for sleeping, but not a place you want to go to for relaxing or cooking etc. The couch is probably a little small for two people, so wouldn't recommend it for stays more than a night. Easy access to the city with just one bus, which was a nice bonus.
60722	4701205	7.0	10.0	28481804	My experience with Brent was good. He is nice and the hospitality was great. Small place and futon was comfortable. I would book again 
60723	4701205	7.0	10.0	28635546	Top stay! Easy BNB especially if laying over or wanting to explore a more casual, less touristic side of town. Great food - Brent was kind enough to show me a bit of the neighbourhood on th first night and had a delcicious meal. Would happily stay again!
60724	4701205	7.0	10.0	28711477	Great host, and good location.
60725	4701205	7.0	10.0	29029488	Brent was great - super welcoming!  The area of town was fantastic and the price was exactly what we needed.  The house was more like a bachelor pad, and so when we just needed a place to crash for the night it was perfect for us.  =)
60726	4701205	7.0	10.0	29177567	Brent was a great host; showed me around Capitol Hill, and informed me of the other great spots to check out in Seattle. 
60727	4701205	7.0	10.0	29645914	Brent was helpful and friedly, He was  always available and ready to talk. The space is small but consistent with its price. A good solution for hosting near downtown. I recommend it.

 For the price you get a place to lay down + clean sheets and a clean towel. It's a great value for the neighborhood! Highly reccomended for people who need a place to crash."

60731	4701205	7.0	10.0	31083949	I am very satisfied with my stay at Brent's place. He is super cool and down to earth, if you need a place to crash that is inexpensive and close to downtown Seattle this is your place. If your more high maintenance maybe no. Thanks for being a great host Brent! 
60732	4701205	7.0	10.0	32095091	It was a bachelor, Spartan experience but no real surprises. Great location. Brent is friendly and easy going. No issues with noise, although I sleep with earplugs. 
60733	4701205	7.0	10.0	32219303	Brent is very friendly and down to earth person. The place is quite convenient, very close to the downtown, Pike Place market, and espresso vivace. If you just need a place to stay and sleep, don't miss it!

60742	4701205	7.0	10.0	35422880	Brent was a great host. Made me feel welcome and checked to see if there's anything I needed. Awesome location as well. I recommend this place for sure
60743	4701205	7.0	10.0	36232365	Brent is very nice, honnest, and particularly intéressant.  I have enjoyed my self à his place. Moreover thé location is perfect,  many restaurants, bars, safe and near downtown. It was gréât.

60745	4701205	7.0	10.0	44745846	I was so happy last night when Brent accepted a request for a bed when our Amtrak train journey was cancelled due to fires. Brent is a very nice and easygoing person with a good sense of helping and being of service to folks. We found his place off the 49 bus, though I am sure there are other buses that go closely. We ended up getting our quota of sleep and hopefully the rest of the journey will proceed as planned. I will keep Brent on my contact list for future benefits.
61464	4082250	6.0	9.0	20459925	In capitol hill, it can be hard to find a quiet place to rest after a day of work or play, but this place managed to be incredibly walkable, yet still peaceful.  Thank you for a relaxing long weekend! Lovely!
61465	4082250	6.0	9.0	38454157	Good location - Capital Hill is a great area.  Apartment was not as clean as we are comfortable with - we appreciate that the host split the cost with us to get the place cleaned while we were there.
61466	4082250	6.0	9.0	39209838	Wesley's place is in a great location on the hill and close to downtown. Communication was easy and he arranged to have his friend meet me at the apartment and let me in. I feel like the towels and bed linen quality could be improved but overall I had a great stay. 
61467	5637990	6.0	7.0	46003248	The house was great. We weren't able to meet April but that was because we arrived very late in the night. The house has a coded lock so no key was needed. The location of the house was perfect for our Labor Day weekend vacation. It was a quick drive to Seattle center and pikes place market. The only bothersome thing I can think of that might turn a person away from this great home was the long flight of stairs you need to walk up to get to the home. We didn't mind it much. But I can see how some might have some trouble. 
61468	5637990	6.0	7.0	54822076	"I stayed in April house with my daughter and her 2 friends are a trip to explore Universities in the Pacific Northwest.  The house was in the perfect location and the view was fantastic.  The girls loved having the entire downstairs and I enjoyed the guest bedroom.  The house was warm and cozy and felt like home to us for 2 days.  It was a little bit difficult to find the staircase originally, but it only took once.  Thank you for such a great stay and for getting back to us so quickly about where the closest store was and anything else that we inquired about.  We would absolutely stay there again.

61469	5637990	6.0	7.0	55398072	"Minimum Hospitality standards were not met. There was no welcoming material or information other then a text stating that the sheets were changed and where we could find clean towels.
Neither the kitchen or bathroom trash had been emptied. The dishwasher had dirty dishes in it and used coffee grinds were left in the coffee maker. The kitchen counters and stove top were stained and dirty as were the counter tops in both bathrooms. Personal toilet articles (toothbrushes, make up, used soap, shampoo and conditioner) were left out on the bathroom counters and in the showers. The dining 
room table still had crumbs on it and we had to clean the living room sofa table with windex in order to even utilize the that room.

It appears that little or no effort was made to clean or otherwise make the residence hospitable for guests, especially paying guests. These conditions made for a most uncomfortable stay.  "

We got in pretty late and he was super accommodating and easy to get in touch with. If you get in before the light rail shuts down for the evening I would recommend taking the light rail to the Westlake station from the airport, $3.00 one way (the station is 0.5miles from the apartment) compared to a $30.00 uber drive!

Staying at the Hacker House was perfect for my 3-month stay while in Seattle for projects, giving me a great opportunity to meet some new people who shared similar interests as well as experience all that Capitol Hill has to offer.
The place was clean and well-managed, and even with 5-7 other people staying there, was surprisingly private.
I had a really good time, would absolutely stay there again and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for short-term housing."
63659	1520581	7.0	10.0	9809051	Another great (email hidden) House. Good meeting everyone and hanging out—though it was just short-lived this time. Would recommend staying for both a few days or a few months.

First of all, Chase responded all messages on time and seemed opened to arrange details to make the hosting work and was sort of flexible with checking in and checking out times. However, the apartment it is not a place I would ever go again.
I was supposed to meet Chase at his work to get the keys on the arrival day, he did not show up at the time we were supposed to meet.  I spoke to his coworker who offered to help, fortunately he got in touch with him because he was not answering my messages and turned out that he was not there. Then, Chase sent a friend who arrived 30 minutes later to bring the keys. Finally, we were taken to the place and the friend told us that they were not expecting us to arrive that day, that they confused the dates.
Once we got to the place, the apartment was dirty and dusty. That  living room floor and washroom floor really need to be cleaned. There was just a couple dirty blankets with weird stains on the bed and there was not even a complete bed sheet set. It was definitely not a bed I felt comfortable sleeping in. I was told that there was going to be an air mattress as well, but we could not find the pump to inflate it and it was kind of dusty. In the washroom, there was not hot water for taking a shower and the floor mat was gross. In addition, the garbage bins in the apartment were half full.
Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience in this apartment, the location was good though. You can go everywhere walking from that place but the fact that the host did not get the dates right, he did not showed up on time to bring the keys, and how dirty the apartment was, made the overall experience not good. We stayed there for a single night and we could not wait to leave next day. It is not a place a would come back or recommend."
63913	8050232	5.0	9.0	47218965	Chase was attentive and helpful, coordinating a time and location to exchange keys, even when I moved out earlier than I originally communicated. The apartment itself is pretty minimal but in a great location for a decent price. I booked last minute and only really needed a place to store my things and rest my head so all in all it worked out great. Thanks!
63914	8050232	5.0	9.0	47420230	"This is an okay place to stay if you just want somewhere to crash for a night, but I don't think it's worth the money you're paying. The bed is comfortable, it's in a really fun area, and it seems like a safe building. However, the bathroom is pretty dusty and there was a lot of trash left in the trash can. These are things I can deal with if I'm crashing with someone who is doing me a favor and I'm staying for free. But I think part of paying money for a space is that these aspects are comfortable as well, so this was a little disappointing. 
That said, Chase was very accommodating about check-in and check-out, and the sheets were laundered (and he mentioned that he was doing the same for the person staying after I left). So if you just need a bed to rest your head while you're out and about, this is the cheapest place available, and you're not picky about overall cleanliness, it's totally workable. "
63915	8050232	5.0	9.0	48207630	This place is perfect for a young person / young couple not looking to spend too much dough. You get what you pay for and there's a reason that this place is priced considerably lower than other properties in the area. It could use a solid cleaning but overall it's a decent space in a great part of town. Chase was very accommodating for me in regards to coordinating the key pick up and drop off (I got into Seattle at 11pm and left a few days later at 5am). I would definitely stay here again but this isn't the kind of place to put your parents if they're coming to visit you for a couple days.
63916	8050232	5.0	9.0	48753046	Meet up/departure was very smooth and painless. Great location to explore the city. Little market across the street for food and snacks. Lots of places to eat out. 
63917	8050232	5.0	9.0	49477435	Chase was friendly and accommodating. The apartment is bare bones and could use a good scrub but it is very centrally located and is priced very affordably for the area. 
63918	8050232	5.0	9.0	49822317	The apartment was great, and exactly as advertised. It's a small space but ideally located to get into both downtown & capital hill. I wouldn't say this is the spot for someone looking for the height of luxury, but it was exactly what I needed. There are some great local bars & restaurants, with good hiking spots less than an hours drive away. Check in & out was made very flexible, allowing me to make the most of the time I had. Thanks Chase!
63919	8050232	5.0	9.0	50206709	"Chase is a very hands off host. I'm not one of those AirBnb-ers that like room service, meals, over hospitable people 'checking in' etc... So in that respect Chase was awesome. He was also very patient with me as I was two or three hours behind my eta. I got lost (first time to Seattle and that airport is really not user friendly). I also fudged my Uber and it took me to a different part of town. I was there doing some apartment hunting and he gave me some good advice regarding where to find cheap rent in the city.

 I disagree with the other reviewers about how dirty the place was. I think a more accurate description would be 'lived in'. Although, that shower rug needs to take a trip to the washing machine (I lay a towel over it). You truly cannot beat the price for the location. Highly recommend walking around the corner to pike grocery and getting a delicious sandwich (the bird and the Cajun were my favorites) Hawaiian BBQ kettle chips, and a beer yuuum. 

Despite being advertised, there was no TV in the apartment. Not a complaint, just an observation. I had my laptop to keep me company. Wifi worked. Stove took really long to heat up. Safe building. Bed was comfortable.  

The only thing that really annoyed me was there was no back stock of toilet tissue or paper towel. All I had was less then half a roll for my stay. Other than that I dug it and will recommend it to friends."
63920	8050232	5.0	9.0	51637102	Chase was very accommodating regarding check in/out times. As mentioned in other comments, place could be cleaner. A little street noise at night. 
63921	8050232	5.0	9.0	52345903	Best location and price out there.  Cleanliness of the apartment is not in keeping with airbnb standards. Chase was prompt in meeting me upon arrival and pleasant to deal with, however he did not show up after arranging to meet me for my early departure and key return.  He was not reachable by phone or text that morning.  Parking is possible at this location but it is a little bit of a hassle.  If you plan on walking, using public transport or Uber , I can't stress enough how great a location this is.
64806	7975026	6.0	10.0	44084791	We had a last minute booking. Henry was very kind, accommodating, and communicated quickly. He even left us beer in the frig. The apartment was as described. The door lock was a little tough but doable.  The bed was comfortable, TV worked good with Netflix. We did not prepare food there so can't speak to those ammenities. The location was great as we were able to walk most everywhere (the walk to Pike Place was long but still better than driving). Even though there was some street noise, it was remarkably quiet for its location and settled down around 9:30 pm. We slept great!
65371	1520533	7.0	10.0	7448727	Nice house and nice community.
65372	1520533	7.0	10.0	7781334	Despite a few issues related to the age of the house, I had a great stay here. It was nice being in a place with other techies. The walk to and from South Lake Union takes about a half hour. You'll get a nice hill-climb on the way back, but it's not too tough.
65373	1520533	7.0	10.0	9099540	I had a fantastic time at the Hacker House during my two month stay. The people there were all very friendly and were from a variety of interesting backgrounds (Programmers, entrepreneurs, engineers, and even a graduate molecular biology student). The house was very clean and is already furnished and stocked. Andy has done an excellent job with the house and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay. 
65374	1520533	7.0	10.0	9416029	"The house is close to everything, The kind of people who stay in the house in general are entrepeneur, developers, etc... It's a great place to improve your network, also Matthew is a great host, he makes everything he can to make you few confortable. 
"
65375	1520533	7.0	10.0	21070446	I was supposed to live in the Cap Hill one, but ended staying in the Cor36 one. The view is amazing, right front of the Lake Union, and the house is pretty equipped. Aaron's doing great as a House Captain greeting newcomers and address our concerns. I met lots of nice people, and had great time chatting with them or sharing different stories. I really appreciate their companion. My journey in Seattle wouldn't be complete without them.
65376	1520533	7.0	10.0	23918445	Great experience! Thanks!
65377	1520533	7.0	10.0	28643868	A nice hostel, room to work on projects and the people were nice. Close to most things in Seattle and overall a good experience
65378	1520533	7.0	10.0	29076040	Convenient location with great nooks and cozy places to study. It was a pleasure to walk over Lakeview via Eastlake on my way to South LAke Union. I was not expecting a towel or linens, but both were given as well as a laundered comforter! The kitchen was clean and the rules of the house were all followed. Aaron, the house grounds manager was kind, available, and amicable. 
65379	1520533	7.0	10.0	43028933	"I (email hidden) House during the summer while I was in Seattle for an internship. It was a great experience. 

Everyone living there is great. The house was tidy and would be professionally cleaned regularly. 

The location could not be better both for the night life as well as amenities. It's also close to a lot of bus routes."
65380	1520533	7.0	10.0	51493343	Io House is a nice and affordable place to stay in Seattle. The location is very convenient and it is in the heart of Capitol Hill market. Almost everything you will need  (food, groceries, public transport etc.) is 5 min. walk from the house. It is a old house and can use some renovation, but still for the location and price it is pretty good.
66451	30712	7.0	9.0	56218	Lovely flat.  Neat, tidy, authentic. Public transportation nearby, but not close (7-8 blocks). Good, quiet neighborhood, great farmer's market. Sadly, the independent bookstore Epilogue is no more. If you are a independent traveler and can share a kitchen, you will enjoy your stay here. Thanks Al for sharing that yummy Pinot Gris and for the special deal.
66452	30712	7.0	9.0	64680	"Al is a very trusting and down to earth individual - proved when he handed the keys over to me and my colleague to essentially ""house sit"" while he and his daughter headed out of town to the Oregon Country Fair.  This generosity seems hard to come by this day and age, so it came as a breath of fresh air.  

However, if you are an individual who is used to a very clean living space - like myself - Al's home may not be the one for you. 

The hardwood floors appeared to have gone unswept for quite sometime
The bathroom sink did not drain (or drained extremely slow) - which he warned me of
The sofa had an unpleasant smell - which made sleeping difficult

My opinion of the stay, however, may be different than others.  I am constantly traveling for work and look forward to a clean, comfortable night away from hotels when I utilize airbnb, which has happened in past stays.  

Overall, the neighborhood is nice, Al, and his daughter, are very welcoming and Seattle is always great.  It comes down to what you are looking for individually.  "
66453	30712	7.0	9.0	74465	"Al’s place will definitely feel like home.  A comfortable bed, full access to the kitchen and living room,  he even cleaned out a space for me in his garage for my motorcycle .  Al is often away on business and when he is in town he stays in the downstairs apartment so often a guest feels as if he has rented an entire apartment and not simply a room. Al is also happy to help a guest out with advice on Seattle as well as just sit around and talk if you are in the mood (when you can catch him between running around on business).

For those of you who dont know Seattle, Balard is one of the best locations in Seattle. Outside of the few tourist attractions, downtown  Seattle is not a very attractive  or interesting place to be, especially on weekends when alot of it closes up. Ballard has easy parking near Al’s, you can walk to the Ballard farmer’s market on Sunday. Movie theatre and great restaurants all withing walking distance from the place. Access to downtown  is just a short drive or bus ride away.
"
66454	30712	7.0	9.0	124469	Al made me feel welcome and comfortable in his home.  He recommended great restaurants within walking distance.  The house has an artsy warm atmosphere with good books and tasteful art.  
66455	30712	7.0	9.0	289054	My girlfriend and I had a nice stay at Al's apartment.  I was a little concerned since the night before we arrived, he told me that a longer-term tenant had just moved out, and he wasn't sure if he could dig the bedding out of storage in time for us.  But we were just driving up from Portland, so he agreed to give us a partial refund if we brought our own bedding.  I appreciated his flexibility, and it all worked out just fine.  We were pleasantly surprised that he gave us a nice organic fruit assortment when we arrived; he was very welcoming.  If you are looking for a sparkling-clean place with a newer kitchen and bath, you may be disappointed.  I know many would be turned off by things like the missing bathroom door knob, grease-stained kitchen ceiling,   and a cobweb or two.  But the bed was decent, and overall, we found it to be quiet, tidy, and cozy.
66456	30712	7.0	9.0	301342	"I'm glad I was able to find a place.  Thank you Al, for calling me once I got to Seattle and being the ""extra"" mapquest.

The property is actually a house.  I couldn't figure out how to make the TV or radio work, but it didn't matter.  I only used the place to sleep.

It was nice to find the Ballard market nearby."
66457	30712	7.0	9.0	347647	We stayed in Al's little house for 3 weeks and greatly enjoyed exploring the Ballard neighborhood. The house is in a wonderful location to explore the attractions of the area (Ballard farmers market, locks, Golden Gardens Park, and local restaurants.) The house is older, and comes with its quirks, but overall a great value and experience. 
66458	30712	7.0	9.0	486494	The host canceled my reservation 4 days before arrival.
66459	30712	7.0	9.0	1218798	"We contacted Al in an emergency, with a death in the family meaning that we could not stay with family as planned, needing accommodation that same night. Al is the kind of host that likes to talk to you for a while, to get to know you a little & find out what you need. He said that he was preparing the house for a monthly rental & that he was not really prepared for a short term stay, to which I replied that we were flexible. As it happened, the dates fitted perfectly into the end of the month.

By the time we arrived, the place was ready, spotlessly clean and bare. After a chat with us, Al went out and bought everything that we would need for at least our first night, such as coffee, sugar, creamer, bowls, plates and toilet paper. We considered this to be ""above and beyond"". Al kept in touch during our stay, making sure that we were OK, not just with the accommodation, but for ourselves as well.

The accommodation is, as it says, the top part of a small house, situated in a quiet family-oriented neighbourhood.  It has a quite large living room, bathroom with bath, an eat-in kitchen and a reasonable sized bedroom. The polished wood floors mean that the place needs a good sweep out every few days, which only takes a minute or two. The heating system works VERY well, heating the house to a comfortable level within minutes."
66460	30712	7.0	9.0	1453257	"The owner is super nice and accommodating. Because he was staying elsewhere, we basically had the house to ourselves - a nice deal when you're traveling with children. Plenty of space.  Outstanding location.  And incredible price.  Cleanliness was an issue for me, however.  It just wasn't a real comfortable place to be in.  A bit dirty.  Some ants in the kitchen. The toilet seat was broken. And the place held an unpleasant odor.  It's an older home, yes.  I'm cool with things not being ""hotel-ish,"" but I would have appreciated a more comfortable environment.  We just slept there, and wouldn't have wanted to spend any extra time in the home.   Still, for the price and location, it's tough to beat. And who really wants to hang out inside when Seattle is beckoning?   I'll probably spend a bit more money next time to hopefully get a cleaner place.  I'll say again: the owner is really friendly and helpful.   "
66461	30712	7.0	9.0	1477513	"Al was very accommodating and responsive when I got in touch
with him. I needed a place to stay for a couple nights with my
dog and he made it easy to make arrangements for the same
day.
I had the whole place to myself so that was really nice.
The place itself was comfortable and was best for a short
stay as it was pretty barren- nothing in the room except the 
bed, no t.v., etc. I mainly used the place to sleep. "
66462	30712	7.0	9.0	1633061	"We were on our second week of apartment hunting and in dire need of an interim place at the last minute.  Al was very accommodating, not only to us, but to the tenants after us in clearing with them that it would be OK if we had our cat with us.

Al's house is very comfortable, with a great living room (with a piano!) and adorable kitchen.  The bedroom is a great size, and the bed was a bit small for the two of us (I'm very tall), but comfortable.   He also has great photos of New Orleans all around the house which made me miss Nola a bit.

Al actually took the bus to the house to meet us with the keys on the same day we contacted him and spent time to show us around and made sure we were comfortable.  He also recommended a fantastic greek restaurant about a 20 minute walk away.

I definitely recommend Al and his great Ballard home as a place to stay."
66463	30712	7.0	9.0	1661236	We had an excellent stay at Al's cozy Ballad apartment.  Al made sure we had everything we needed for the evening and even recommended an excellent Greek restaurant for us that we enjoyed for dinner.
66464	30712	7.0	9.0	1760229	Quiet and comfortable neighborhood.  Would have been nice to have access to cable. Limited use of cooking due to small amount of dishes and cookware available for vacationing couples.  Al was very friendly and a great host that left fruit, juice, candy and sparkling water for our enjoyment.
66465	30712	7.0	9.0	1880802	Al was great and we had the nice old house to ourselves.  At first glance, the yard needs some TLC but we had a great experience in the house and the area is quiet and well located.  Would go back for sure.
66466	30712	7.0	9.0	1891282	Location, location, location. Ballard is great community about 15 min outside of Seattle. The downtown is filled with bars, shops and eateries and makes for a wonderful evening walk.
66467	30712	7.0	9.0	2315681	"First of all, the positives:
  1. The neighborhood is great.
  2. The apartment is spacious.
  3. I didn't see Al until the last day. He gave me my space and it was appreciated.
 4. He left several beers and beverages in the fridge for me.

Now the negatives:
  1. There was a broken window pane in one of the bedroom windows and the place was in a state of disrepair. The bathroom door was missing a knob. The screen door was broken.
  2. The place was unclean. The bathtub was dirty, had signs of mold, and had half-used bars of soap lying in it. The same with the sink. There was an ancient bar of lava soap on the sink counter. The bedsheets were stained. On the stove top there were 2 unclean looking pots and there were tiny ants scurrying throughout the kitchen. 
  3. The full-sized bed was uncomfortable. It lacks a headboard and is on rollers. It would push away from the wall constantly. 
  4. There was only one roll of toilet paper in the place. I ended up buying my own so I could, um, survive the week.

On the whole I would not recommend staying here. Al seems like a nice enough guy but the place is not well kept up and definitely not worth the money. There are much better options strewn throughout the city. "
66468	30712	7.0	9.0	2376828	Al was flexible, warm, and friendly, and the neighborhood is quiet and only a ten-minute walk from the commercial streets in Ballard.  But the apartment is very bare bones: it might work best for someone planning a longer stay and really wanting to make it their own, or for folks who only need a place to crash and don't care about frills.
66469	30712	7.0	9.0	3745398	"We stayed at Al’s place for 2+ months, so I suppose I am the AirBnB expert on this property, so here is the scoop. 

The Short Story: Your very-own complete apartment. Spacious. Convenient to the safe and great neighborhood of Ballard. Al is very easy-going and personable. He makes himself scarce, but he is there when you need him.  As long as you are not expecting a pristine hotel-type experience, you will be satisfied. 

The Long Version :
Al lives in the basement, and you get the ENTIRE top of the house with your own entrance, living room, bathroom, bedroom, and plenty of space and closets. The kitchen is shared with a door on either side; to your place and his, but Al will give you so much space you may wonder if he even lives there, so really the kitchen is yours.  In the 2+ months we lived there, I only encountered him about 5 times, so it’s basically like having your own complete apartment! 

It is pretty well furnished and the kitchen has all the basics you will need.  I have given Al some advice to make it more traveler and AirBnB friendly, so it should be a bit more equipped and fixed up than some of the prior reviews reflect. All of the minor negative items mentioned in previous reviews should be taken care of before you book the place, but they likely won’t even bother a reasonable person.

For those out-of-towners, Ballard is a great neighborhood in Seattle [good bars, shops, food] and Al’s place is quite conveniently located to the main-drag of Ballard (its walkable). If you plan to be darting all over Seattle, Ballard may not be your prime location, as it doesn’t facilitate easily driving to many other neighborhoods of Seattle, but buses will get you around fairly easily.

Al was very easy-going and helpful. He was always easily reachable, and whenever I had a concern, he took care of it almost immediately. He makes himself scarce, but he is there when something comes up, which is exactly what one wants in a landlord!  
"
66470	30712	7.0	9.0	3991654	I didn't stay there, but Al graciously offered a refund when it turned out that we could not make the trip.  I will look him up next time I am in Seattle….
66471	30712	7.0	9.0	5992555	"If you're looking for cheap accommodation in the cosy Ballard area, Al's place might be an option. However, the apartment was not very clean, and I don't think it had been hoovered before our arrival. The kitchen is shared with Al, who lives in the apartment. We chose not to use it, but we could hear when he was in the kitchen. That meant that the place didn't feel very private to us, especially since there was only a close (but unlocked) door between our part of the apartment and the kitchen. The apartment is situated on a quiet street close to Market street and Ballard Ave, where plenty of restaurants and coffee shops can be found.
Al was very helpful with recommendation to the area."
66472	30712	7.0	9.0	6310503	We had a great time staying in Ballard and it was a good choice for two teachers on a budget. Al is very nice and personable. He offered us a glass of wine on arrival and suggested some music venues and restaurants in the area to check out. Ballard is a great part of the city to stay with lots of good coffee shops and restaurants close by. The house is well described in many of the other reviews. It is a good value for the price. It is not like staying in a hotel. But if you are looking for a cute neighborhood experience this is a good choice. Thanks Al!
66473	30712	7.0	9.0	7349280	Everything about my stay was very nice. I had to arrive late due to my flight being delayed, Al left the door open and left me the key. We didn't run into each other because of our schedules. We did play phone tag for a bit about an electrical issue but he always got right back to me when I contacted him. It's very quiet in the neighboorhood so if you are looking for a city feel this isn't it. I never heard a sound after 9 pm which is nice but for a young lady in a new city, I was a little far from the nightlife. Taxis were very helpful and only about 15$ from the house to the city center. The house was cute and clean with new linens. My only complaint was I was traveling alone as a young lady and the bathroom didn't have a door knob or lock which Al warned me about in advance saying it was being repaired but he wasn't sure if he would be free to fix it before I arrived. This was a little unsettling when showering and using the bathroom but Al never came over to that side of the house so there was nothing to worry about. There was also a door seperating the kitchen from Al's part of the house. I never used the kitchen and the door couldn't be locked which again made me feel a little uncomfortable being a woman alone in a strange place but Al never came over unannounced. In all, I would recommend this place to a friend especially a small family or couple. For a lady traveling alone, it's not ideal but it worked. 
66474	30712	7.0	9.0	7860756	This is a great place to crash when you're exploring Ballard and Seattle. It's a quick bus to the downtown core. You get what you pay for so if you're looking for a five star place, this may not be it. The bed is very comfortable and a nice place to lay your head. There wasn't enough toilet paper. Al was very attentive when we couldn't find the house. It was a bit confusing for us as we arrived at night and there was no address on the house. If you'll be out exploring most of the day - this is a great and cheap alternative to a hotel. Thanks Al! 
66475	30712	7.0	9.0	9157086	Last weekend, my friend and I took a pretty impromptu trip up to Seattle from Portland. I sent the request on Friday and Al thankfully responded and accepted our last minute request for the next day! Our friends were playing a show at a venue in Ballard that was within walking distance from Al's so it was perfect! When we arrived that afternoon, Al had just finished cleaning up the place and the sheets had been freshly laundered. He gave us some suggestions about where to eat and we ended up taking his advice and walking to an awesome Greek restaurant right off Market, about 10 minutes away. The house itself wasn't luxurious or anything but it was warm, pretty clean and he provided us with some sparkling water and snacks. However, there wasn't a hand towel in the bathroom and the doorknob still hasn't been replaced in there. Overall, it was great for the price, just what we needed.
66476	30712	7.0	9.0	9314038	"Our stay in Al's house fit our needs very well.  Right location, comfortable space, and accepted our little dog.  Al bustled around to get the space ready within 24 hours.  He clearly communicated about possible concerns that have already been discussed on his airbnb page so that there would be no unpleasant surprises.
I was impressed with his friendly welcome and concise explanation of use of the house."
66477	30712	7.0	9.0	10414018	We had a great stay at Al's. It was super brief but it was the perfect crash pad in Ballard for our 1 night in town. If you want a comfortable, basic accommodation with privacy and peace, this is a good deal. Al is super nice and left goodies like chocolates, coffee and San Pellegrino too!
66478	30712	7.0	9.0	10707908	Staying with Al was wonderful!  A fantastic host.  He offered us a bottle of wine upon arrival; took us on a tour of Ballard; and recommended lots of restaurants and night spots.  His flat is cozy and very conveniently located.  A fantastic trip - thanks Al!
66479	30712	7.0	9.0	10965933	Myself and a friend stayed with Al for 3 nights in March. The apartment was cosy and comfy, and was in a good location for accessing the shops in Ballard and for getting the bus downtown. We got to meet Al, who was friendly and helpful, and gave us plenty of tips for where to go.
66480	30712	7.0	9.0	11575957	Al was very accommodating and friendly, and his Ballard house was exactly what we were looking for.  A very short walk from great restaurants, record shops and coffee, but very quiet at night.  We would definitely stay there again.
66481	30712	7.0	9.0	12026919	Lovely, bright and cozy. We had a great weekend; the piano was a big bonus for us. Beautiful original tiles in the bath and kitchen; large sunny bedroom and very comfy bed. It's a very very quiet neighbourhood, we were awakened by the birds, which was really nice. Close to some really super restaurants.       
66482	30712	7.0	9.0	12517781	Al seemed like a nice guy.  And very accommodating of having a dog.  Kitchen is shared with downstairs tenant.  Location is great too.  However overall clutter/cleanliness could be improved.  Some things like missing door handles on closets and bathroom, etc.  
66483	30712	7.0	9.0	12976531	"I contacted Al Parisi twice during my stay in Ballard, and both times he responded quickly and positively. First we had missed communications about getting the key, and Al showed up promptly to let us in. Then, when the shared kitchen tenants had left the kitchen a mess, he got on it and the kitchen was cleaned.

You approach his funky Ballard apartment through an overgrown front yard, and go into a living room with piano, musical instruments, festival posters and 1950s era drapes. And there was fruit and water to welcome us. 

A center hall has a bath on the left. The knob is still missing from the bathroom door, but we appreciated the selection of soaps and lotions that were there for us if we wanted them. The shared kitchen on the right is well-equiped, but it is not clear what pots, pans and tools are for common use and which are the downstairs tenant's private things. An info sheet with hints about kitchen use, wi-fi, and checkout, f.i., would be helpful.

The hall also has a well-stocked supply closet. We found light bulbs there and replaced some burned out bulbs in the overhead fixtures.

At the back of the hall is the bedroom, with a comfortable bed and warm quilt, and good closet and dresser space.

Nothing polished and fancy here, but it was easy to settle into. The price was in our budget, and the location was right. "
66484	30712	7.0	9.0	14755696	"Al was a great host. The accommodations however were a bit different than expected. We were not informed that there were two young children in the apartment below us until after we arrived for our 6 day trip. 
Previous reviews stated that the apartment was a bit messy but comfortable. When we arrived we noticed the room we were staying in was very dirty. The bathroom shower curtain had black mold growing on it and the entire bathroom smelled like urine. The bathroom door knob is still missing (that wouldnt be a problem except the downstairs neighbors can walk in at any point. The shared kitchen was always very messy and dirty with food being left out for days. 

These things being said, Al is a very kind person and was gracious enough to let us use his home."
66485	30712	7.0	9.0	15792233	"This apartment worked out very well for my family and I on a recent week-long trip to Seattle. Al met us upon our arrival and made us feel very welcome, even providing a local beer and some k-cup coffee for our stay. The apartment is a good size living room, plus a very small private bathroom and a good size bedroom (we fit a portable crib/pack-n-play in there). There is a also a kitchen space that is shared with the tenants who live downstairs (a very nice couple with a small child). The location is great, in a quiet neighborhood that is only a short walk into downtown Ballard and also 3-4 blocks to the bus line to get into downtown Seattle and elsewhere. For parents, there is a park 1-2 blocks away with a good playground area, including a sandbox (with trucks) and a zip line. 

The place itself is somewhat rough around the edges, so don't stay here expecting 4-star accommodations. We didn't mind so much, but in the interest of openness and because I know some people care about this stuff, there are some things to note. The kitchen and bathroom both need a serious deep cleaning! I'm sure Al surface-cleaned these before we arrived but they both need serious professional attention. :) The doorknob is missing from the bathroom door  - didn't matter to us but something to note if you are staying with people you aren't intimate with. There were a lot of ants (we were there in the summer during a very hot week...). The bed, while pretty comfortable, doesn't have a headboard or footboard so it is just the metal frame and mattress. Wasn't an issue for us, but there isn't a TV, stereo, or even speakers to plug into. Overall, these things didn't get in the way of enjoying the place, and we still felt it was a good value for the money.

On the fun side, there is a upright piano in the living room that we were told we could use, as well as a drum kit (!) which belonged to the tenant downstairs. The place is decorated with various posters and prints from various music festivals (mainly NOLA).

Overall, while some improvements could be made, I would definitely recommend this place for people seeking budget accommodations in Seattle. Al, the host, is super cool, the location is great, and it would be very hard to beat the price in the Seattle area."
66486	30712	7.0	9.0	16220744	We did not have much communication with Al while in Seattle, but there really was not a need.  He made sure to let us know how to find entry and what to expect upon arrival.  Everything was as advertised.  For $75 a night I think this is a cozy little place that made us feel comfortable for our stay in this area.  The neighborhood is beautiful and public transportation is an easy walk about 5 blocks away.  The house is a little bit untidy, but that's the only complaint, can't expect too much.  We ran out of toilet paper on the last night, which made for an interesting last morning.  All in all, we were comfortable and had a good trip.
66487	30712	7.0	9.0	16874367	Al came through for me in a pinch which I'm really grateful for. He's a very kind man who has the best of intentions and even drove my friend and I around upon our arrival to see the local neighborhood. That being said, the accommodations are honestly less than stellar. All of the reviews are pretty accurate about this place but we had no other options during our time period. The house is generally untidy- the front yard looks overgrown and the screen door is missing a screen. There is even a boat dock out front with no boat! Inside there is a lot of clutter. We did have clean sheets and towels which was nice but the bathroom was not clean unfortunately. Maybe surface cleaned but the grout between tiles is black, there are wet (possibly moldy) spots on the ceilings. Ants crawling around everywhere. We woke up one morning to three dead moths in the shower. Short cab ride to Ballard and Markets streets but a long bus ride to downtown. Not ideal for two young girls on a road trip but we made the best of it. To be fair, the unit is priced on the cheap end for good reason. It's clear you're not getting top notch amenities but the space is big and Al is flexible.
66488	30712	7.0	9.0	17655545	This was my second stay at Al's place in Ballard and both times were great, easy access to Ballard and Freemont entertainment districts, a large comfy bed, and pet friendly... Al will be whatever you need out of a host, whether that be a local guide with plenty of knowledge to share or an unobtrusive presence while you do your own thing. Thanks Al!
66489	30712	7.0	9.0	18889078	Als place worked great for our needs. It is definitely the most affordable place in the area that we could find and Al is a great host. Super kind and accommodating. We came to work a festival in Seattle and just needed a place to sleep at night, so Als home was perfect. Its a good budget place in Ballard, but if it was a hotel it would definitely be a 2 1/2 star. It definitely could have been cleaner and the door was a little tricky to open. 
66490	30712	7.0	9.0	19235168	"Al was a great host who went out of his way to make us feel welcome always, which was most appreciated when we first arrived. Al was kind enough to have beer and pizza waiting for us when we got to his place the first night, and after a canceled flight and an arrival time close to midnight, was the most appreciated.  He was always thoughtful and accommodating of our needs and respectful of our privacy throughout our stay. He also gave great suggestions on places to visit and resources for anything we needed.  

The listing description is very accurate but reading the reviews was very helpful as well. I will say in agreeance of previous reviews that the place was very clean and tidy but if you need things deep cleaned and have an issue with things like dirty grout than this may not be the place for you -not judging, just saying. 

Then there's the location. Located in Ballard, it was only a short walk to many great Ballard sites, fantastic restaurants, and scenic beaches, plus easy access to a cheap bus ride to downtown. Al even directed us to a place that was close by where we could rent bikes which made our experience even better. 

More than anything what we loved about staying at Al's house is that he made it feel like a home away from home and that you could tell that he genuinely wanted us to have a great stay in his home and in Seattle. We would definitely stay with Al in Ballard again next time we are in the area!"
66491	30712	7.0	9.0	19683601	"What a wonderful quite place to stay.  So easy to get to anything in Ballard.  Al supplied anything we needed.  Would stay again if in the area.
"
66492	30712	7.0	9.0	22877021	We had a great time in our stay at Al's place- loved the piano!
66493	30712	7.0	9.0	24394346	My brother and I were in Seattle for Christmas, and Al was a great host. We had two dogs with us and very much appreciate that he let us stay in his home.  The space is great, and while there's only one bed, the sofa is plenty large enough and quite comfortable to sleep on. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Al's place to others who are looking to stay in Ballard.
66494	30712	7.0	9.0	25448694	Al, was able to accommodate my husband and I perfectly to our needs. The apartment was clean and private. Al was nice enough to leave some snacks for us. Throughout our stay, He talked to me frequently making sure we had everything we needed. 
66495	30712	7.0	9.0	25587927	It was great that Al got us in on such short notice.  There wasn't a TV but the internet was sufficient.  I love Ballard and it was nice to find a place that takes dogs.
66496	30712	7.0	9.0	25866107	"I rented this for my rep who was doing work with me while in Seattle.
She said that Al was very nice and communicative, however the place was filthy, with a dirty kitchen, overflowing garbage and dust everywhere. I felt terrible that she has this experience while working with me."
66497	30712	7.0	9.0	26276041	Al was very welcoming, phoning me a couple of times to see if everything was okay.  Everything was okay!  His rental is as described, cozy, though rooms are larger than cozy, clean, and warm with a comfortable double bed, and great towels.  The neighborhood is very quiet and convenient to places in Ballard  that we wanted to visit. Prior to our arrival I mentioned to him that I like having my coffee first thing in the morning so  he conveniently left out a coffee maker and  coffee in the kitchen for my use.   The place is simple and comfortable,  not new and  glamorous.  It suited us just fine and we would definitely stay at Al's place again.
66498	30712	7.0	9.0	27212087	"Al's place is definitely cozy, and it's located in a great neighborhood. You are walking distance to grocery stores, restaurants, bars, cafes, and parks. There is plenty of street parking, and the neighborhood is very quiet.

You will have the top floor of the house, with Al and his daughter share the bottom level; the only shared space is the kitchen. We had a very comfortable stay in the place. We easily modified some things, such as stuffing a paper towel in the missing knob to the bathroom, bringing extra toilet paper, etc.

We stayed for an extended period of time (3 weeks) because we were moving from Texas, so we needed a place to stay while we located a permanent home. Major points are awarded to Al because he allows pets. We have a small dog and we were very happy to find a place that allowed him.

Overall, we had a very comfortable stay. Since we stayed a long time, we made use of the kitchen a LOT and I would only mention that it is not fully stocked (something Al is working on), so there isn't cutlery, there are limited pots & pans, and there is no microwave. I just mention that so you could get a better idea of what you are working with in case of a long term stay. In case of a short term stay, you are in a city with so many great restaurants that I doubt it would matter!

Now as far as cleanliness, everybody has different standards. Like another reviewer mentioned, it's not like this place has been deep cleaned, but as somebody who stayed a few weeks, I could definitely tell that Al definitely does general cleaning and upkeep of the space. But if you have any issues, Al is super accessible by email, phone and text. He really works hard to make sure you feel comfortable in his home, and he is open and willing to address any issues you may have. He is a really great host that respects your privacy while doing his best to address your needs."
66499	30712	7.0	9.0	29788937	A cozy, comfortable, well-equipped and pleasant place to stay, in the heart of Ballard! Al and Angela were incredibly helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Felt at home. Thank you! 
66500	30712	7.0	9.0	32043412	We LOVED our stay at Al's home!! It was perfect for our family.
66501	30712	7.0	9.0	32225239	Al's place was really nice and quiet. His place is in Ballard which is close proximity to the city as well as the main roads if you need anything like groceries or gas. Nice and quiet neighborhood too. I have short notice but he had this place set up right away for me!
66502	30712	7.0	9.0	32851129	Really nice guy. Great neighborhood. I'll definitely book again. Thanks Al!
66503	30712	7.0	9.0	35560587	The apartment is located in a great part of town and is very quiet. Despite the unusually warm temperatures we were very comfortable and slept really well (thank you, Al for the fan!). Al was great in returning my call regarding our arrival even though he had a really busy week and weekend. Our paths never crossed actually, but I had no doubt if we had needed anything, Al would aim to please! We weren't in the apt very much during our stay and it worked out great for our purposes. Thank you Al! - Tracy
66504	30712	7.0	9.0	40108911	Al and his place were great! Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown Ballard and easy to get to downtown Seattle from there. We had our 6 month old baby with us and Al was so kind to even let us use a pack n play that he had at the house so we didn't have to take up extra room in the car to bring ours. Even the neighbors stopped to say hello to us as we were packing up the car to head home. It's not fancy, but it's quiet and comfortable and served all of our needs. I would highly recommend staying at Al's place!
66505	30712	7.0	9.0	40532406	Al was friendly on the phone.  Once we got there we did not hear from him but we were ok with that. The location is great.  Near a lot of restaurants and markets.  Quiet and safe neighborhood.  The house is small but just fine for a couple of people. The house has potential and with work could be a very nice place.  The bed was comfortable.  It could use some TLC with paint, maintenance and deep cleaning.
66506	30712	7.0	9.0	42030277	"Al's place is great! I noticed that some has commented about place not being clean. My comment for that is that is ""Yeah sure it's missing a female touch. But it's a guy that is renting it."" So if you are really fancy then it's maybe not for you, but I felt at home. And will stay there for my next visit if it's available. Thanks Al."
66507	30712	7.0	9.0	46168533	Very relaxed. Easy going. 
66508	30712	7.0	9.0	47381368	This apartment is located close to all things Ballard, which was why we decided to stay here.  We stayed only two nights of the total we booked due to a change in travel plans.  Al was good on communication, but the place could use some maintenance.  The front door was sticky, the screen door was broken, and the dryer wasn't working.  The yard could also use some maintenance and clean up.  If you are looking for a place close to Ballard, and are on a budget, this will work just fine.  Just don't expect anything fancy.
66509	30712	7.0	9.0	47732842	Al was the nicest! Cute rustic quarters in a darling neighborhood (with some fantastic restaurants within walking or bike distance!). Al was incredibly accommodating, and was very flexible to work with us regarding our visit. The bed was comfy and clean, and we will definitely be looking up Al again next time we come to town.
66510	30712	7.0	9.0	48399816	Al was a great host - very friendly and welcoming - and the place was comfortable and in an amazing location!  We were so glad we were staying in Ballard, and thought the place was a great deal for the price!
66511	30712	7.0	9.0	50485674	I had a great stay at Al's apartment. It's located on the main floor of a little bungalow and Al lives in the basement. The space isn't flashy, but it's warm, cozy, and feels like a cottage right in the middle of Seattle. The bed was really comfortable and so was the giant couch in the living room. Al left us some snacks and wine which we appreciated. We never met, but he seems very easy going about everything. For the price, this is an excellent accommodation in Seattle and I would absolutely stay here again. 
66512	30712	7.0	9.0	51943184	Al was a very welcoming and laid back host which helped to make our week long stay very pleasant.  Although Al's place is in the middle of a family-friendly neighborhood, the nearest coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, and bars are just blocks away.  We had both dogs stay with us and felt very safe walking them in the neighborhood after dark.  This was a great value for the amount of space provided, which was helpful for two people and two dogs.
66513	30712	7.0	9.0	52744191	We stayed with Al for a long weekend and had a wonderful stay! The apartment was cozy and well located. 
66514	30712	7.0	9.0	53572142	We loved this quiet little spot in Ballard. Al was welcoming and understanding and provided us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  When we return to Seattle, we would definitely stay here again.  
69010	670021	7.0	8.0	2243336	Tiki's house was a clean, pretty and cozy place to stay. It has a full kitchen, a living room (with TV) and a small work place. I expected a small room to sleep in but it was definitely beyond that. And even if you don't have a car, there are several bus stops near house (0.4~1mile) where you can take a bus to downtown, UW, northgate, etc. I enjoyed staying there!
69011	670021	7.0	8.0	2581005	"They are just getting started in the BnB world so they have a few things they are still working on. My room was missing a few things to make me feel at home (like hangers, and a place to store by clothes, curtains- I let Darlene know and it was sorted out). A few things in the bathroom and kitchen needed some loving care like a constantly running toilet and leaking shower- again, Darlene tried her best to fix these things up. 

It's a bit far away from the city but there are numerous bus routes within 15 minutes walk (up and down hills). If you don't have luggage and don't mind dodging cars, it's a lovely walk on a sunny day. 

They are making more improvements to the property all the time so hopefully your stay will be nice. But where else can you be welcomed by a Native Indian-American at a few hours notice? Thanks again. "
69012	670021	7.0	8.0	3069686	"Very nice place to stay, and Tiki has added a coffeemaker and small dining table for those of us who can't use the high bistro table.  The room and bed are tight for two people, just right for one.  You will enjoy staying here if you don't mind sharing the house with a stranger.  It worked out fine for us.
"
69013	670021	7.0	8.0	15780051	"Darlene is great, she helped us a lot because we were new in town. The home is very comfy and there are everything that you need in the house.

"
69014	670021	7.0	8.0	16129311	Really enjoyed staying with Darlene!  Her location a little remove from did town really feels like you are in western Washington, not just another city! Stayed with my girlfriend for two nights and we were both very comfortable!
69015	670021	7.0	8.0	16870585	Darlene was great and her home is very nice and cozy. She was a great host
69016	670021	7.0	8.0	22066946	Good for its price. Close to hwy. many stores closed by. Internet was a bit slow. The house was kept clean,  it has its unique smell to it. The provided towels were a bit old. But then again, for the price it beats the hotel. Some snacks and juices were provided.  
69017	670021	7.0	8.0	28931565	"I and my wife spent 5 months at Darlene's place. The first 3 months we were paying cash directly to her. The last two months we were using the Airbnb service.
The location is acceptable, Lake City way is in 10 min walking distance. One disadvantage the location has is that the neighborhood is not save for walk after hours.
For the first 2 months leaving at Darlene’s place was good. After that we started having troubles with her. Since Darlene leaves at the garage, her presence at the house is constant, which fine–this is her house after all, but there were two occasions that she was drunk and she was behaving really bad. One of the times she was drunk, she unlocked and entered in second room, which was rented by another couple (they was not in the house at that moment). At that time I was at home and I told her that she is not supposed to enter in the room while the people are out, she answered me that she is the owner of the house and she can do whatever she wants, and she told me ”stupid boy”. One time she entered in our room without knock while my wife was there. So if you are looking for a place where the room you are renting has some level of privacy, maybe Darlene’s place is not the best.
There were cases, while we are at home, she came in and unplug the power adapter of our laptop. There were also cases when she was unplug the heater no matter that it was cold for us to save electric power.
About cleaning the house, in general she didn’t maintain the house clean, no matter that this was her responsibility. Sometimes it was taking more than 2 weeks for her to get us clean sheets and towels (again her every week responsibility).We would be very happy to wash and dry more frequently the sheets and towels by ourselves, but she didn’t allow us to use the washer and dryer for sheets and towels.
Two weeks before we left she came drunk and asked me what we'll do next month. I replied that we are looking for an apartment and we will not stay in her house. She got really angry, and started causing troubles. She turned off the fuse of the washer (the fuse box is in the garage) and asked us extra money to use washer and dryer. Therefore, we didn't use washer and dryer last two weeks.
The check-in to the house didn’t take time and was easy, but on the day we were checking-out Darlene came early in the morning and started cleaning the bathroom, we were not able to use the bathroom, and we should leave two hours earlier."
69018	670021	7.0	8.0	42377484	My parents came to Seattle to attend my college graduation ceremony. We stayed together at Tiki's house for one month, and after my parents left, I stayed for another month, during which I met several other nice tenants. Since Tiki converted her garage into a studio for herself, my parents and I lived next door but separately from Tiki. It was a wonderful experience for my parents and I, as the house provided us with enough privacy and Tiki was chill about a lot of things. When I went to work during weekdays, my parents took a walk around the neighborhood. It was a nice neighborhood with a lot of tall trees, which made it cool during hot days but also not much direct sunshine into the house. Tiki invited me to her daughter's party but unfortunately I didn't make it. The house was close to Safeway, QFC, gas stations, a bus stop to downtown Seattle and a bunch of restaurants. The only inconvenience was Tiki charged for laundry. Mostly my mom hand-washed our summer clothes, and I went to the nearby laundromat once. 
69019	670021	7.0	8.0	47294382	Darlene was a great host. Bed was comfortable and TV and wifi worked fine. 
69070	4951079	6.0	6.0	36297789	"I enjoyed my stay at Siri's residence. Overall I had a great experience, and felt very welcomed. The family respected my privacy and allowed me to set the tone for how much I wanted to interact. The space itself is just like the pictures and well cared for. The kitchen, lounge area and bathroom are shared space with other potential renters. I don't think that was clear to me when I originally looked at the room. It's a good idea to ask if anyone else will be occupying the space while you are there. I had no problem with sharing the space, my roommates were friendly and respectful. The location is close to several bus routes as described, but it is a decent distance from downtown. You have to take a 30 min bus ride if you plan to travel to the U-district or downtown. I would recommend staying at Siri's airbnb and I would consider staying there again for future trips. However, I would advise you to speak with Siri first and discuss the schedule of her family and the other possible renters in advance. At times there can be a lot going on so you should be fully prepared for that ahead of time.

The apartment has a great location and in a really nice area with lotsa food and supermarkets nearby.

Very comfortable apartment for 2. Large-screen TV with many channels available. Wifi was not made available tho.

Apartment was set-up like a bachelor's apartment, rather than a place expecting guests. So it's kinda messy & the smells of men's cologne & old sheets remain. Bathroom and Carpet need some cleaning too."
69545	5639238	3.0	10.0	30534500	Tim was a good host and was very responsive to our needs.  His apartment is very new and in a cool part of Seattle surrounded by lots of trendy bars and restaurants.  One of the best oyster bars in the city is on the ground floor of his building! 
69834	5252515	7.0	10.0	32553658	Gilad was a good host, he kept in contact, was quick to answer my questions, and made sure we would get into the apartment ok. He also left us good recommendations for things to see and do in Seattle. The apartment is huge, and in a good location - easy to get into the city but still has the quiet, quaint feel of the lower anne neighbourhood. 
69835	5252515	7.0	10.0	36673038	Gilad was a wonderful host. He was extremely responsive and accommodating.  The apartment is in an awesome location.  In addition to several stores and restaurants nearby. the Space Needle / Art Center is a short and pleasant walk away.The rooftop view is breathtaking and is a great place to decompress and enjoy a glass of wine. If the opportunity presented itself I would not think twice to stay here again.  
69836	5252515	7.0	10.0	39921662	"Great place to stay in Seattle! We were two couples in town to catch some baseball games and nightlife. We loved the location, parking, and hospitality. We'd absolutely stay again in the future and recommend to friends.

Thanks!"
69837	5252515	7.0	10.0	43636293	Gilad made us feel very welcome!  Nice place with nice appliances and bathrooms.  Right next to a bus stop taking you to downtown.  Would definitely stay here again!
69838	5252515	7.0	10.0	43963739	Gilad did a great job communicating instructions on checking in and was very responsive prior to our trip.  He also was very accommodating in letting us leave our bags there early while the condo was being cleaned.  The rooftop deck was closed the entire time which was a bummer but we are assuming it was building maintenance.  The place was very nice and spacious. 
69839	5252515	7.0	10.0	46153831	Gilad was very accommodating. He was very responsive to any questions we had. Everything was explained very thoroughly. The space itself was in a great location and I would definitely recommend staying at his place the next time you are in the Seattle area.
69840	5252515	7.0	10.0	47721273	We had a great time! Gilad's condo was very comfy.  It was literally like staying at a friends house while they were out of town.
70327	5261239	7.0	10.0	26654547	Eric's house was right downtown and very close to everything. Thanks so much for the chance to visit, Eric!
70328	5261239	7.0	10.0	27697132	The apartment was easy to find and access.  It's in an area of town near lots of coffee shops and restaurants, and close to tourist activities and public transportation.  The pictures are accurate.  If you need a basic place to stay in a good location I would recommend this place.
70329	5261239	7.0	10.0	27805644	Eric's apartment was perfect for our visit! It is very close to shopping, restaurants, all the touristy attractions, & the monorail. The projector screen was great for downtime. The pictures are very accurate & it was clean. Very easy to find and get around. Eric worked with us and our schedule very well! I would recommend this place to anyone.
70330	5261239	7.0	10.0	28234784	"My friends and I stayed at Eric's apartment and it was as exactly as the photos showed. Very centally located and Eric was accomadating. Check in and out went seamlessly.  I forgot my charger and he offered to mail it back to me, Thank you for your hospitality Eric!







"
70331	5261239	7.0	10.0	28505463	As described.  Eric greeted us at the apartment on time - and then left us to it.  Apartment was great for easy access to Seattle needle - we also walked down to Fisherman's wharf.
70332	5261239	7.0	10.0	28798660	Great location. Spartan furnishings, smallish studio apartment, reasonably clean (very tidy, but a bit musty). We had a problem with the key to the apartment door not working -- like, not working *at all*-- but Eric offered to come try to fix it, and I expect that he will do so before the next guest arrives? On the whole we enjoyed our stay and felt that it was a good bargain. 
70333	5261239	7.0	10.0	29884360	"Eric was a very good host. The location is great and walking distance from downtown and Pike place. The place is comfortable too. It is definitely worth staying at Eric's place for the weekend. He was very responsive and help us with late check in when our flights were delayed. With that aspect he is a 5/5 host. 

I guess with the amenities, if you were to be for a longer duration, the room can be slightly more prepped up given sometimes you would end up staying more indoors with rain in Seattle. With the in-house amenities I would give it a 4/5. All in all, a great stay!"
70334	5261239	7.0	10.0	30454143	See previous review (we extended our stay).
70335	5261239	7.0	10.0	30537689	"The location of this place is pretty spectacular. You are in the heart of downtown near the Seattle Center, Pike Place Market, and Olympic Sculpture Garden. We were able to walk everywhere, so there was no need for a car. 

The place itself had its downsides though. The lock to the apartment is old, making it VERY difficult to even get into the apartment. There is an art of wiggling and shaking the key around to unlock the door and just get into the place. Make sure that Eric shows you some tricks to get it to work, because the first time we did it, it took us 5 minutes just to get in and we were exhausted from a long day of walking around the city. Also, it wasn't the cleanest place either (there were unknown foods underneath the curtains and food crusted on the silverware), but we rarely spent time here for it to be a real issue. We were hoping to cook, which was a big reason why we chose an apartment over a shared room, but didn't really feel comfortable to do so (there were not a lot of cooking supplies anyways). If you don't plan on spending much time in the apartment and just want to be super close to everything the price of the place is extremely reasonable though. 

Overall, like I said, the location really beats anything else we found, even with some of the issues. Eric was very responsive to if we had any questions. We also last minute requested an extra night and he was very gracious to help us out. "
70336	5261239	7.0	10.0	31365024	The apartment was actually for my dad. And from what he told me was the location was perfect! Centrally located with tons to do near by. The apartment itself was a bit on the smaller side but unless your planning on staying in the whole time the location makes up for the room. Being that the apt was actually for my dad I still was the one communicating with Eric and everything went very smooth...! He replied to any concerns either of us had very quickly. 
70337	5261239	7.0	10.0	32532763	"Perfect location!! Walking distance to everything you want to see in Downtown Seattle!! Eric was always prompt in his response via text- very polite, but not too social- which is fine :)
The downside to this place is that it is not very nice, not cluttered- but pretty dingy. Bed was okay. It definitely sags to the middle- but after walking around all day we were exhausted and slept hard! The shower was a bit dirty- but hot water and pressure was good. 
If you are looking for simply a place to crash at night, and don't mind being in a bit of a shabby apt then this place is great! We didn't mind- it was an adventure! Kitchen is tiny and not much room or utensils to cook- so we ate all of our meals around town. There is a convenient store one block away which was very helpful! 
100 inch projector style screen tv was fun to watch movies on late at night- but volume was pretty low.  There isn't a closet to hang clothes or dresser to put anything away- so we used the smaller couch as a storage place for our suitcase and belongings. 

All in all- it was a good experience. Perhaps a little pricey for what it actually was- but I have noticed the price has been significantly reduced since our stay. 
Again- if location is a priority- and you are low maintenance- then this place is perfect for you! "
70338	5261239	7.0	10.0	33797929	"Easy checkin and checkout
Quick response to all correspondences
Sort of a dark, dingy feel to the place 
Bathroom, shower was a bit dirty
Excellent location"
70339	5261239	7.0	10.0	34949797	The neighborhood and location were fine and Eric was friendly and communicative. The listing however, was not what we expected. It is on the 3rd floor and is a pretty small studio that felt cramped and dark. The carpets were also wet from a cleansing which left a cloying sweet smell to the place. Eric explained that this had to do with the previous tenant making a mess. We didn't feel comfortable sitting on anything or touching anything. 
70340	5261239	7.0	10.0	35644005	Very good location, and Eric was a great, flexible host. It's an older, pretty Spartan building, but the necessities are there, and we spent most of our time roaming the city anyway. It suited our needs perfectly.
70341	5261239	7.0	10.0	35944628	"Eric was prompt and brief. Key problem was addressed and easy to handle. The description is accurate. Small and cramped and a very small kitchen but we came for the great location. Walking distance to the market adm fun shops and restaurants. Space needle, if you want it, is literally a
Short walk. Entertainment system a bit glitchy. recommemd great Vietnamese place around the corner - greenleaf - in a labor temple. Very cool and cozy bar. Nice staff. Overall a great deal for the location. "
70342	5261239	7.0	10.0	36210439	Great communication, needed a blow dryer and Eric delivered!
70343	5261239	7.0	10.0	37075235	Eric was super helpful and available. We needed some concert tickets delivered and he made it really easy to get them delivered before our stay in Seattle. Eric's spot was located in a really cool area that was nice and fun to walk around. Great restaurants and bars right nearby. If you're looking to have a spot to crash at and not really hang out at, Eric's place is great. Could have been a little bit cleaner/organized, but altogether had a great stay.
70344	5261239	7.0	10.0	37581758	Check in & out were simple. The 3 floor walk up was not an issue. I was surprised at how quiet the building was. The location really made our vacation - we were close to all the museums and parking was not a problem. We visited during an unseasonable hot spell and the a/c unit treated us well. However,  the bed was not very comfortable and the kitchen was sparse.  We didn't spend much time in the apt apart from sleeping. 
70345	5261239	7.0	10.0	38646081	"Eric responds  immediately.
The room was very close to Space Needle.  It was quite at night, but old."
70346	5261239	7.0	10.0	38854454	I booked Eric's space for my parents and it was perfect! The location is ideal for downtown. 5 min walk from Space Needle. Great bed, huge tv, clean and spacious. Stay here if you are doing the tourist thing. Get coffee at Drip City too!
70347	5261239	7.0	10.0	39414860	"Eric's apartment is a great spot to stay while sightseeing in Seattle if you are planning on being out of the apartment most of the time.  The pictures are exactly how it looked, and the location was fantastic.  We were able to get around without a car because the apartment was so centrally located.  It was the perfect place to crash after a long day of seeing a really great city.

We never got to meet Eric, but we were able to get into the apartment and get the key without any trouble at all.  Eric even left us some supplies when they ran out.  We would stay here again."
70348	5261239	7.0	10.0	39613075	"Great location in Belltown, very close to downtown, Space Needle, and Pike Place. The apartment is small but fine for two people, especially if you're going to only be sleeping there. Eric was nice, and communicated via text to coordinate check in and was there in person to give us the keys. 

This is a no fuss apartment. Sheets and towels were new, but bathroom was dingy (bathtubs and sink were dusty, and old bars of soap were left in tub and on sink). There is no parking included; if you're bringing a car, be prepared to pay for street parking.  Make sure you discuss check out process ahead of time, as we were unable to get a hold of Eric before check out on the day of. "
70349	5261239	7.0	10.0	40350474	Erick was extremely accommodating  and answered all of my questions, responding to my messages promptly. His studio really is in an amazing location, place market is about a 15 min walk and the space needle is a 5 min walk. Also really liked his projector which has Netflix! Only gripe I have about my stay Is that me My Wife and my 10 month daughter were not aware that there was not elevator access to the apartment. Being that his apartment is on the 3rd floor which isn't the biggest deal, but when you are hauling a jogging stroller and diaper bags, car seats etc. Up and down stairs it feels like 6 floors. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. 
70350	5261239	7.0	10.0	41924453	The apartment was in a great place close to many attractions that were all walkable. Netflix and Plex were available on the Tivo and worked great.  The refrigerator was stocked with some fruit and drinks which were great after a day out on the town. It's an older building but as all of the essentials which were more than adequate. Eric was very understanding with us when we were late due to our plane being delayed and answered all our questions leading up to our stay very quickly.
70351	5261239	7.0	10.0	42166430	Although we never got the chance to actually meet Eric, it was easy to make arrangements to get into the appartment. The listing was accurate about being just steps from the needle it was quite cool.
70352	5261239	7.0	10.0	42712899	The location was great for exploring the city.  Be prepared to pay for parking and still spend money on public transportation.  The apartment is a 3rd floor walk up.  The building is older 1930's maybe?  
70353	5261239	7.0	10.0	43564842	"We got to meet Eric briefly during check-in, he was pretty friendly and accommodating overall. The communications beforehand could be better tho, as I was trying to ask for check-in instructions a few times before the check-in date, but I didn't get a firm answer until about an hour before checking in at 3pm on that day, just shortly after we've arrived Seattle. As we're from Canada, that's why I wanted to get confirmations before we arrive in the States. Everything works out at the end tho, we arrived at the building at 3pm, no one were there so I gave Eric a call, he was polite and told me that he's running 10 mins late. He did in fact sent me a message on Airbnb shortly before check-in to tell me that he'd meet me at the building but will be running 10 mins late. As I didn't have a data plan in the States and no available wifi around, I actually wasn't able to see the message until afterwards. It would of been nicer if I could get the check-in instructions a few days earlier.
The place was decent and located in an awesome location, extremely convenient if you wanted to do some sightseeing. The cleanliness for the bedroom/living room was fine, but there could be more work put into the bathroom, as we found some yellow stain on the back of the toilet seat and cover, and there were some dusts around that could of been easily wiped. Maybe having some air freshener in the bathroom would be nice, as there was this weird smell in it. Could of been the building being so old, so I just put up with the smell.
Overall we did enjoy our one night of stay here."
70354	5261239	7.0	10.0	44149463	This place was the perfect location for my weekend needs, just a short walk to everything I wanted to see and do in the area. Very clean, comfortable, quiet and relaxing setting, with no trouble at all. The host was very quick to respond when I had a question about check out. I enjoyed my stay very much and would love to stay here again on my next Seattle visit. 
70355	5261239	7.0	10.0	44587951	We used Eric's space for a quick one night work event in Seattle.  The location was fantastic and it worked out perfectly for our needs.
70356	5261239	7.0	10.0	45085844	"
We didn't meet Éric but the communication before booking was fast and easy, as well when in the place. The area is few yards away from Space Needle Center thus making it very convenient. However, there are not many restaurants or shops except those at the foot of the Needle. Regarding the apartment, it is located in an ancient typical building and on the third floor. Note that there is no lift and be prepared to carry your suitcases . The bathroom and the kitchen,  would gain to be renewed. The bed is very comfortable. Good points are that there is air conditionning and an up todate cinema equipment that we never had in our previous AIRBNB places. But, without willing to be rude, we must say that we have been a bit disappointed, considering that the place is not matching the price. Anyway, thanks to Eric"
70357	5261239	7.0	10.0	45409620	"The location was indeed great. The only thing we loved about the apartment was  watching movies on the projector screen. The things that we didn't like ...

1. For us kitchen is very important when we go on a vacation. It was a compete disappointment. There was only a medium sized shallow pan and another square shaped flat pan little bit bigger than size of a bread, one knife and one as slotted spatula. We expect bit more than that when accommodation says kitchen. We had to buy all our meals. I asked for a deep pan for cooking rice and making tea but didn't get it. The microwave and oven was very dirty, so couldn't even use it. Overall the kitchen was in bad shape.

2. The bedding didn't look like it was fresh, not used previously. It was the same black comforter as in the picture. I just hope it was not the same used by previous occupant. I didn't quite feel good about sleeping on the bed. But we had no option.

3. In the toilet there were only 2 tissue rolls, we realised it in the morning when we had to leave and it was almost finished. Couldn't find any extras.

4. There was no space to hang clothes. We used the sofa. And when we were sitting on sofa, they were on the carpet.

5. All junk stashed behind closed doors.

6. It's not a professionally maintained apartment. Its as if someone is already living there but for the nights that you're saying he moved out.

We should have had paid little extra and gotten a nice hotel with free parking. We thought there would be parking space instead had to spend extra 70-80 bucks per day for parking outside.

70358	5261239	7.0	10.0	45641298	Perfect location for your stay in Seattle.  Near downtown and the Space Needle.  Spacious rooms with everything that you would need (even Netflix!)
70359	5261239	7.0	10.0	45958413	Although our schedules did not match to actually meet the host, Eric was still a good host through text, answering questions and concerns. His apartment was exactly what we needed and looking for to stay a few nights to see the city. The location was only 2 blocks away from Seattle Center and the biggest tourist attractions. This was definitely a convenient listing and would highly recommend it. It was clean and the projection screen with Netflix helped when there was a rainy night night and we had to stay in. The host was friendly as said earlier, would recommend this apartment. 
70360	5261239	7.0	10.0	46671343	Easy access to the apartment and convenient parking in front of building! Thanks for the quiet stay on my quick trip to Seattle! 
70361	5261239	7.0	10.0	46883541	The apartment was just what we needed for our visit to Seattle. The location is great. The only tricky part was parking, but there are many options nearby so it ended up as not a problem. It's about two blocks from the Space Needle, Science Museum, EMP Museum, and a lovely park. Everyone we saw on the street seemed friendly enough; many people walking dogs or jogging. The building is older, but the apartment was clean and well equipped. There was an air conditioner, bed, shower with hot water, and a small kitchen. Eric was very accommodating.
70362	5261239	7.0	10.0	48326267	Everything exactly as described, and Eric was very easy to communicate and work with.  Extremely convenient to the Seattle Center and a nice 20 min walk to downtown (or shorter monorail ride). Would certainly stay again.

Eric's place was just what we were looking for.  We were within walking distance to all the areas we needed to be.  There were several nice places to eat nearby.  Parking was not a problem, as we arrived on a Sunday afternoon and left Monday morning. 

The apartment was perfect; we particularly enjoyed Netflix on the projector screen. Everything was clean and well kept. We will most likely try to book with Eric again next time we need to stay in the Seattle area.

70372	5261239	7.0	10.0	55310937	Eric's place was a lovely place to spend a night downtown after a very exhausting day. The space was clean, bright, and comfortable. I liked being able to use the electronic key to access the flat, and the privacy of not needing to meet Eric was rather nice as well--it felt like my own place! The building is older, very charming, and the neighborhood was pretty quiet.
70373	5261239	7.0	10.0	55702152	Eric was very accommodating and we had plenty of privacy here. The place was nice and secure, in Seattle proper and the bed was comfy! Hulu plus was a nice touch too.

We parked in the lot next to the building for a reasonable rate and moved to street parking on Sunday as there were lots of spots available. 
70375	5261239	7.0	10.0	56707270	My dad and I had a great experience staying at Eric's space. Location was great and the building was easy to navigate. Eric had clean trash cans and had a new roll of toilet paper ready for us apron arrival. The only two downfalls of the space was that the kitchen could use some updating (dirty and not many utensils ) and that the TV was super laggy. Overall great experience the space was great for the price. 
70376	5261239	7.0	10.0	56894404	"I arrived to Seattle and Eric was very quick FYI respond to my initial text upon arrival.  He made himself available to buzz me in remotely and I was off and away.

The place is as pictured, and it's very centrally located if you have business downtown or in belltown.  There's a lot of value in this rental.  It provided everything that I needed, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a crash pad that's super convenient and relatively close to everything."

From the description given of the property it is obviously a much loved family home so we find it hard to criticise it. We do feel   though that their description is a little generous and biased and we would not probably have described it as they have.
It is relatively inexpensive, in a nice area,  no problem with street parking and Anna was very pleasant and friendly in all of our dealings with her. "
78800	299817	4.0	10.0	6420049	Great little house on the back side of Cap Hill! Perfect amount of space for an extended stay for my little one & myself (and then my husband later in the trip). We stayed there for about 3 weeks & were wishing we could have stayed the entire summer. Anna was very accommodating with any questions / requests & even delivered a box of the most beautiful organic produce I've ever seen! Great place, cool kinda quirky/arty decor, softest quilt on the master bed I've ever slept under & great location with easy access to everything! Make sure to check out the beautiful hand painted Peter Rabbit bed. Adorable! Thanks Anna, for a wonderful stay in your lovely wee house 3

83590	6120046	7.0	9.0	30745986	Megan was a very accommodating host. I had a question when I first arrived and she answered her phone immediately. She has the cottage full of all kinds of eclectic items and it made the stay very unique. For the price it is unmatched with having access to the whole place and being in a location so close to great views of the water and the skyline of Seattle. While still being able to walk to a variety of restaurants  and bars. I would definitely stay there again.  
83591	6120046	7.0	9.0	32129346	The cottage is in a great location --very central. Fremont offers much in the way of restaurants, cafes, pubs, yoga, music venues, a great organic market nearby (PCC) and quaint shops. Lots of busses run through here so if pretty quick to get almost anywhere in Seattle. The decor is very hippy grandma eclectic as described, with a comfy couch to relax on. As a longtime San Franciscan, I found this very familiar and charming. The highlight was the amazing tempurpedic mattress that felt like sleeping on a cloud. Wifi got spotty towards the end of my stay, which made it difficult to do my late night remote work, but it forced me in the daytime to get out and enjoy the great cafes nearby. p.s. shower has great water pressure.
83592	6120046	7.0	9.0	32997399	Great location. Very central to Fremont and so much to do in the area. We easily found the public dock access to the lake and could walk everywhere. Walking is great, however, I suggest you take public transport to the house. Parking is limited and was very hard to find anything more than 2 or 3 hrs nearby, and so I had to keep moving my car. Sunday Fremont market was awesome! Megan was very welcoming and the house had everything we needed. Great spot to stay!

Location is AWESOME. Down the street from a great brewery, access to running/cycling paths along the water, tons of restaurants & bars.  Only 20 min to downtown by public transport.  We loved Fremont!"

Megan was out of town during our stay, but she made sure we were comfortable reaching her or the neighbors if we needed anything.  

We had a terrific time exploring the area on foot.  When we did drive, parking wasn't as difficult as we anticipated, and it was surprisingly quiet at night for as busy as the area is.  This was a great home base for our trip."
83597	6120046	7.0	9.0	40331174	The LOCATION was awesome. It was so great to sit outside, have a view of some of the city, be within a few blocks of great food and an excellent microbrewery, and Fremont is such a great neighborhood. The lake was just a block away. We walked the 2 miles to UW and rented bikes. The apartment was comfortable and fun to be in. The bus system was easy to use, esp. for going downtown (if you don't need a car, don't get one--you'll need to pay for daytime parking). Megan was very helpful in the lead-up to our trip and was easy to contact once we got there, to answer a few questions.
83598	6120046	7.0	9.0	41932114	Great location - walking/biking distance to a lot of restaurants/bars in a fun neighborhood! Accommodations were cozy. 
83599	6120046	7.0	9.0	44894119	"The ""Lake View Cottage"" in Fremont is a short work to shops and cafes and a short but hilly walk down to the waterfront.  The bed was comfortable.  There is no wifi if that is important to you.  Megan has highly decorated the apartment in a highly personal style with small personal objects everywhere and on every surface. We only stayed two of the 4 nights we had booked so we  had brief contact with Megan.  If you are a compulsive ""neatnik"" who likes things in order this might not be the place for you."
