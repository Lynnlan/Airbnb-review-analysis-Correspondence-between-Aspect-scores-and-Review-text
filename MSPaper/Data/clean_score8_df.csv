Contacted four hosts, and Chris was the only one responded, and responded in time! He apologized for not being able to show me around because his band had a major show during that weekend. (Guys- they do have a GREAT taste in music- come here if you do, too)

The house is in a great neighborhood. You have Trader Joe's right across the street, literally. AND lots of fantastic restaurants, cafe, gift stores, etc. surrounded. This would be the perfect neighborhood to live in. All the things- within walking distance.

You'll be sharing a bathroom with other roommates (but that wasn't a problem for me at all). If you're looking for a place to crash that's within walking distance to everything, this is perfect for you.

I'm very happy with my stay, and hope other guests enjoy the location as well. :)"

Big Friendly house,cosy bedroom in a lively and vibrant neighborhood full of cafes and bars, amazing to chill out in the morning before walking downtown in just over half hour. Chris was also a very sweet host, he came to see me when I arrived to Seattle, gave me the keys and directed me to his house because he was working at that time. 
During my stay I was out all day but we had a few good chat at night. He's really a good fellow! Great music taste and very easy to get along with.
I promised my self to be back in Seattle again and I'll definitely stay at his again!"
1090	5062445	8.0	10.0	35270046	Great location.  Good food nearby and easy bus access.  DEFINITELY give this place a chance.  Chris is super accommodating and if your schedules align is great hang as well.
1091	5062445	8.0	10.0	42254182	Christ is such a nice guy. He gave me a very warm welcome on my first day in Seattle. Introduced the neighborhood and told me a lot of staff about his music. The place is lovely and so quiet at night. I had a memorable stay because of this cute home. And the location is wonderful. Very close to downtown. Just few minutes away. I would definitely recommend Christ's place!
1092	5062445	8.0	10.0	45416946	"Chris is awesome!  Very friendly and welcoming.  Really dig the house and the neighborhood.  

Great location, loved the vibe of the neighborhood and having Trader Joe's and El Diablo Coffee right there.  "
1093	5062445	8.0	10.0	46167437	Chris and his roommates were great hosts! They were very friendly, accommodating, and fun. I traveled to Seattle alone and they made it so I did not feel lonely. The house is located very conveniently to downtown, I did not have a car while I was in Seattle and managed to get around just fine via public transit (and the occasional Uber). I definitely recommend staying at Chris's if you are looking for an affordable and convenient location in Seattle!

Located in the lovely Ballard neighborhood, Lauren's B&B is only a 10 minute drive from popular downtown locations including the Space Needle, is next to a 7-11 convenience store for quick restock, and is within walking distance of awesome Ballard shops. Lauren and Gabriel are also super friendly too! 

Highly recommended especially if you are planning to explore Seattle with a car"

1854	4258515	8.0	9.0	34231248	"Lauren, Gabe, and their children were great hosts during our stay in Seattle. I had previously used an airbnb location in Magnolia which I loved, but it was booked this time around so I hoped Lauren and Gabe's place in Ballard would be as wonderful and it did not disappoint.

Extremely safe neighborhood, extremely close to many big bus lines including 2 direct lines to downtown, and there is even a downtown area a few blocks down from the apartment with major nightlife of its own. 

I didn't spend much time in the apartment during the day but it was a quiet place to sleep which looked exactly like the pictures and I slept more soundly than I ever do at home.

Thank you Lauren and family! :)"
1855	4258515	8.0	9.0	34615698	I appreciate Lauren accommodating us (party of 4) in such short notice. Lauren is pleasant, hospitable, flexible, and unobtrusive. Her home is located in the heart of Ballard near area amenities and attractions. The rooftop deck offers a relaxing oasis above the city streets. Overall, a prime spot with a fantastic host.

1857	4258515	8.0	9.0	36700705	"Lauren and her family were the perfect hosts! Their place in Ballard is comfy, clean and modern and her family were very welcoming and very lovely! 

The location is fantastic, close to so many bars and restaurants, perfectly safe and minutes away from the downtown bus. 

We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle! "
1858	4258515	8.0	9.0	37209196	Good
1859	4258515	8.0	9.0	37707338	Lauren was very kind and accommodating. My friends and I loved the neighbourhood! 
1860	4258515	8.0	9.0	38134616	This is the worst experience with Airbnb, we shared a two bedrooms with Lauren's faimillies with 3 kids and a dog, they go out of their bedroom then we are out of the apartment and go back to the bedroom when we come back, which makes us feel not friendly and uneasy, well we still smell the unpleasant smell of the dog. They didn't wash their dishes and damp the gabage bin  in time as well in the kitchen. The most unfriendly thing is that we can not even leave our heavy bags at her home after 11:00 in the morning of the day we leave back home, which she has mentioned when I check in and let us feel very not friendly, and that is not imaginalble that we hadn't access to the WIFI in such a modern day! I will never come back and live in any Airbnb apartments!
1861	4258515	8.0	9.0	39073563	"La habitación estaba muy limpia y tranquilo. La ubicación es perfecta. Algo fuera del centro de  Seattle, pero uno llega muy rápido y fácil con el transporte al centro. Y en la tarde se puede disfrutar la tranquilidad de Ballard.  

Muy recomendable."
1862	4258515	8.0	9.0	39660914	Lauren's kids are adorable and the free parking was great and it was also great to be able to walk to old Ballard neighborhood and all the seaside parts on Puget Sound. What a fun city!
1863	4258515	8.0	9.0	39950203	Lauren was very kind during our stay. The room is clean and the location is close to lots of fun restaurants and shops in the Ballard area. 
1864	4258515	8.0	9.0	40460705	Lauren and her husband were very welcoming and helpful! I was admittedly a little wary as this was our first time using Airbnb but everything went smoothly. We had 4 adults packed into the room so it was a little tight but we made due. The 3 kids were all very well behaved and quiet.
1865	4258515	8.0	9.0	40858427	Lauren and Gabe's place was in a great location. It was safe and secure and both of them were very kind and friendly. Having a parking space available was a huge bonus!
1866	4258515	8.0	9.0	40974304	Thank Gabe and Lauren for waiting us until midnight. The apartment is very nice. The room was very clean. It was a nice experience!
1867	4258515	8.0	9.0	41630323	Overall, we had a great experience! We were only looking for a place to sleep for a cheap price in a clean place - this is exactly what we found! The place is right next to a RapidRide bus stop, which was perfect for getting downtown. There were a ton of shops, cafes, and restaurants a walk down the street. Lauren and her family were very sweet and helpful. They pretty much just let us do our own thing and gave us plenty of privacy, which was fine! Our room was clean and quaint. The fans in the room kept it at the perfect temperature. The only thing that was kind of a hassle was when my friend went back to the condo during the day to use the restroom and the dogs were in there. He didn't want to mess with them, so he had to go somewhere else - but obviously this is not a big deal, just something to communicate! Like I said, we had a great experience!
1868	4258515	8.0	9.0	41939678	Lauren and her family went out of their way to make our experience comfortable and convenient. The space was small, but nice. Thank you!
1869	4258515	8.0	9.0	43508721	Lauren's place was perfect for where we wanted to be in Ballard.. Easy walk to stores, restaurants and bars.  Easy access to buses for a quick trip downtown .. Very nice host with all of the accommodations we needed
1870	4258515	8.0	9.0	43734942	Lauren and Gabe are excellent hosts. The whole place was beautiful and very clean, laundry access was a big plus, dinner on the rooftop was fun. The family was real quiet and accommodating. Highly recommend staying here if you're willing to share a space with the hosts. 
1871	4258515	8.0	9.0	48478264	"This place is in a great location in Ballard! The rooftop area with bbq is quite nice and if you have time to use the small gym, it also looked nice! 
The apartment itself was, however, a bit of a disappointment. Just very awkward... Basically this is their 3 small children's bedroom complete  with bunk beds and hard mattresses that becomes your room.  I am not opposed to bunk beds. The hard mattress, however,  was not great nor was I sure the blankets on the shelves were clean. The first one I pulled out did not smell at all good.  There was nothing but a fitted sheet on the bed. No pillow. Nothing. I didn't think there was a door at all when I arrived because it slides along the wall with no way to lock it. 
While Gabe was friendly and took me on a little tour when I got there, I didn't find Lauren particularly nice. 
You have to walk across the kitchen and living area to get to your room. (All five of them and the two dogs retreat to the other bedroom.) 
There is a hamster or gerbil with a squeaky wheel that I listened to for a while that night. At some point he was also brought into their room. I was grateful for that but, again, just awkward... Quite easy to feel like you are inconveniencing them. 
The bathroom is over next to their room. The thought of taking up the bathroom with five other people waiting was a bit off putting. I did not shower. 
In addition, while I think it's a great thing to homeschool, knowing all three kids were home all the time and I was occupying their room did not leave me feeling secure or that my things would be left untouched by little hands, even if the kids were all very sweet. (They're still small curious children.) 
I did not complete my stay. In fact I only stayed one night of the three I'd booked. It was all just too awkward... Thank you, Gabe, for trying. 
I really hesitated in leaving a review but I got numerous reminders to please do so from airbnb and I guess I feel other people should know my experience. I texted Lauren twice upon my departure to talk to her about my experience. She did get back to me. Kind of the attitude I found from her while I was there as well. I'm sorry it couldn't be a more positive review."
1872	4258515	8.0	9.0	49708595	The perfect spot to stay in if you're looking to explore the Ballard area. We really enjoyed our stay here, and would definitely stay here again. Very clean and easy to get to. No Wi-Fi in the house though, but easy to find at local cafes and bars and breweries. And there are a lot of breweries nearby!
1873	4258515	8.0	9.0	50052961	Awful experience! I was looking forward to staying at Lauren's; however, she was unresponsive, and after several hours, I let her know that if I didn't hear from her I'd have to make a reservation with a different host. She did not reply to that message until after I had made another reservation. I requested she cancel the reservation as it was the fair thing to do. Only THEN did I get a reply that basically stated she has a strict cancelation policy, refusing to work with me. Note she has a mere 40% response rate. I feel absolutely cheated by her and airbnb.  Avoid. 
3977	9331449	8.0	10.0	55946229	"The room is very nice, with a private bathroom a very nice balcony and in a great area. Only a short drive to downtown and plenty of street parking. The whole house is very nice. It wasn't super tidy but everything was clean. 
We didn't meet the host but communication was permanent, with quick responses. 
I would recommend this property to any visitors, especially if you are renting a car."
3978	9331449	8.0	10.0	56538934	"Varun is a warm and approachable person. He was an excellent host to us. He made it clear that we were welcome in his home and he was thoughtfully attentive to our needs. He responded quickly to messages.
Besides being an urban, modern showpiece, the home was clean, comfortable and spacious. It was everything that was promised. The bed was superb, the shower was hot. We slept soundly in this quiet neighborhood. 
The location was within easy walking distance to good food and coffee. There is great fun to be had in Ballard.
Parking was always easy."
4082	3155785	8.0	9.0	42231253	Kim was great and responsive to meeting up to handoff the key, provide the address, etc.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was a single female traveling alone and felt very safe at Kim and her roommate's place.
4083	3155785	8.0	9.0	42629386	I loved staying with Kim.  She was a great host and the retro vintage house is exactly as advertised.  My room had a private bathroom which made the stay even better.  Highly recommended!
4084	3155785	8.0	9.0	43310332	Kim was warm, friendly, and real. Thanks, Kim! The room I rented was big and clean. It had its own bathroom with shower! I liked the diverse pictures and sculptures through the place.  And I guess I like short sentences. 
4085	3155785	8.0	9.0	46005974	I did not meet Kim during my visit. I stayed in her room while she was out of town. The room is nice and the bathroom and shower were fine. I only briefly met the other roommates. 
7263	7900056	8.0	9.0	47765951	"Jim's place was exactly what the 8 of us were looking for in a nice, clean, no-frills ""basecamp"" for a wedding weekend.  The 4 bedrooms and 4 real beds are a rare commodity in the Wallingford neighborhood, and there was plenty of space for each couple to spread out in privacy AND hang out together in common areas.  The house is in a great spot for walking to coffee, bars, donuts, dinner, grocery, pharmacy, parks, and everything Green Lake has to offer.  Jim's communication was excellent and the experience was as easy as you hope for with a great Airbnb host."
7264	7900056	8.0	9.0	48569165	"We had a group of 9 stay at Jim's apartment, with prior approval. The location and size were great for us. Unfortunately, the apartment was not clean upon our arrival. We notified the property manager that we were a bit disappointed at check in. 

He helped us clean up the dirty floors, bathrooms, and dishes. We also later found had dirty sheets on one bed and issues with the TV and washing machine. 

The most disappointing part of our stay was dealing with the owner, Jim. He was difficult to deal with throughout our stay and put a black cloud over our vacation.

I would not recommend staying at this location - save yourself the headaches.
"
7265	7900056	8.0	9.0	49500898	"The house was even better than the description. My friends and I had a wonderful stay at Jim's place. The location and size was excellent. Communication was very quick and straightforward and we had no issues whatsoever.

A+, highly recommend"
7266	7900056	8.0	9.0	50394792	We rented Jim's place for an out of town group of sales reps.  The location was great for us, since our office North of the city.  If you have time, the park is very close.  Easy to find, and the street parking was easy as well.  The home/duplex was plenty spacious for our guests, and we took advantage of the kitchen to eat in.  Jim was very quick to respond to emails, and we had no need to contact him during the stay, everything was in order as described.  We already talked about using the home again next year.
7267	7900056	8.0	9.0	52713020	Vi är mycket nöjda med huset vi bodde i, perfekt när vi var många. Bra att huset hade kodlås så att man slipper hålla koll på nycklar. Vi hade även närhet till vår släkting vi hälsade på och att huset ligger nära den underbara Green Lake. Husvärden var lätt att få kontakt med både före och under vistelsen.
8077	3939683	8.0	8.0	47516624	"This place was super nice. Location was good, facilities were all ok and host was so kind! 
I really like this place and recommend here!"
9631	3732076	8.0	9.0	17245457	"The neighborhood is beautiful, tho it's a little distant from shopping and the like.
Luckily the house has long boards and bike that one can borrow and a major trail right across the street.
They were still building up the location when I arrived but it is lovely area, lots of space. Multiple kitchens and bathrooms and lots of other resources. It was lovely."
9632	3732076	8.0	9.0	17716207	"The neighbourhood and view is fantastic; I stayed on the top floor, and when working from the couch you can see the Seattle skyline out over the water.

The bunks are comfortable and there is lots of workspace throughout the house. The only complaint I have is that the top floor/top bunks can get hot; some fans would be nice :)

Besides that, it was a fantastic stay. Everything was really clean, and the other housemates were very friendly. I'm coming back here whenever I visit Seattle."
9633	3732076	8.0	9.0	18587299	Once again, it was a very pleasant stay. They got a really cool atmosphere that I'm sure anyone in tech would appreciate.
9634	3732076	8.0	9.0	19093088	I enjoyed my time at the house.  The host was welcoming.  The house was quiet, and thus a great space to get work done.  The location is safe and close to Fremont, which is a great small-town-feeling neighborhood.  
9635	3732076	8.0	9.0	24161395	Awesome house and very comfy bed!  It's social, almost hostel-like, and the other guests were friendly.  The location is fantastic!
9636	3732076	8.0	9.0	29679899	"cor36 was an amazing experience! The house is newly remodeled and painted and has great furniture and facilities for getting work done: big tables, lots of chairs, comfy couches, and bikes/helmets/locks for getting around. From my first night, I met interesting people working on their own startups and projects, which inspired me to get work done on my own startup. Matt the house captain was friendly and available.

During the day, I had most of the house to myself, and often invited friends over to co-work with me. I really liked the occasional hack night, like making an LED beacon when the International Space Station was overhead.

Keep in mind, this is a shared living situation, with 4 bunk beds in the same room."
9637	3732076	8.0	9.0	31395937	Stayed the second time here and i really totally enjoy the hotel with all the hackers meetup ... i enjoy the room again.. 
10188	9866461	8.0	10.0	58253926	Eric was incredibly polite and accommodating. His place was clean and as pictured. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. Building has plenty of parking and close to a lot of restaurants and bars. Very convenient and a great value. I would recommend stating here. 
10430	3888986	8.0	10.0	41576826	"This is really an amazing place to stay! I am really excited to meet lots of friends during my stay. Especially enjoyed talking about tech stuff with people who have different background. The house weekly party is also very very fun! I also gave a talk during my stay, which is really interesting. It's really a nice experience and I actually invite one of my friends to stay at the same place. Finally, I want to thank the house manager, Paul, who is a great and smart guy! Really enjoyed talking with you and your insightful opinion really impressed me! See you later, Paul! I highly recommend this place, especially people who like technology and willing to share you mind with others! This is definitely the best choice!

11769	15108	8.0	9.0	358030	Bob was a great host. His house was very well located for our needs and we really enjoyed his private, tranquil backyard. He was even nice enough to post some clothing home we had mistakenly left behind.
11770	15108	8.0	9.0	396968	Bob was a great host. He was very accommodating, his home and the room were as described, and he was gracious enough to wait up and show me around when I said I would be arriving late. 
11771	15108	8.0	9.0	456716	What a neat place with a lovely backyard - great location, great host, great pets!
11772	15108	8.0	9.0	919284	A friendly place.  Thanks, Bob.
11773	15108	8.0	9.0	2693792	The place was comfortable and it was not difficult to go to the city by a car.  My best things in there is a lovely dog and cats. Super cute.Thanks for making us feel at home.  ありがとう！
11774	15108	8.0	9.0	3962261	Quiet, cozy home in a neighborhood.  Just 1/2 mile from my grandchildren.  On the bus line, easy walk to Green Lake.  Sweet pets, very clean and nice.  
11775	15108	8.0	9.0	4324698	"I am absolutely satisfied with Bob's plaсе. First, it is the best location in Seattle. Green lake- it is something amazing!! Its a perfect place for walking, jogging, bicycling , kayaking, taking pictures and every thing!!  There are a lot of cafes , restorans , but at the same time it's very picefull, not crowded place, very  convenient to get downtown and university district. Second, Bob-is great! Hi is  friendly, helpfull and welcoming like host  and  interesting like a person! And his lovely pets are so cute! 
Thank you, Bob! "
11776	15108	8.0	9.0	5155676	Bob's room was just what I needed. A quiet place to rest and work for a bit before heading to climb Rainier. Bob was welcoming and fun to talk to. He has a lovely backyard with so many cozy places to curl up and read. It was a treat to stay with him! 
11777	15108	8.0	9.0	5201006	We had a quick overnight stay and we had a great time.  Bob was wonderful and we loved the sweet cats! The location to Greenlake was convenient for a morning run and the backyard is fantastic! 
11778	15108	8.0	9.0	5352889	Bob is a great host. Comfortable house with nice downstairs bedroom, comfortable bed. Shared bathroom but not a problem to access. Very close to downtown Green Lake restaurants,  Thanks Bob!
11779	15108	8.0	9.0	5518324	"Real estate agents say, ""Location location location."" This charming home is, ""Location location location location location location."" Oh, did I mention it is in one of the best, hippest neighborhoods in the Seattle area? Green Lake is a scenic country oasis within the city of Seattle. 

I treated a 19 year-old German student, Jasper, to three nights at Bob's house because my place, and the timing, was impractical. Bob was enjoyable to do business with, albeit by phone, and it felt as though we were old pals. I look forward to meeting him in person. The accommodations were delightful as promised, according to Jasper. I did see the inside, and the yard, and agree. Although I am unfamiliar with the German language, I believe Jasper's ear-to-ear grin at Bob's house spoke volumes. "
11780	15108	8.0	9.0	5537121	Nice location. You're sharing the bathroom and house with college students. Bed is ultra firm.
11781	15108	8.0	9.0	5878538	We had a great time in Seattle at Bob's place. The room is nice and cozy, it was great to meet Bob and he gave us some excellent tips on what to do and see in Seattle. Definitely recommended.
11782	15108	8.0	9.0	5993299	I stayed at Bob's five nights and had a pleasant visit. Bob was friendly and helpful, very easygoing. The house is a bit outside Seattle's center but well connected by buses.The neighborhood is nice with a beautiful lake and park, and restaurants, close by. The room was comfortable enough and I had no problems with the other guests or using the bathroom. It's next to the kitchen and you can hear the conversations, but people were respectful and it was not an issue for me. The hot tub in the yard was wonderful in the evenings. It was a good experience and I would definetely stay at Bob's when I am in Seattle again. 
11783	15108	8.0	9.0	6281261	"Wir waren 12 Tage bei Bob und ,wurden sehr herzlich aufgenommen.
Es war alles so wie beschrieben.Der Garten ist eine Oase der Ruhe,
und man konnte den Wirlpool benutzen oder einfach nur entspannen
Dass wir das Bad teilen mussten war auch kein Problem.Die Katzen genossen ihre Streicheleinheiten,und wenn unsere Zimmertür offen war ,schwupps,lagen sie im Bett! (wenn nicht,kratzten sie an der Tür ),Bob ist ein ausergewöhlicher hilfsbereiter und lieber Gastgeber.Ich habe ihm so gerne zugehört wenn er auf  seinem  Klavier spielte oder singend das Geschirr spülte.Dieses Haus lebt und hat eine positive Energie.Leider spreche ich nur ein wenig Englisch,und doch klappte die Verständigung weil Bob sich sehr große Mühe gab.
Bob ,wenn es wirklich klappt dass wir uns sehen wenn du in Italien bist werde ich bis dahin mein Englisch aufbessern!!!! 
Danke für alles, Es war  schön dich kennenzulernen.

Liebe Grüße auch von Franziska

11784	15108	8.0	9.0	6337875	The house was comfortable, and the cats were lovely, but the garden was definitely the highlight. Thanks for being such a nice host, Bob, we'll definitely come down another time soon. :)
11785	15108	8.0	9.0	6377834	bob was wonderful. its extremely close to the lake and an easy taxi ride from most things.  def recommend staying with him and his two lovable cats
11786	15108	8.0	9.0	6440029	This was my first airbnb experience and i'm a fan.  Big thanks to Bob and for him sharing his nice room in Seattle.  He was very helpful in providing quick advice to local eateries and coffee shops as well as make my stay as comfortable and easy as possible.  If you stay here I advise you to check out Green Lake sunsets- stunning views only a few blocks away!
11787	15108	8.0	9.0	6481865	This room was in a great location and the room was clean and comfortable. A surprise bonus was the host Bob, who with his friendliness.generosity and openness made me feel instantly at home. Bob rents out more than one room in the house and I got the impression that it is always buzzing with activity and socializing!  This might not be a first choice for someone looking for quiet, alone time free of pets, but for me, it was a fun experience and I would definitely return! Thanks Bob!
11788	15108	8.0	9.0	6691479	"Bob was an incredibly chill and fun host. We felt very welcome at Bob's place, almost like family! We joined in on one of his many game nights and had a blast while there. He was very helpful, and also let us his kitchen pretty much every day, as well as his collection of spices and seasoning! 

I highly recommend staying at Bob's place if your passing through Seattle, or staying there longer term for school, etc. "
11789	15108	8.0	9.0	6782583	Bob was a gracious host whose location was ideal for me.  His other house members equally nice and sharing.  This was a fine entree back into Seattle after 7 years away.
11790	15108	8.0	9.0	8109789	Bob's place is a true community.  Besides the others rooming in the house, many of Bob's friends stop by for an evening  of pleasant talk and board games.  One can join in around the kitchen table or retreat to one's room without feeling pressured to participate.  Bob is an extraordinary raconteur as well as working actor, songster and piano player.  He is full of energy and skill.  The house is situated just a block from Green Lake which I am told is the busiest park in Washington.  Walking, jogging, or wheeling around the lake is a favorite form of exercise for what seems like the majority of north Seattle.  I stayed at Bob's for a month and a half.  I used the city transit for nearly all my travel and found it to be convenient.  Two major routes stop just a short block away and several others are nearby.  Restaurants, pubs,  Ben and Jerry's ice cream, coffee shops and a couple grocery stores are within walking distance.  Bottom line is I loved my stay and next time I'm in Seattle Bob will be first on my list for lodging.
11791	15108	8.0	9.0	8748809	Staying with Bob was wonderfull! Exceeded all my expectations. Thoroughly enjoyable and very relaxed. The cats are a treat and the hot tub is a dream and Bob will provide great entertainment and conversation. The bed was very comfortable, I didn't want to leave!!! I recommend staying with Bob highly. A home away from home.Thank you Bob, I can't wait to return!!
11792	15108	8.0	9.0	11300173	"The five weeks I spent at Bobs in Seattle passed way to fast! When I arrived I had a warm welcome with homemade soup and waffles. The kitchen was well equipped and it was fun to cook there. It was always fun to meet up for chats in the nice common areas with Bob, the other housemates, friends or the two lovely cats. Also the neighbourhood, Greenlake, is a good place if you are motivated to discover places that are not on every tourists schedule, such as Ballard, Wallingford, Ravenna or the University District - all easy accesible by bus.
Go ahead - if you wanna have a good time in Seattle, book a place at Bobs! :-)"
11793	15108	8.0	9.0	12414291	Very warm and welcoming place. No false advertisements  !!  
11794	15108	8.0	9.0	17264265	All in all it was an exceptional living experience with Bob! It was a friendly, quaint and welcome atmosphere with an awesome back yard to boot.
11795	15108	8.0	9.0	17399370	Bob met me at the door, very friendly and welcoming. The room was exactly as the pictures showed, the house was very charming and eclectic. I really want to know how he got that gorgeous grand piano in there!  He had towels laid out, fresh flowers on the nightstand, and played some great piano music I could hear while I was in the shower. :). His cats were so friendly one tried to stow away in my backpack. 
11796	15108	8.0	9.0	17606809	Bob was very welcoming and really helped us out by approving our stay at the last minute. We were only in the house for one night, so we spent very little time there. House is in a great location...walking distance to a couple bus stops and Green Lake. A little disappointed with the cleanliness of the house and room (the room smelled like cats and mildew). Also did not realize the house was shared with several other AirBnB guests, giving it a hostel feel. 
11797	15108	8.0	9.0	17868554	Bob was a gracious host, very friendly. We felt welcomed in his home and our needs for quiet time were considered. The house is in a great neighborhood in Seattle and has an awesome back yard. It is a little bit of a funky house and I would recommend coming prepared for that experience. Like most older houses, sound travels well. Any comers here should love cats, because there are two very present male kitties living here. 
11798	15108	8.0	9.0	17984735	Bob is friendly and welcoming. The neighborhood is cool. Before booking this place make sure your not annoyed by cat smell. 
11799	15108	8.0	9.0	18685637	Bobs place was in a great location. Close to Green Lake on a quite beautiful street!
11800	15108	8.0	9.0	19766648	We had a lovely time at Bob's house met his two nice cats! Bob is a fantastic nice host en we like to come back next year.
11801	15108	8.0	9.0	20660427	The house is great. Good location, near the beautiful Green Lake Park and close to bus stops. Bob is an amazing host, very friendly and willing to go out of his way to help you. The bed is very nice, the bathroom clean, the kitchen fully equipped. I honestly wish I could have stayed more time.
11802	15108	8.0	9.0	21189557	Bob was very kind and accommodating in letting me stay at his home on last minute's notice, though we really didn't get the chance to meet.  The bed was comfy, and the neighborhood was very quiet for being so close to the bustle of Green Lake--walking distance to shops, restaurants and the local health food store.  Lovely kitties, too!
11803	15108	8.0	9.0	29287529	Very pleasant stay. He respected the fact that I was there for school and therefore didn't have much social time, but always invited me to join him and others in playing board games, etc. He was also very helpful in suggesting directions to places where I needed to go as well as having a genuine interest in what I was studying.
11804	15108	8.0	9.0	33379182	Bob is amazing host, he is very friendly and made us feel at home. The room is cozy and we love it! And Bob is a wonderful singer !! I hope we can watch him in another concert.
11805	15108	8.0	9.0	42658046	The room/ house was everything that it promised to be. A block away from buses to downtown, the supermarket, etc. A block away from Green Lake where I spent many memorable evenings. Bob is very friendly and welcoming. I cooked quite a bit in the kitchen and he very graciously let me use spices/pots/containers etc. The hot tub in the backyard and Pollux, Bob's cat, were a bonus! I grew up scared of cats but I got quite attached to Pollux by the end of my stay. I had a lot of fun conversations with Bob whenever we overlapped in the kitchen. I'd highly recommend the house to anyone looking to stay in a picturesque neighborhood while being close to downtown.
11806	15108	8.0	9.0	45144156	"I stayed in one of the upstairs bedrooms for 6 months, and have visited twice since moving out of the state.  Overall, I had a great experience living here.  Bob is a wonderful host and friend.  Will stay in touch for a long time, I'm sure.  He was very reasonable and understanding with everyone living in his home.  

The house is only 2 blocks from Green Lake and I always felt safe walking nearby.  It's a quiet area with no real noise pollution, like police sirens or thumping bass.  The jacuzzi and garden were great to relax in.  On-street parking was never, ever an issue, and there was plenty to do and see within walking distance.  The nearest bus lines run on Wallingford Ave, only a block away. You can go to U District or  or downtown without having to transfer.  I commuted to Redmond every day by bus and never felt like it was an epic journey.  

Would definitely recommend and will probably return if I come back to town again.
"
11807	15108	8.0	9.0	48715283	"Bob is absolutely fantastic.  With late night conversations in the kitchen, boisterous game nights, morning singing and songwriting sessions, and an overall 'what's mine is yours attitude', he makes you feel as if you belonged at his house all along.

Pollox the cat is reserved, but loves rough attention when he's looking for it.  The house is incredibly eclectic and lived-in, and Bob has a habit of collecting memorabilia.

You'll be missing out terribly if all you're looking for is a clean and tidy place to crash."
11808	15108	8.0	9.0	52845073	Bob's house in Green Lake makes for a great home in Seattle.  The room was exactly as described and Bob went out of his way to make me feel at home.  Highly recommend.
11809	15108	8.0	9.0	53566511	Bob was a friendly and gracious host who communicates efficiently and effectively - he is mature and strikes an excellent balance between giving you your space but also being there if you need him. He is also an excellent source of information about the city's transportation system and anything different, from a tourists perspective, about Seattle. Don't hesitate to book his clean, quaint and well maintained (and sign posted) private room! Pollux the cat is a wonderful companion too! Highly recommended.....
11810	15108	8.0	9.0	54716158	We chose Bob's house because of its excellent location near Green Lake. We decided not to stay when we saw that the room was small and dark, next to the shared kitchen and bathroom. There were more people staying in the house than we expected, making the small, over-furnished space claustrophobic. Handwritten signs everywhere and odor of cat box contributed to the unpleasant feel of the house. The advertised hot tub was without water and clearly hadn't been used in a while.
12653	6278181	8.0	10.0	44183234	"This is a beautiful house in a very nice walkable area of Seattle. Right next to a Thai restaurant, two cafes, a great brunch spot and an awesome pub. It is also 3 block from Greenlake Park which is surrounded by restaurants and cafes and it is a joy to walk around, our son loved the wading pool. 
Sierra was super accommodating when it came to sleeping arrangements, it is always hard to make a toddler sleep away from home but he slept like a log this time, Sierra even left a little teddy bear for him!
"
12654	6278181	8.0	10.0	48607816	"This place is really nice and Sierra was excellent to work with.
Excellent neighborhood too, with some nice cafes and bars just a few doors down. Worked out perfectly!"
13979	9300972	8.0	8.0	57705226	Didn't get a chance to meet Caitlyn and get husband but she was very easy to get a hold of and explained everything clearly. The place was lovely, in a great location with buses nearby that take you straight into downtown. The snack and pamphlets left along with the toiletries were a lovely touch by the hosts.
14971	5020861	8.0	10.0	27368379	Great
14972	5020861	8.0	10.0	29634999	Christen was a very gracious and welcoming host. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was very spacious and quiet. Being able to eat breakfast on the back porch in the morning was a very nice touch. Christen even cooked a delicious homemade soufflé for my stay. The location is perfect for visiting the university and is right next to coffee shops, restaurants and stores. 
14973	5020861	8.0	10.0	31953054	Christen is a wonderful host! The room is clean and cozy. The location is also perfect for me! It's very close to UW and I'm able to visit my friend everyday without taking a long trip. I really enjoy my stay here.
14974	5020861	8.0	10.0	35002323	Christen was a great hostess. She was very considerate and helpful in regards to my crazy schedule. Her apartment was spacious and conveniently located next to a lively part of town. It is also less than a 15 minute walk to campus. I would absolutely recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay near the Washington University campus.
14975	5020861	8.0	10.0	36209539	I could stay very comfortable thanks to her kind assistance. Since I went to bed and got up early to manage terrible conference schedule, she understood my situation very well.
14976	5020861	8.0	10.0	38402342	房子的位置很不错，就在华盛顿大学区里面，房东很热情好客。
14977	5020861	8.0	10.0	39674222	"Christen was very nice and very accommodating.  The apartment is at a great location, and if you are in Seattle to visit the University, this is the perfect spot for it.  It's also close to lots of cheap and tasty places to eat.

The apartment is fine, but it definitely has a feel of a college apartment - somewhat messy and not perfectly clean.  For example, I noticed halfway through the stay that the room had a funky smell.  Christen was very apologetic and immediately set out to clean the place, but the smell was there nonetheless.  Also, you’re sleeping on her room, while she sleeps on a sofa-bed in the living room.  In most other places I have stayed in AirBnB, there is some separation of the host space and the guest space, but in this case there wasn’t any.  Finally, this is an apartment with a dog (albeit a tiny one) - there were mornings that I found little puddle of pee or a poo in the bathroom (never anywhere else).  Christen again was very apologetic and always took care of things right away, but this is just something for future guests to keep in mind: these things happen, it’s natural when there is a dog living in the house.

All said, the stay was fine, I would stay again, and I would recommend it to others (specially because of the very nice host), as long as you are aware that this is like staying in a college apartment with roommates."
14978	5020861	8.0	10.0	41811767	"I stayed here for a week while attending an event at the KeyArena in downtown Seattle. The room was clean and quiet, Christen was a great host, and it was an easy 15 minute Uber ride to get downtown.

There were only 2-prong outlets in the room so I had to charge my laptop in the living room. So bring a power strip if you're like me and travel with a bunch of electronics."
14979	5020861	8.0	10.0	43648704	One bedroom apartment close to UW campus, convenient to restaurants and groceries, good public transportation. Christen was very welcoming and hospitable. Bedroom is comfortable and private, but you are sharing a 1 bedroom apt; Christen sleeps on the sofa bed in the living room. Full kitchen--fridge, stove dishwasher, microwave, coffee.  Had some trouble with the wireless but Christen got it fixed quick.
14980	5020861	8.0	10.0	48181267	Christen was nice and hospitable. Room and bed is big and comfortable. Location is perfect for UW. I would stay again and I would recommend it to others.
14981	5020861	8.0	10.0	50481817	Christen was a great host! The bed was comfortable, there was always food & coffee readily available and she always made sure to check if I had everything I needed. Location is perfect if you're visiting UW. Would definitely stay here again if i can. 
14982	5020861	8.0	10.0	51806588	I was in town for an interview at UW, and the location was fantastic.  Christine was very accommodating, even with her busy schedule and my busy schedule.  It was quiet, so I was able to prepare for my interview in peace.
14983	5020861	8.0	10.0	53949539	The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14984	5020861	8.0	10.0	57726439	Christen wasn't there during my stay, but she left the key very accessible for us and checked in with us to make sure everything was ok throughout the weekend.  The location is close to Capitol Hill and University of Washington.  Overall, great experience!
15127	9134196	8.0	8.0	55236426	it's ok
15225	1549973	8.0	7.0	7026986	The apartment was clean, basic and sufficient.  Furniture is definitely cheap ikea stuff, except possibly the couch.  The queen bed seemed small for a queen bed, I think it was actually a double sized bed, since it was easy to make my feet go over the edge.  Pillows were similarly small and the sheets & blankets were similarly cheap. 
15226	1549973	8.0	7.0	15920668	A very helpful and nice host. The listing was everything it said it would be, and very close to the UW campus. Overall would recommend to anyone as a cheap alternative to a hotel.
15227	1549973	8.0	7.0	17891106	I live in Seattle, and rented this unit when I had friends in town. I'm familiar with the neighborhood so new what to expect. Everything was great and was exactly what we needed, mostly just a place to sleep, and spent our days enjoying the city.  The place was comfortable and clean, and there is a small selection of dishes, thought we ate out mostly. If you're planning on spending a lot of time cooking, I recommend bringing some cooking supplies, (and bottle opener/wine opener). Though everything served our purposes just fine. Melissa was very nice and I certainly have no complaints!
15228	1549973	8.0	7.0	18278830	We had no problems with our stay, check in was easy and smooth.  The apartment is very modest with limited amenities, but worked for us.
15229	1549973	8.0	7.0	18549317	"Upsides:
(i) great location (2 or 3 blocks away from UW. Approximately 5-min walk to University Way and 8-min walk to UW campus)
(ii) spacious (this is a big one-bed room with an over-sized living room)
(iii) blazing fast internet (I used it for a video-conference on WebEx and watching on-line streaming videos all the time) 
Downsides:
(i) loud noise (this is not a quiet building as advertised. Instead, the living room faces a main street where heavy traffic coming in from high way all day. Even worse, this unit is located less than 10 feet from the back of a hotel and the bedroom faces the laundry room and trash dumpsters of the hotel. As a result, the laundry machines send loud noise to the bedroom throughout day and night, and the garbage truck comes in around 7am every other day)  
(ii) parking fees (the host charges $8 for parking)
(iii) old complex (the wall is paper thin so you can hear someone talking or watching tv upstairs and next door)
The host seems to control many apartments in that neighborhood so you have many options. Avoid this property unless you can fall asleep no matter what.    
"
15230	1549973	8.0	7.0	18823835	"The good: Melissa is a wonderful person and was incredibly kind to us. We foolishly locked ourselves out the first day and Melissa was kind enough to let us back in without taking a ton of time. Also she brought us extra towels and made sure the place was set up for us. Really, I can't praise Melissa enough for being so nice.

Also the apartment was exceptionally clean, like just had cleaners do a deep clean type clean.

Also it's relatively inexpensive, close to bus lines into downtown and near some decent college restaurants. 

The less good: The pictures are not representative of this space. It really is a bare-bones College style apartment. Old building. Dingy common space. The bedroom was also really noisy from the nearby laundry room and back alley used by trucks. This was all fine with us because we were just sleeping there and the price is/was right."
15231	1549973	8.0	7.0	22559257	I arrived early and was able to leave my luggage in a different room, which I appreciated. Somewhat less nice was the difference between the space I ended up getting and the original I had rented. Ms Yao had unfortunately scheduled some renovations for the day of my arrival and I ended up with a different apartment which was less well furnished than the one advertised. However she was very accommodating and I was perfectly content with the apartment I ended up getting.
15581	6575407	8.0	10.0	48336309	Great location and beautiful view.  Close to downtown, 10 min drive.  Set in the University of Wash neighborhood with many activities. Great hosts and all around nice accommodation.
15641	7649837	8.0	9.0	41048112	"Nice apartment with great amenities. We were there during a summer heatwave and there was no ac or a fan. We literally barely got a wink of sleep due to just dying of heat. Wish we could have enjoyed the space but it was just too hot. 

"
15642	7649837	8.0	9.0	41695423	房主炒鸡友好热心负责，房子环境条件炒鸡赞，studio非常整洁，房子距离UW很近生活很方便，房间里日常用品齐全生活十分舒适。好评！
15643	7649837	8.0	9.0	42940543	"I did not meet Luyan but she was the most gracious communicator.
  
The studio itself was indeed upscale as advertised and well stocked with goodies provided by the host.  The location of the studio is  a good base to see the main attractions of Seattle.  The neighborhood seemed safe and close to Trader Joes and other stores.

Like the previous reviewer, I was there during a heat wave and the studio was very warm during the day and through a good part of the night.  I can say that is was somewhat uncomfortable. Perhaps if a fan was provided it would help. 

The main bed was comfortable.  The other sofa bed was small and short, so if you are over 5"" 6"" or so, you probably wont be comfortable sleeping in it. 

 If you have a car, I found the free parking in the neighborhood to be challenging.  The closest parking was mostly required but there is unrestricted parking on the over side of 45th St but it was hard at times to find a free spot.  There are also some paid parking lots not too far away - but I'm a cheapskate and I did not use them.  

There is constant noise, day and night, from the freeway when the window is open.  This may be an issue if you are sensitive to noise.

The key pickup and drop off was through the service KeyCafe and is located at a nearby coffeehouse, Trabant.  This process was relatively painless.  However, Trabant opens at 8:30 on Sunday and I had 6 a.m. flight so I had to have my daughter drop off the keys later.  A minor inconvenience but may be an issue for you if you do not have someone to drop off the keys for you.

The internet wifi is very fast and I was able to hook up my iPad with the provided cable to the TV and stream movies.  I don't think there were cable TV channels available.

Luyan does not charge a cleaning deposit so the studio is expected to be left clean.  She is very clear on her expectations.  I didn't mind cleaning but this may not be everyone's cup of tea.

All in all, a nice studio in a convenient location that is priced right for this area with a friendly communicating host.
"
15644	7649837	8.0	9.0	43144827	Nice place, almost a hotel room, came as advertised. On the one hand there's cleaning, on the other hand there's saving the money. We lucked into a parking space right in front on Sunday night, had some good Greek food after a five minute walk. Convenient to U of W.
15645	7649837	8.0	9.0	44001490	Luyan is a great host and her place is wonderful. She is very helpful, communicates with her guests very well, and even provides lovely snacks. The apartment is very nice with an awesome view of the city. Some may see the required cleaning as a drawback, but Luyan has set everything up so that it's really quite effortless. The area was wonderful too; it had lots of restaurants and bars nearby, and is just a quick ride to downtown or Ballard. I'd love to stay at Luyan's the next time I visit Seattle, I had a wonderful stay.
15646	7649837	8.0	9.0	44686404	"Luyan is a very responsible host and I spent two great nights at her place. 

Before I arrive, she sent me a clear and detail apartment guide which contained basically everything I need to know for my stay. Her apartment was nice and clean, close to UW and downtown. 

Since I was travelling alone, I had some safety concerns at the very beginning. After I arrived, I found I didn't need to worry about it at all. The neighborhood is safe. In addition, there is on-site building management staffs. Moreover, a key fob is needed in order to get in the building and use the elevator. 

"
15647	7649837	8.0	9.0	45894102	Great location, modern and clean apartment, all you need for a weekend in Seattle. 
15648	7649837	8.0	9.0	46796470	Great place, good location, inexpensive, although the stay was a little bumpy for us. The apartment felt like a very cozy dorm and was very lovely. We had an amazing time in Seattle, and this spot was a perfect launching pad. You do have to do all your own cleaning (and it's a bit of work) but we knew that going in, but somehow we forgot to do the dishes amid mopping, vacuuming, laundry and trash duty :( . Luyan was very responsive, and although it was a little tricky to arrange pickup and drop off of keys with her being out of town - our key pickup window was very small due to flying in at 1145pm and the cafe we were supposed to drop the keys off at was closing down permanently the next day. Everything worked out in the end though! And we even got to spend some quality time on the roof which was furnished and had an awesome view. I highly recommend this lovely pad, and I'd probably stay there again next time I'm in Seattle!
15649	7649837	8.0	9.0	47783951	"Luyan was a very responsive host who clearly cares that those using the space feel comfortable and welcome. She was mostly prompt with email responses to any questions that I had. However, I do not think that the first word in the title of the apartment can be 'Clean' -- I got this place for my parents and when we all walked in, there were dirty dishes in the sink and the bathroom clearly had not been cleaned for a while. 

The location is great, the price is also good for the location -- my folks liked the bed a lot and slept well, they also felt very safe since the apartment is on the 7th floor. 

If you plan to do any cooking, there are extremely limited cookware supplies - we struggled to find plates, cups and a coffee pot - so I would not plan on eating in. "
15726	1773803	8.0	9.0	8144167	"A cozy apartment in the middle of the university district. There's plenty to do nearby on ""the ave."" Also there's a farmer's market every Saturday which has locally grown vegetables/fruits/meats and cheeses. It was only about a twenty minute drive to get to most other areas or sites; the apartment is in a great location.

Sheldon is a wonderful host that will tell you everything you need to know about the city, as well as really making you feel at home. He's extremely easy to contact and always promptly answers any questions about where to eat or what to see. Sheldon even took us tailgating with him to a Seahawks game. He is very inviting and left us with a great experience."
15727	1773803	8.0	9.0	8490699	"Sheldon was a gracious host. He was attentive. He checked in via text message, and ended every conversation/note, asking if there was anything he could do for me and my family. 
The apartment was a perfect getaway for us. We have been at Children's Hospital, and the bed was comfortable and the whole place was quiet. The location is perfect for anyone wanting to spend a week or more in the U District. Or if you are in town for a Huskey/Seahawks/Mariners game. If the Seahawks are in town, you will probably be invited to a wonderful Tailgate by Sheldon.
If you do have any challenges with the apartment, Sheldon will take care of the issue promptly.  He is like the greatest of waiters; there when you need him, but not over-bearing, and lets you enjoy the space and his neighborhood."
15728	1773803	8.0	9.0	8924892	"Sheldon was fabulous! We booked same-day and he responded quickly and was flexible. The apartment is quite spacious with a large sectional and cute den space in addition to the bedroom. 

You really cannot get closer to ""The Ave"" in the University District. This apartment sits in the center of the action and there are no shortages of busses to get around the city.

We would definitely stay here again! "
15729	1773803	8.0	9.0	8988146	"Sheldon was a great host with a lot of advices. The apartment is vast and clean.
As someone said previously, you are right on ""The Ave"" and there are TONS of restaurants around. 
Unfortunately, we didn't find U-district to be a nice neighborhood. Even though we were on the third floor, we could hear very clearly people in the back alley at night as if they were sharing the room with us. 
The kitchen is equipped with a lot of wine-related tools, but has no toaster.
Although the ad says the contrary, there is no wifi in the apt. You are surrounded by cafés and other places offering free wifi, but you cannot check your mails in the comfort of the huge couch."
15730	1773803	8.0	9.0	9106387	Sheldon was a phenomenal host! he made sure that all my arrangements were taken care of, and he was very understanding of my somewhat hectic schedule. His place was in an incredibly convenient location, and if you have anything you need to do in or near UW this could not be a more perfect place. The apartment itself was very clean, extremely spacious, and very comfortable. Highly recommend!
15731	1773803	8.0	9.0	9210221	Sheldon was a very attentive and helpful host who was easy to communicate with. He met with me at a convenient time and helped me bring my luggage in, showed me all around the apartment, and told me a lot of information about Seattle and nearby restaurants. The apartment was conveniently located in the center of the UW campus village area where there are a number of restaurants and shops. He was considerate enough to accommodate my complex travel schedule and I appreciated that very much. The apartment was warm and well equipped for a nice stay. 
15732	1773803	8.0	9.0	9354992	"Sheldon was a great host! Communication was extremely easy which made meeting up no problem at all. He made sure we felt welcome and comfortable in his home which is always a plus. The place itself is better than the pictures. The location is perfect for walking around the u-district; free parking is just around the corner! I would gladly stay here again. 

Thank you! "
15733	1773803	8.0	9.0	9428674	Thanks again for everything. Had a great stay in Seattle, Sheldon was a great host, the appartement is in the student district, very close to lots of good restaurants. 
15734	1773803	8.0	9.0	9800259	His apartment is really great. It's cosy, beautiful, has every tools you need, and the location it's perfect, it's close to everything you need. Sheldon is a really nice host. He was always in touch with us all the time, showing up quickly everytime we needed to solve anything. I'd definetly rent the apartment again if I had the chance.
15735	1773803	8.0	9.0	9841070	"Shel is responsible, personable and no mystery. I prefer dealing with straight forward people and that is what I got with Shel. The location of the apt is great!!!! The building is old, the apartment is a little drafty, you will hear street noise, and the hot water is sparse BUT for the price, location and personality of Shel you will be getting a great deal! I would rent again (I went with my 5 year old and his ""aunt""). We had a great experience! I am already planning my next trip up! Shel is very nice. Check around and you will not find a better crash pad!"
15736	1773803	8.0	9.0	9906044	Shelden and his place were great. Was in town for business at UW and the location was perfect. Area was bustling but apartment away from the street. Comfortable, spacious accommodations. Check in and check out were a breeze and Shel was way responsive. Very highly recommended!
15737	1773803	8.0	9.0	9935340	Sheldon was a good host.
15738	1773803	8.0	9.0	9986292	Sheldon was very hospitable. He was there if we had any questions and let us know about many great places to eat. We liked the grungy University side of town. Apartment is old with no central heat, but with heavy comforter, heated blanket and space heater we were just fine. Good location if you're visiting the university. Only thing I recommend is bringing sheets and wash cloths. Other than that everything was great!
15739	1773803	8.0	9.0	10066612	Shel was good about checking in via text to make sure things were going well (and to recommend restaurants) and the apartment was great - interesting building with a lot of character and fantastic location.  We really enjoyed ourselves.
15740	1773803	8.0	9.0	10122684	Superb location if visiting University of Washington. Wonderful south sun, Over roof view of Space Needle and downtown Seattle. Classic old building with all the unique attributes of such. Many good restaurants just outside door. Multiple flights of stairs. Sporadic internet. OK for cruising more difficult if working from computer. Very low water pressure at kitchen sink but good at shower. Sitting room off bedroom perfect for reading. No tv which was good for me but not for everyone. If you have a car, parking is problematic. You will have to lug your bags unless you find the spot in front on the street. Three blocks away you can park for free. To find the entrance it is difficult. Remember that the Gyro shop is next door to the north. 
15741	1773803	8.0	9.0	10213914	Great communication, extremely helpful and understanding. I will definitely be booking next time I'm in Seattle.
15742	1773803	8.0	9.0	10321677	As many others have said, Sheldon is a great host. He communicated all the details and made sure I had everything I needed. He was able to provide information about the area and some good tips for good food. I'd definitely stay again and recommend Sheldon to my friends. 
15743	1773803	8.0	9.0	10366667	Sheldon was a good host.  We arrived later than expected due to travel delays, and he was perfectly accommodating.  The apartment is very spacious and conveniently located.
15744	1773803	8.0	9.0	10437376	"When renting a place like this, knowing you won't be able to see it before your stay, having communication with the host is vital. Sheldon was excellent at keeping a reliable line of communication, I felt taken care of before, during and after the stay. Aside from the stellar service we received, the apartment was completely cleaned, well-stocked, and the only real difference between it and a hotel was the high-level of direct service we received and how ""homey"" the space feels. A great price for the space and amenities that were given, I am very impressed with the overall experience and I was IN LOVE with the location and how close things were. Getting quarters for laundry from the restaurant next door further proved how nice the people in the area were. I would love to rent this place again :) High marks from this very satisfied guest! Thanks Sheldon!"
15745	1773803	8.0	9.0	10747672	Sheldon was really professional , helpful . The apartment is brilliant and is very close to the university . You have all types of cuisines nearby . Calm locality . Neat and perfect I would stay . Would highly recommend ! 
15746	1773803	8.0	9.0	10978566	"We had a great time, and enjoyed the stay! The apartment was as described, and Sheldon was very knowledgeable about the area. He was available, but not overbearing, and his suggestions definitely came in handy.

The location was great, and we were able to get around easily between public transportation and Uber."
15747	1773803	8.0	9.0	11082434	"Our stay was excellent. The apartment is right in the heart of the university district. We could walk anywhere near UW and the bus stop is maybe 300 feet away, so incredibly convenient to the rest of Seattle.

Sheldon was an excellent host. He met us near the apartment, showed us around, and was always quick to respond by text to the couple of small questions we had.

I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to be near UW."
15748	1773803	8.0	9.0	11216861	"First off, Sheldon is a great host. He was very accommodating when we requested an earlier check in time and overall very accessible yet not overbearing. He provided us with bus schedules, and personal restaurant choices (my boyfriend and I were pretty much on a foodie trip)--even Sheldon's girlfriend made a nice list of restaurants with descriptions and all. 
Now onto the apartment: It was very clean with plenty of blankets, towels and traveling essentials (shampoo/soap etc). Seattle a lot cooler than we're used to but if you turn the heat on and bring out the space heater it wasn't bad. The only negative thing was the bed. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because with every movement there'd be a loud squeak. I mentioned this to Sheldon, who promptly asked whether I'd like the bed flipped. It wasn't a huge deal to me because the couch is ridiculously huge and comfortable so I crashed there instead. 
All in all, a good experience. "
15749	1773803	8.0	9.0	11410139	Sheldon was a great host. The apartment was exactly what was advertised and sufficient for our stay. I would not hesitate to go back and stay again. Any time I needed anything Sheldon was there to help with questions I had. Great trip great place!
15750	1773803	8.0	9.0	12809904	Sheldon was an obliging and unintrusive host. The location is fabulous for anyone needing to spend time in the University District.
15751	1773803	8.0	9.0	13029988	Great appartment, extremely well located!... idealy placed for restaurants, cafes and UW, transportation to downtown almost right in front of the door. Sheldon was really nice, check in and check out went smoothly, also provided me with intersting tips on for seattle discovery!. It was a really confortable stay and an overall positive experience. Thank you Sheldon!.
15752	1773803	8.0	9.0	13117552	Shel's apartment was as advertised. We found it clean, spacious, and comfortable. And Shel was easygoing and friendly. If you want a spot in the heart of Seattle's U district, I would recommend this one.  
15753	1773803	8.0	9.0	13273184	My stay at Sheldon's apartment was great. The apartment was exactly as described, and Sheldon was a wonderful host. Loved how quirky and fun the place was. It's literally in the middle of everything near the UW campus but at the same time nice and quiet. There are blocks and blocks of restaurants around, a Bikram yoga studio in the same building, grocery stores, post office, copy center--all 1-2 minute walk away. The apartment also had wonderful views--of the Seattle skyline, and of a lovely backyard area shared with other buildings. A great place overall.
15754	1773803	8.0	9.0	13407757	Fun and funky apartment for a great price in a great neighborhood! 
15755	1773803	8.0	9.0	13662481	Sheldon was welcoming. He has gone out of his way to make his space useful.  I appreciated having a separate room in which to meditate and do yoga.  The kitchen and bathrooms were a little small.
15756	1773803	8.0	9.0	13793426	Sheldon made it easy for us to stay at his place. We arrived late and Sheldon got us in and gave us the quick tour so we could get settled for the night. The place is very comfortable and met all of our needs.
15757	1773803	8.0	9.0	14391047	Sheldon was an easy host to deal with, very responsive and straightforward. The apartment is convenient, light and bright, and met my needs very well. I would stay here again.
15758	1773803	8.0	9.0	14775918	谢耳朵的房子是我在美国第一次租住的民居，房子宽大，设施齐全，最满意的是交通方便，出门走一分钟就是公交车站，有多路公交车去往市中心。过马路就是漂亮的华盛頓大学校园，房子所在的街区是一条美食街，有各国的美食选择，特别是有中国的川菜和粤菜，超市也很方便。美中不足的是房子比较老旧，没有电梯，刚到时有一点失望，住了三天后，认为还是满意的。若再去西雅图，有可能再次入住的。谢谢!
15759	1773803	8.0	9.0	15055120	"Shel's place is fantastic. Great location, everything is just as described and pictured. He was extremely accommodating when we needed an earlier check in. In the apartment you'll find maps as well as great restaurant recommendations within walking distance. Shel was also always available to answer questions and even went out of his way to suggest a baseball game and fireworks happening our first night in town. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting the city. 
"
15760	1773803	8.0	9.0	15162500	Nice, quiet apartment for our family of 4 in a great area of town. Easy transit access to downtown and lots of restaurants, parks in walking distance. 3rd floor of a 3-storey walkup - we were there on a day when it was 33 Celsius outside so the apartment was a bit warm, but cooled off overnight. Sheldon was friendly and helpful.
15761	1773803	8.0	9.0	15300235	Sheldon was very nice. He accommodated our arrival time and showed us around. Place has a lot of character as it is over 100 years old, which we like! sinks did not drain as it was stated an issue from last BNB guests possible pouring something bad down drain. Also remember to close living room window during hot day as bugs from alley way will find there way to the room. Other than that very clean could not have asked for better location, great food. Would recommend. parking on street is free from 8-8 and free on Sunday. Thanks again.
15762	1773803	8.0	9.0	15617821	Easy to book and meet to get a key. Very warm on a 95 degree day. Suggest additional fans. Great location and priced nicely 
15763	1773803	8.0	9.0	15870470	Sheldon was accommodating about check-in and available by text.  Bldg was pretty much as described, but apt was clean.  Bed and couch were very good.  Refrigerator worked well (appreciated in the heat wave). Street parking was available after 8 or 9 pm but not after 8 am.  Wifi worked in the living room.  Quiet at night, even in heat wave, but a lot of morning noise.  Street scene is getting rougher.
15764	1773803	8.0	9.0	16398401	I thought I already left a review. If so, post the previous one. If not here is a short version. Sheldon was very available by text. I responded immediately each time. His apartment is comfortable especially the bed. It is a nice location near the University. 
15765	1773803	8.0	9.0	16704880	Sheldon was a gracious host. He checked in with us during our trip and gave us places we could check out. The apartment is large and the couch is comfortable. It was quite warm during the day but cooled off nicely at night. We weren't home much during the day for it to matter. We were woken up in the morning by noises in the alley. Parking is almost impossible, but Sheldon did point us to the neighborhood adjacent and we were able to snag a free spot on the street. Overall, it is exactly as described. 
15766	1773803	8.0	9.0	16847160	Sheldon was a great host! He was very understanding when we ended up checking in later and he periodically checked up on us making sure everything was alright. He also gave great tips for places to go to. His building is definitely 100 years old and has no AC unit (people don't use it in the NW). The apartment was quite humid and dark during the evenings. In the mornings, we were constantly woken up by loud noises from the street. However, the location of the apartment was great and parking was pretty easy to find. The apartment is very close to the downtown area. 
15767	1773803	8.0	9.0	16911602	Sheldon was super friendly and gave plenty of ideas for neighborhood restaurants and things to do.  The apartment is situated in a somewhat dingy building right in the center of a lively series of blocks filled with shops and inexpensive restaurants catering to students (think Telegraph, Berkeley).  The apartment itself is large, with three rooms and an open galley kitchen.  You won't be doing any serious cooking (nook table's small, only three spoons, etc.) but with the many restaurants around, this isn't an issue.  In general a functional apartment with a friendly host and a location central for the university.
15768	1773803	8.0	9.0	17149919	"Great location, a block from UW. Sheldon was accommodating with our arrival time, and informative with regards to local eateries and sights.
With that being said, the actual room was in a building that is 100+ years old, and has issues that come with a building of that age. It's on the third floor, and with no a/c you will roast during the summertime till the sun goes down. No need for an alarm because the garbage truck will be sure to wake you up daily at 7am since you'll need those windows open for circulation. We also experienced a dirty bathroom and kitchen that unfortunately may not get much cleaner at this point (even if someone had cleaned the tub; we'd also advise bringing your own towels.) The wifi will likely only connect if you sit by the front door of the apartment as it has a terribly, weak signal.
Overall, we would not recommend it to friends and family so I wouldn't recommend it to you. Similar priced listings in other bigger cities have provided more and at better quality."
15769	1773803	8.0	9.0	17232951	Large apartment that had a big U shaped couch which had ample space in addition to the bed. The building is relatively old but the apartment itself clean and well furnished. 
15770	1773803	8.0	9.0	17292638	"This was our first experience with AirBnB, and I have to say it was mixed. Sheldon seemed rushed when he greeted us, and he never mentioned the wi-fi code, but he did let us drop off our suitcases when we arrived at 12:45 and the previous tenants had not yet left. We appreciated that.

The neighborhood was pleasant, and the apartment is spacious and reasonably clean, though hardly immaculate. We were grossed out, however, to find only a bottom sheet and comforter on the bed, with no top sheet or duvet. Worse, Sheldon asked us to straighten it when we left (rather than removing the sheet). It seemed pretty clear that the next guests would be sleeping in it, and we assumed it probably hadn't been changed after the previous guests left. 

The building, too, is pretty down at the heel. The dead flowers in several of the windows add to the atmosphere (in a creepy way). Overall, it was okay, but barely."
15771	1773803	8.0	9.0	17749120	The apartment is in great location, easy access to all the amenities, like bank, supermarket, restaurant and campus.  The host also very helpful to arrange the transportation between airport and apartment.  We enjoy the stay.
15772	1773803	8.0	9.0	17967894	Sheldon did a great job with our first experience on AirBnB. Convenient location and great place to stroll around during down time on our trip.
15773	1773803	8.0	9.0	18012171	"Since we came to Seattle to visit the University of Washington, Sheldon's place right on University Ave. gave us just the right location and feel of a college campus.  We found easy parking nearby and enjoyed the view out the windows of the city lights.  Restaurant options abounded.

The building is urban, college gritty and like most of Seattle doesn't have AC but Sheldon had cooled the summer heat nicely with plenty of fans.
We slept well and it was just the perfect place for us to stay!"
15774	1773803	8.0	9.0	18132916	Amazing location and place to stay. Shel was responsive and courteous. Highly recommend. 
15775	1773803	8.0	9.0	18221439	Great neighborhood, excellent views, very comfortable apartment and great price. There were even earplugs in the night stand! Couldn't have asked for a better host. Thanks!
15776	1773803	8.0	9.0	18669135	Check in/out was super easy but place wasn't clean enough. Location was easy to get to downtown on bus. 
15777	1773803	8.0	9.0	18729905	"Good apartment if you're looking for a place to crash for the night. Sheldon wasn't available when we arrived, but his friend Mark was helpful.  He answered all my texts in a timely manner. 

There was a ton of street noise in the morning,  but that was expected from other reviews.   The bed was very comfortable.  Towels were super crunchy,  so I'd recommend bringing your own.   Only one roll of toilet paper,  which could be risky.  

The U district was a good college town,  but a little grunge.   Good restaurants around and easy to lyft or uber places.   

Overall good experience for our first time in Seattle."
15778	1773803	8.0	9.0	18876050	"When you first see the bldg., do not be disheartened! I see why Sheldon doesn't post photos of the exterior.  The bldg. is old with a neighborhood reminiscent of Berkeley, a bit grungy, a bit rundown. Homeless youths were drumming in the foyer of a nearby Kaplan’s testing center; at night, several homeless were sleeping on the steps of nearby offices; the odor of grilled meats and garlic filled the air for most of the day and night. 
Fortunately, the bldg. has a locked main entry door with three flights of stairs to the unit. No elevator. The unit is in the far back of the bldg. and is surprisingly quiet given that the main façade faces the Avenue.  We had a bit of a snafu getting the key. Sheldon was not around as host and his friend Mark had the key. Unfortunately, we were late in meeting Mark and Mark had a baseball game to attend. We did eventually get the key by meeting Mark at the Mariners game, so it all worked out in the end.
The unit is as advertised: a fairly clean, fairly quiet place. There is one main bedroom, a large living room, one small bathroom, a small sitting room, and a kitchenette. Unfortunately, the kitchen sink was backed up when we arrived and Mark was not able to fix it. 
Sheldon provides soap, shampoo, toilet paper (nice touch – TP rolls in the kitchen drawer), towels, sheets, and ample amounts of coffee (terrific selection) and coffee makers.  He also has suggestions for restaurants which he places near the front door.  Several fans in the unit help to circulate air as it can become warm on the top floor, even for Seattle. The bathroom is small, but the hot water is immediately available. Currently, the only mirror is a small one in the bathroom. 
The décor is late 20th century graduate student – I was having flashbacks to my own experiences as a grad student, down to the ancient harvest gold rug in the living room and the generic posters. The living room has a very large sofa sectional on which we planted our two teenaged sons. Sheldon also supplied wi-fi directions and where to get the best reception in the unit. Pls. be aware that there is no TV or phone. BYOD (Bring Your Own Devices).  We had a rental car and did not take public transit. Parking is paid Mondays-Saturdays, but free on Sundays. We had no problems finding street parking, but it was a Labor Day weekend w/ no college events.
Overall, if you are looking for a convenient place near the University, don’t mind reliving your grad student days (or are a grad student), then give Sheldon’s place a try. Just make sure to be on time to get the key!
"
15779	1773803	8.0	9.0	20843390	"The location is so convenient and the Sheldon provides all stuff you may need when you live in. It's so considerate.
U Disc is really a good area and Sheldon is very nice to share all useful information, including dining, supermarket, farmers market, bus route etc, which are all quiet useful.
So I really enjoy the stay in Sheldon's apartment. "
15780	1773803	8.0	9.0	21286980	"Hi,
The apartment location is very good for the university and for downtown. "
15781	1773803	8.0	9.0	21409663	I had a family emergency occur the day we were planning on staying at Sheldon's so we didn't end up staying at his place. We did meet Sheldon and he was personable and accommodating. The neighborhood is in the heart of the teeming University district with many ethnic eateries right on the street of his apartment. The location is a great base from which to explore Seattle. 
15782	1773803	8.0	9.0	21432821	"host was flexible about arrival time and gave good transit suggestions...he carried a super heavy suitcase up the stairs to the 3rd floor for us!
ideal location for getting a sense of UW..."
15783	1773803	8.0	9.0	21568023	We had a great stay in the heart of the University District. Our host met us at the front door and gave us a tour of the apartment. The apartment was very nice with a great view of the Space Needle! Clean linens were available and the apartment had everything we needed. There were tons of great international restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Our stay was very enjoyable and I highly recommend this listing to anyone wanting to stay in the University District of Seattle.
15784	1773803	8.0	9.0	21726319	My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Shel's place in the University District.  The apartment was clean, warm, quiet during our Saturday-Tuesday stay, and Shel was an accommodating host. He was easy to contact and welcomed us into his home.  If I have the opportunity to visit UW again I will definitely try to stay here again.
15785	1773803	8.0	9.0	21857033	I was late arriving to the city and forgot to notify Sheldon of my tardiness. He touched base to make sure I was doing okay and then we worked out an alternate plan. Sheldon was very flexible and the apartment was great! The couch was super comfortable, as was the bed.
15786	1773803	8.0	9.0	22032722	Sheldon was there to leave me the key. Gave us a tour and also some recommendations. Apt was good size. There were plenty of sheets and towels for use. Went during October so the apt was pretty chilly at nighttime. There was a heater and extra blankets for use. Thanks for hosting Sheldon!
15787	1773803	8.0	9.0	22284938	Sheldon was very accommodating as our travel plans changed last minute a couple of times. The apartment is located in a very central area in the U District. It was spotless and comfortable, with plenty of space. I would highly recommend this space to anyone staying in Seattle for a few days! 
15788	1773803	8.0	9.0	23442963	We lived in Sheldon's apartment for a month, and we felt like at home, Sheldon was very very attentive with us and helped us to practice our english, we went with him to some funny parties and he recommended us a lot of nice places to dance, eat and have fun. Sheldon's apartment is pretty wide and so clean, near many restaurants, a brewery, clothing stores and the UW. We really had fun staying in U-District. Thanks for hosting Sheldon.
15789	1773803	8.0	9.0	23617747	Sheldon was great and very responsive. This is a fantastic location for the U and the apartment is really good also.
15790	1773803	8.0	9.0	23767985	I chose Sheldon's listing for my trip with my sister because she's hoping to go to UW and it's right near the campus. It was perfect for us and Sheldon was very accommodating and responsive when we had issues and questions. It's a nice amount of space and perfect for giving my sister an idea of the university area. It's kind of out of the way, as far as tourist attractions go, but since it's right next to several bus lines, that wasn't a problem. It was perfect for us and we definitely recommend it. 
15791	1773803	8.0	9.0	23957894	Sheldon was a great host. My flight was delayed so I arrived to the apartment much later than expected but despite the hour Sheldon was still warm and welcoming. The apartment was as described with everything needed for a comfortable 4 day stay. It was in a fun part of town with tons of restaurants and a very short walk to the UW campus. Would stay there again.
15792	1773803	8.0	9.0	24443619	"thank you sheldon ! 
our trip to seattle was fantastic, your place is a perfect base to explore from.  "
15793	1773803	8.0	9.0	24930802	Sheldon was easy to connect with and let us into the apartment as soon as we both could get there. I really appreciated how he kept in touch via message/email and showed us around the apartment. The space itself is very welcoming, in a no-frills, student-life way. We really liked the neighborhood (lots of cafes and restaurants, close to where else we needed to be) so the morning noise didn't bother us -- it was great to be in the perfect location for our Seattle trip.
15794	1773803	8.0	9.0	25239269	Sheldon was a very welcoming host. He was kind enough to extend an invitation to a potluck event, and made sure to check in on us to ensure our comfort. The location of his apartment was perfect - one street over from the campus and surrounded by excellent restaurant choices. The wifi did not work very well in the evening, but other than that, I would recommend Sheldon's space to anyone looking to visit the campus.
15795	1773803	8.0	9.0	25772115	Sadly I never made my trip (boo!) but Sheldon was great. He totally accommodated my travel pals and was apparently an A+ host! Thanks again and hopefully I'll make it to Seattle soon!
15796	1773803	8.0	9.0	25825353	Sheldon was a gracious host and the accommodations were welcoming. He gave us great advice on eateries as well as other activities to do. He is easy to communicate with. The apartment is in a great location.
15797	1773803	8.0	9.0	26356842	Sheldon was very accommodating and helpful.  He gave us lots of good ideas for things to do in the area and he didn't freak out when we broke one of his pots and a wine stopper.
15798	1773803	8.0	9.0	26607803	"Sheldon was friendly and helpful while giving us privacy. The location was perfect --it was centrally located and accessible to everything. The apartment itself was very comfortable, private, and had great views.
"
15799	1773803	8.0	9.0	27675264	"Sheldon was a great host and met me as soon as I got there. The place was very quiet inside and spacious. I wasn't thrilled with the location at night at first, but felt safe once I was more familiar with the area. There is only paid parking nearby, if you rent/bring a car.

Sheldon checked in on me the first night to make sure everything was good and it was. Bed was super comfortable too. Thanks!"
15800	1773803	8.0	9.0	27733630	"Sheldon was a great host! He invited us to a party the night before out stay and was accommodating to us checking in late that evening.
The place was beautiful. Big windows, lots of comfy furniture, food, clean, and great location. You can tell he cleaned between guests and was a very welcoming guy. Overall, he was a great host and his place was wonderful!"
15801	1773803	8.0	9.0	28463527	Thank you very much for the stay! Although Sheldon wasn't personally available when we checked in (he gave us advanced warning), he gave us clear instructions on who to see in order to get into the apartment and when I texted him with questions he responded almost immediately! The location was incredibly convenient for our friend's wedding, but was laso steps away from myriad restaurants, bus stops, and Zyp cars. The location was extremely quiet...the only real sound was that of a few neighborhood seagulls, despite being in the middle of the U-District!
15802	1773803	8.0	9.0	28684279	Our stay is perfect. Sheldon is very accommodating, and the house has everything we need. 
15803	1773803	8.0	9.0	28763520	This apartment is an excellent value in a high priced, lively, convenient neighborhood. The price reflects the somewhat spartan, bachelor-pad aura and rather worn condition of the building.  Hey, luxury costs! The unit served our needs well, except for the noise level. We are probably more noise sensitive than many urban travelers so it might not be an issue for others.  Sheldon had the place clean and tidy for us.  We appreciated his encouragement that we use whatever we needed in the apartment. Glad he pointed us toward the Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast, just a few blocks away. Great tip.
15804	1773803	8.0	9.0	29246776	Sheldon was an easy going, yet still prompt and professional host. I booked very last minute and he was prompt in responding to my request as well as responding to any questions I had during my stay. The space is roomy and comfortable, and I really enjoyed the unique old space. I look forward to staying here again sometime.
15805	1773803	8.0	9.0	29347421	Had a nice stay. Prompt easy check in, host did a nice job of showing us around the apartment and recommending a couple of local restaurants. The neighborhood around the apartment is near the college so there are plenty of food options and there's a nice brewpub two doors down, my friends and I had a fun stay.
15806	1773803	8.0	9.0	29635385	The apartment was conveniently located and Sheldon was generally responsive. The apartment also had everything I needed. However, it was not very clean. Not horrible, but floors appeared not to have been swept, counters not well wiped, etc. Also, for some odd reason there were yellow light bulbs in the living room, making it dim and sort of weird. Sheldon did not respond when I complained about the cleanliness level. It felt like a student level apartment.
15807	1773803	8.0	9.0	30052195	sheldons place is in a good location to be in the heart of university district and close to downtown seattle. There are plenty restaurants around the neighborhood. I didn't meet him personally but he left the key for me to acess. The building condition is a little shabby but I think it is the age and there isn't much he can do about it. I think the price should be a little lower for what it was but if you consider having the entire place in somewhere like seattle, it isn't bad.
15808	1773803	8.0	9.0	30259787	" Located in the very busy neighborhood near the University. Good access to public transport. Great location if you are without a vehicle, otherwise parking is VERY challenging. Either expensive and inconvenient or you have to park 5 or more blocks away to park for free. 
Apartment is on top floor and quiet. A bit worn but works OK. My girlfriend had to clean the toilet before she would use it and there was only one towel that kind of smelled. Carpet could stand replacing. Bed was comfortable. Overall not a bad experience, in retrospect not sure it was worth the price. I'd recommend it for a lower fee but if we ever return to Seattle will choose somewhere else."
15809	1773803	8.0	9.0	30591267	Sheldon was there to welcome us & show us around the apartment. He was very resourceful with information about parking, eating & other points of interest. The apartment comfortable with great view to Seattle. The WiFi extremely poor. 
15810	1773803	8.0	9.0	30981876	"Kommunikation med Sheldon var effektivt og uproblematisk.  Jeg mødte ham aldrig, men hentede blot nøglerne i sandwich-butikken nedenfor.

Lejligheden ligger midt i et livligt ""latiner-kvarter"" med masser af restauranter, barer, mm.. Lejligheden ligger dog væk fra gaden, så der er ingen larm overhovedet.

Internetforbindelsen er ikke særlig hurtig, men den er god nok til mail og surfing."
15811	1773803	8.0	9.0	31277262	Sheldon was very accommodating, had everything thing we anticipated for the stay. Made for a great weekend in Seattle, located right on University Avenue. Would definitely stay here again and met all our needs.
15812	1773803	8.0	9.0	31797601	Great experience and wonderful neighborhood. Thank you Shelton for being such a great host!
15813	1773803	8.0	9.0	32475887	"Shel's apartment was just as promised.  Close to lots of great restaurants, basically on campus, and plenty of shopping.  While it is in the heart of the U District, the apartment was quiet and peaceful at night.

Check in was easy and Sheldon was responsive and helpful.

The bed is comfy, the couch is luxurious and there is plenty of space.  The WiFi is pretty weak - so don't plan on a lot of Netflix, but checking email etc. was fine."
15814	1773803	8.0	9.0	33981033	"The unit is spacious and big. It have mostly everything I needed in general. Location is awesome!
However, I feel like the blankets are not super clean. And wifi is super duper slow, or it's on/off all the time."
15815	1773803	8.0	9.0	34569469	"Sheldon is a nice person and so is his apartment! This apartment is very close to UW campus. There is a big bedroom and a living room. And there are also a lot of restaurants around it.
"
15816	1773803	8.0	9.0	35198767	Sheldon, we had a great visit! Thai Tom is our new favorite restaurant!  :)  Thank you for everything & all the best!  
15817	1773803	8.0	9.0	35354129	Location, Location, Location!  This place is perfect if you want to be in the University neighborhood of Seattle.  The apartment is roomy for 2, kids can sleep on the sofa.  Sheldon met us personally to show us the apartment.  Tuesday is garbage day in the street below and it is kinda noisy.
15818	1773803	8.0	9.0	36005891	"First, some positives:

- Public transportation is steps away.
- Dozens of international restaurants are right out the door.
- Good water pressure and hot water.
- Towels and sheets galore.
- According to our daughter, the sofa was very comfortable for sleeping.
- Minimal neighbor noise.
- Aside from flies wandering in from the outside, no bugs!

Now, the negatives:

- Both ceiling fans were broken and so we had to open the windows despite a floor fan; this let in lots of flies where screens were absent.
- The apartment backed up to a very noisy alley. Garbage pickup (see flies, above) started as early as 4:30. Earplugs in the nightstand (some used) were ineffective when a truck was dropping a restaurant dumpster right out the (open) window.
- As others mentioned, the internet was weak.
- As someone mentioned, the carpet was stained and probably needs replacing.
- Speaking of the kitchen, there were...issues. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, but it was barely functional. As someone mentioned last summer, utensils were (still) lacking: two soup spoons, one butter knife, plates for approximately three for one meal, no large pots or pans, no storage containers or wraps, no measuring spoons or cups, dying microwave. (Meals were...challenging.) The kitchen was dirty—not only the dishes and pots, but also the insides of the drawers, fridge and freezer.
- Things were worse in the bathroom. Simply put, it was filthy. The tub needed a good scrubbing, the rubber mat was mildewed, and dusty soap scum covered everything. And, we aren't convinced the sheets and towels were clean before being put out.
- I found a clump of hair and a stepped-on vitamin/pill beside the bed.

In-betweens:

- While Sheldon furnished lots of toiletries, they were stacked around the bathtub and vanity, leaving no room for our own stuff. Additionally, there were no empty drawers, cabinet or food storage space.
- The closet was spacious but had too few hangers.
- The only mirror was on the medicine cabinet door.
- The living room light bulbs were yellow.
- Laundry facilities consist of one shared coin-op washer and dryer on the second floor.
- The smoke alarm died beeping in the middle of the night.

I know it's an old building—I live in one myself—but many of these things can be addressed cheaply (and for about the $25 'cleaning fee'): plunk down $10 for a door mirror from Target, grab a handful of plastic (not bent wire) hangers, pick up some cutlery, have extra alarm batteries on hand, and (this is important) vacuum and wipe the bathroom and kitchen clean. Others are aesthetic: consolidate single toiletry bottles (or buy a new $3 bottle of Suave every guest stay or two), toss the dead plants on the fire escape, use white/clear bulbs, paint over ceiling stains instead of smearing a dirty cloth over them.

It's clearly a bachelor pad/college-type place, but as for a 'jewel' we expected something a bit more polished."
15819	1773803	8.0	9.0	36216926	In the heart of the university district.totally secure building. No elevator, FYI. And even though there's no air conditioning, the fan was awesome. Sheldon was a gracious and accommodating the host. Great view, including the space needle. Unexpectedly quiet. Would recommend particularly if you want an urban environment. Lots of room in. It's all good particularly for the price
15820	1773803	8.0	9.0	37317773	We enjoyed our time in Seattle and in the apartment.  We found the bed to be comfortable.  If you're looking for a simple and inexpensive place to crash at night and explore the city by day this is a good option.
15821	1773803	8.0	9.0	37569957	My husband and I were greeted by Sheldon almost 15 minutes late after the 3pm check-in time to give us the keys and show us around his apartment.  He was very quick in his initial meet & greet, and the apartment and neighborhood was not what we expected.  We didn't stay the entire time at that location and ended up at another airbnb location in Seattle.
15822	1773803	8.0	9.0	37939025	Sheldon's place was comfortable and suitable for the night we spent there. Sheldon was a bit late for the check-in but furnished us with supplementary linens and supplies when we asked.
15823	1773803	8.0	9.0	38447821	The neighborhood was great, and the host was attentive. But, the unit itself was very dirty and didn't feel like it had been cleaned in a while. We only stayed for 1 night, and I am glad that we did not stay longer in that unit. 
15824	1773803	8.0	9.0	38536922	Great place! Spacious, clean, and unbelievably convenient to the University District. Sheldon was a great host, and check-in / check-out was a piece of cake. Highly recommended!
15825	1773803	8.0	9.0	38859621	The location and the space was described adequately. Sheldon was very responsive to my questions via messages. I would stay there again!
15826	1773803	8.0	9.0	39733763	Die Nähe zum Unigelände war für uns ein großer Pluspunkt.
15827	1773803	8.0	9.0	40104040	We had a great time in Seattle. We were unsure of when we would arrive so Sheldon arranged for us to pick up he keys close by our place. Once inside the place was clean and bright. The main complaint  was the noise at night. There were people in the alley behind us as well as the garbage trucks came each morning very very early. The carpet was a little questionable. The area was neat as we had not stayed in this part before.  
15828	1773803	8.0	9.0	40612054	"The location is excellent for food and restaurants and it is around a $15 uber trip to downtown Seattle.  The apartment was a third floor walkup which is OK if you are able to walk up three flights.  This fact should be made more clear by the owner in the description.  

The apartment was pretty clean except for the rug which was fairly beat up.  It was more like a college apartment than an older person's apartment.  In general it was clean but fairly beat up.  It lacked a TV and only had a wifi which worked sporadically.  The furniture and appliances are clean but older.  The bed is very squeaky.  The sheets and towels were adequate.  There are enough amenities for cooking but once again old stuff and there is no dishwasher.  There is very little space to eat a meal.  It only has a little nook in which the table takes up the whole space.  The bathroom was clean and the shower had good pressure.   The bedroom  is incredibly noisy outside because it faces an alley where garbage trucks come at 4 in the morning.  It also has no A/C which was brutal because Seattle was unexpectedly hot when we were there.  We had to leave the windows open which didn't help much and the birds woke us up early along with the garbage trucks.  Installing a few simple box ACs would have made it much more comfortable and killed some of the outside noise.   

In general the apartment was clean but it needs updating to be a more special experience.  If you just need somewhere to crash for a night, this is a good choice. But if you wish to be more comfortable while in the apartment, this may not be the place for you."
15829	1773803	8.0	9.0	40719193	Sheldon was a responsive host and his apartment is in an excellent neighborhood. I appreciated the convenient location, comfortable sleeping spots and nearby food options. Thanks Sheldon! 
15830	1773803	8.0	9.0	42537171	Cool neighbourhood. Great location for eating out, and for public transport. The apartment is bright and spacious and quiet at night.
15831	1773803	8.0	9.0	42726569	It was my boyfriend and I's first time using AirBnb together; I had used it with my family previously. Sheldon had put out extra blankets in case we were cold. Though, there was an issue with the key and getting in; the directions weren't very clear. The first door gets into the building, the second door gets you into the hallway, and the third get you into the apartment. The neighborhood was cute and college town-like. The description of the listing was accurate, except we couldn't find the air-conditioning that was listed- the multiple fans provided kept us cool enough. Not having a tv was strange, but only staying one night worked out great. We didn't even try to use the wifi due to previous reviews of it being spotty. A portable DVD player worked out great.
15832	1773803	8.0	9.0	44096116	"Sheldon was very accommodating.  The apartment was exactly as described.  There was plenty of coffee and tea available, as well as basic pantry items.  The apartment does overlook the skyline, and is right in the center of the U-district.  I was using the apartment for its proximity to the campus, and I was glad I went with this cozy and secure apartment.

Good communication with Sheldon throughout the process, and would stay here again when returning to the area."
15833	1773803	8.0	9.0	44445875	This space is a great spot for visiting the University of Washington.  It's right next to campus and surrounded by good cheap eats. Sheldon told us to use the streets to the west to avoid paying for parking and that was helpful.  It's bright, but really a college apartment.  It's a great value but you have to be ready for beat up and stained carpet, a not especially clean bathroom, a well used couch and so-so towels.  As others mentioned, the alley noise is pretty incredible.  I'm not sure why trash trucks came both mornings we were there, but they came loud and proud.  Pack your earplugs :)
15834	1773803	8.0	9.0	46507045	We had a little trouble getting a hold of Sheldon when we first arrived, but it all worked out in the end.  Great location.
15835	1773803	8.0	9.0	46629898	The neighborhood and location or wonderful and very easy to catch the bus downtown. Sheldon left some info for local restaurants and things to do, which was nice. The apartment didn't feel as clean as I was expecting but the apartment served its purpose.
15836	1773803	8.0	9.0	46848435	Great place if you are looking to stay close to university.  Had everything I needed. 
15837	1773803	8.0	9.0	48007761	"We had a great experience - photos were accurate and host was responsive. He even invited us to an event in the city that we would have otherwise missed! 
The unit is in a vintage building in a college neighborhood, but the age of the unit and the noise of the neighborhood are offset by the host's welcoming attitude and a homey, bright, and comfortable spirit throughout. "
15838	1773803	8.0	9.0	48699676	"Sheldon's place was as described. I always read through the reviews thoroughly before booking a place and both agree and disagree with them. It's true, there is a lot of noise from the alley behind the apartment - both with the trash trucks and dumpsters and generally people just walking back there and talking. But I live in a city in an apartment that backs to an alley so it didn't really bother me. The apartment is very ""woo college!"" and took me back to my undergrad days. It's an old building with old furnishings. But I disagree with the other reviews that the apartment is dirty. Yes, the carpet has stains but I could tell that it had been recently vacuumed. Yes, the linens were old but I could tell they were clean. Yes, the shower is old but when you have an old, iron tub it's impossible to get it looking brand new. If you're looking for a nice, quiet place to spend your time indoors while in Seattle, this might not be the place for you. But I was on a work trip and the conference was at a nearby hotel and I just needed a place to crash and shower and Sheldon's place was great for that. There's no TV but the Wifi worked just fine for me to watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, and check email. I didn't use the kitchen at all so can't speak to that.

The only other ""downsides"" to the apartment were there weren't many three-prong plugs and the bathroom outlet wasn't working so I had to blow-dry my hair in the kitchen. Again, I didn't care but others might. I also had to keep my computer plugged in overnight in the kitchen because I worried the adapter in the bedroom would short my charger out. Also, I have sinus issues and have almost a constant runny nose and there weren't any tissues in the apartment. Not a big deal but I felt bad using paper towels so much. 

The area is definitely a crowded, college strip. There were quite a few homeless people around but again, I come from St. Louis where there are lots of college kids and homeless people so I wasn't shocked. I never felt unsafe. It's not my kind of ""scene"" with all of the young kids and hole-in-the-wall restaurants but again, I wasn't staying in that neighborhood for pleasure. I did eat from the sub shop below the apartment twice and the food was really good and the service was very nice. There's also a Starbucks two doors down which was nice. 

My flight got in late and Sheldon arranged for me to pick up the keys from the sub shop, which was easy enough. 

Overall, this is a great place to crash if you need to stay in the University District and if I have another conference in the area I will definitely stay here again! "
15839	1773803	8.0	9.0	49150563	The location was great to travel from, awesome cheap eats around the general area and only a 15 dollar uber to the market place. Sheldon was a little behind schedule when we met up with him but we were a little bit late on our check out so it was fine. Really the only thing I can complain about was the smell from outside. It was the most intense raw sewage that permeated through out the building that was almost unbearable. So we had to use air freshener to mask the stench. Other than that it was close to amazing gyros and crepes....
15840	1773803	8.0	9.0	49342621	还是不错的选择 但是只有一张床 三个人还是有点挤
15841	1773803	8.0	9.0	49551615	Great little apartment! There was a little mix up with meeting times but it was a great experience over all. I will definitely stay here again 
15842	1773803	8.0	9.0	49899172	"A descrição do apartamento não confere com o que encontramos, a começar pela foto de apresentação; a vista da pone e da cidade não existem.
O anfitrião não foi nada atencioso. Retiramos a chave numa pizzaria, no mesmo prédio, e, a subirmos ao apartamento, foi uma decepção só. Carpete imundo, sofá sujo, banheiro microscópico, toalhas usadas no banheiro, roupa de cama usada, lixo cheio na cozinha. Quando liguei ao proprietário, este informou que outros hóspedes haviam deixado o apto e ele não teve tempo de limpá-lo. Eram 15 horas, e ele informou que só poderia tomar providências por volta das 20h!
Foi a pior experiência ad viagem."
15843	1773803	8.0	9.0	50456559	This apt's location offers great convenience for everyone who want to explore the beautiful campus of UW by walk, and many downtown attractions within 15 minutes drive. It's equipped with everything you need for a warm and comfort night. 
15844	1773803	8.0	9.0	50818351	The place is located in a great part of Seattle with cool trendy and ethnic restaurants all around. It is Seattle so parking can be rough but there is free parking west of the apartment you can find. Internet at this rental is slow so be advised if you have work you need to do online. Luckily there's great coffee shops all around in case you need to hop onto some faster internet. This is a big rental! You have lots of space, the host Sheldon is kind and happy to help you out. I recommend this rental. Mahalo!
15845	1773803	8.0	9.0	51103162	What a great find in the middle of the University district. With all the amenities of home and ample space, Sheldon has provided travelers with an awesome space to explore Seattle from. 
15846	1773803	8.0	9.0	52077794	Sheldon was extremely helpful and accommodating.  For my first experience using Airbnb, everything was just great.   
15847	1773803	8.0	9.0	53759528	Communication from Sheldon was very good. The location of his property is right on University Ave. so if you have business at UW like I did, it will be perfect location.  The unit is spacious and is quite large for a one bedroom with bonus room and large living area. I was at UW for an interview so I only used the property to sleep and shower.  Unit is in an older walk up so be prepared to climb stairs as there is no elevator.  Sheldon provided plenty of towels, blankets, shampoo, and everything needed for the stay.  If you are looking for a 5 star property then this unit is not for you, but if you are looking for a spacious apartment centrally located by the U at a reasonable price then you will be happy with Sheldon's place.
15848	1773803	8.0	9.0	54129319	和房东交接钥匙非常顺畅，房源描述完全相符，地理位置非常好，如果下次去西雅图还会选择这里。
15849	1773803	8.0	9.0	55861450	Sheldon was very responsive with text/email/phonecalls.  He was very flexible and offered good suggestions for easing my short-notice travel into Seattle.
15881	6705584	8.0	10.0	35160961	Nice place for the money, as hotels in the university district are far more expensive.  Parking was difficult, but not impossible, but you don't really need a car to access all the shops and restaurants nearby.  Melissa was a good host, and just upgraded the wifi, so Internet access was great.  I stayed a week and it was only noisy once on a Saturday night, then perfectly quiet thereafter.  Shower was ocassionally lacking in power, but was always hot.  Would recommend for 1-2 people traveling on a budget.
15882	6705584	8.0	10.0	38146619	The listing is exactly as described.  quiet neighborhood with alot of good restaurants nearby. Melissa is great!  She responds very quickly to text.  Def reccomend.  
15883	6705584	8.0	10.0	49121973	"아파트는 UW 주변에 위치하고 있고 2층에 위치하고 있습니다. 아파트 자체가 좀 낡긴 했으나 전반적으로 시설물들은 깨끗했습니다.
UW 주변에 걸어가면 식당가가 있고 downtown 으로 가는 버스가 있어 편리했습니다. 밤에는 전반적으로 조용한 편이었습니다. 와이파이가 잘 되었고 히터가 잘 되어 전혀 춥지 않았던 것이 큰 장점이었습니다."
16137	9316399	8.0	10.0	54048037	Had a great time at Alden's place. Right across the street from the college, really nice view also. Super convenient location, and Alden was a great host. 
16138	9316399	8.0	10.0	54541134	Alden was such a lovely host - she is an undergrad at UW and is very friendly, interested in getting to know me, and offered plenty of recommendations for activities, food, coffee, transportation, etc. She was easy to communicate with and very responsive. The bed is comfortable, in a closet with just a few feet of space around it, but you have access to the entire apartment. If you're looking for a place that's for lounging and very spacious, spick and span, etc. then this might not be the best place, but if you want to be near UW in a cute building and with a friendly host then it's great!
16139	9316399	8.0	10.0	54670367	she is very nice .but  the room is a little bit small for couple.
16140	9316399	8.0	10.0	55465296	Amazing Host! Made us feel very welcome, and accommodated to our requests very well. The price was more than reasonable as well for the location and space. Definitely would recommend her to anyone!
18181	9448215	8.0	10.0	56349855	Savannah was a great host - she welcomed me and showed me around her place, gave me WiFi access and told me about the neighborhood. Thank you for a pleasant stay :)
18813	1499596	8.0	8.0	23368699	This place was fantastic.  It was perfect for us.  From the radiant heated floors to the giant bathtub on the third floor.  Love, love Gerry's style.  His furniture is gorgeous--mid-century modern mostly in wood.  Eames kitchen table chairs.  Every looks so good that you're surprised it is all extremely comfortable.  His photos on the walls are uplifting and compelling and visually well-framed.  The kitchen has everything you could want.  The beds were super comfortable.  The building seems eco-friendly and built very solidly.  Windows and window treatments are high quality.  No drafts (even on a snowy day).  The neighborhood was close to everything.  Other folks in the building were kind and casual.  You can walk downtown or to Capitol Hill or take a $5 Uber ride.  We would move into that place in a minute.  Even better than the photos.  And Gerry was a very good host.  Beautifully done, Gerry.  
18814	1499596	8.0	8.0	24420498	the host was great communicating with us and the home was as described.  great place with all the amenities we needed.
18815	1499596	8.0	8.0	29668446	Truly a special home. Airy, cozy and unique at the same time. 
18816	1499596	8.0	8.0	33256570	The house is great, everything was perfect and very comfortable. Gerry was very helpful and answered my questions quickly.
18817	1499596	8.0	8.0	35098405	Great place, we had 5 people and we all fit comfortably. Everyone loved it! Very spacious and description on posting was accurate.
18818	1499596	8.0	8.0	37326492	"the host left a welcome packet that had the wifi information, things to do in the area, what amenities to use and how to keep it clean. that was very useful to have.

the pictures of the listing were very accurate. the house was very modern and had a lot of windows which was nice to let the natural light come in. clean and organized and left some clean towels for us to use. very nice living room on the second floor with the apple tv. the neighborhood was chill and had a nearby park and coffee shop that was very walkable. it's about a 15 minute drive to pike place which was nice since it's not too far or too close. "
20760	319768	8.0	9.0	1072595	"We had a wonderful, 10+ day stay at the Hobbs family's beautiful modern home in Seattle in March.  Jen met us when we arrived, gave us a tour and showed us everything we needed to know.  She had inquired about what we were interested in doing and seeing in Seattle before we arrived, and had put together a great list and Google map of these spots of interest, including factoring in my half-marathon training and recommending nearby running routes.  She and her family were lovely to meet.  

The house was a perfect spot from which to explore Seattle.  We used the internet connectivity to work on our computers during the mornings, went for runs along Lake Washington, and in the evenings we very much enjoyed their gorgeous kitchen, where we were able to cook great meals.  We had our car with us and used it to get around, but we noted that very frequent bus service was available at the end of the block.  We felt very welcome in the Hobbs' home, in the 'mi casa es su casa' type of way.  Thank you Hobbs family!!  We would love to come back  : )"
20761	319768	8.0	9.0	5840865	Beautiful house and thoughtful hosts. Jen provided lots of cupboard and closet space for our things and left out toys and books for our three year old. He enjoyed the stay as much as we did. He beelined to the backyard sandbox whenever we came back from an outing.  The house is beautiful, parking was easy and the neighborhood was lovely with parks and shops nearby. Everything was just really handy and comfortable. We hope to come stay again.
20762	319768	8.0	9.0	5961892	"We absolutely LOVED this home - and although we never met them in person, we love this family too! Jen was extremely helpful and responsive leading up to our stay, and we really appreciated her sending us a map with kid-friendly neighborhood restaurants and parks. Our kids also really enjoyed having some new toys and books to play with. 

Their home is warm, friendly, and bright, so it was very easy for us to feel comfortable right away and just RELAX! We also loved the backyard, our kids spent hours out there and my husband just sat back, sipping his beer and enjoying the beautiful Seattle summer. 

Kitchens, bathrooms, etc. are all well-stocked, and we all enjoyed cooking on that awesome stove. I spent a LOT of time just chilling in the hammock on the master bedroom patio - yay!! :)

We parked our rental van in the driveway - very convenient! Street parking was easy for my brother's rental. He found parking within a couple houses every time. 

Location is great too - felt like everything we wanted to see was 5-30 minutes away, and found SO MANY great restaurants, playgrounds, cultural experiences, etc. within 15 minutes. 

We hope their availability lines up with ours next time cause we'd love to stay there again! :) 

MAHALO HOBBS FAMILY! "
20763	319768	8.0	9.0	6169187	This is a nice house in a convenient neighborhood close to downtown and UW. The area has plenty of restaurants and grocery stores. The kitchen is amazing. My elderly mom had some trouble with all the stairs but did alright as it turned out. Jen was very helpful with some changes to our schedule and was always quick to respond to emails.  I hope to return here next summer! Dave
20764	319768	8.0	9.0	9419492	What a COOL place! Jen was kind enough to let us stay here while we were in town for the week for xmas. We've always wanted to live in a modern home in Seattle and we had our chance! Great location, super neat architecture, good amenities (GOOD ESPRESSO MACHINE!). Will definitely stay again. 
22189	6411986	8.0	8.0	33329162	We loved staying here, plenty of space convent and easy to navigate. Great location especially if you have a car. Easy to get  to cap hill, downtown, bell town, etc. Also decently priced for Seattle.
22190	6411986	8.0	8.0	33865720	I enjoyed staying here. The space was neat and tidy and Tim was willing to answer any questions I had.
22191	6411986	8.0	8.0	34576881	This was my first Airbnb experience and I loved it. Tim, the host is very friendly as well as his roommate Rob. The apartment was in good shape and it was easy to come in and out as we pleased since we had our own key. The location is pretty close to the city so it was very convenient to just take Uber or Lyft from the apartment to the city each day. I had a wonderful experience and I plan to use Airbnb again in the future.
22192	6411986	8.0	8.0	35256703	The description of the place was accurate. Tim was very nice and welcoming. He also offered to pick us up from the airport. He is very nice and gave us recommendations of places to visit. The location of the apartment is so close to downtown and convenient.
22193	6411986	8.0	8.0	35842373	This was an awesome experience. The whole house is covered in super rad art, and Tim was a super gracious host. The room was clean and well appointed. It was clear how things worked and any house quirks. Its also a quick jaunt to a lot of rad areas in the city. Tim is cool and an engaging conversationalist. Thanks so much!!
22194	6411986	8.0	8.0	38293695	"Tim was very helpful; he left a detailed note describing rules, amenities, and tips. Replied quickly, and offered directions on how to get there from the airport most efficiently.

The space itself was more cluttered than I would consider comfortable; not that it's not livable, but it seemed every counter, corner, and wall-space was packed and stacked.

The bathroom was in good condition, clean, albeit a tight squeeze, especially in the shower for 6'2"" me. Just be prepared.

I appreciated the extra blankets and sleeping bags! Most of them smelled like dog though, which was a bit off-putting. To be honest, I must have skipped over the part of the listing that said they had a dog. Totally my bad. The listing DOES say they have a dog.

The kitchen was a bit of a mess - there was a cloud of gnats around the sink the entire time. 

It got rather hot at night, and there's no AC or fans. Windows don't have screens (and those that do are ripped open), so I didn't feel comfortable leaving them open.

In summary, Tim was a gracious host, but the space could use some work.

P.S. We had far too much fun with Alexa, the Amazon Echo."
22195	6411986	8.0	8.0	41110315	We were really happy with this place!  Spacious living room and kitchen, garden and great we could use Netflix and plenty of other utilities. The bed was super comfortable. Nice decorations too, with an endless amount of books and movies. It's doable to walk to the center, otherwise a taxi won't cost much. Tim and his roommate are very nice and they helped us where necessary. Also, we basically had the whole spot to ourselves the whole weekend! 
22196	6411986	8.0	8.0	45848567	The bed was super comfy! Tim was out of town but his roommate Rob was very nice and welcoming.
22197	6411986	8.0	8.0	46309920	Tim was great from the get go, super prompt with all correspondence and very helpful directing out of towners :) the house is older but adorable, really nice just outside the city, and everything was very clean. The bed is large and comfortable, the bathroom is clean and large, and the linens were great. Tims roommate is very quiet and conscientious and was really helpful setting us up with getting into the house. Great for young people exploring the city!!
22655	9532861	8.0	8.0	55326289	Beautiful loft. Internet did not work, which was unfortunate. Great place if you are looking for minimalism and a convenient location.
23302	7291403	8.0	9.0	39233645	Our stay was great. Peter made everything very easy and was accommodating especially for a last minute booking. I would recommend!
23303	7291403	8.0	9.0	40005406	Our first airbnb stay, and it was a very pleasant experience. The condo was as promised, Peter was responsive and helpful, and the stay was a short drive to the Seattle city center for sightseeing. The patio overlooking the water was wonderful for morning coffee and for dining after a busy day in the city.
23414	7999692	8.0	10.0	46776076	This is a great apartment! Fantastic views on Lake Union and the CBD and easy to get to all the must see places ($8 uber to anywhere). Clean and equipped. Also walking distance to nearby restaurants and deli. We loved just sitting on the balcony and watching the sunset! 
24502	8483477	8.0	10.0	48646895	We had a lovely stay at Anna's condo. The location was perfect - close to downtown and all the things we wanted to do.  Space was just right for two. I will mention that the furniture configuration is different than the photos.  For example there is not a full sofa, but a love seat and two barrel chairs,  but it was fine for our short stay in Seattle.  It was clean and fit what we needed. 
24688	1831338	8.0	9.0	14108848	Reena was so friendly and accommodating, really lovely woman to be around. The space was great, comfortable and clean. We felt very welcome and at home. Discovery Park is a 5 minute walk too, and it's a quiet and safe area. 
24689	1831338	8.0	9.0	15070622	What a fantastic location in a fantastic neighborhood.  So quite all the time.  I slept so well every night on the perfectly firm futon.  Reena is such a sweet, sweet lady.  She did everything to make me feel at home.  A week into my stay I came home one night to find fresh flowers in my room.  Thanks so much for a wonderful place to call home for a week.
24690	1831338	8.0	9.0	15287470	"Reena was very nice and hospitable! It felt much more like staying with a relative than a stranger. She was very patient even though we ended up having to check in way later than anticipated. She gave plenty of recommendations of places to eat and things to see. 

The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. It was a fifteen minute commute into downtown. The house is five minutes away from Discovery Park and the neighborhood is loaded with amazing lookout points. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking  for a homey place to stay that isn't disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the city."
24691	1831338	8.0	9.0	15974744	Reena was very welcoming and made us feel comfortable upon arrival. She lives in a quiet neighbourhood a 30 minute bus ride away from downtown. The room was very clean and looked exactly like it did in the picture. Our first time using air b n b and it was a good experience. 
24692	1831338	8.0	9.0	16190151	Reena is sweet, quirky and very talkative. We only stayed for one night but the room was great. The neighborhood is very safe and calm, and the beautiful Discovery Park is only a couple blocks away. There's a pizzeria with late-night delivery over in Magnolia (a 30 minute walk), next to a sports bar which is also open relatively late. We arrived late and needed both a walk and a bite to eat so we got a drink at the Magnolia bar and had our food delivered there.
24693	1831338	8.0	9.0	16945014	The host was very friendly and engaging and knew the area well suggesting many fine eateries in the neighborhood. The room was exactly as pictured, bright and airy with plenty of free safe street parking. We had a very good time and some wonderful conversations.
24694	1831338	8.0	9.0	17719092	Thank you Reena for the hospitality.  
24695	1831338	8.0	9.0	18839814	"This is hard to write, Reena seems like a nice person. There were big problems with this booking.
Biggest problem was bugs.  When we got back Saturday night there were lots of bugs in the bedding, on the bed and on the floor. Reena saw the bugs. I had to ask for clean sheets.  Reena said she would spray the room the next day. I don’t know if she did. On Sunday night when we got back we still had bugs and I woke up on Monday morning with two bugs crawling on me.  I don’t think Reena understood bugs are a big deal. If I am paying $150 per night I expect it to be bug free.
We were offered no discount or compensation for the bugs; we were even charged a “cleaning fee.”  
You can hear the voices from the basement room that is rented out – holes in wall where moulding not completed. 
You must have a car to stay here. The bus is far away, 10 blocks up a very steep hill during the evening, its better during the day.
On a positive note, there is good water pressure and lots of hot water in the shower. 
We have stayed in lots of Airbnb places in Seattle and Hawaii as well as been host to hundreds of people over the last 4 years in our home, so we are not newbies with staying in other people’s houses.  
"
24696	1831338	8.0	9.0	34387131	"Reena was exceptionally welcoming and stayed up late to welcome us into her home. We made delicious pizza before turning in for the night and she maintained her generosity throughout her stay. The room was lovely and sunny and the rest of the house was clean. The location is amazing if you want to get out of the downtown area, only minutes to the amazing Discovery Park. 

Reena herself is exceptionally open and is eager to interact and connect with her guests (whether that works for you or not). "
24697	1831338	8.0	9.0	35342570	nice place, and Reena is awesome !
24698	1831338	8.0	9.0	38087516	Reena was exceedingly generous and welcoming.  She made me feel like I was coming home to see an old relative.  The room is exactly as the picture displays, and the bathroom is more than adequate.  The local neighborhood is quiet and scenic.
24699	1831338	8.0	9.0	38684387	Reena's a wonderful host. The room was comfortable and clean. My husband and I had a peaceful night's rest. We went on a relaxing walk with Reena, views of Mount Rainier and the bay. Tried home grown veggies - great tastes. Overall fantastic experience. 
24700	1831338	8.0	9.0	38806786	Reena is a very kind person. However, that being said, I did have some issues during my stay with her that I felt compromised my personal safety and the safety of my belongings. Upon my arrival Reena informed me that she did not have a key for me, which can be problematic when you're a guest in someone's house for obvious reasons. She said that the neighborhood was safe and that it was okay to leave the doors unlocked, which isn't exactly solution that made much sense to me. She also said it was likely the last people who stayed with her (the night before) took the key with them because they liked the way it looked. When I asked if she would call the previous guests to see if they had the key, and/or try to retrieve it, she said no because she didn't want to blame them for anything. This made me very uncomfortable. As a woman, traveling alone, I wanted to feel safe in the house where I was staying. Knowing that strangers who very possibly could still be in the area had a key to the house made me feel unsafe. I also didn't feel comfortable leaving my belongings in an unlocked house. Reena eventually made me an extra key that evening, but it didn't make me feel any more safe knowing the other key was still somewhere out there, and at that point the key was of no use to me since it was late and I had no plans to leave the house that night. The next morning I left at 5 AM, sleepless, and with a bad taste in my mouth form the whole experience. I felt like it was more important to her to get the $100 for the room than to take a few hours to change the locks/look into the issue of the missing key. I especially felt more like a dollar sign than a person when I asked for a partial refund through AirB&B and Reena declined to give it to me. A partial refund would have been fair, and the right thing to do, in my opinion. I'm sorry to say that although Reena is a nice person, due to the issues described above the overall experience wasn't great, and certainly wasn't worth $100.
24701	1831338	8.0	9.0	39684783	Reena was exceedingly kind. The bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. There was an unmade mattress in the living room and no way to secure our things, so unknown guests was a concern that affected our view of the value. Her conversation and sharing were appreciated. 
24702	1831338	8.0	9.0	39844274	Reena is a wonderfully warm person, she greeted us at the door with a big hug and a warm smile. The house is very nice, clean and tidy, with a nice little garden plot out front. It was very easy to find, one bus from downtown. The neighbourhood is beautiful, lots of big old houses, gorgeous gardens and great views of the water. It is a bit far from downtown but we were only there one night so it was OK by us. If staying longer, then get a day pass on the transit system, I think it would be worth it.
24703	1831338	8.0	9.0	40287311	Reena was a great host. She was extremely welcoming upon first arrival, greeting me with a big hug and a great conversation. I was not able to take her up on her offer for a tour of Discovery Park, but should I be in the area again I would definitely go! I suggest Reena's place for anyone looking for a nice, quaint stay in Seattle.  
24704	1831338	8.0	9.0	41822554	Can't be better
24705	1840671	8.0	10.0	15663166	Reena is the perfect host and welcomed us with open arms. Her house is in a beautiful location and well connected to Seattle downtown by public transport. We spent an amazing evening and took a gorgeous moonlit walk along the coast at night and were almost reluctant to leave the next morning. Thanks Reena for a really great time in Seattle.
24706	1840671	8.0	10.0	15731533	"Reena is an absolutely amazing and most welcoming host! She made us feel at home immediately - and was even kind enough to accommodate our later than expected arrival after midnight. Upon arriving I was greeted with a warm smile and a hug from Reena. 

The room is very large, nice and private for two people. It is located in the basement of the home, so stays quite dark if you like to sleep in, but also has plenty of pretty and well-placed lighting to brighten up the space when you need. There is a bathroom downstairs, as well. It isn't attached to the room, but is right outside and a short walk to the bathroom. 

The home is in a beautiful neighborhood and is a short walk from Discovery Park and a bluff overlooking the Puget Sound with stunning views of the water, across to Bainbridge Island, mountains in the distance, etc. The views from that park are unrivaled. 

But overall the very best part of our stay with the interactions with Reena. Though they were brief, as we were only there one night, she is an amazing person, full of positive energy and love. We had such fun looking at all of the treasures in her garden in the front yard. I would definitely come back again for a stay in Seattle. And this is a very reasonable price for the location and space. Thank you Reena!"
24707	1840671	8.0	10.0	16224666	Was located in a very nice neighborhood and was a very nice room. Reena was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the whole trip.
24708	1840671	8.0	10.0	16947377	We had a wonderful experience staying at Reena's.  My 4 year old son and I had a 5 night stay in Seattle and Reena helped make it an awesome stay.  The room itself was clean and comfortable, and it was a little cool the first night but Reena provided a nice thick quilt that made the rest of the nights even better.  Reena truly made our first AirBnB experience a great one.  She helped us figure out how to get around the town and even provided a bus pass that we just had to reimburse for the rides we took.  The bus stop is only a block or two away to get to downtown, so even though I had a car I tried the bus a couple times and it was kind of fun.  Discovery park is also very close by and was lots of fun for my son.  I honestly have nothing but good things to say about our visit to Seattle and Reena was a great host!
24709	1840671	8.0	10.0	17598153	Reena was a wonderful host.  The room was as advertised - a nice simple room in the basement of her house which offered lots of additional private space in the rest of the basement with a private bathroom.  Reena was welcoming, warm, and entertaining!  I most enjoyed our walks through the neighborhood.  Reena brought me on a few 3-5 mile walks through Discovery Park and along Magnolia Blvd.   I would stay with her again next time I'm in town!
24710	1840671	8.0	10.0	18752240	"Everything people have said about Reena is true. She is a delight.

However, this basement room she rents left a lot to be desired for the price. First of all, the basement is an unfinished space. What the pictures don't show you is that the ceiling beams/insulation/electrical wires are completely exposed. This meant that each morning we were awoken by any footsteps or movement upstairs. The downstairs ""living room"" she references in the listing is actually just another bed. When we asked if anyone would be staying there, she replied: ""Not as of yet, but who knows two hours from now."" Which meant that we could have potentially been walking through another person's sleeping quarters every time we came, went, or used the bathroom. I should also mention that the areas weren't dirty, per se, but the bathroom had (water?) stained linoleum and there were several spider webs throughout. Again, this basement room is an unfinished space."
24711	1840671	8.0	10.0	39710765	Reena was great! Very warm and welcoming, and interesting conversation, and she even made us a great breakfast! The place was clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood was beautiful, with large houses and nice landscaping, and right next to a Discovery Park with trails etc. It's about a 30 minute bus ride to downtown.
24712	1840671	8.0	10.0	40689557	Reena's place was located in a lovely area. Short walk to the park with a wonderful view and a minutes drive to the downtown Seattle area. She was very friendly and made us feel at home. 
24713	1840671	8.0	10.0	43338759	reena is a lovely and welcoming person.  the space was comfortable and private since the basement is isolated from the rest of the house.  the neighborhood is very quiet and nice, just a few minutes walk to discovery park.
24714	1840671	8.0	10.0	43711500	"Reena was amazing!! See welcomed us with open arms and had a very special energy about her that had you feel at home. I highly recommend staying with her.
"
24715	1840671	8.0	10.0	46034973	"Reena was very welcoming and accommodating of our arrival and departure schedules.  Her home is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, close to the park which overlooks the sound and near where our daughter lives.  Lovely.
While the bedroom we used is in the basement, it is very comfortable and we slept well there (in spite of the unfinished ceiling in the room).  Quiet.  The bathroom was a convenient to the bedroom.  The finished basement through which one walks to get to the bedroom is beautiful. We were pleased to have a strong cell signal in the room.  And, her garden tomatoes were a delicious taste of summer.
Our only regret is that Reena was feeling less than well during our stay.  Would like to visit again under better circumstances.  "
25088	4264043	8.0	10.0	21254673	Lori was a great host. Amazing location! 5-10 minute walks to everything; Pikes Place, Downtown, the Waterfront, Space Needle, Occidental Park. Yeah the place needs a bit of updating. But, can't complain for the price. Would recommend for anyone looking to get the most out of Seattle.
25089	4264043	8.0	10.0	21400654	"The location of the place was truly outstanding! 
Everything was within walking distance from this location!  Shopping starts two blocks in one direction and the bars, pubs, lounges, cafes, restaurants are all over the neighborhoods.     Not to mention that all the bakeries and coffee houses are sprinkled everywhere you walk.

The apartment is what I would call, one of the great old vintage apartment buildings built in the late 1920's.  There was lots of creaking sounds one makes while walking around on the hardwood floors, but that's to be expected from a 20th century style apartment building like this one.  

The room was like the photos on AirBnB;  it's a clean, no frills style, vintage feeling room.  There's also a bathroom and a deep old style tube with a shower, and a small kitchen (but with all the great eating places around, I don't see that you need to eat in).  The décor was also a cool mix of a basic midcentury modern style of furnishings as well.  

Overall for the great price she offers and what your getting I think she's pretty fair.  I think that it's a nice clean room with a soft comfortable bed and I enjoyed my stay a lot.  

She lives in the building too, so you can call or text here for anything, as she is a very friendly and helpful soul."
25090	4264043	8.0	10.0	21486178	Lori's place was great! The apartment is in an incredible location. It's just a couple of blocks off the Westlake light rail stop, so it's super easy to get to after flying into Seattle. The Space Needle and Pike Place Market are both 5 minute walks away. I would definitely recommend staying here!
25091	4264043	8.0	10.0	21679422	We never got to meet Lori but she was great! She had the keys ready and waiting for us, checked on us to make sure everything was okay, and quick to respond if we had a question. The neighborhood is central to so many things and not a far walk from different modes of public transit. The description was accurate, it's small and simple, and the building is charming.
25092	4264043	8.0	10.0	22153706	"This was a great little flat, right in the middle of Seattle's downtown area. The location was terrific, just a short walk from the seafront, the market and Seattle Centre. It would be a great place from which to explore the city and surrounding area.
The flat is a decent size, clean, comfy, private and well stocked. Excellent value too."
25093	4264043	8.0	10.0	22371980	Can't beat the price and location! Lori is awesome and the other residents in the building are really laid back and great. It has all the essentials. Had a great stay in Seattle!
25094	4264043	8.0	10.0	22496858	Lori was great! She attended to all our requests promptly and the apartment was clean and comfortable. It is the perfect size for 2 people and the location is amazing. 
25095	4264043	8.0	10.0	22655335	I never got to meet her but she made things very easy.
25096	4264043	8.0	10.0	22983229	"My boyfriend and I had the honor of staying here for a week and we absolutely loved this place! Lori was an exceptional host and whenever we had a question or needed assistance, she was quick to help us out. She also provided us with brochures with all the big Seattle attractions. 

The apartment itself is located right in the center of downtown so we were able to walk everywhere, including Pike Place Market and the Space Needle, within 10-15 minutes. The apartment has a full bathroom and a full kitchen, which includes all the basic amenities such as towels, pots and pans, plates/bowls, and utensils. It has a nice and cozy feel to the place, which is perfect after a day on the town!

All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an affordable and convenient place to stay in the heart of Seattle! "
25097	4264043	8.0	10.0	23077223	Super easy, great location and Lori was very accommodating! Wish it had been just a little more cozy during our cold Seattle visit-- the radiator wasn't working while we were there, but the building heat kept us warm enough!
25098	4264043	8.0	10.0	23165466	Great great location! Lori made everything extremely easy for us upon arriving and departing! 
25099	4264043	8.0	10.0	23840766	Topplek in Seattle, dichtbij alles, heel basic maar voldoende voor een perfect verblijf. Lori was bijzonder behulpzaam
25100	4264043	8.0	10.0	23997794	"Love the small studio!  The host met us and showed us the room.  The communication was great.  The location is central and short walking distance to Pikes Marketplace / Ferris Wheel and the Monorail that goes to Space Needle and Museums.  Had to circle the block a few times to find parking and got lucky with a spot right in front.  Parking is free from 8pm to 8am and all day Sunday, otherwise it is street metered.  Will definitely come back again, especially liked the warm radiator that keep the room toasty.  There is no WiFi or Cable, but they do have a TV with DVD.
"
25101	4264043	8.0	10.0	24140554	"This is a charming old building tucked into the heart of Seattle, surrounded by hotels, restaurants and bars with shopping nearby. We walked to evening entertainment at the Triple Door and daytime exploring through Pike Place market and the waterfront. 
This is a studio apartment with a large closet area and small kitchen. The bed was comfortable. 
Lori was helpful and hospitable. I liked the feeling of stepping off the noisy street and into the past, climbing up one flight of stairs that looked and felt much as they did 100 years ago. The building is quiet inside. The décor in our room was mid-20th century. 
We will keep The Virginian on our list!
"
25102	4264043	8.0	10.0	24272996	"Perfect stay in Seattle! The appartment is really awesome with the charm of the old style furnitures. Location is just perfect, between two luxury hotels, steps away from a great grocery store, great restaurants and dowtown shops. The only negative comment is that it could have been cleaner. 
I would definitely go there again! "
25103	4264043	8.0	10.0	24418706	"What a great location and super airbnb experience! Just a short walk to pike place market and plenty of public transportation options. 
Lori was a great host ; keys were available when we got there and she was very responsive when we inquired about a hair dryer. 
The bed was incredibly comfortable. The apartment was just fine for two people who are in seattle to see the sights, there's not really much room to relax in the room other than on the bed. We never quite figured out the heater and it made some noise, but we still slept great and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Would definitely recommend it! "
25104	4264043	8.0	10.0	24483224	Great location, Lori is super nice and we had everything we needed. She even let us in before the normal check in time. The only thing is that the heater was really noisy but we had earplugs so it wasn't a huge deal. It's a great place to stay for a night if you want to be near the action in Seattle!
25105	4264043	8.0	10.0	25591550	Lori's place is perfect for anyone who wants to be in the heart of Seattle. My boyfriend and I were able to walk to all the sites that we wanted to see, and the few times we didn't walk, the public transit stops were all right close by. Ralphs Market, right across the street, was a great place to pick up breakfast supplies, and most of the time our data was enough for internet access, but if not, we just hit the Starbucks down the street. The apartment has historic charm and is a comfortable size for two. The bed was nice as well. Lori provided us with the necessary information for our later check-in and then let us on our own. It couldn't have been a better landing pad for our eventful exploration of Seattle. 
25106	4264043	8.0	10.0	25917342	This location could NOT have been better! We were within walking distance of everything we wanted to do in Seattle. The place was warm, clean, and had everything we needed, including kitchenware. I would absolutely stay here again or recommend it to anyone planning on visiting the area. 
25107	4264043	8.0	10.0	26310182	This place is a good spot if you want to be walking distance to all the Seattle tourist attractions, and to the train/monorail/streetcar stop. Nick is also a good host, easy to communicate with and flexible. The place is very simple, and just like what you see in the pictures. It's a good place to stay for two people, and if you're there for only a few days.
25108	4264043	8.0	10.0	26748108	"Everything was exactly what it claimed to be. Perfect location for the perfect price, and no unnecessary bells and whistles. The whole process was streamlined. We got our keys easily and were able to stay later in the day before our flight because it wasn't rented that night (thanks!)

This is the perfect launching pad to explore downtown, and there is a huge range of fun stuff within walking distance. It's RIGHT where you want to be. The room itself is small and modest, but well worth it if you are an urban explorer who just needs the basics."
25109	4264043	8.0	10.0	27090812	The place is very convenient to walk to sightseeing spots, and the kitchen is equipped and useful. Though we've met power went out and noises of the heater, Nick had replied and help solve the issues promptly. If the door lock can be securer will make travelers feel at ease.
25110	4264043	8.0	10.0	27253393	Nick was extremely helpful in helping to find the place and staying a phone call away. The place is just as described. Location is everything for this place. It was walking distance to EVERYTHING! The bed does make quite a bit of noise, but by the end of the day, we were so tired, that it didn't matter.
25111	4264043	8.0	10.0	27534247	Location was perfect! Walking distance to Capitol Hill, Pike Place Market, Space Needle, and everything else we wanted to see. The room was comfortable, but the walls were really thin, and the floor was very creaky. Great place for what we paid!
25112	4264043	8.0	10.0	27800144	The location is amazing! Basically half way between the pike place market and the space needle (each a 5-10 minute walk). The neighborhood is very walkable and safe with plenty of nice restaurants nearby. The room itself is very clean, the bed was VERY comfortable; a little small though. I enjoyed my stay very much, and was very happy with Nick as he host. I arrived rather late (almost midnight) but Nick remained very courteous and professional! I will definitely recommend simply because of the price versus location!
25113	4264043	8.0	10.0	28013200	This place was exactly what we needed -- great location, simple amenities, reasonable price.  Nick was also very responsive and helpful.
25114	4264043	8.0	10.0	28132871	Great location, and Nick was super helpful in getting keys to me and everything. It's super close to Pike Place Market and is really easy to get to from the airport by light rail. The building is older and a bit creaky, and the room could have been a bit cleaner, but overall it's a good place to stay. As noted, there isn't wifi in the room, but there is a little deli a couple buildings down that has free wifi if you need it, which Nick pointed out to me.
25115	4264043	8.0	10.0	28391382	"Great central location and decent amenities for the price of the apartment. Really, all the essentials you need. **but NO WiFi
HOWEVER, we did encounter a few problems:
1. No answer when we arrived (notified owner that we were coming in late) and eventually when we got into the building the AirBnB door was unlocked...
2. Had not been cleaned. Fridge still had half-eaten food in it, and dirty tissues under bed

Besides that, no problem with the room as we were not in it much and its all a traveler really needs. "
25116	4264043	8.0	10.0	28606287	Great location! Nick was very quick with communicating and the apartment was a very fun little place to spend a few days!
25117	4264043	8.0	10.0	28784242	Nick and Amy were both incredibly flexible. The check-in process was seamless and the place was exactly as advertised. Loved the location, all of the amenities were perfect, and it was just an overall positive experience. Hope to stay there again.
25118	4264043	8.0	10.0	30025324	"Amy was very responsive the week leading up to our trip and helped with tips on how to get around Seattle as well as to the airport for our departure. She also accommodated our request for early check-in and was extremely easy to get in contact with. 

The apartment was clean and true to the photos shown on the listing. We did cook in the kitchen for a few meals and two people can easily sleep in the bed provided. The only complaint would be the lack of items such as additional toilet paper/paper/trash bags towels and some kitchen supplies, such as coffee mugs. 

The location was superb, we had a short walk to Pikes Place market and were able to pick up random items at the grocer across the street. I would definitely recommend this apartment for a short stay in Seattle. "
25119	4264043	8.0	10.0	30933825	The house is absolutely at a great location. We have all the essentials we need and we felt cozy lay in bed after having a trip. Amy was kind and all the process was simple. We will definitely stay here again.
25120	4264043	8.0	10.0	31101220	Great communication, location, and stay! I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle.
25121	4264043	8.0	10.0	31421706	We really enjoyed our stay at Amy's appartment. It´s spacious, well located and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again.
25122	4264043	8.0	10.0	31760030	Check in was really easy and flat was easy to find. It was perfectly located for us to do lots of tourist things! Flat was nice and airy and well laid out - had everything we needed. Thank you!
25123	4264043	8.0	10.0	32054317	Amy was so helpful. We needed to print out a city pass and she not only did that but also delivered it to our front door (Thank you!). The apartment itself was cozy, enough space for the 2 of us. The bed was squeaky and old, should get replaced soon as it started to get uncomfortable on our last night there. The location was perfect. We were only 5 min walk to Pike's and 10 min to Space needle.
25124	4264043	8.0	10.0	33173839	This place was a perfect little apartment to stay in. The location was amazing! The kitchen is supplied well, and I was able to cook some meals. 
25125	4264043	8.0	10.0	33369275	"Never met Amy and she was hard to get in contact with in the days before our arrival; however, she emailed me the day before with informative instructions on how to get our keys and a festival happening in the city. 

Our room was clean and comfortable. It's a perfect room for a young couple traveling on a budget and it's in a great location - a short walk to Pike Place and the Space Needle. "
25126	4264043	8.0	10.0	33498223	Amazing studio!! walking distance from everyone. Definitely has the old vintage feel! Very quiet. Would love to come back. 
25127	4264043	8.0	10.0	33979105	"This location is seconds from fine dining and several small eateries, mass transit, and high end shopping.  The room is simple and quaint. small bed and small refrigerator.  Very clean presentation.  

The thin walls made it apparent when people were coming and going.  Being close the the stair well did not help with the noise level either.  The water pressure is low, so don't expect breathtaking showers.

Overall, this is a great downtown location if you don't need a lot of amenities.  
"
25128	4264043	8.0	10.0	34279960	"The Virginian is really an ideal location for a Seattle trip.  It is a 5-10 minute walk to almost everything (Pike's Place Market, Space Needle, waterfront, etc).  For the price, it's impossible to beat!  The apartment is small but has everything you need - fridge, microwave, small kitchen, bed, and bath.  The apartment could use a deep cleaning, but it's definitely not ""dirty"".  Check in was easy enough.  One thing I will mention is that the walls are very thin and the floors/stairs are very creeky.  Another thing is that one of the residents must smoke because I could smell it when they were smoking.  It would even wake me up at night but I'm very sensitive to cigarette smoke.  The unit itself does not really smell of cigarettes.  I could just smell it when someone was smoking nearby. "
25129	4264043	8.0	10.0	34528470	"Location: Located right in the smack middle of downtown Seattle. My friend and I walked to everywhere- Space Needle, Chihuly Museum, Kerry Park, Pike Place Market, Starbucks Reserves Tasting Room, and so many good famous restaurants. And we don't really work out often so that says something! Also there is Ralph's right across the street which is convenient.

The host: The owner, Amy, was super helpful and friendly. We landed in Seattle at 9:30 AM. Even though the check-in is at 2:00 PM, she let us drop off our luggage and store them in her office so we can go sight-see in the morning until the check-in time!! Huge thanks to Amy for that!!

Room: The room is perfect for two people- one comfy bed, good hot shower, fridge, clean dishware... We visited Seattle when it was pretty hot and sunny-- higher than 80 degree, but the room itself was pretty cool and unaffected by the temperature.

I'd say my friend and I made a smart choice of choosing this place for an affordable and efficient travel in Seattle."
25130	4264043	8.0	10.0	34698025	211 was a great little apartment and the location was perfect. It's a short walk to shopping, pike place, and a Starbucks down the street for wifi ;) the building is very authentic but it did smell somewhat of stale cigarette smoke. Easy access though and a smooth check in with Amy who was very helpful! We found that there was no TV which was a bit of a downer but we had an iPad to use. Definitely would recommend especially price-wise compared to hotels in Seattle! 
25131	4264043	8.0	10.0	35196031	This place was perfect. amazing location, perfect size for 2, felt very safe! i would stay here again and i would recommend to my friends for sure. thanks!!!
25132	4264043	8.0	10.0	35451064	The check in and out was very smooth, only met Amy for a second on our way in but we enjoyed our stay for sure. We didn't rent a car but instead used public transportation or walked everywhere since the location was so central. Really liked Seattle :)
25133	4264043	8.0	10.0	35769070	Fantastic location, easy to find and Amy was more than accommodating.  Would stay here again.
25134	4264043	8.0	10.0	36018881	The best thing about the space is the location. It is really convenient to get around. The space is vintage, so expect creaky floors and thin walls. My only complaint is that the floors were really oily. Other than that, everything was fine. I didn't get to meet the host, Amy, but she was relatively responsive once I arrived. Would stay again just for convenience
25135	4264043	8.0	10.0	36167482	The apartment was cozy and I loved all the features that were original to the apartment like the bed and the cabinets.  I found the bed really comfy, perfect for just me but can't imagine two people trying to sleep on it. You cannot beat the location, it is a quick walk to almost everywhere you might want to go and the neighborhood around seems nice and safe. This is a perfect home base for exploring Seattle and I would not hesitate to stay here again if I find myself back in the Seattle area.
25136	4264043	8.0	10.0	36505077	Amy was very easy to work with. She met us when she said she would, which we greatly appreciated. Also, the place was clean and met all of our expectations. Thanks Amy!
25137	4264043	8.0	10.0	37052379	Accommodation was as described Great location and bed was very comfortable but found it a little small for two. Check in was very smooth and Amy was easy to contact. 
25138	4264043	8.0	10.0	38817815	Wonderful place, it's the perfect location, very cool apartment,  excellent hosts, everything is very easy and well prepared, the place is old but that's what gives it the Victorian Charm but if your unable to carry suitcases up two flights of stairs look elsewhere, otherwise this is the place! Highly recommended!
25139	4264043	8.0	10.0	39295078	"PROS: Location, location, location! Just like everyone else stated, the best perks about this place is the location. If you are coming from Sea-Tac airport, just take the LINK lightrail train (about 40-45 minutes) and it's 5 minutes walk from there.  Amy met up with us on time and gave some suggestions for us to visit.  It's about 5-10 minutes walking distance from all the touristy spots we wanted to go to (Space needle, Chihuly Glass Museum, Starbucks Reserve Roastery, Ride the Ducks, Pike Place). The apartment looks exactly like it does in the photos. It has a refrigerator there, fan which was great for the hot summer time, bathroom stocked shampoos, toothpaste, toilet paper, 2 towels, we didn't need to bring much extra bathroom toiletries.  The bed fits 2 people and the kitchen has plates, cups, stove to cook if needed. There is a tiny sofa there but not meant for anyone to sleep on.

CONS: The apartment itself is a bit old and dated but I felt very safe staying here. 

Overall I would definitely come back the next time I visit Seattle! Thanks Amy!"
25140	4264043	8.0	10.0	39606084	Appartement meublé vintage. On se croirait presque dans le Seattle des années 1930. Logement idéalement situé en hyper centre. Pas mieux !
25141	4264043	8.0	10.0	39903482	The location was perfect and the apartment was clean and cozy. The outside noise could get a little loud. The bed is comfortable but tight for 2 and squeaky. We learned that the parking in and around the downtown is expensive. We found the Westin parking garage behind the building to be the best option.
25142	4264043	8.0	10.0	40716066	The apartment was clean comfortable and an amazing location! It's an old building so the floors do creek and the walls are thin - it didn't bother us I just noticed a few people had mentioned this ! Check in was very smooth and Amy clearly explained how everything worked and we didn't have any issues whilst we were there . Would definitely stay again ! 
25143	4264043	8.0	10.0	41190703	"Good experience here – the best feature was the location, hands down. It was an easy walk to Pike's Place Market and Lake Union. Plenty of space in the apartment – full-size fridge, full (if small) kitchen, full bathroom, etc.

The place wouldn't win any awards for ambiance/decor, but it's not like the post was misleading. Good value – would stay here again. Things to improve: wifi would be nice, and there was a slight odor (though we only noticed it for a few minutes each time we came back to the apartment). The building obviously had some great history to it as well."
25144	4264043	8.0	10.0	41924415	It was a pleasure to be back at The Virginian.  The rooms are basic and funky but perfectly comfortable.  Amy provided info prior to  my arrival and was helpful when I had issues getting the keys to work.  I look forward to returning.  
25145	4264043	8.0	10.0	42670175	Location, location, location, that pretty much summarizes this apartment. If you looking for a luxurious apartment this is not it, but the location is great, and in the end Location in a city like Seattle, is what you are looking for. 
25146	4264043	8.0	10.0	43351891	This is a simple apartment, 10 minutes from Pike Place Market and 15 from Seattle Center. There is no wifi and no step free access. The room could be quite dark as the window view is obscured by a wall. 
25147	4264043	8.0	10.0	44759492	Amy  was super accommodating to getting us into the apartment to leave our bags before check-in so we can go explore Seattle. Exactly as described. Nothing fancy but perfect location to just let everything. The place is very clean! Had a great time in Seattle 
25148	4264043	8.0	10.0	46698855	First time using airbnb and it was a perfect experience.  Amy seemed very sweet, but we didn't have much communication because none was needed.  First time to Seattle for both my wife and I and if we went back this is the exact location we would want.  No bells and whistles in the apartment but had everything we needed.  Best value I could find.  Very very safe.  
25149	4264043	8.0	10.0	47150651	Excellent location, easy check-in, place as described and great communication. Thanks again. I would definitely recommend this place! 
25150	4264043	8.0	10.0	48165394	"The place is exactly as described. Clean, neat, small and tidy. Really great value for money. We found the bed a little small for the two of us, but managed ok. 
The location is EXCELLENT! Close to the city, Pike Place, and the Space Needle. We also loved how it was a 5 minute walk to Belltown - it's a cool area with lots of bars and restaurants. 
Amy was a bit difficult to contact in the days leading up to our booking and as a new Airbnb'er I did get a little bit concerned that there was a problem. Luckily, Amy got back to me the day before we were due to hit Seattle and everything went to plan. "
25151	4264043	8.0	10.0	48396922	Amy's place was great! It was exactly what I was looking for in regards to convenience and location. Space is bigger than depicted in the pictures as well. She communicated effectively as to how to check in etc. Make sure to go to the Dahlia Lounge across the street for the coconut cream pie! Was also a set for Sleepless in Seattle :)
25152	4264043	8.0	10.0	49202855	Amy was very helpful! I arrived early and she allowed me to drop off my bags prior to the check-in time. She was very responsive to anything I needed. The location was perfect! It was a short walk to the convention center for work and very close to Pike Place Market. I was able to walk to anything I needed. 
25153	4264043	8.0	10.0	50078499	It took a few tries before Amy sent us the information about how to get in, but once she did it was super clear and easy! The apartment is exactly as pictured: small, clean, quite. The apartment building is definitely dated which was a bit of a drawback. For the price and location it's unbeatable! 
25154	4264043	8.0	10.0	50616119	Was a great place to stay with charm. Was in an excellent location, in walking distance to most things. 
25155	4264043	8.0	10.0	51110747	"We walked to everything, the Space Needle, Underground Tour, Pikes Market.  The apt. has no windows facing the street so it was fairly quiet.  The place could use a makeover though. The ceiling needs repainting and there was plaster falling off the bathroom wall.  

The Apt was clean and Amy was responsive.  "
25156	4264043	8.0	10.0	51606875	"Wonderful experience! 
The apartment was very nice, clean, spacious. 
The location was great for walking around the city.
The host was very accommodating.
It was my first stay with AirBnB and not my last."
25157	4264043	8.0	10.0	52036753	Amy was very accommodating and let us drop our bags off early. The room was in a great location. Thanks! 
25158	4264043	8.0	10.0	52588814	"Everyone booking this Airbnb is doing it for the same reason - this is the cheapest entire apartment you can get at such a prime location in Downtown Seattle. It is therefore to be expected that it won't be perfect. Previous reviewers (myself included) were happy with their choice, but I think they glossed over some of the drawbacks. I'll focus on those to provide some insight that I feel is lacking.

Let's start with the good. This is a fantastic downtown location with easy access to SeaTac Airport via the LINK light rail. Amy was nice and on time to give me the keys. There is a coin-operated laundry room in the basement. Little amenities (e.g. shaving cream, umbrella) were a nice surprise. 

Now for the drawbacks. It's an old, worn apartment in a dire need of a renovation. I wouldn't call the decor cheerful . There is no thermostat in the unit, the temperature is set for the whole building and can be too low for some. The only window view you have is that of a concrete wall of the neighboring building. The neighbors can be loud at night. The lack of internet access wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but it's uncommon to see these days. 

For the price though, you can't beat it. If I'm in town for a conference again, this place will be on my list. If you are looking for a cheap, completely private place to stay at a great location in Seattle, and don't mind the trade-offs, it's a good choice. 

Ralph's Deli across the street is open late and it's convenient for picking up some basic necessities. Dan's Belltown Grocery on 3rd ave. is a slightly cheaper alternative. 

"
25159	4264043	8.0	10.0	53953176	"The best thing about this apartment is the location! It is in walking distance of almost all the touristy things in Seattle! 

The apartment itself is a little dated but overall it was great! Amy had it stocked with pretty much all the basic necessities. The bed was surprisingly comfortable as well. I would definitely stay here again! "
25160	4264043	8.0	10.0	54576256	A really great little place that is central to everything in seattle. Would definately recommend and stay again! Thanks Amy
25161	4264043	8.0	10.0	54865686	Great place to stay in Seattle!!!
25162	4264043	8.0	10.0	55449001	Outstanding location, close to all the best sights Seattle has to offer...within a few short blocks of the monorail to the space needle, to Pike Place Market, Belltown and some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. Terrific value, considering cost of other places to stay in the immediate area. Very petite, best for one person.
25163	4264043	8.0	10.0	56479569	I was very happy with this apartment--the location is excellent, particularly if you like really good restaurants. The room was clean and well furnished. Lots of space for storage, so I could really make myself at home. I hadn't noticed in the description that there wasn't an elevator. That was only an issue when I arrived and departed with my big suitcase! I'd definitely stay here again. 
28386	4264056	8.0	10.0	23916017	Check-in was simple and quick! The room was pretty sparse but the essentials were all there which was great. The kitchen sink was filthy and was on the checklist so I cleaned it so the owner wouldn't think that I did it. The kitchen and fridge were great but I didn't use either. The location was perfect for walking to the major sites around Seattle like the space needle, pacific science center, and pikes market. 
28387	4264056	8.0	10.0	24196854	The room was fine for the two of us for one night. The kitchen sink was clogged up, so we didn't end up getting to do any cooking - but Lori warned us that morning before check in.
28388	4264056	8.0	10.0	24309134	The location is quite ideal nestled between 4 star hotels and only about 4 blocks from Pikes Place. Check in and check out went swimmingly. Though the building is quite old which offer the good and bad of that. On the Airbnb spectrum of hotel to homey I would say it falls more firmly into the hotel slot.
28389	4264056	8.0	10.0	24430101	Loved this small downtown studio. The location is perfect if you want to explore downtown Seattle. Pike Place Market is just a few block away. Although we didn't get to meet Lori, everything was setup perfectly on our arrival. We had absolutely no problems checking in and out.
28390	4264056	8.0	10.0	24855907	My fiancee and I could not have asked for a better location to stay in Seattle! We were right in the heart of the Seattle hustle and bustle, there is a grocery/deli across the street which was incredibly handy! Minutes walk to fabulous restaurants in Belltown, the Monorail, Pikes Place Market and downtown  We parked our car and didn't need to use it till we left! Lori our host was very helpful letting us know about parking and check-in was very easy! The apartment itself added to our amazing stay in Seattle, it was old school but very homey and romantic! I would happily stay there again if Lori would have us! I will recommend this apartment to anyone and everyone! 
28391	4264056	8.0	10.0	25394638	Great location.  Easy to get around and a lot to do in the surrounding area.  The apartment was pretty sparse but it had the essentials. There is no Wi-Fi or TV but that made me explore more.  We coudlnt figure it out how to get the heat to work but stayed warm anyways.  The only thing that was wrong that it was a little bit dusty. 
28392	4264056	8.0	10.0	25502486	"The location was PERFECT. We took the Link in from the airport and it was only a 5 min walk to the apartment. All the touristy things were within a 15 min walking distance of the apartment. We decided to rent a car our second day there to explore the rest of Seattle (the car rental place was only a 5 min walk!)

Lori was an amazing host. She promptly answered all my questions before arriving and she continued to be available for us throughout our entire stay. "
28393	4264056	8.0	10.0	25631404	Lori made our whole experience of finding and staying in a place in downtown Seattle super simple. Very clear listing, very flexible and willing to communicate, and simple procedure for picking up and dropping off the keys. The location along with the price tag attached cannot be matched. This will likely be the best bang for your buck that you will find downtown!
28394	4264056	8.0	10.0	25717438	The apartment was great, and Lori is so awesome, helpful, and friendly.  It was just steps from the tram, so getting to and from the airport was easy.  The location is right downtown and close to lots of fun things (museums, library, food,pubs....) I felt safe and slept well. I will be back.
28395	4264056	8.0	10.0	25845580	The description pictures were accurate. The instructions given for check-in and check-out were clear and straight-forward. The host was also able to reply back promptly on her phone. You might want to bring slippers for the cold floor tiles. There was no cleaning fee so the place had to be tidied up afterwards. 
28396	4264056	8.0	10.0	26104052	The location is fantastic! I had never been to Seattle before, so I wasn't sure exactly where to stay, but I really lucked out with this place. Bars, restaurants, Pike Place market, the Space Needle, and Seattle Center are all in walking distance. The space itself was pretty cool because it's in a restored historic building, but I think I might have enjoyed it more on a shorter stay. The original Murphy bed was not so comfortable by the fourth night! Overall, the price was right and the location was unbeatable so I'm really happy I stayed here.
28397	4264056	8.0	10.0	26684242	"Location and Price are a hit, everything else is  a miss. 
Location: The location of this apartment is ideal.  It is within walking distance to several restaurants, Pike’s Market, and, if you are in shape, the Space Needle.  There is a Metro bus just around the corner (download the app to figure how to get around) but there are plenty of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.  
The Room: We chose this place because of the age (pre-war) and expected features characteristic to it.  We were not disappointed, this room has high ceilings with beautiful molding, unique closets and a charming claw foot tub.  However, this is not a home but an empty apartment (perhaps awaiting rental?).  The space is sparce and provides the barest basic needs.  If you are looking for a place that is cozy with the comforts of home (typical of an AirBnB or a Bed and Breakfast), this is not it.  This place lacks a couch, coffee maker, or even a throw rug. The room has NO ambiance.   Despite the urban/downtown location, it is a quiet room.  However, the pipes in the corner of EACH room transport hot water (radiators?) and crackle and pop every hour on the hour, loud enough to wake you EVERY HOUR.    Unfortunately, to sum it up this room was grimy.  The baseboards and floor edges were soiled/dusty, the dish drainer was dirty and the tub and toilet were unclean and required scrubbing (by me).    
The Host:  We never met Nick the host, but he promptly provided extra towels and cleaning supplies upon request.  He left us a bottle of wine.
"
28398	4264056	8.0	10.0	26827971	"This was a great first time with AIRBNB.
The whole process from booking to checking out was awesome. 
A great value, a perfect location.
Nick was great. He was there when we checked in and was helpful with communication throughout the process."
28399	4264056	8.0	10.0	27054248	"Nick was prompt at getting our room heated up- it was freezing when we arrived but the heating in the building had went out.  The building is clean but very old with steam/heat radiator which I have only seen in the movies.  The pipes made all kinds of awful noise during the night which resulted in a huge lack of sleep.  Parking was an issue, before arriving I asked about parking and was told it was $4 an hour on the street or discounted daily rate across the street.  We were not told street parking was free on the weekends - which we were staying Sat-Mon, until after was paid for a garage.  The garage was better anyway since the location was shady once we walked around.  There also isn't a coffee pot, BUT Moore Coffee down the street is amazing and they make cute animals in the foam.
"
28400	4264056	8.0	10.0	27334784	Great location. Across the street from a delicious bakery and only a 5-10 minute walk to Pike's Place. Safe area, well-lit at night. The building itself leaves a little bit to be desired. It was small, which we didn't mind, but it was very old. The bed and floorboards were creaky, walls were paper thin (we could hear our neighbors talking) and whenever water moved through the pipes (ie. someone showering), it sounded like banging pots / pans near our head. Hard to sleep. But... can't complain too much given the price. And more importantly, the towels were clean. 
28401	4264056	8.0	10.0	27444970	The location couldn't be better – especially for the price!  Very close to the water and the market, great food, and nightlife!  The building was safe and fairly quiet, and the apartment had everything we needed for the weekend.  One word of warning is that the apartment is creaky and squeaky.  If you’re a light sleeper, you might want to bring along a little fan or noise machine.  Otherwise, it was great!
28402	4264056	8.0	10.0	27500180	"The best thing about this listing is the location. It is quite close to the Waterfront and Pike's Place market as well as many restaurants. It is also only a few blocks from the public transport including monorail to the Space Needle. The apartment itself is on the smaller side but it was perfect for our two day stay. It was clean and well-stocked. The maps and other information about Seattle were a nice touch.
Overall it was a great experience. "
28403	4264056	8.0	10.0	27639747	"My husband and I enjoyed a marvelously sunny weekend in Seattle. Nick was a great host-- he was always timely in communicating, provided clear instructions regarding how to pick up the keys, and was very accomodating as my husband and I arrived after 11pm. 

Pros: Location! Perfect downtown location with easy walking distance to all of Seattle's great sites (space needle, museums, pike market place, restaurants, etc.). Price-- affordable. 

Cons: The apartment is very old.-- the building is very old and charming, however, all of the appliances/amenities are very old/rusty. The pictures listed make the apartment appear larger and nicer than it was.  The bed was only a full size and very lumpy/little support/squeaky, with the head of the bed in a closet. For this reason, you could hear everything. We would go to sleep and be woken up very early by banging and clanging. In addition, at least for Verizon users, little to no reception.

"
28404	4264056	8.0	10.0	27897769	Great location downtown!  Historic charm and a comfortable Murphy bed to boot.  Nick was a pleasant host who was nice enough to accommodated our late arrival
28405	4264056	8.0	10.0	28083997	Great location. Clean and cozy apartment. Nick was very helpful. 
28406	4264056	8.0	10.0	28385855	I would definitely recommend the apartment if you're in Seattle for a few days and looking for a cheap place to stay. Great downtown location, only a few steps away from pike place market and the waterfront but it's quite noisy at night and could have been cleaner. Nick was quite helpful and always answered promptly.
28407	4264056	8.0	10.0	28524065	Nick was easy to communicate with, had an easy time of getting in and out on my timeline. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the building and heating itself are old and loud with the usual, but notable, banging and squeaking. It is indeed a basic, and well-located, apt.
28408	4264056	8.0	10.0	28776996	Great communication with Nick and his assistant prior to and during the stay. Very easy check-in process. The apartment was clean, and is also a bit more spacious than in looks in the pictures. Great experience overall!
28409	4264056	8.0	10.0	29037499	Nick was a good host, quick to answer and kind enough to let us be a little bit late. I agree with the other reviews that the apartment is a bit creaky and loud pipes, but that's what comes with an old building. Maybe bring a small blanket next time since the space heater doesn't work that great. Other than that, I loved my stay. Its really close to Pike's and a lot of small bars. I would definitely stay here again.
28410	4264056	8.0	10.0	29912247	our stay was wonderful. Amy was very quick to respond and was even nice enough to let us check in early. The place itself is in a great location central to to pretty much everything I was interested in. The apartment is older but  very clean. I would stay here again.
28411	4264056	8.0	10.0	30441573	Great, basic apartment in a good downtown location. Agree with other reviewers that it's a bit loud (old building/creaky pipes), so bring ear plugs! I was in town for a conference, so I wasn't around in the daytime too much and it was nice to have an affordable place to crash. Good communication with Amy and super easy checking in/out, which I appreciated. 
28412	4264056	8.0	10.0	30754720	Everything about this airbnb experience was fantastic from start to finish.  Amy wrote ahead of time with clear instructions about how to pick up the keys.  Since our flight arrived earlier than the check-in time, Amy was wonderful and met us early/held onto our bags until the apartment was ready so that we could begin exploring early.  The location is perfect, near the space needle, pike place market, ferry terminal, airport Link train, great wheel and stadiums.  We took the Link from the airport to the apartment and walked everywhere else on our trip, no taxis or car are needed at this apartment.  The neighborhood felt very safe and we were comfortable.  The apartment was stocked with what we needed, and definitely felt more homey than a hotel room, and at a much better price point than area hotels.  The entire place was clean when we arrived, and the building is quiet.  The apartment rocks, the location rocks and Amy rocks as a host.  We would definitely stay again and recommend to friends or family visiting Seattle.
28413	4264056	8.0	10.0	30974820	This is an awesome little apartment with a location you can't beat. Amy was quick to respond and very accommodating! I'd definitely stay here again.
28414	4264056	8.0	10.0	31795270	"Great location downtown Seattle in walking distance from everything! I recommend not bringing a car if at all avoidable because parking is crazy, but I was able to figure out that meters on the street in front of the building are free from 8pm-8am if you must.  

The apartment was clean and appeared as pictured.  Very old building so as expected the walls were pretty thin.  Only complaint was the noise from the water pipes at night.  Again, it is an old apartment building so I would recommend bringing some cheap ear plugs if you are at all bothered by noise.  

Other than that Amy was super nice and easy to get in touch with.  Check in and out were quick and easy and I would recommend staying here to those looking for a great deal on an apartment in the heart of downtown."
28415	4264056	8.0	10.0	31988127	"Nice apartment really well situated, I didn't even have to take the bus ! A bit old but not a real problem. Amy answered quickly and seemed nice although I didn't meet her. Maybe a wi-fi could be an improvement  idea for the apartment.
Would definitely recommend it if you're in Seattle for few days and need an ordinary place downtown."
28416	4264056	8.0	10.0	32169768	The overall experience was good. The apartment is very well located within walking distance of downtowns shopping areas, Pike Place, and the Space Needle. Lots of amenities which I never used but good to have the option. Wish the bed wasn't as uncomfortable as it was but I'm not one to let something like that ruin my time. 
28417	4264056	8.0	10.0	32492922	Excellent location
28418	4264056	8.0	10.0	32764432	Amy's place was perfect! The location was right in the middle of everything you'd want to see or do in downtown Seattle. Even our local friend said we scored a sweet spot with the location. If you're looking for an affordable place to crash after a day of exploring Seattle, this is the place! The apartment included all the basic things you would need for a quick stay. Great location and price. The needle, pike place, emp, chihuly, top pot doughnuts, & the shopping district are all within walking distance. 
28419	4264056	8.0	10.0	33069680	My boyfriend and I had a good experience at Amy's place in Seattle. The place was a perfect size and true to the pictures. We didn't hang in the apartment very much but the space was clean and ready upon arrival. Entry/ departure procedures were very easy to follow. The location was perfect for us!
28420	4264056	8.0	10.0	34623954	The apartment is in a good location. We were able to walk many places, and catch public transport easily. There is no Internet, so be prepared to use data. The walls are very thin, so don't say anything you don't want others to hear. Overall, the apartment is a good price for the location. 
28421	4264056	8.0	10.0	34776877	This apartment is in a great location and is quite roomy, but we would've benefited from having wifi, since we were international travellers and didn't have an American SIM for our phones. We knew this when booking but didn't realise how reliant we were on having it once we got to the States. The building is old and a little creaky, but we only stayed 2 nights, so it was ok. Easy to check in and out and Amy was great with communication. Definitely recommend based on location.
28422	4264056	8.0	10.0	35197573	"This is a fantastic location and a great space to stay for 2!  The apartment was very clean and VERY quiet.  It's in perfect walking distance to ANYTHING you want to do in Seattle.

The instructions for getting in to the apartment were clear.  Amy was tough to get a hold of in the weeks prior to our reservation which left us a little anxious.  Luckily, everything worked out and we were very pleased with the space!"
28423	4264056	8.0	10.0	36515964	"""Fantastic downtown location!"" - as the title says, the only thing this place has going for it is the location. 

- Floors were horribly sticky as though someone dropped goo all over, every step we took a step our flip flops would unstick off the floor - messaged Amy to re-clean but she was out/busy/unresponsive. She claimed that at 130pm it was fine, we entered at 2pm and it was impossible to walk barefoot anywhere. This lasted both days.  -1 star

- Amy was not quick to respond to our requests/concerns/messages and never picked up her phone. She also did not meet us upon check-in while we waited at the restaurant outside.  -1 star

- The weather was very hot and there was no fan provided in the apartment. Amy offered to provide one but did not inform us when she would drop by and missed us. -1 star

You get what you pay for but for $100 a night, least we expected was a clean apartment. Would not stay again."
28424	4264056	8.0	10.0	38108711	The stay work out really great for us. The location is fantastic close to everything you'd want to see. Post was extraordinarily responsive even getting us into the apartment early which helped us out after a long train ride. Would definitely stay here again.
28425	4264056	8.0	10.0	38581373	We spent three nights here and it was perfect! The location was great, close enough to walk to the space needle and train stations, and in a nice downtown area. It was a lovely space with a rustic feel, we felt very comfortable in that cozy place. Would love to stay here again! 
28426	4264056	8.0	10.0	38984316	As stated before, prime location, low cost. 
28427	4264056	8.0	10.0	39375332	Very true to description.
28428	4264056	8.0	10.0	41058933	"The location of this appartment is great: it is a five minute walk from Pike Place Market, and at walking distance from the Space Needle, downtown and Pioneer Square. 
Communication with Amy was efficient - everything went well. 
The appartment was clean, nicely decorated, convenient and spacious enough to put all your baggage. It is located in an impressive old building and definetely has a certain charm. However, we do feel that it needs a new mattress on the bed (the bed itself is beautiful, built-in) and a new bath (nothing charming about a very old bath).
Other than that, we had a wonderful stay in Seattle!"
28429	4264056	8.0	10.0	41313156	exactly what we wanted - basic apartment in a great location. pike place market, the space needle and seattle art museum all within walking distance. perfect for a short stay in seattle!
28430	4264056	8.0	10.0	41919298	"The apartment is true to description and the location is prime! It's in an old building, a bit outdated, but clean. The flat felt a bit stuffy when I checked in but opening the windows solved the problem almost immediately. Overall a good value!!!

I didn't get to meet Amy in person but communication via texting worked well. Thanks Amy, for a pleasant stay!"
28431	4264056	8.0	10.0	43684003	It was a pleasant stay and the apartment was very well located within a 10min walk to the Space Needle. The communication with Amy was easy and everything was taken care of when we arrived. Wifi will be offered in the near future - that would have made it perfect. We can recomment it. Thanks again for having us.
28432	4264056	8.0	10.0	43935813	"This was a great location! Check in and check out were a breeze. Accommodations were clean and simple, but definitely ""vintage"". It's a fair price, but you are mostly posting for the location, which was more than worth it to us."
28433	4264056	8.0	10.0	44410897	It was cheap accommodation, it was in a good location a few blocks from the market, space needle and downtown. It was a bit grubby, but you can't really expect much more with the money you pay for it. It did the job!
28434	4264056	8.0	10.0	45239117	We loved our stay!  The location could not have been better.  It was a great basecamp for our time in seattle;  easy access to pike place, space needle,  belltown and downtown!
28435	4264056	8.0	10.0	45484991	Amy was absolutely fabulous! She was incredibly accommodating and  very understating. Check in was very easy and the location is great!  I was in town for a wedding and was able to check in a little bit early and had to leave a little early as well. I left my necklace in the room so she will be mailing it back to me. 
28436	4264056	8.0	10.0	46387474	Listing was accurate- very convenient location. Easy check-in, easy check-out. Amy was available for questions, etc. 
28437	4264056	8.0	10.0	47154256	The location of this place was the selling factor.  A bit grubby but it served all our basic needs as we weren't in the apartment much. Good for a weekend of exploring Seattle.
28438	4264056	8.0	10.0	47372742	"Die Lage der Wohnung war ideal, da wir mit dem Zug angereist waren.
Die Wohnung war mit dem nötigsten ausgestattet, im Badezimmer das Waschbecken mit Rostflecken, der Duschvorhang mit Schimmel. Wir wollten dort nicht duschen, hatten versucht den Schimmel zu entfernen. Kontakt zu Amy nur über Haustelefon zur Schlüsselübergabe. Ich hatte im Email nach Anreisemöglichkeiten vom Bahnhof zur Wohnung gefragt, bekam aber keine Antwort darauf."
28439	4264056	8.0	10.0	47623307	This is a very convenient apartment which is very near to Pike's market and a lot of restaurants around the corner as well.  The apartment though small is good for a couple with a kitchen and bathroom. Recommended
28440	4264056	8.0	10.0	47963222	I was getting uncomfortable at first since I hadn't heard back from Amy via Airbnb and finally called her.  Check in and Check Out were a snap.  I loved the place.  It is older as others have said, but I would stay there again in a heartbeat.  The location was central and you couldn't have asked for a cleaner place.    The brochures on the table of everything going on in Seattle was a great idea.  Somebody staying here should be aware that there is no TV and no coffee pot.   I almost went out to Target and bought a cheap coffee pot and would have left it.  I really didn't need the TV, but could see where it would have been nice on a really nasty night or to watch the news since there was no internet.   There is a great bakery and a grocery store across the street and a couple of restaurants in the same block.  Once I discovered them, the lack of coffee pot became a non issue.    The apartment is also an easy walk to Pike Place Market (5 or 6 blocks)...  
28441	4264056	8.0	10.0	49324304	"Excellent location. Apartment offers everything, but note that there is no Wi-Fi at the current moment. 
I found that there is a good Wi-Fi connection in the adjacent restaurant (which is quite expensive), and also a free, very stable, Wi-Fi in the Macey's branch which is only 2 minutes walk away."
28442	4264056	8.0	10.0	49875677	Right in the heart of down town, we literally could walk anywhere! The value for this place is fabulous any hotel in this location would easily be 3x now. 
28443	4264056	8.0	10.0	50087859	"Great location! Walking distance from the market which was very convenient.
The place itself was a bit gloomy and it would be really nice if there was wifi provided.
Amy was a bit tough to get a hold of sometimes but she'd pick up every time you tried calling her directly."
28444	4264056	8.0	10.0	51010678	Excellent location right in the heart of downtown Seattle. It was perfect if you're looking to walk around and explore the city and just need a place to crash at night, which is exactly what we did. Very cool, old school, historic building. 
28445	4264056	8.0	10.0	53449725	The apartment was easy to find and as described. It did need a bit of airing out as most old buildings do. I was in town for a conference and, having been a former Seattleite, was planning to spend much of the days out and about so only needed a place to sleep. This was definitely a great value for the location - easy walk to the Convention Center, light rail, buses, and Pike Place Market. Check in and check out was very easy.
28446	4264056	8.0	10.0	53882133	Amy was a good host, check in was easy. The room was nothing fancy, bed was very squeaky, but a good place to sleep otherwise. The location was amazing. I would stay here again. 
28447	4264056	8.0	10.0	54229029	Amy was extremely hard to get a hold of. She basically ignored us until the day of our reservation. I messaged her on Airbnb a week prior. I called and texted the day before with no response what so ever. We had never been to Seattle, and we had experienced a last minute cancellation with Airbnb previously, so it made us apprehensive. The location was great once we made it in.  
28448	4264056	8.0	10.0	54517910	Everything worked out perfectly during our air b&b trip.  When we arrived we called Amy as instructed, she immediately buzzed us in and we picked up the key in the designated pick up spot.  When we walked into our unit, everything was as expected.  The heater was turned on so the apartment was nice and warm.  We bought an umbrella at the airport but noticed one was provided along with miscellaneous toiletries.  We did not see Amy at all during our trip, but it was not necessary as we had everything we needed.  The location was great as it was walking distance from Pike Place Market, the waterfront, and other various bars in surrounding neighborhoods.  Check out was simple as the check out policy and procedures were clearly listed on the door.  Location is walking distance from the light rail to head back to the airport.  Awesome location and perfect for a couple exploring Downtown Seattle.
28449	4264056	8.0	10.0	55678322	Amy was very easy to get a hold of and everything was as described in the unit. It was very clean and location couldn't be beat! 5 minute walk to the market and 15 minute walk to the space needle.  As others mentioned, no Wifi or TV so beware if you need to be connected! Only other thing missing was body wash or soap! Plenty of shampoos/conditioners, though.
28450	4264056	8.0	10.0	56585864	Good location, easy communication with Amy. Thank you.
33355	1815304	8.0	10.0	8619936	"Just looking for a quick overnight in Seattle and this spot was perfect! Steps away from everything on Capitol Hill. We absolutely lucked out on this location. 
Michael is awesome. He's an extraordinarily welcoming and genuine host who opens up his unique home to you. The accommodations are in a second floor loft and while an air mattress is not the most immensely comfortable arrangement, the location, space, and value made up for this aspect. 
Thanks Michael! Good luck in Seattle."
33356	1815304	8.0	10.0	8650470	I had an incredible experience staying with this host family.  Such great, loving people who are very hospitable and recommend the best restaurants and attractions around town.  The condo is situated perfectly in downtown Seattle, which was great for walking and site seeing. The room provided is a loft which is cozy (provided with privacy curtain) and has a luxurious queen sized air mattress to sleep on. Getting in and out of the condo was easy and we were provided with a set of keys. There are two dogs named Zero and Frida. They are very cute fluffy buddies that you can never give enough hugs. They are fairly quiet and mild tempered dogs, which is a plus. Michael and Lily are incredibly giving and easy going, and make for super interesting conversations! Overall, I give this 100% A+, and if I were in the area again I would definitely stay here again, no questions asked. 
33357	1815304	8.0	10.0	8826617	Awesome couple, awesome location, super friendly and hospitable and willing to do more than most. Very glad I chose their place. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!! 
33358	1815304	8.0	10.0	8986980	It was a great experience!  They provide family atmosphere.  I highly recommand it! 
33359	1815304	8.0	10.0	9035702	"Michael and Lily were both wonderful hosts! We needed a place downtown and close to the action. Pike's Place was walkable and so was Capitol Hill. We used Lyft to get to Fremont neighborhood and see the attractions there.

Michael and Lily's place was comfortable and they made us feel at home (though we weren't there too much, since there was so much to see around their place!) They provided breakfast stuffs and coffee, and had a computer set up with a slideshow of things they'd done so far. We got locked out once because their the door to their apartment complex was busted for everyone, and they left what they were doing down the street to come let us in. Lovely.

Only small downsides: The air mattress would deflate (as air mattresses do) which would make the sleeping uncomfortable towards the morning. Not a huge issue if you're just staying a couple of nights. Also, they have small dogs, which would occasionally yip during the night. It only got to be a problem one night when Frida ostensibly needed to use the doggy bathroom. But Michael and Lily came back shortly after I texted them to let her out.

Michael and Lily were wonderful hosts, you can't really beat the location / price as far as we could see, and would recommend staying with them again. Cheers guys!"
33360	1815304	8.0	10.0	9187037	Michael and Lily are the perfect hosts for your stay in Seattle. They really like to host people and show them their neighborhood. We just stayed with them for one night and had a very good and fun time. The appartement is in the middle of everything. You can walk to the best places in town and it is just 5 blocks from the lightrail station. We would stay again.
33361	1815304	8.0	10.0	9203411	Super friendly hosts, very clean place, plenty of privacy, friendly dogs, central location--you can't go wrong!
33362	1815304	8.0	10.0	9271140	Amazing and fun times at this great place in a wonderful location! 
33363	1815304	8.0	10.0	9334983	"Great airbnb. Michael, Lili and the doggies were extremely welcoming and friendly. They were more like friends I have not seen for ages rather than strangers. 
The space is conveniently located. 10 minute walk to the shopping zones and 15 minute walk to the Pike Market. The space is also well-equipped with WiFi, computer and Netflix. The only down side was the air bed, but it would not matter for just a few days. Overall, highly recommended!"
33364	1815304	8.0	10.0	9450985	Michael and Lili were awesome, generous hosts. I arrived on Christmas Day when most places were closed. Michael brought me around Seattle and even found places for dinner. They were both very friendly and great to talk to and had great tips for sightseeing and food. The apartment was very tidy and the loft was just amazing. They provide so many facilities that you won't be bored even if you decide to just stay in and chill. Definitely a place I would love to stay at again if I return to Seattle.
33365	1815304	8.0	10.0	9710334	"I was in Seattle for a decently long 8 days and my stay with Michael and Lily was an amazing experience. They are very friendly and accommodating to me. They had lots of advice for different hotspots to visit while I was in Seattle and helped me a lot in getting to explore the entire town at large. We even went out together at times and they know how to have a great time in such a large city. Michael and Lily are excellent hosts.

The location of their apartment could not be in a more convenient place, situated in the middle of Downtown Seattle close by to virtually everything you would ever need. Bars up the street, Pike Market down the street, and a whole motley of other shopping centers and wonderful eateries in between.

The loft inside their apartment is spacious and comfortable. They provide a computer, printer, and scanner all by the desk which was incredibly convenient for me, meaning I didn't have to use my laptop for any of my work. Their dogs Freida and Zero are adorable bundles of energy, although they sometimes bark at night. The air mattress is a little odd to sleep on at first and you have to refill it each night, but you get used to it.

All in all they were wonderful people, the loft is well equipped for most of your needs, and the apartment is in a fantastic location. You can not go wrong staying here."
33366	1815304	8.0	10.0	9751652	It was an awesome stay at Michaels place. Although we stayed only for one night we were made to feel completely at home. Michael is a very good host and we had a wonderful time with him going to bars and having the best possible hot dog so far in my life. Thanks Michael!!
33367	1815304	8.0	10.0	9767069	I would strongly recommend MIchael's place to anybody. The hosts were incredibly gracious and hospitable. It's a beautiful apt in a central location. I couldnt have asked for much else, I had a lovely stay. I wish I had more time to hang out with them. 
33368	1815304	8.0	10.0	9813262	"Michael, Lily, Freida and Zero are nice host.
They gave us a lot of advice about Seattle.
Their apartment is very cozy, providing we have a wonderful time in Seattle
"
33369	1815304	8.0	10.0	9856820	Michael and Lily were super nice! We checked in fairly easily, the location was very central in a decent building. We only stayed one night as we were just flying out of Seattle the next day, but it worked well for us. I would not recommend it for a long-term stay because of the lack of privacy in the loft area, but great for a couple days. Their dogs were really cute, but if you are picky about dog hair/smells then they might bug you. It was awesome having use to the desktop computer in the loft space with Netflix so we could watch our favourite shows in bed. The bed was inflatable, but you could adjust it quite easily to make it firmer/softer and it was fairly comfortable. It was nice having a kitchen there with complimentary coffee/tea and bagels. Lily even made us a delicious breakfast! Great hosts, and overall a great stay. 
33370	1815304	8.0	10.0	9886796	It was a great stay! Michael was extremely accommodating. His partner in crime gave some great recommendations for restaurants in the area and ideas for what to do. The air bed was not a problem much. If only one person was staying, the air bed would actually be perfect. For two people I think it's still ok to some extent. It did get really really hot during the night though. So DO pull the air bed away from the wall. Their dogs are quite well behaved and adorable. I would say that staying here made traveling in Seattle so much more fun and affordable than staying in a hotel that was equally as close to downtown. Plus it's great having a refrigerator and computer to use!
33371	1815304	8.0	10.0	9952670	"Great place to stay in downtown Seattle, the Location was really the key factor. Their perfect 100 walk score is crazy awesome.

Michael, Lily and their two little dogs were great hosts and really helped making my stay in Seattle a truly fantastic one!

I fully recommend anyone staying in Seattle to consider staying here as they will definitely be glad they did."
33372	1815304	8.0	10.0	10006413	My wife and I recently spent a week in Seattle to scout out the various neighborhoods for a planned relocation later this year. Two of those nights were at this downtown location with Michael and Lily, who were fantastic hosts. The location was amazing! You couldn't ask to be more central. Parking can be a bit tricky, so if you are planning to drive make sure to speak with Michael ahead of time. There were lots of amenities and public transport links within walking distance, so you really wouldn't need a car if staying here. Michael and Lily were kind enough to show us some of the great bars and restaurants in the First and Capitol Hill districts. They also provide some great advice for those thinking about relocating to Seattle (they were in our shoes 6-months ago). Great hosts, awesome location, comfortable bed, clean bathroom and friendly dogs! Highly recommended!
33373	1815304	8.0	10.0	10123125	I absolutely enjoyed my stay with Mike and Lilly. The doors and the building were easy to find and get into. Mike was super friendly, super hospitable, and helpful. As soon as we walked in he handed us the key to the place. The place is comfortable, clean & welcoming. They have two small dogs but when Lilly and Mike go to bed the dogs go with them. The place is very central and can walk, bus or lyft it anywhere. They offered us bath towels, orange juice & bagels (even though we could not find any cups in their kitchen). I cannot say enough of how helpful they were with recommendations on itinerary and places to eat. Their place was central to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and shopping! There was a bit of confusion on booking so we had to book another Seattle location the same day we left our home city, but Mike was kind enough and gave us a ride the next day to our second airbandb in Seattle. If you do not mind sleeping on air mattress I would highly recommend staying here. I would definitely come back to stay with them again if I am ever in town again!
33374	1815304	8.0	10.0	10155252	Michael and Lillie were phenomenal hosts! This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have found a better home to start our adventure. From the moment we got there, we felt right at home and very welcomed. They had such a fun energy and were extremely helpful recommending the best bars, restaurants and things to do around town. I wish we would have had more time to spend with them! The view from their place was beautiful and the location truly is ideal: safe and literally a hop and skip from just about anywhere. I never thought that the hosts would be such a highlight of our trip of exploring Seattle. Thank you for everything Michael and Lillie! :)
33375	1815304	8.0	10.0	10195748	Micheal and Lilly were awesome hosts! Their place is clean and in an awesome location. They took me out the night I got there and showed me a great time. They know a lot about the city and really helped me get to know the area. I highly recommend them to other travelers headed to Seattle. 
33376	1815304	8.0	10.0	10418061	"Michael and Lili were exceptional hosts, they provided not only space - they invested their time and energy to show us the city personally. And we can assure you there is a lot to see! 
Apartment is in walking distance to the centre and many little (and inexpensive) restaurants and bars. It is warm and welcoming place with everyhing what you need for your stay. There's only one drawback - the air mattress doesn't provide high comfort... 
Overall, we've been very satisfied."
33377	1815304	8.0	10.0	10528679	My friend and I stayed with Michael and Lili while we were in town for a conference. They were very nice and helpful (great restaurant recommendations) during or stay. Their place was perfect for us and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Even though we are all busy, it was great to hang out with them and get to know them at the end of the day. Plus, their two dogs are absolutely adorable and very sweet. I would recommend them to anyone wanting to stay in/near downtown.
33378	1815304	8.0	10.0	10569892	Michael and Lili were great!  Unfortunately, we were only there for one night, but a great night it was. Lili greeted us and immediately showed us around the place. Also offered us a lot of information about the sites to see and how to get around. At night, they suggested really great bars that quickly became my Seattle favorites. Their dogs are SO adorable and well behaved. Michael and Lili are so friendly, informative, helpful and always made sure we knew that if we ever needed anything they were there. It was because of them our stay was easy, nice, enjoyable and especially memorable.
33379	1815304	8.0	10.0	10674460	I had a very nice time with Michael and Lili. They were both friendly and open with their home. The location of the apartment was wonderful and everything was just as they had described it. 
33380	1815304	8.0	10.0	10762497	"The location of Michael and Lili's apartment couldn't be better; we walked everywhere in the city, and the neighborhood is surrounded by cool places to eat and drink. Their apartment is lovely and comfortable. If you've never slept on an air mattress, it might be awkward at first, but it's a good night sleep anyway. They are very friendly people, willing to give directions and advice on the places to visit. The dogs are lovely, too! We only stayed for two nights, but we totally recommend their place. //
El departamento de Michael y Lili no podría estar mejor ubicado: fuimos a todos lados caminando y el barrio está lleno de lugares interesantes donde comer y tomar. Su casa es linda y cómoda. Si nunca durmieron en un colchón de aire, quizás les tome un rato acostumbrarse, pero igual se duerme bien. Ellos son gente muy amigable, siempre dispuestos a darnos indicaciones y consejos sobre qué lugares visitar. Sus perros también son adorables. Solo nos quedamos dos noches, pero recomendamos este lugar sin ninguna duda."
33381	1815304	8.0	10.0	10794612	Great location, very friendly hosts. The space is not very private, but the photos are accurate. It worked out very well for me. 
33382	1815304	8.0	10.0	10839428	They are really nice. They introduced us many good places in Seattle. Wish we can stay in their house more days. 
33383	1815304	8.0	10.0	10924290	Mike and Lili’s main mantra was to make their guests feel comfortable and at home - and they did exactly that for me. They welcomed me to Seattle with open arms and I became enamored with the city on my first day. They are flexible, easygoing, and very accommodating to needs if you ask for help. Also, I am allergic to dogs with fur but I didn’t have a hard time when I stayed at their place. The dogs were so well-behaved, joyful and rarely went up to the area I was sleeping. 
33384	1815304	8.0	10.0	11271288	"We really enjoyed our stay at Michael and Lili's apartment and felt very comfortable throughout our time in Seattle. Unfortunately Lili was out of town during our stay, but Michael was extremely knowledgable on things to do and had great suggestions during our stay. The location couldn't have been better and there was a myriad of things to see and do. We found it easy to come and go as we pleased and always felt welcomed on our return by Frieda and Zero. We would definitely stay at this location again and would recommend it to anyone.

Thanks! 

Mike and Josh"
33385	1815304	8.0	10.0	11395130	I had an excellent time staying with Michael! He was a great host. His knowledge of the Seattle area was extensive and he pointed out a lot of fun things to do in my down time when I wasn't at my convention. I'd definitely stay at this location again and recommend it to anyone!
33386	1815304	8.0	10.0	11651274	This was my first experience with Airbnb and I had a great time staying at Michael and Lili's apartment. This location is ideal because it is centrally located to everything you want to do while in Seattle. It's an easy walk to downtown Seattle, local bars and restaurants. Micheal and Lili are warm, extremely friendly, and offered great ideas of where to eat and even took some time one evening to show me some of the local bars in the neighborhood for a good drink. Also, what made the stay all the more enjoyable were Frieda and Zero who greeted me with over-the-top enthusiam and they are well behaved, adorable, dogs. I felt like I was at home while visiting and I definitely recommend this spot and plan to book again with them on my next visit to Seatte.
33387	1815304	8.0	10.0	11679415	"Very central and easy walk to downtown Seattle. Perfect if you want to stay in Central Seattle.

33388	1815304	8.0	10.0	11850688	We had a great time staying at Lili and Michaels apartment. It was our first airbnb experience and we were really happy to had such nice hosts like Lili and Michael are. They helped us to find a parking lot for our car and gave us some good recommendations for bars, restaurants and sightseeing! We were welcomed to use the kitchen, balcony, bathroom and living room! The location of their Home was perfect. It was a great experience! We highly recommend them!
33389	1815304	8.0	10.0	12144496	We stayed at Micheal and Lily's on our first ever trip to Seattle, and we have to say that one of the reasons we adored Seattle so much was due to these amazing hosts. As soon as we arrived we were welcomed like old friends - they introduced us to the best burgers in all of the US - Li'l Woody's, took us out to explore some of Capitol Hill's most incredible bars - with pinball all night, and gave us so much insight into a city they obviously love. Had a blast, thanks guys! 
33390	1815304	8.0	10.0	12223094	Michael and Lili were very friendly and easy to coordinate with. The location is perfect and although I was visiting for work so I didn't have much time to chat with the hosts, they were great about letting me get my work done upstairs! 
33391	1815304	8.0	10.0	12329811	First time using airbnb and I’m satisfied with everything. Michael & Lili are a great hosts and their apartment is real cozy and very very close to The Washington Convention Center which makes it quick to get to all tourist locations. He even prepared good guide books ready for us. We had great chat with them and enjoyed the whole stay. 
33392	1815304	8.0	10.0	13207656	The location was great- if you're in town for a conference, you can't ask for a better spot. Close by restaurants, shopping, convention center, etc. Groceries are a bit of a hike if you need heavy shopping, but there's a convenience store on the corner if you just need basics. I arrived right after the host's standard mattress died and before the futon frame arrived, so I slept on the mattress on the floor, which was fine for me. I also love animals, so the dogs didn't bother me, however if you're anti-dog or allergic, you may want to look at another listing (they live there, we don't). I was attending conference stuff from 9-7, so I didn't get to spend tons of time with my hosts, but overall, my first Air B&B was good! 
33393	1815304	8.0	10.0	13571546	Good place, well located. We didn't see Michael, but Lili was friendly and gave us good advices.
33394	1815304	8.0	10.0	13935152	Mike and Lily were great hosts! They were so flexible with my check in/check out time which I really appreciated. Their room upstairs is great and perfect for travelers. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a place in downtown Seattle! 
33395	1815304	8.0	10.0	14857663	Great hosts, great location what more could ask for!  I stayed with Michael & Lilly for 8 nights whilst I was attending a conference and it worked really well.  This was my first AirBnB experience and I'll certainly be doing it again.
33396	1815304	8.0	10.0	15137313	I really enjoyed my stay at Mike and Lilly's apartment.  They are very friendly and nice hosts to talk to and stay with.  I had a great experience and I recommend it to everyone, specially if you are looking for a place close to downtown, restaurants and shops.  You would also enjoy the view of the town from the balcony. 
33397	1815304	8.0	10.0	15523850	Michael and Lili were great hosts, very hospitable and they gave us some excellent recommendations. The location was perfect and we managed to get everywhere we wanted to without a car. We stayed for 8 nights and the bed was very comfortable. We would definitely recommend staying with Michael and Lili.
33398	1815304	8.0	10.0	15811804	Loved staying at the loft.  The crash course on the neighborhood pubs was incredible.   Great location, right downtown. We will be looking you up next time in Seattle!
33399	1815304	8.0	10.0	16564562	Very convenient location,very cute dogs and very nice hosts
33400	1815304	8.0	10.0	16714180	Michael and Lily were very friendly, and their place was superb! Definitely will recommend this place for my friends who want to visit Seattle. 
33401	1815304	8.0	10.0	17044838	We had a great time with Michael and Lily in Seattle. We would recommend this place for the location and particularly the welcoming hosts. We were able to walk everywhere we needed and Michael and Lily even showed us around some of the amazing nearby bars. They made us feel very welcome in Seattle and gave us loads of great recommendations.
33402	1815304	8.0	10.0	17500008	Staying at Michaels was great. The hosts were really nice and helped us with every kind of questions. The place is located in downtown, just perfect. We really loved our stay there and would always come back :)
33403	1815304	8.0	10.0	17931769	"Lili was great. She was helpful in telling us about the local hotspots. She made us feel very welcome.

The location within the city is excellent... actually it couldn't be any better. We were just a few blocks from anything anyone would want to do in the city.

If I had to nitpick it would be the smallish bedroom... which is an office in the loft area, with a convertible couch in it. Being that it was mid-August it got a little hot up there with no AC. That said, we didn't travel to Seattle to be locked up in an hotel room or apt... so we didn't really mind at all.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind sleeping on a couch-bed."
33404	1815304	8.0	10.0	18497802	"Very welcoming. Michael and Lili make you feel at home. 

Fantastic neighborhood. Blocks away from Pike's Place Market, easy access to the lake, ferry's on the bay, tons of fresh eats. "
33405	1815304	8.0	10.0	18679667	I arrived in Seattle with a couple days to check out the area. I didn't have much of a gameplan, and Lili and Mike were both extremely helpful. They told me about must see places and referred some great restaurants. Later on Mike showed me some local bars which made for a great time. The place was nice and tidy, and the dogs were uber friendly. A++ 
33406	1815304	8.0	10.0	19464418	"The absolute best things about this place are:  1) The location, and 2) Lili!  The location is absolutely amazing - just steps from the convention center, easy walk to the market, and other downtown destinations.  In the other direction,  hole in the wall bars, restaurants and just all around kool places to hang.  We didn't get to meet Michael, but my advice to you is - whatever Lili tells you to do, drink or eat - Do it, Drink it, or Eat it!!  Her recommendations allowed us to have some of THE best food and drinks, hands down, that I have ever had.  Must trys include Kedai (hole in the wall Malaysian) and PieBar (Pietini's!!).  She is a wonderful and sweet host. We felt completely at home.  

When we first arrived I was a bit worried about the small space upstairs (it pretty much fits the bed and the desk and that's it), the open aspect of the lost (its got a curtain for privacy), as well as the shared bath (although it was clearly stated), and thought I might have made a mistake.  However, Lili made us feel so at home that in the end none of that mattered, and I was just SOOO happy about the location and her company!  The apartment is small so 4 people would really fill it up, and if you need real alone time there are probably better options - but we had a truly wonderful stay.  Thank you so much Lili!!  You are the best!  Mwah!!!"
33407	1815304	8.0	10.0	19684121	This was my first time using Airbnb and I must say that Michael and Lili were great hosts. They also have two friendly dogs. Lili gave us recomendations of what to do and where to eat. There place is in a excellent location and everything is in walking distance. I would recommend this place to anyone that plans on staying a couple nights in Seattle. 
33408	1815304	8.0	10.0	19892126	The pic is accurate - the room is a loft at the top of the very cool spiral staircase on the left. Very comfortable even during warm weather for Seattle - nice Dyson fan keeps it great. Two little dogs - a pug and a long-haired terrier named Frieda, easy to make friends with. The place is close to good eating and the Paramount Theater - Neil deGrasse Tyson was there for a few nights as well as Brian Regan. Good cinema nearby as well. I flew in and needed no rental car. I used Lyft and foot travel to get where I needed to be (I was here for a week of work). Michael and Lili are great people and experienced with Airbnb. Yup, no doubt I'd do it again.
33409	1815304	8.0	10.0	20283301	Apartment very well located. Lili has been very welcoming. Might stay there again in the future.
33410	1815304	8.0	10.0	20428569	"Michael and Lili were great hosts. Very warm and welcoming. They really made our stay at Seattle a great experience, especially with all their really good suggestions (the map they provided with landmarks as well as places to eat/drink at, was also quite helpful). Their home was very lovely and my friend and I thought that the decor was very tasteful. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here when they come to Seattle. 

bonus: Their pups are also the nicest ever, so fun and loving."
33411	1815304	8.0	10.0	20675354	The listing was accurate, Michael and Lily were super welcoming and utterly keen to see me well-fed during my stay, and this was my first airbnb experience, so they left a great impression and made me want to try it again.  The neighborhood is just unfairly awesome.  Delicious food at adorable places everywhere I looked, and access to everything downtown.  I want to move in.
33412	1815304	8.0	10.0	20818828	This was such a great stay! I felt so welcome and could have not asked for a better downtown accommodation. That said, it IS still downtown with all its noise, dust, air, and sketchiness - only a block away. I am happy i stayed right there, i walked to all the places i needed to be.
33413	1815304	8.0	10.0	21102166	The location is great. Lili is very nice and welcoming. I had a great experience.
33414	1815304	8.0	10.0	21441087	"Lili offered great suggestions and a lot info about exploring Seattle. The loft is a private area with shared bathroom. It was the perfect place to explore Westlake / Downtown Seattle.   Make sure you get the CityPASS and if you like to walk there's a lot of stuff nearby including the light rail and monorail a few blocks west that leads to to the space needle.  I spent the evenings exploring Capitol Hill which is conveniently within walking distance heading east.  Day time you can head west and you can do all the tourist stuff.

Lili and Michael also have two sweet and friendly dogs but they are trained to stay out of the loft area."
33415	1815304	8.0	10.0	21825134	I had a great time with Lily and Michael. Unfortunately this was a business trip, so there was not much time on my side. But whenever I could get a few hours off, Michael and Lily had several great tips handy. Whenever I can make it to get back to Seattle, I will make sure I can stay with them again. Thank you so much for such a great Airbnb-first-timer experience.
33416	1815304	8.0	10.0	22182425	"Home away from Home. Michael and Lili made me feel totally at home for the 4 days I was there. They invited me to join them for dinner or drinks on a couple of occasions. they are also have lots of knowledge of   whats going on in the city. Comfortable bed, with all the amenities you need.

I will definitely be staying here should I ever be back in Seattle, and recommend everyone to stay with Michael and Lili  "

I only slept there and we went out together a couple of nights, which is a really cool way to find out the cool bars in Seattle. Michael is a Yelp guru who knows all the best places. Not to forget: their apartment is really close to the convention center, that was the main reason I picked them! 
Thanks again!

33418	1815304	8.0	10.0	22674868	Great location- the walk to Pike Place and downtown was easy. The Space Needle wasn't too far either... The apartment is nice- nice little loft for your bedroom! Honestly, it was everything it was advertised. And Michael and Lili were great too- very friendly and hospitable. Cute dogs as well! We only had a short stay there but would recommend it.
33419	1815304	8.0	10.0	23307507	Have a rest time in Michael and Lily's house! They are so nice, give me much help and make me feel so safe in my personal trip. It is a very great location in downtown to get good restaurant and buy everything. 
33420	1815304	8.0	10.0	23809516	Excellent location, timely feedback, warm hospitality, reasonable price, and lovely dogs made our stay in Seattle more special than it could have been!
33421	1815304	8.0	10.0	23876977	Lili was an incredibly enthusiastic and welcoming host. I was comfortable in their loft room and found their apartment to be very quiet. The location within walking distance to downtown, Pill Hill, and the light rail is superb.
33422	1815304	8.0	10.0	25202610	Really awesome location. Just a block from the convention center. Michael was a great and friendly host. 
33423	1815304	8.0	10.0	25625803	The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
33424	1815304	8.0	10.0	25660524	Staying at Michael's and Lily's was a good choice for three reasons - its location, Michael's and Lily's insight of their city, and their adorable canine companions Zero and Freida. We visited Seattle for the first time, arriving from China at the Westlake light rail Station with our luggage. Before checkin, we had three hours to kill, so we ate our first meal in a Japanese restaurant upon Michael's recommendation. Excellent Sushi! Many yummy meals followed afterwards in endless quality restaurants within walking distance. Zero and Freida kept us company when we rested in the apt. Zero loved to play and both of them (especially Freida) snuggled with us on the sofa. We heartily recommend Michael & Lily's place for Seattle first timers! 
33425	1815304	8.0	10.0	26023357	Great space in an excellent location. Michael and Lili were both very welcoming and offered their expertise on surrounding areas of town (which I needed as a first-time visitor). Their two dogs were sweet and quiet, and I felt very welcome here in Michael & Lili's place. I would surely recommend and stay again.
33426	1815304	8.0	10.0	26377373	"Michael and Lilli are awesome hosts. 
We felt very welcomed and home. 
The flat is located in the middle of the town and the street surrounding it are full of adventures. Both of them had very nice suggestions for different locations and things to do downtown.
Their Dogs Zero and Frieda have been a lot of fun while we stayed.
We would recommend them warmly as hosts for Seattle to everyone."
33427	1815304	8.0	10.0	26436913	Michael and Lili were fantastic hosts. Room is great with comfy sofa bed and good bedding provided. They took me out and showed me local bars and restaurants in the capitol hill area which is a really cool place. Its an excellent location where there is a solid nightlife any night of week. If you want to see the best of Seattle and have a blast while your there then these are the hosts for you.
33428	1815304	8.0	10.0	26804077	Great location, super friendly hosts! Great doggies that are a lot of fun! The room is spacious and welcoming. There is a little bit too much noise coming from the cars on the street, but nothing that will keep you up.
33429	1815304	8.0	10.0	27401391	My boyfriend and I enjoyed our weekend visit to Seattle. Michael and Lilli had lots of places to recommend that we check out. And the recommendations were great! The location was very central. We were able to walk to most places from Michael and Lilli's. They were very warm and friendly. The space was clean and comfortable. The dogs were cute, too! :) 
33430	1815304	8.0	10.0	27547783	"Had a wonderful 3 night stay at the best location in Seattle. Michael was very welcoming and warm. His is really the ""best location in Downtown"". Within walking distance to downtown Seattle and also close to bus lines if you need/feel like riding. Great stay!"
33431	1815304	8.0	10.0	27774635	This location is truly in the center of it all! We walked everywhere from pike place to the space needle. There are cool places to eat (Michael knows them all!) and great bars close by. The dogs are super sweet and love to get attention, so cute! Overall we loved our stay at Michael's place. 
33432	1815304	8.0	10.0	27889918	Me and my friend visited seattle for two days and michael and lili's place were very close to everything. We had our own room and the dogs were great. Michael and Lili were very friendly and so easy to get along with. Although we weren't home for most of the day, we enjoyed our stay. They are great people, and are very flexible with check in and check outs. I hope to see them the next time I visit . 
33433	1815304	8.0	10.0	28172031	Lilli and Michael made me feel extremely welcomed and made sure that i was comfortable with my surroundings as well as help direct me to great places in Seattle. They had great brochures for me to see what was around the city and encouraged me to explore-- good experience.
33434	1815304	8.0	10.0	28274706	Michael and Lilli were fantastic host! They were both really welcoming and the loft was super clean and comfortable. The apartment is in a VERY central location. It was a short walk to a ton of bars, shopping, and restaurants! Michael and Lilli had lots of recommendations on where to go. All the places we went to were great! I would definitely recommend staying with them. Plus, their dogs are adorable! :) 
33435	1815304	8.0	10.0	28519488	Michael and Lilli are such great hosts! They were extremely welcoming upon arrival and their dogs, Freida and Zero, are the cutest! The location is far away enough from the nearby shopping/food areas so that it is a calm space but close enough that everything is an extremely short walk. Several locations, including Pike Place, Space Needle, and much more are definitely accessible on foot should you want to save on a few bucks but Ubering anywhere is pretty cheap. Transportation to/from the airport was a breeze too!
33436	1815304	8.0	10.0	29192925	My partner and I visited Seattle and this place was ideal because of the location! Lilli was really nice and welcoming. We were able to walk down to Pike's Place Market which was great. The space was accurately described and great if you are only in town for a couple of days and need to centralized location!
33437	1815304	8.0	10.0	29512245	The location was perfect, only a block from the convention center. Michael was flexible with our check in and helpful with recommendations of places to visit. We would definitely stay again!
33438	1815304	8.0	10.0	29828964	Great experience staying at Michael's place! Very welcoming and knowledgeable about the neighborhood. Location is top notch and transportation between the house and airport is cheap and convenient. The room is located in a loft and is comfortable and offers full privacy.
33439	1815304	8.0	10.0	30144991	"Das Zimmer sowie die Wohnug sind sehr gemütlich eingerichtet und sauber. Die Lage ist herforragend inmitten der Stadt.
Michael und seine Frau waren sehr nett und Hilfsbereit, hatten viele tipps für Restaurants und Aktivitäten.
Die beiden Hunde waren sehr süss."
33440	1815304	8.0	10.0	30588448	Great hosts. They offered lots of advice on Seattle. My accommodations were very clean. I would highly recommend Michael's location to anyone!
33441	1815304	8.0	10.0	30876917	Lili and Michael were very accommodating and kind.  They offered suggestions on where to go in the Seattle area and the location/price is perfect.  
33442	1815304	8.0	10.0	31514795	Lilli and Michael were the best hosts ever! They were unbelievably welcoming. They made us feel at home in their apartment and took time out of their days to show us a good time around Seattle. We couldn't have asked for better hosts. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone looking to experience Seattle at its best.
33443	1815304	8.0	10.0	31881597	"I visited Seattle for a conference at the Washington Conversion Center. The location of the apartment was the top priority in my search at Airbnb. After leaving Seattle I can say that it was the excellent tips for F&B and sights and the help from Michael and Lilly that made my stay in town memorable. 
I can highly recommend this hosts/room and will definitely come back in my next trip to Seattle."
33444	1815304	8.0	10.0	32282747	"The location couldn't be better: near to sights, bars and restaurants. Walking distance to Peak Place market. They are nice and the communication was easy. 
They even provided us with some food and coffee :)
The pets are friendly. 
The house is small but you have everything you need. The room for guests is also small once the sofa-bed is extended. "
33445	1815304	8.0	10.0	32745330	As international students traveling from Kansas to Seattle, we carried a lot of luggage with us when we arrived in Seattle. It was so nice that Michael met us and helped us with the luggage on the check-in day. During the five-day stay in Seattle, both my friend and I felt home when we lived at Michael & Lily's house. Michael provided us with a lot of good recommendations about the places to pay a visit, try foods or have a drink. We loved the time talking with Lily who is pretty interesting and friendly (we also got breakfast made by Lily in the morning that we left). This is probably the best location in Seattle to live if you would like to enjoy this city: you can walk to Pike Market, Starbucks, good restaurants, shopping malls, bars of different themes, Capitol Hill; you can take buses, or light rails, or taxis to travel around in case you're tired of walking (though not much walking) and want to explore something new of the city's system. It is really convenient to reach all of the interesting places in downtown Seattle, which is also one aspect that makes us fall in love with this city. This stay was pretty enjoyable and we highly recommend friends to choose Michael & Lily's place if they get an opportunity to visit Seattle, and fall in love with it like we did :).
33446	1815304	8.0	10.0	33117088	Great location. Michael made really great recommendations on places to see. Very friendly and welcoming. 
33447	1815304	8.0	10.0	33372943	Michael is awesome! The moment we stepped in, he made us feel at home and made us feel like family.  He gave a lot of good recommendations for food and places to go for fun and was very very accommodating.  His place is clean and your room is in the loft upstairs for your own privacy. Michael was super hospitable, making our stay in Seattle all that much more enjoyable. Also, his dogs Zero and Frida are super friendly and the cutest dogs you'll ever meet!
33448	1815304	8.0	10.0	33571550	I stayed at Michael's apartment for 3 nights and he was an excellent host. He had a ton of great suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood, and when we told him some of the activities we had planned he suggested other places to eat or things to see nearby. We had a late flight out on our last day and he was very accommodating and let us keep our luggage in the apartment after we checked out. The two dogs are also a plus, they are adorable and very friendly!  
33449	1815304	8.0	10.0	34116690	Michael and Lillie were excellent hosts. They instantly made me feel at home, really knew their city and showed me the local highlights. If I'm back in town, I'll definitely be looking to stay there again.
33450	1815304	8.0	10.0	34293557	This location is perfect! Easy walk to sights, downtown and nightlife. Michael  and Lili had tons of suggestions for places to go and were accommodating. Comfortable and easy place to stay and at a good price!
33451	1815304	8.0	10.0	34857734	"My fiancè and I were in Seattle for 2days. This was our first airbnb experience and we were very pleased. Michael was a great help. He had loads of recommendations. The location is perfect walking distance to everything. We felt comfortable and had our own space. The dogs are super cute. We didn't get to see Lilli much but she was very warm and welcoming also. 
Thank you again for a great stay in Seattle"
33452	1815304	8.0	10.0	35103874	Michael and Lilli were the most awesome hosts! They had a ton of great suggestions for things to do in Seattle. They instantly made me feel at home; not to mention the location is perfect, very close to everything.  If I'm back in town, I'll definitely be looking to stay there again.  In addition, their pets Zero and Frieda are just the most adorable and friendly dogs. I would highly recommend Michael's location to anyone!
33453	1815304	8.0	10.0	35380083	Great place to stay close to everything downtown. Michael was great with many recommendations of awesome things to do in Seattle and really made sure you felt like home. They are both awesome hosts and I would both recommend it to others and stay here again. 
33454	1815304	8.0	10.0	35569787	"Michaël & Lily make us feel at home. Both were very nice, and took some time to give us some advice about nice stuff to do in Seattle.

There were available to respond to all our questions. Their place totally fits with the description they provide on the website. It is really well located, and we were very quickly downtown by feet.

We really enjoyed our stay, thanks again to both of you !"
33455	1815304	8.0	10.0	35906371	My wife and I had a phenomenal time staying with Michael and Lili in Seattle for our 30th birthdays. Their living space/amenities were exactly as expected and they were excellent hosts to us.  They were very welcoming and quick to give us any advice we wanted on local fare, coffee and other must-go's all over Seattle.  We highly recommend them and look forward to staying with them again!
33456	1815304	8.0	10.0	36466644	This was my first AirBnB and it was a great experience! They have a beautiful apartment in a great area. It was so easy to get anywhere I wanted. I was in town for a conference, so I loved the easy access to the convention center. It was super close to Pike Place and other downtown destinations or a short ride on public transit to anything else! They were very welcoming and offered great suggestions for good eats nearby. I came to Seattle a lot as a kid, so I already had my own list of things I wanted to do to relive my childhood, but they know the area so well that they would be an excellent resource for anyone less familiar with Seattle. I felt fortunate they had an opening for the dates I visited! Very sweet dogs too.
33457	1815304	8.0	10.0	36772274	Michael and Lilli were good and friendly hosts. Lilli graciously waited up when we first arrived as our plans changed and we didn't get in until nearly 1am; even then she was very welcoming and kind. However, we were a little deceived by the pictures of our space (the loft area) online. We pictured a nice bed, but in reality it was a fold out futon. The bathroom was not the cleanest either (but I have high standards) and underwear was left on the floor both mornings I went in to take a shower. If those things don't bother you, this will be a great fit for you. The location was prime for walking to almost anything downtown or to the metro, but parking was a hassle and obviously not cheap in Seattle. If you need any tips or recommendations Lilli is  a good resource!
33458	1815304	8.0	10.0	37139008	Great location! Walking distance to just about everything you want to see! Smooth check in and check out! Michael and Lily are very friendly and helpful and will take you out to introduce you to the city if you'd like!
33459	1815304	8.0	10.0	37453372	"Very nice experience staying in Michael and Lily's apartment. The location of the apt is very nice, closed to everything. Even though we have a car, we choose to walk when we visit the city. Michael and Lily are very friendly. We checked in very late in the evening (12.45 am) because we came from Olympics national park, which is super far away from the city but Michael was still waiting for us. 
Although we haven't had the chance to talk too much, as we were out all day and went back very late, but Michael and Lily are very good hosts. It was a very good experience staying in their home. "
33460	1815304	8.0	10.0	37832071	Michael and Lili have a really excellent place in Seattle that is at the heart of everything in the city. Best of all they had some really great suggestions for things to explore and we had a great dinner together discussing the town. I would love to stay again with them!
33461	1815304	8.0	10.0	38372283	My experience at Michael and Lilli's apartment was great! It was a perfect location to explore the city and they made me feel very comfortable in their home! They gave me a run down of the different suburbs, restaurants and things to do in the city! :) I would definitely recommend staying with them! 
33462	1815304	8.0	10.0	38599799	"""Best Location in Downtown Seattle"" is exactly right! I couldn't have asked for a better base of operations for my exploration and adventures. I never got a chance to meet Michael (simply because my comings and goings didn't coincide with his), but Lilli and the adorable pups welcomed me warmly and provided awesome suggestions for things to do and food to most certainly not miss. Since I visited solo and didn't have much time and thus packed light, the loft was the perfect space for me and very comfy. "
33463	1815304	8.0	10.0	38861378	"The location was awesome, and the hosts were super knowledgeable about the area. Their dogs are so cute! 

Lili and Michael were also flexible given our schedule—much appreciated!

The smoke was a little strong at times but manageable since it's only on the patio."
33464	1815304	8.0	10.0	39797418	Michael and Lili were very accommodating to our unpredictable arrival time. They were friendly and welcoming. We felt comfortable in their space. 
33465	1815304	8.0	10.0	40918272	Michael and Lili's place was in a great location. We were walking distance to everything we wanted to see. They gave us great suggestions!
33466	1815304	8.0	10.0	41730083	I had a great time staying here for a week. The space was quite comfortable and it was close to plenty of places to eat and hang out. Micheal was a great host and made me feel very accommodated, and I'd totally stay here again if I were to come back.
33467	1815304	8.0	10.0	42387415	"First, I should say I didn't spend much time in the apartment because I was attending a conference and had activities from 8am-10pm every day I was there.  The futon was comfortable, though the apartment got very hot at times. (I stayed there in August.) There was a fan in the room, which helped a good deal with the heat. The bathroom is small, but it was very tidy and the water pressure in the shower is awesome! I had to wait a couple of times for the bathroom in the morning, but that's understandable when 3 people are using the same bathroom and trying to get out at around the same time in the morning! I didn't see them much because I got back most nights after they went to bed, but they were very nice when we did get a chance to talk! They recommended some activities for me, but I didn't have any time to do them! :(  Thanks for a great and easy stay! 

If you're going to need to go to the convention center, I highly recommend this place! It's a five minute walk to the center, and I suggest you walk through the park to get there! Very pretty. "
33468	1815304	8.0	10.0	42667128	Lili and Michael's place is excellent!  It is close to many attractions and great restaurants.  The room is nice and clean.  The hosts are very friendly.  They are accommodating to my arrival schedule and they give really good advice!  The dogs are cute and sweet!
33469	1815304	8.0	10.0	43359234	"My boyfriend and realized last minute this was a shared space reservation (our first time using airbnb) but lily and Michael were great hosts. They took us out the first night to come local bars in capital hill. A great karaoke spot as well (Michael is a fan :)
They were very welcoming and suggested many spots to spend time in Seattle as well as bainbridge. Try out shiros for sure... Amazing! There is smoking at this apartment on the balcony but with the doors open all the time it allows the smoke inside so just a warning. The futon was comfortable... Clean sheets and pillows. The shared bathroom was clean but could be a tad bit cleaner in the shower. The dogs.. Frita and zero are soooooo cute! Great hosts overall! "
33470	1815304	8.0	10.0	43784432	Great location, close to everything. Really nice hosts and everything went smoothly.
33471	1815304	8.0	10.0	44286607	Great hosts who were very friendly/ helpful. Great location and apartment was very nice. Can be cramped at times, but great for a short stay.
33472	1815304	8.0	10.0	44645131	Super convenient location. Lily is very friendly. We enjoyed our trip very much.
33473	1815304	8.0	10.0	45363664	Michael and Lily were both wonderful hosts. I mostly saw Lily while I was staying but it wasn't a problem because she made me feel right at home by showing me all these great places to eat and by being very kind and informative. I would love to stay again. Seattle is an amazing city and I hope I can come back soon.
33474	1815304	8.0	10.0	46577677	Our hosts were very nice and welcoming. We didn't get much time to talk as we were seeing Seattle most of the day and our trip was during the week. The place is centered really well around everything so you'll usually walk or take a short Lyft/Uber or bus/rail ride.  For the short stay we had, its proximity to everything, and the price, it really is worth it. 
33475	1815304	8.0	10.0	46975323	We enjoyed our stay with Michael and Lily, the location was excellent and the room was as described. Very friendly dogs that were fun and did not bother us at all. Everything went very smoothly thanks to our experienced hosts.
33476	1815304	8.0	10.0	47963321	Michael and Lily were wonderful and made us feel very welcome. We used the kitchen and the tv a couple times after spending the day at the market. They were very nice and let us drop off our luggage early so we didn't have to haul around all of our stuff for the entire day.
33477	1815304	8.0	10.0	48173686	Chris and I had a nice stay :) we were only there a couple of days and didn't spend much time at home. The bedroom and apartment was just as described and everything was ready for us when we arrived :) the internet connexion wasn't great, but again, we didn't stay at the flat so much so it didn't really matter. Michael and lily were nice hosts! 
33478	1815304	8.0	10.0	48691990	Michael & Lily are amazing hosts and their two dogs are friendly and sweet. I absolutely had the best time staying at their apartment. Perfect location, great little balcony and private loft space. If you are interested or in need of any guidance when it comes to things to do in Seattle, restaurants to try, bars worth visiting, and a little history of the city itself, Michael and Lily are well-versed and more than happy to help. I fell in love with Seattle and it was partially their fault! :) I highly recommend booking this Airbnb for your next trip. 
33479	1815304	8.0	10.0	49003913	The house is very convenient to any places in Seattle downtown . Lily is very nice . She give us many suggestions . It's a nice place .
33480	1815304	8.0	10.0	49268034	"Lily is really nice and made us feel comfy right away ! The 2 dogs are cute and discreet, as Michael and Lily !

A little bit of noise at night because of the open window, but everything else was fine. Great for short stays, as it is near everything interesting in Seattle =)"
33481	1815304	8.0	10.0	49666590	"Wow! What can I say? Mike and Lily's location was as described. Maybe even a bit better than I anticipated. I traveled solo, but the room could definitely accommodate a couple. Wifi and iron were provided.

Steps in any direction outside of their apartment will lead you to whatever brought you to Seattle. Nightlife/entertainment, amazing food, quick access to public transportation.

Mike and Lily were great as hosts. Actually, you can't really ask for too much better than those two. When I checked in, Lily took some time out to give me the run down on Seattle neighborhoods and where I should go based on my interests. Michael invited me out for a quick drink with his crew before I went off to a catch show downtown. I was having so much fun that I lost track of time and almost missed my show!

Review summed up in two words: Stay here"
33482	1815304	8.0	10.0	50147393	Loved the central location, nestled on a hill close to downtown. My hosts were very accommodating. 
33483	1815304	8.0	10.0	50439883	Excellent location in Seattle, plenty of privacy, great balcony. Hosts had a lot of great recommendations. Had an amazing trip!!!
33484	1815304	8.0	10.0	51152048	It's comfortable and convenient there.Also have two lovely dogs:)
33485	1815304	8.0	10.0	51669144	You won't find a better location. If you are looking to explore downtown, you are walking distance to everything. Give up the search and just stay here, well worth it.
33486	1815304	8.0	10.0	52852645	"Perfect location in Seattle Whatever you want to have a great meal, buy something in grocery store, go to famous scenery e.g Pike Market, Pioneer Square, Downtown waterfront
Michael and Lily are very nice , invited us to bar and gave us a lot of advice for trip (and we really liked Bainbridge! Really beautiful island! )
This is our first time to America and find accommodation by airbnb, and we really glad to meet Michael, Lily and have a wonderful trip


"
33487	1815304	8.0	10.0	53488610	Micheal's family really welcomed me and let me have a comfortable night during my stay. Since this apartment is located in very convenient place, close to the Starbucks Roasting and Convention Center, I was able to walk down to the city center even very late night. Although I couldn't have a chance to hangout with them due to bad condition, in spite of their kind offer at Friday night, other visitors will be very satisfied with their hospitality as well. 
33488	1815304	8.0	10.0	53984020	Great hosts! The apt is close to Seattle downtown and there is lots of great good food nearby. They are really friendly gave me many advices. The two dogs are so cute, I like this place very much.
33489	1815304	8.0	10.0	54342291	Location, location, location! This place is walking distance to everywhere! Michael and Lily are very nice people. They are a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the best restaurants in town. Despite the fact that the loft is blocked off with curtains, there is plenty of privacy. If you're looking to explore Seattle, stop your search and book here.

34068	1107845	8.0	10.0	5926365	Owen's place was in a charming building that was incredibly convenient.  The bed was very comfy, and the place was tidy.  If you're looking for a spot in Capitol Hill that's convenient to lots of entertainment, dining and tourist options, this is it! 
34069	1107845	8.0	10.0	6015444	Great stay-- apartment as advertised. Easy walking distance to downtown. Owen sent keys to me in advance. Very accommodating. 
34070	1107845	8.0	10.0	6142800	Owen was an excellent host. He was easy to work with and has a great place with an awesome location. It is within easy walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and downtown. I would definitely stay at his place again. 
34071	1107845	8.0	10.0	6406142	We had a great stay here! The apartment has an amazing view of the Space Needle! We were able to walk to all the major attractions, Space Needle, Safeco Field for a game, Pike Place Market, and the ferry station to Bainbridge Island. Owen was a great host and very responsive to all of our questions. The neighborhood has a bunch of great restaurants and you are super close to the convention center as well. 
34072	1107845	8.0	10.0	6472667	Location. Location. Location. It was SUPER easy to get to the trains, buses and ferries from Owen's place. We easily found Car2Go in the area and they were usually available. It was great to stay in Capitol Hill, since there are no reasonable rate hotels in the area. Close to all the bars/restaurants/shops and walkable to Pike Place Market. Apartment is all you needed: bed, bathroom and a small kitchen. Worked perfectly. 
34073	1107845	8.0	10.0	6699398	Great location and Owen was really helpful with suggestions for paces to eat, where to get great coffee and running routes. Loved Seattle and the experience was so much better being in a cool little place that was easy walking distance to Pike Market, downtown, and all the other touristy spots.
34074	1107845	8.0	10.0	6767418	I wouldn't ask for any more from this place. It was clean, super comfortable, nicely furnished with great views in an unbeatable location. I recommend it. 
34075	1107845	8.0	10.0	6829113	"It was a great apartment in a very good location. It was a short walk to downtown and it had a neighborhood feel since it was in Capitol Hill. Best of both worlds. Owen was a great guest who laid out clear instructions on retrieval of keys and amenities, and he also always responded quickly to e-mails.

Oh, and a great view!"
34076	1107845	8.0	10.0	6949400	Owens place was great! Centrally located in Capitol Hill, near great coffee shops and great restaurants. I'd certainly stay again :)
34077	1107845	8.0	10.0	7731684	Owens place was awesome and was in the perfect location. It was within walking distance to downtown and to all fun places for the drinking and dinner. I would book his place anytime.
34078	1107845	8.0	10.0	10553286	A great easy place right where I needed to be. Thanks Owen!
34079	1107845	8.0	10.0	10683587	This was our first time using airbnb and we were nervous. But Owen was kind and helpful and very generous, and his Capital Hill apt was beautiful, airy, and incredibly centrally located. We were just a few blocks from downtown and Pike Place Market, and his building was surrounded by awesome restaurants, bars, and coffeeshops (not to mention Elliott Bay Book Company). We had a great stay, and would definitely rent from Owen again.
34080	1107845	8.0	10.0	11195730	"Owen's apartment is perfectly situated between Pine and Pike, making it an ideal location if you're looking to check out the culture (bars, restaurants, bookstores, records shops, clothing boutiques, etc, etc, etc,) of Capitol Hill. And you can also stroll along Pike directly to the market and other downtown destinations — an easy 20-minute walk. 

Owen's place is a studio apartment with a bed, a couch, a loveseat, and kitchen. It's cozy and has all the essentials you need. Owen has blankets, towels, soap, etc. laid out for us. There's a TV (no cable, though), wifi, and even a little desk if you want to get some work done. That said, if you're looking for a modern apartment to rent, this probably isn't your place — it's outdated, small, and feels a little like a studio apartment you'd rent in college. But a great place to lay your head and get easily out into the city.  

Owen himself was remarkably helpful from start to finish. The keys were easy to retrieve; he offered great advice on places to grab a beer and rent a bike, etc.; he was quick to answer questions about the apartment; and while he was available, he also disappeared, letting us feel like the apartment was our own. 

I'll definitely give Owen a call again next time I'm in Seattle. "
34081	1107845	8.0	10.0	11364233	We were in town for an event at the convention center, and we couldn't have found a better location than Owen's apartment. It was walking distance from everything we needed, and an easy transit ride from the airport. Owen was very helpful and accommodating, and made our first airbnb experience a breeze. We would definitely rent here again. Thanks Owen!!
34082	1107845	8.0	10.0	12105176	Owens place is in the perfect location if you're looking for a good fun night in Seattle. Walking distance to numerous bars and restaurants. Went to The Honey Hole a couple times for an awesome meal. Owen is a really cool, laid back guy. I would definitely recommend it to anybody visiting Seattle  
34083	1107845	8.0	10.0	13043471	This apartment is all about location - a great place to experience Capital Hill from. Comfortable bed and sofas - but make no mistake, this is like staying in a student's studio flat. Same level of cleanliness (or lack thereof) and particularly grungy and ill-equipped kitchen. This is a place for a single person or a couple - maximum. Owen was very pleasant, but didn't exactly rush over to correct the situation when I mentioned the cleanliness issue 
34084	1107845	8.0	10.0	13250243	"Owen and his brother were very responsive hosts.  Josh was at the apartment when we arrived and got us everything we needed.  During the stay, Owen texted and checked-in to see if we needed anything.

The location was ideal for the conference center.  It was just a few blocks downhill in the mornings, and by the walk back in the evenings, the bars and restaurants were open and were nice motivation to make it back uphill.  
The neighborhood is very hip and there were lots of young people out all over (in the afternoons and evenings).  It wasn't a problem finding a spot for a happy hour or dinner.  If you are touring Seattle, it was a little bit more of a walk, or an easy transit /taxi tide to the major tourist locations.  I did have a rental car for the first 2 days for visiting Tacoma.  It was great that Owen provided a visitor parking pass to park in the neighborhood, although hard to find a spot on Saturday night (but not surprising).  

The apartment was as advertised - the view of Seattle was very nice, and it had what I needed for my work travel purposes.  I used the living area and the desk (and wifi) for working.  The full-size fridge in the kitchen was convenient, although, the kitchen was rather small if you intend to cook.   The bathroom had toiletries, but I brought my own.  There was a nice TV that you can hook up your computer to for watching videos (I didn't try seeing if there was actually TV signal available).   

The only downsides, which I suspect Owen would take care of if I cared enough about these factors to text him, were the lack of a hand towel in the bathroom, the sink in the kitchen needed a scrubbing, and there were a few dust bunnies all around (if you have allergies).  Again, I suspect that if it bothered me enough to ask, the host probably would have been very responsive about it.  The little things didn't overshadow the broader picture that the apartment was in a great location, had all the amenities I needed, and the view of the city was a nice plus.  Overall, I was very comfortable and pleased with the place.  "
34085	1107845	8.0	10.0	13520513	Owen's place was fantastic, with a gorgeous view. The location was close to everything in downtown Seattle and had everything we needed around it. Owen was super helpful and checked in on us during our stay...he even left us a bottle of wine!! Would definitely stay again.
34086	1107845	8.0	10.0	13788907	"Owen's place was exactly what we were looking for, and met the expectations set by the listing. The entire stay we really felt the place was ""ours."" And if you're looking for a great, sweeping view of downtown, including the Space Needle, this is the place for you. Great location in Capitol Hill, too: right near tons of restaurants, coffee shops, nightlife, and, if you're a book lover, the Elliott Bay Book Company. Easily walkable to downtown. Lots of car2gos as well.

Coming from Texas, we were somewhat worried about the unit not having A/C during June, but the mornings and nights were very cool and pleasant, and Owen's blackout shades easily kept out the late afternoon sun, and the fan helped too. "
34087	1107845	8.0	10.0	13935412	Can't beat this location.  Easy to book and check-in.  Great place for restful sleep and short breaks between sightseeing and activities.  Owen made sure we had a contact if we needed anything--which we never had to use.  Would definitely stay again.  Thanks!
34088	1107845	8.0	10.0	14165195	"Owen's place is located in a fantastic spot.  It was a short walk to downtown while also being surrounded by several great restaurants and bars.  We took the train in and it was only about a $10 Uber ride away and only a ~15 minute walk to the light rail to take us to the airport.

If you are there on a Monday night and have time, check out the basement bar at The Cider House as they have an open music night on the stage where the crowd swaps in and out with singers and several different instruments and was a great time.

Owen and his brother were very responsive to any questions we had and had everything ready when we arrived; hand towels and blankets set out and even left us a bottle of wine.

The apartment is a decent size, but could have used a little bit more cleaning; nothing terrible, but some relatively minor things that could be taken care of pretty easily.  

Also, we were asked to tell neighbors that we were friends of Owen's if anyone in the building asked; no one asked us and I guess that is pretty common request on Airbnb.  It didn't seem to be a problem as we did come across several people in the building who didn't ask us anything, but just a heads up in case anyone feels uncomfortable in that position."
34089	1107845	8.0	10.0	14311990	Wonderful experience! Owen gave very clear, concise directions and we were never confused about anything.
34090	1107845	8.0	10.0	15602820	Great experience! Owen was really responsive and helpful. The apartment is charming and very comfortable. The view is fantastic. It's walking distance to so much great stuff too. I'd love to stay again. 
34091	1107845	8.0	10.0	15769345	Owen's place was awesome! Great view and in a great, central neighborhood.  It was great that organizing the apartment was so easy for our trip.  He provided all of the information we could've possibly needed and was very responsive for the few questions I did have for him.  I'd definitely stay there again!
34092	1107845	8.0	10.0	16067839	Awesome place, great location, with easy access to the train and walkable to most of the places we wanted to go to. Beautiful view and extremely easy check in- check out process. Owen explained where to find everything very well and we loved staying at his place!
34093	1107845	8.0	10.0	16226716	I had some minor issues getting the key (my fault) and Owen was quick to call to make sure that everything was okay.  This apartment is perfect for someone looking to stay in a fun part of the city to have access to downtown or the Fremont area.  The apartment was clean, and the view was perfect as I sat at the desk getting last minute work finished.  
34094	1107845	8.0	10.0	16682304	Owen was wonderful. Very responsive, attentive, and helpful. We had a wonderful time staying at his place. It is a perfect location and has everything you need while in Seattle. A stones throw from great restaurants, coffee and fun...and a nice safe & secure building. 
34095	1107845	8.0	10.0	16815230	"Owen was very accommodating in arranging for the apartment to be available same day when I arrived in Seattle and checked for availability. The apartment is in a very characteristic building with an awesome Parisien elevator. The apartment had all amenities I required for my stay which was largely out and about in the cool hipster neighborhood with plenty of coffee places, bars and restaurants. The view over the city and especially with the sunset is unbeatable. 
It can get a bit warm inside with the sun shining in, but that's really a luxury in Seattle... :-)
I would have preferred if the construction site opposite the street wouldn't start at 7am, but I was there during the week so don't know if that's also in the weekend.
Also great was the guest parking card which Owen provided!"
34096	1107845	8.0	10.0	17519147	"This was my first time using AirBnB. Owen's place was great, and in a really good location that was central to everything.  He answered his phone readily with a question that we had upon arrival. Overall, I would definitely recommend his place to anyone coming to Seattle- as it is located in the ""hip"" capitol hill, yet also pretty close to downtown. We didn't have to rent a car or take any cabs while we were there- we walked to everything. 
Thanks Owen! "
34097	1107845	8.0	10.0	18418587	Loved staying in Owens place. A perfect setting between downtown for work ( near to convention centre) and Capitol Hill for fun. Everything I needed was on hand. A great stay all in all
34098	1107845	8.0	10.0	18826953	Owen's space was great and perfectly located for Convention Center activities. The apartment was clean well maintained. It was my first time staying in a secured building so remember to always take your building key with you!  Temporary parking permit was great. Overall was very pleased with the location and price, and Owen was very communicative.
34099	1107845	8.0	10.0	19160394	Owen has very helpful. Place was good, clean and location wise convenient.
34100	1107845	8.0	10.0	19715408	The picture of the view from this apartment does not do it justice, it really is spectacular.  Owen was great, he accommodated my boyfriend and I last minute after our previous host had cancelled.  Two hours after I initially requested to book the apartment, we were comfortably checked in with a bottle of wine waiting for us, which, after the last minute snafu with our other place was much appreciated.  The apartment is exactly as pictured and the neighborhood is great, plenty of restaurants, bars and coffee shops within walking distance.  We visited some of the national parks outside Seattle and loved coming back to watch the sunset over Seattle from the very comfortable living area.  Would definitely stay here again!
34101	1107845	8.0	10.0	20054181	"We stayed at Owen's place for 4 nights, and it was great. He was very communicative and flexible with check-in/out times to accommodate our flights. It was our first time in Seattle, and Owen's place is in a convenient location. Within a 10-minute walk in any direction, you can get to Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill restaurants and bars. The convention center and retail core of downtown is only a few blocks away.

Photos are accurate to the apartment. Just one tip: The apartment is on the 6th floor, and the elevator is an old-timey one where you have to open the door and ""cage"" yourself vs. the doors opening automatically when you push the button. This was fine for us, as we didn't take it all the time (took the stairs), but a heads-up for less agile guests."
34102	1107845	8.0	10.0	20393599	Everything was so fine, especially the location was the best. I was staying there for the Decibel Festival, and most venues were so close that I could walk all the time. Near restaurants and shops were also great experience. 
34103	1107845	8.0	10.0	22388520	Neat apartment in a great location. Would repeat!
34104	1107845	8.0	10.0	22556436	"Bad news first, good news second. Owen's place is in an older, but nice, building right in the heart of things. When I arrived I had to fiddle with the lockbox in an odd place, and the elevator was one of those clumsy push-the-door open deals from yestercentury. A bottle of wine greeted my arrival, which was quite nice. Unlike most Airbnb ""whole apartments"" I've stayed in previously, this one is clearly someone's primary residence. The closets have that someone's stuff in them, the fridge has that someone's food. It was a touch shabby, but maybe more ""comfortable"" would be a better way to put it. Still, the place was adequate for my needs. Great wifi speed too.

The location is where Owen's place is awesome. You wouldn't know it by looking at the map, but this place is smack dab in the middle of a great area. I kept opening Yelp to look for coffee, or lunch, or even dance clubs, and the best options were just a few blocks away. Lots of transit options within a block, though the waterfront and Pike's Place were walkable for me.

All in all, while I was a bit underwhelmed by the apartment itself, I would totally stay here again."
34105	1107845	8.0	10.0	25313130	Funky vintage apartment building located in the perfect spot for checking out Capital Hill and downtown. Owen was totally on the ball and easy to work with. 
34106	1107845	8.0	10.0	26032129	Very satisfied with host and apartment. Everything is the same as on the pictures. Host is very flexible to work for late check-out to accommodate my travel schedule. 
34107	1107845	8.0	10.0	26676444	Owen's apartment is just what we were hoping for. The location is perfect for exploring the whole of Seattle, and the views are amazing! The apartment itself is nice, comfortable, and well equipped for everything you would need to be able to cook, live and sleep. Would recommend to anyone. 
34108	1107845	8.0	10.0	28447655	Owen, thanks so much for having me in your home! It was a great convenient location to get to downtown and still be stepping distance from all the fun restaurants/coffee shops on cap hill! Super cool view of the skyline and removed enough from the noise of the city. Also, Victrola and the Starbucks Roastery were right next door! :-)
34109	1107845	8.0	10.0	28711623	The apartment is cozy and clean. I was attending a conference at the Sheraton and had to be there at 8:30 every morning, and it was just a quick walk. Nice café right around the corner, convenience store, etc. No reason not to stay here. 
34110	1107845	8.0	10.0	33394424	My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle, and Owen's apartment was located in Capitol Hill, where it was walkable to most (touristy) places. Ot was absolutely perfect for us. The apartment is as described in the pictures.  Owen was easy to get in touch/communicate! We had a great time, thanks Owen! 
34111	1107845	8.0	10.0	33817879	Owen was quick to respond to our initial request and continued to be very helpful when we had questions/requests/asked for recommendations. He did a great job making sure that we had all necessary information about his apartment and how to get in, etc. prior to our arrival. From reading previous reviews we knew pretty well what to expect of the apartment and building. The location is great, it was nice to stay in a neighborhood and be able to easily walk to and from downtown during our stay. Capitol Hill is an awesome neighborhood - my roommate and I loved Owen's recommendations and found plenty of other great spots on our own. 
34112	1107845	8.0	10.0	35124562	Apt was exactly as described and the view of downtown was great. The location was the best part with all kinds of great places to eat and see within walking distance. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the market that wasn't bad at all since its straight down the street. Would recommend to anyone, especially if you don't want to rent a car for your visit.
34113	1107845	8.0	10.0	35684315	Great first Airbnb experience with Owen! Comfy apartment in a great location. Owen was easy to get in touch with and was quick to answer any questions I had. 
34114	1107845	8.0	10.0	36420382	The stay was great. The apartment is right in the heart of Capitol Hill and only a couple blocks from the Pikes Place Market. It's also easy to get to from the highway. The apartment itself is good. Nice amenities with TV, bed, and full kitchen. But with this one the location is best!
34115	1107845	8.0	10.0	39297105	This apartment is in an excellent location in the busiest part of the city, great for walking. On Capitol Hill near downtown, it is a short walk to excellent restaurants on the hill, coffee shops (including the new Starbucks Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room), and music venues. It's just a 15 minute walk across downtown to Pike Place Market.  Everything is within reach on foot.  Also easy airport access, taking the Light Rail from the airport to the end of the line, Westlake Center station, and walking from there. It was our first visit to Seattle and this was a great base.  Owen has an expresso maker as well, so buy some beans and make your own in the morning!
34116	1107845	8.0	10.0	54949114	Studio was spot on with the description. A short walk to downtown. Has a heater that is turned on at night (by the super?), and an additional plug-in heater. There are also a couple small convenience stores, a great cafe (Victrola), the Starbucks roasting room all within a block.
34117	1107845	8.0	10.0	55647762	The ap was perfectly located for us and Owen made the key transition really easy! The heater kinda had its own schedule, but Owen has an additional electronic heater.
34118	1107845	8.0	10.0	55841953	The place was exactly as described. Perfect location and very accommodating host. Comfortably fit 3 of us. Overall great experience!
34119	1107845	8.0	10.0	56407434	Owen was an amazing host.  He was easy to get a hold of and always responded quickly.  Getting into his place was no hassle with straightforward instructions.  The apartment was so charming and comfortable.  There were no surprises about his place from what was posted.  The place is centrally located in a very lively neighborhood.  There are a lot of great restaurants and shops just around the corner.  He is also just a short walk or Uber to Seattle's major attractions.  I highly recommend staying here if you want to vacation in Seattle.  Thank you Owen!  
34120	1107845	8.0	10.0	56685364	I really enjoyed three days here. Different kind of room in my life haha
34121	1107845	8.0	10.0	56962493	처음으로 에어비앤비를 이용해보는데, 가기 전에 걱정되었지만 오웬씨가 잘 설명해 주셨고 집도 사진 그대로 였어요 ^^ 위치도 시애틀 다운타운에서 멀지 않았고 집주위가 시끄럽지 않고 좋았습니다.
34122	1107845	8.0	10.0	57274932	Owen' place was amazing! Very clean, great location, walking to downtown, and simply pleasant to hang out in. Only wish I had stayed here longer. Cannot recommend this place enough!
34700	4566609	8.0	9.0	23462394	The location is pretty good. 20 minute walk to downtown. The room is a really nice experience in an old-style apartment. 
34701	4566609	8.0	9.0	24033920	Alex was an excellent host. She was able to accommodate our irregular arrival and departure times. Great communication made everything a lot easier as well. The apartment is in a really cool end of town, lots of great bars and its only a short walk down town. The actual apartment was really clean and looks exactly like the pictures. I would recommend this place to everyone and would stay again!
34702	4566609	8.0	9.0	25312291	Alex's place is so cute and lovely! The place was very clean and located in a great part of town. Everything we needed was well within walking distance. Loved the bed, which was big enough to fit two people. Alex seemed a bit busy and hard to contact at first but was very attentive once we got there. Overall we had a great stay. She was so friendly and kept us updated on when we could meet. Would definitely stay again!
34703	4566609	8.0	9.0	28448155	Place was prepared for our stay. Alex was friendly and made sure we had all information necessary for the trip. The place was as pictured. Cute minimalist/industrial hipster design and decor. 
34704	4566609	8.0	9.0	29571689	Perfectly adequate apartment in a premium location. Neatly kept; good bed. We really appreciated being so close (one block away) to a grocery store and pharmacy and found it easy to walk downtown, to transit, and to a couple different areas of Capitol Hill. Those who need quiet should be pleased with this place. It's on the back corner of the building and while there was the occasional noise from the hallway, it was all within the realm of normal apartment living, and we found the building residents respectful of sleeping hours. Nice big windows you can open and close to fit your fresh air needs, with venetian blinds you can adjust for your desired ratio of light to privacy. Wifi provided by the building is pay-to-access and device-specific; it's also pretty patchy in the apartment, but it's good enough. Alex communicated clearly with us and responded promptly when we had questions. She even provided us with a list of recommendations for restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood. Would stay again.
34705	4566609	8.0	9.0	29980996	Alex's apartment was perfect for our visit to Seattle. We spent most of our day time at the Convention Center which was a convenient walk and there was always plenty nearby to entertain us by night. Her communication was always prompt and exact. The description of the apartment was on point and as a bonus she has a great collection of vinyl for the time you're around the apartment. 
34706	4566609	8.0	9.0	32214388	"Alex has a very cool little place. Communication with her was very good as well. I'm not certain her place is ready for ""prime time"" yet but I would consider staying there again baring some improvements. The shower didn't really work; specifically, the hot water just trickled out. She lists Wifi as one of the amenities in the listing, but it is Wifi that you have to pay for and even still, it doesn't work very well. With that said, listing Wifi as an amenity and not having free Wifi is like listing Transportation as an amenity and then providing guests with a pamphlet for Taxi service upon arrival. Considering some hotels do this, it would be unfair to say that it is entirely inappropriate. Almost all the reviewers mention how clean the place was, but I didn't have that experience at all. Maybe I came on a bad week. Otherwise, she provided things like soap and clean towels and such which was nice. I really liked the overall decorum and style of the place. With some improvements it could be a pretty nice place to stay."
34707	4566609	8.0	9.0	32373509	Super rad spot. Wish there was wifi!
34708	4566609	8.0	9.0	33245531	"Place was good, it's an older building, so lots of creaks, thin walls, draft-y room. There is street parking all over (2 hour limits for the pay by spots from 7-6PM Mondays-Saturdays). The shower pressure/temperature isn't the greatest... either pressure or warm (email hidden)n't have both. 

Messaged the host about 2/3 weeks regarding parking--no response. 
Called/texted/messaged the host the day of check-in ---no reply/response.
Called AirBnB to contact the host---literally 10 minutes after calling AirBnB, she texted back... Seemed a little sketchy but at least we had somewhere to stay."
34709	4566609	8.0	9.0	35302083	The fresh flowers were great, the apartment was just as it was described. I really loved the neighborhood most of all. There were a bunch of fun bars and restaurants. The only negative is the wifi did not work as I had seen other guests had commented about a similar issue. 
34710	4566609	8.0	9.0	35606534	Overall, it was a grrat place to stay. Nice and close to downtown which was perfect. Only downfall is that the building is a bit older. (Which she does mention in the description.) Alex was accommodating and always responded promptly to any message I sent to her. 
34711	4566609	8.0	9.0	36086340	We arrived and everything was just as Alex noted I her detailed welcome email. We had no problem getting in or finding the studio. The Internet was a bit of an issue as you must pay to use it and it was not very good service. The studio is in a great area of town, Capitol Hill and all the amazing restaurants around. Good stay, we will stay again when we are back in Seattle. 
34712	4566609	8.0	9.0	36376456	"The place was exactly as described. Rather old building with thin walls, but it was quite and clean. Like others have said, the wifi didn't work (though we didn't spend too much time investigating why). The best part is its location, and the local bars/restaurants are all so close. 

Alex was super nice and easy to communicate with. She was very fast to text back and clear with expectations. "
34713	4566609	8.0	9.0	36727477	The photos and description show exactly what the apartment is like.  Alex had great communication about procedures and was available by email when I needed to communicate.  The apartment is in a fantastic location close to great Seattle sights.  
34714	4566609	8.0	9.0	40785373	Cute little studio in the middle of everywhere you'd like to walk to. Alex had some awesome local recommendations (Comet, Mamas Pizza, Glos). A gorgeous city and a nice place to come back to after a long day of walking.
34715	4566609	8.0	9.0	42251207	"Alex was very nice, provided some great information on the area, and even called me once my plane had landed to help me with directions.  Check-in was very easy and Alex was friendly.

The apartment itself is as photographed, and the location is unbeatable.  Just over a block away from a supermarket as well as tons of bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc.  It was really great.

My two complaints: the wi-fi was a little slow, and Alex was unreachable by phone when I had a question about check out on the day-of."
34716	4566609	8.0	9.0	42723955	"Alex was great with communicating with us, she even let us know the unit was ready early. Good location and the unit was clean. 

Building is old, as stated.  Could be Shabby/Chic if fixed up but is only shabby. 

Security door is nice but side door was left propped open most of the time. Also a homeless(?) person was hanging out on the front steps our first night when we returned.

The unit is badly in need of TLC. "
34717	4566609	8.0	9.0	43360377	"This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Close to cool restaurants and bars in pike/pine area and 10-15min walk to downtown.
The apartment was as discribed and very clean."
34718	4566609	8.0	9.0	43828113	Just as others have said, the space was just like the pictures and communicating with Alex was very simple and straightforward. The location was perfect for hanging out in capital hill and we couldn't have been happier with the experience.
34719	4566609	8.0	9.0	45195073	Location is a small but very comfortable studio in a great part of town. Alex is responsive to questions and sends great information on walkable activities. Bed / Kitchen Areas were clean. Sink in the bathroom was clean but the tub needed a scrub and old shower curtains had some mold growing around the bottom. Biggest other was Internet, which you (1) have to pay for (2) is terribly slow and unworkable. Overall if you need quiet or Internet for your travel you won't be pleased but a perfect fit if you need a place to stay for a night you plan on hitting the town. 
34720	4566609	8.0	9.0	45365088	Finding parking around Alex's place was a little bit tricky, but other than that and the slow internet, it was a breeze.  Alex gave easy instructions to get inside the apartment. Mostly quick responses, although she wasn't reachable on the check-out day.  The listing is as described, old apartment, but great location and lots of suggestions on things to check out in the area from Alex.  Would recommend.
34721	4566609	8.0	9.0	46121007	The place was exactly as described! I loved the location as it was super easy to get to all the bars on capital hill. Very simplistic type place, so if you're pretty much just looking for a place to sleep, this is it. Only problem was Alex wasn't entirely responsive via text but it all worked out in the end. Would recommend.
34722	4566609	8.0	9.0	49629455	The place was exactly as Alex described and in a fantastic location, walking distance to Pike Place, downtown area and Capitol Hill. The place is pretty cozy as previous commenters noted, but for the price and the spot, it was exactly what we needed. Alex was very helpful with places to check out and see. The wifi didn't work, but we used a hotspot. 
34723	4566609	8.0	9.0	51608824	After two good experiences with Airbnb this was not a good one.  The entire place was filthy, including spoiled food in the refrigerator and grit in the bathroom.  There was no stopper for the sink to wash dishes and there was only one working bare light bulb in the main room (a second bulb came on unexpectedly a few days later).  The Wifi didn’t work despite numerous attempts. There was no comfortable place to sit.  I wonder if the place would even met Airbnb minimum requirements.
34724	4566609	8.0	9.0	52104412	"This studio is such a great value!  My partner and I were very comfortable here for the weekend.  The location is awesome a the bed is really comfy. It was very clean and well maintained.  The decor was minimal yet artistic.  We will definitely book it again given the opportunity.
I had a couple of questions throughout the weekend and Alex was super prompt/friendly in responding."
35497	8355276	8.0	9.0	49866270	Rilwan was a great host. He provided a clean private space for me. Everything was clean and orderly, he was on time and very friendly. I would definitely stay at his place again. 
35498	8355276	8.0	9.0	50369828	Have to admit my first experience was a great one. Rilwan was very accommodating to my girlfriend and I. Very flexible with the check in/out time. Never felt any pressure to leave at the end of our stay. The apartment was clean and tidy and was in a great location centralized to all of the things we wanted to do in Seattle. Hope all of my future experiences with airBnB are this pleasant. 
35499	8355276	8.0	9.0	51478501	Rilwan was a great host. Very punctual with check-in and check-out and was available during my stay if I needed anything. The apartment itself is really centrally located if you are spending time downtown or near the waterfront. It is also very near public transit (I went up to Edmonds one of the days I was in town, and it was very easy to get to the bus from the apartment). The neighborhood is great with a wonderful grocery store just around the corner and restaurants just a 5 minute walk from the place (Sushi Kanpai is highly recommended). I would definitely recommend this apartment if you are looking for an affordable place to stay in a great area of Seattle!
35500	8355276	8.0	9.0	51778560	Rilwan is so accomodating! We had last minute changes on our flight but he stil managed to meet with us to give us the key. Everything was perfect. We loved the place! The neighborhood is quiet and nice. Walking distance to Downtown. We love Rilwan's place! We will definitely stay here again when we go back to Seattle! We enjoyed Seattle and this place made us feel at home. 
35501	8355276	8.0	9.0	52439477	All was well. Place could have been cleaner.
35502	8355276	8.0	9.0	52872365	The place was great and location was good! Rilwan was an excellent host.
35503	8355276	8.0	9.0	53358199	Great at communication, especially with emailing or texting. Readily available if questions or needs. Great location, walking distance to pike place market and downtown. Relatively private location.
35504	8355276	8.0	9.0	53729128	Wonderful experience with Rilwan. He was super easy to get in contact with, and amendable to me changing the departure time when I left. Such a great host. The place was so clean and tidy. Will definitely book again if coming though Seattle.
35505	8355276	8.0	9.0	54124787	Rilwan greeted us with a smile and was quick to help us get all set up.    The neighborhood was relatively quiet and only about a 10-15 minute walk to pioneer square and around 20-25 from pike place market.  Overall we had a great weekend and will certainly consider Rilwan's studio as an option next time we visit beautiful Seattle. 
35506	8355276	8.0	9.0	54295741	Rilwan was very easy to work with - nice coordination and communication regarding key pick-up.  The apartment is a good location for access to I-5 and downtown Seattle.  Several cafes, restaurants and a small neighborhood grocery store are within walking distance.  It is a block away from Harborview Medical Center, so the siren quotient from ambulances is high.  Apartment was not clean and lacked some basics such as soap, water glasses, kitchen towels, an iron and back-up bathroom towels.  
35507	8355276	8.0	9.0	54515829	Our stay at Rilwan's was lovely. He was super responsive and the key handoff and departure went smoothly. The place is centrally located and was very close to the Paramount theatre, where we went to see a concert. If you're looking for a cheaper place to stay without any crazy bells and whistles, this is your place! 
35508	8355276	8.0	9.0	56654269	The host canceled this reservation 64 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
35509	8355276	8.0	9.0	57429700	We loved our time in Seattle! Rilwan was very flexible with the key drop off and pick up. The apartment was clean and located in a very convenient place. There were many cafes, restaurants, sights, and neighborhoods within a few blocks. Highly recommended!
35510	8355276	8.0	9.0	57988452	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36803	9186256	8.0	8.0	54686510	Krystal was very accommodating with our check in. We were welcomed with wine, a cheese tray, and a few necessities in the fridge. Plenty of fresh towels, great Wifi, nice TV, convenient location, and decent beds! Met all of our needs!
38775	5487653	8.0	9.0	30505480	good for the price
38776	5487653	8.0	9.0	38106300	Staying at Aaron's place was a treat. It's in a fantastic neighborhood (Crown Hill) and you're within minutes of Ballard, Old Ballard, and Wallingford, not to mention the Bay. Good bars and restaurants all around and pretty easy access to downtown Seattle as well. The place itself was immaculate. We had all the information we needed for our stay (key location and wifi, etc.). Communication with Aaron was great. Highly recommend staying here!
40911	3916050	8.0	9.0	18382198	Lisa was kind. The room is small, but if you need a place in a pinch, it gets the job done.  She does have 1 or 2 other people besides herself living there, but didn't see them often.
40912	3916050	8.0	9.0	18778394	Lisa was very sweet and I had a great time at her place. The room is small but the price was right and the location is very good, safe, and close to lots of Seattle. 
40913	3916050	8.0	9.0	19494635	"Lisa's home is in a very good location if you need to get into downtown Seattle, but don't want to spend a bunch of money on a place closer in. There is a stop for the Rapid Ride bus only one block from Lisa's house and that bus will get you downtown in about 25 minutes (and has free wifi!)
I didn't have much of a chance to chat with Lisa once I arrived, but she was very prompt in responding over email when I was planning my trip."
40914	3916050	8.0	9.0	19645660	"Lisa was great in communicating back and forth and getting to the place from the E bus line from downtown was easy (just take the 91st St RapidLine stop). 
The room was as advertised; it was a small room, but very comfortable and no issues with the wifi while I was there."
40915	3916050	8.0	9.0	20064489	Great host, very friendly and sweet. Good small room, clean, smells fresh, clean bathroom. Nice neighborhood; not near buses though, you should have a vehicle if you are looking to get around town! 
40916	3916050	8.0	9.0	20395145	"Round 2 with Lisa was absolutely amazing and perfect! My apologies for some inaccurate bus information on my first review (I am not able to modify it). There are some bus lines right up the block from Lisa's place (I used the E line bus mostly) with easy access to the city.

Lisa is a sweet heart and very warm and welcoming; her genuine personality has rubbed off on her lovely son Adrian! 

Wifi was readily accessible, I was able to do laundry no problem, entering the apartment was easy (a key was always available for use). 
The space was very clean, the bathroom was clean! Overall a wonderful experience!"
40917	3916050	8.0	9.0	25650438	"Pros: I got lots of privacy. The room was clean. 2 towels were provided. Communication and parking were good.

Cons: Son screamed a lot and the living room and mostly the kitchen were so dirty is was disgusting. "
40918	3916050	8.0	9.0	25827391	Lisa's house is located in a very nice area. Its less than a minute to the E line which comes every 10 minutes or so and will take you to the light rail or downtown.  Plus, her house is near several grocery stores and restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood is very quiet yet safe. Lisa leaves you to do as you please, so you never feel like a stranger in her home. She is very nice, and will answer any questions you may have. The bedroom is nice and cozy. The WiFi is also fast. If I had to do all over again, I would absolutely do it again!
40919	3916050	8.0	9.0	26810700	Lisa is a friendly helpful host. The room is nice, the bed is comfortable and clean and the house is very quiet. I would definitely stay there again.  Great value for the money!
40920	3916050	8.0	9.0	27192065	Lisa was a very kind host. The bed is very comfortable and I had a restful nights sleep. I would definitely stay there again.
40921	3916050	8.0	9.0	27549976	I felt very welcome by Lisa's warm greetings when I arrived. The room has great privacy and the house and neighborhood is perfectly quiet. Complimentary bottled water was provided together with clean sheets and bath towels.I had no problem at all during my stay.
40922	3916050	8.0	9.0	27698986	Lisa's place was very lovely for the price! She wasn't invasive at all and let me go about my business. Despite appearances, the mattress was incredibly comfy (and I have back problems)! I'd gladly stay again. 
40923	3916050	8.0	9.0	28754072	"Lisa was very welcoming. The house is located not far from Green Lake, in a very nice neighborhood. The room was clean and ready for me. It is not large, but it is a cheap, and comfortable space to stay, for a traveller with a tight budget.

I will recommend staying there, if you find the (accurate) description suitable for you."
40924	3916050	8.0	9.0	29954196	Lisa was very accommodating and quick to communicate. The place is right next to the 99 which makes for easy access to North Seattle neighborhoods. 
40925	3916050	8.0	9.0	30474262	Room was as described. Lisa was a very kind, courteous, and understanding host.
40926	3916050	8.0	9.0	30846984	Good room for the price. Lisa is a good host.
40927	3916050	8.0	9.0	31135349	Lisa is a good host and accommodated my needs very well.
40928	3916050	8.0	9.0	31488417	Lisa was very friendly and helpful.  The room is clean and there were clean sheets and towels.  It was a comfortable bed and I am very greatful to have had such an affordable and convenient place to stay, right off highway I-5.
40929	3916050	8.0	9.0	32221916	"Lisa was very hospitable and gracious as a host.
I had to make a last minute arrangement, and Lisa was very responsive and accommodating. Reservation, confirmation, and her first response all took place within 10 minutes.  Fresh water and towels were waiting in the room. 

The place was very well maintained - clean, uncluttered, and very comfortable. It is at a very convenient location right off the highway.  

She was also very understanding when I had to leave a little after check-out time because I needed a little extra time for rest. You can tell she really wants her guest to feel comfortable and relaxed. 

Highly recommended."
40930	3916050	8.0	9.0	32800875	Bed on floor. Bathroom not clean.
40931	3916050	8.0	9.0	32951185	"My second time staying at Lisa's place. She was again very hospitable, extremely responsive with communication, which is very important to me when I airbnb. Location is also very convenient right off the highway and close to stores and restaurants. 

Her demeanor makes you feel comfortable and at home. I appreciate her small gestures such as water bottles in the room. The room is relaxing and is not cluttered with the host's belongings, which is the case with some airbnb hosts.

I highly recommend her to anyone visiting Seattle! 
"
40932	3916050	8.0	9.0	35887053	I liked it fresh air coming in my window and slept good nice carpet and Lisa was nice thx
40933	3916050	8.0	9.0	36332669	Lisa is a friendly person and made me feel very comfortable. She would check in occasionally to see if there was anything else I needed. Easy communication, completely respected privacy, the room description was accurate... overall a great experience! 
40934	3916050	8.0	9.0	37401455	Convenient Location right near a lot of neat cafes, basement room that stays quite cool even in the summer. Lisa was a nice, helpful host
40935	3916050	8.0	9.0	37772763	Lisa was very accommodating and her home is located in a very convenient location with plenty of parking.   My room was nice and quiet. I will definitely come again.
40936	3916050	8.0	9.0	38077858	Lisa's place is very spacious n clean. Though it's described as basement, there's still window for air. Lisa's very kind n communication went smoothly. thanks! :)
40937	3916050	8.0	9.0	38445546	Host was very nice and welcoming
40938	3916050	8.0	9.0	38847353	Lisa was a very understanding host.  I had to get in very late at night, and had to leave very early in the morning, and she accommodated that very easily.  The house gave a very good feel for Seattle, and she grows some amazing figs!  I only wish that I were able to stay there longer.
40939	3916050	8.0	9.0	40480565	Lisa was very nice and accomodating.  She was quick to respond to messaging/texting.  The room was what I expected, and mattress was comfy.   The house is in a very nice location: easy to walk to Greenwood, which has great coffee shops, and right by a bus route to downtown, and to the University.  I enjoyed my stay!
40940	3916050	8.0	9.0	40693831	Lisa was a great host, very welcoming. The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was great!
40941	3916050	8.0	9.0	41142534	Lisa was very nice. Everything was as described. Thank you!
40942	3916050	8.0	9.0	41296586	This place was just as advertised, and was perfect. Lisa worked with my wonky and shifting arrival schedule and made it easy to check in. The neighborhood is quiet, but close to Greenlake (walkable), so a perfect location in my opinion. A nice quiet stay. Would definitely stay here again.  
40943	3916050	8.0	9.0	41786464	"Lisa is very nice and friendly. She is very approachable and makes you feel comfortable at home. 

The room is small, and underground. It is sufficient for one person. 

The area is convenient, as there is direct bus to downtown. "
40944	3916050	8.0	9.0	44261201	Very good and owner so nice, Thanks a lot. I will see you again
40945	3916050	8.0	9.0	44614255	Lisa was an awesome host. The place was quaint and quiet. Just as posted. You got some great places to eat nearby and public transportation access. Had a great experience.
40946	3916050	8.0	9.0	45230378	"Lisa was very friendly & welcomed me to her home. Her house is located in a good area, convenient to the highway & Greenville city center. However, the house has a lot of clutter. Parking on the street in front of the house was convenient.
Bathroom was clean enough but a lot of clutter, specially given several guests having to share it. The basement room is basic, nice little window allows fresh air to come in. I found clean towels & bottles of water welcoming. However, the mattress as described is on the floor and not comfortable. It was good enough for the one night. But the sheets were not clean. Didn't look like they were changed since the last guest. They had a few strands of very long hair and the pillowcase had stains. There was no extra sheet provided, just the fitted sheet.
Therefore, I had to utilize my travel sheet & sleeping bag for the night. So glad I had that stuff. For $50+ I expect at minimum clean sheets & clean towels, even if the room & bathroom has not really been scrubbed down. 
I do appreciate Lisa welcoming me with short notice, but it was instant booking, so I expected the room to be clean and ready, anyway."
40947	3916050	8.0	9.0	46160997	Room was just as described. Lisa was friendly and welcoming. Great location with walkable streets to nearby Green Lake and cool restaurants in Ballard.
40948	3916050	8.0	9.0	46663280	Lisa's was kind and friendly, even though we ran into each other only twice. The room was the perfect little nook, perfect for getting work done. What a great find! Would definitely recommend!
40949	3916050	8.0	9.0	47773009	Lisa is a great host! She's very nice! Her house's location is very good! It's such a pity that I didn't have enough time to talk with her.:(
40978	5931372	8.0	8.0	30169706	This is a great house and for a great deal. Tahoma hosted my family, visiting me from Iceland. They had a nice experience and enjoyed their stay very much. Tahoma responded quickly to my very late request and everything was nice and clean when they arrived. Thanks Tahoma, I will definitely recommend this North Seattle Home for guests.
40979	5931372	8.0	8.0	31023241	We loved our stay in the Townhouse. It was clean, cosy and welcoming. Thanks for everything.
40980	5931372	8.0	8.0	33632964	交通方便，離市區近
40981	5931372	8.0	8.0	35297657	Really good price for 5-day stay in Seattle. Nice townhouse with garage. As long as you have a car, it is pretty convenient.
40982	5931372	8.0	8.0	36277274	房间干净而整洁，三层公寓带私人车库。我们一行2对夫妻。住2间卧室，真好。厨房东西非常齐全，主路对面有华人超市。自己可以烧着吃。谢谢房东
40983	5931372	8.0	8.0	37063108	Wonderful clean home, close to great coffee shops, restaurants. Would definitely recommend and rent again!
40984	5931372	8.0	8.0	37318513	It is nice and lovely house. The host kindly provide everything we need. We had a good time there. Thank you very much
40985	5931372	8.0	8.0	37709434	"Nice house -  modern, comfortable and, on the whole, clean. A pleasant place to stay. 

BUT the downside: if you aren't familiar with Seattle, then do be aware. This house is barely a block from Aurora, which is essentially Seattle's red light district. Streetwalkers tout for business just a few meters away from the house. It is located just behind a sex shop too! There is also a lot of noise at night both from Aurora and people hanging around on the dirt track outside the house. Because of the type of activity going on in the neighborhood, police presence is pretty high. There was a cop stationed outside the house when we were there keeping an eye on prostitutes and drug dealers. 

None of this bothered us as we know the area well and if you are sensible, you won't run into trouble. But some people may well have issues with all this.    "
40986	5931372	8.0	8.0	39741347	"This is a great little home!  My husband and I took 4 teens and had ample space with everything we needed. The owner provided a queen air mattress which was VERY helpful with the teen boys who wanted to sleep separately. :-) Be aware that the bathroom is shared with doors to the 2 bedrooms upstairs. Anyone wanting to get in to the shower would be walking through one of the bedrooms.

 I got the pleasure of meeting the owner and she is so helpful to answer any questions I had. She was thoughtful to bring me grocery bags as Seattle is plastic free and she knew we would need to do grocery shopping Thanks for that!  The area of town is older, but we didn't feel unsafe. It is noisy with traffic, which was noticeable because we slept with windows open...but the description tells you that. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks! "
40987	5931372	8.0	8.0	40894199	"The Good: My mother, husband, and 2-yr old, stayed at this house at the end of July 2015. It's located right off Aurora avenue and close to i-5, which made it very convenient to get downtown to Capitol Hill, downtown, lake Washington, and very easy to go any place west of the highways such as Fremont, Ballard, etc. The house has kitchen tools and dishes perfect for cooking easy meals. Even the knives were good. I loved that there was an electric kettle. We didn't use them but there was a coffee maker, French press, and rice maker too. The beds, sheets, and blankets were very comfortable. Lots of towels too. The sheets, bedrooms, and bathrooms were clean (other than the bathroom drain, see below). One reviewer said that aurora is the ""red light district"" this is not accurate. We were totally safe and although there were some people drinking during the day and one woman who seemed high this felt very normal for a city. Aurora had some great things on it like the drive-in burger place, a yoga studio, and the pcc natural market a five minute drive away. The Sex toy shop is no longer there.

The not-so-good: we arrived to a dirty house. Not unbearable but not up to par with what you'd expect for the price. There wasa layer of grease over the oven and microwave. The toaster and refrigerator had crumbs and food grime in them. The floor and stairs had dirt and dust in them. There were small cobwebs on the lights in the bathroom and the bathroom drain was clogged with a ton of hair. I actually pulled it out myself because I was so disgusted. We had Mary Ann come back the next day to clean the floors and kitchen again. She cleaned the second floor, toaster, and fridge but the microwave and oven were still greasy and the stairs still had dirt on them. It seemed like the house hadn't had a thorough cleaning in a long time. We would've been happy to pay a higher cleaning fee for a hotel quality clean.  We are from NYC so were used to street noise but definitely being off aurora was noisy and it was too hot to sleep with windows closed. There is no AC so you put the fan on at night and it cools down a lot. It also was a particularly hot summer for Seattle. 

Overall we had a great stay at this location and would return of we knew it would be cleaner next time. "
40988	5931372	8.0	8.0	43617525	House was just as it is listed! True, it is somewhat close to a noisy road and some non-family businesses, it is also close to a public transit stop - and we never felt unsafe. The house was clean and just the right size for our larger family. You can even see portions of downtown Seattle and Mt. Rainier from the upper floor!
40989	5931372	8.0	8.0	44746241	The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
41316	4038347	8.0	9.0	19580494	The listing was accurately represented and Lisa and her son were welcoming. The listing was a good value in a quiet neighborhood just outside of downtown Seattle. The location offered a good alternative to I-5 with a main road directly to downtown Seattle being a block away form the street Lisa's home is on. 
41317	4038347	8.0	9.0	20776928	Lisa was very nice and friendly. Room has ample closet space and dresser. House is located right off the E rapid, which gets you to/from downtown in about 20-30 minutes. I was doing research at UW, which was about a 30 minute bus ride off the 48. Greenwood also has a nice strip on Greenwood Ave, good cafes and restaurants, plus a  cocktail lounge.
41318	4038347	8.0	9.0	21173875	"I would never recommend this host. First, the house was really messy,  I never used the living room even one time. the bathroom was quite messy as well. I spent most on my time at a medical conference and stayed out as much as I could so I would avoid the messy environment. I booked 3 nights but I was unable to continue to staying there. I left after two day and as her profile states, she has flexible cancellation policy. I left early at 0800 and requested a days refund but she declined to honor her own policy. No beef, this I ended up paying for the rest of the stay. 
That said, Lisa was prompt in replying to messages. She was however unable to present me with the keys until after the first night, and I had to request for it. The location is great for what I was to do in Seattle, close to University of Washington. 
"
41319	4038347	8.0	9.0	21327061	Nice location.  Only 10 minute walk to Greenwood and 20 minute ride to downtown
41320	4038347	8.0	9.0	21451563	The house has very good location, room nice, clean and spacy. Lisa is very nice, easy to communicate, she just made some potato soup when I arrived and offered me, so nice!
41321	4038347	8.0	9.0	21559000	Lisa was a very accommodating host. The room was comfortable. Excellent public transportation to downtown Seattle. 
41322	4038347	8.0	9.0	22048448	Lisa (and her son!) were very nice/accomodating. Room was as described. Internet was a plus. Hope he feels better! :)
41323	4038347	8.0	9.0	22382454	Bed was very comfy, photos in the listing are accurate. Very easy to get to downtown Seattle on the bus. Lisa pretty much left me to my own devices which was ideal.
41324	4038347	8.0	9.0	22940936	This is a great place to crash. Lisa was very welcoming, and the neighborhood was safe, quiet, and with ample parking, as described. I was in and out because of an early flight, and got everything I needed for a great price.
41325	4038347	8.0	9.0	23000994	Lisa is so great!  She was very gracious and made me feel very welcome.  The room is nice and clean and the bed is SO comfortable!  Best sleep I've gotten in quite some time! 
41326	4038347	8.0	9.0	23731030	Lisa was very nice, and accommodating. The neighborhood was nice and the room was a good size and comfortable. 
41327	4038347	8.0	9.0	24159796	"Lisa's been very pleasant during my stay, which I actually extended by another week (to a total of two) after feeling things out the first few nights.

She has been very accommodating and has generally left me to my own devices unless I engage her in conversation, and is friendly in the passing.

I haven't had any issues during my stay, and I'd use this place again should the need arise."
41328	4038347	8.0	9.0	24389833	"Extended previous stay, pleasant experience all around.

See previous review for more info."
41329	4038347	8.0	9.0	25624397	Lisa was nice and accommodating. The house was messy, but the room was clean with clean bed sheets. The bathroom was messy, and the shower is lower, so something to consider if you're taller. She provided fresh soap and a clean towel. I was given my own space and privacy. 
41330	4038347	8.0	9.0	25913395	Had a great time at Lisa's place. She was very friendly and welcoming. Her knowledge of Seattle and the world was very much appreciated. The location has great parking which is highly valuable because many parts of the city lack easy parking. The atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. Her sense of humor is great as well. The area is close to bus stops and coffee shops if needed. The desk in the dining room was totally acceptable for doing any work. Used it quite often at night with no problem. The bed is large and comfortable and the neighborhood is very quiet. So overall I had a great time and learned a lot from Lisa. 
41331	4038347	8.0	9.0	26654007	Yes the room described exactly as it looks in the ad.  Lisa was very accommodating and helpful.  Her location was less than a half mile from the conference site I was attending which was perfect.  I was hardly there except late at night.  It was easy to navigate to food and drink.  She is very sweet as is her 4 year old son.
41332	4038347	8.0	9.0	27749811	Lisa was a wonderful host towards me. She has a nice house to live in and it was 20 min - 30 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle which is very convenient. I had a nice time leaving in her place when I needed a place to stay. Thank you, Lisa.
41333	4038347	8.0	9.0	28631257	Lisa was very pleasant and accommodating.  The room was a good size and the neighborhood was quite.  
41334	4038347	8.0	9.0	28762866	Lisa was pleasant and a good host, the room was clean and comfortable, and the neighbourhood is nice and quiet. However, it does not mention in the listing that she has a four-year-old boy who sleeps in the neighbouring room, and I think that's very important for establishing expectations as to what the atmosphere and noise level in a home will be. I had booked this room only needing a quiet place to sleep overnight. I arrived late at night after a long, tiring day driving, and was very taken aback to be greeted by a boisterous child. He's a cute kid and Lisa seems like a good mom. But even the best-behaved four-year-old boy is still going to be bursting with energy, and it's not fair not to tell people up front to expect this. Some people won't mind a bit, but those of us who are light sleepers want to be able to confidently pick accommodations where we can expect quiet.
41335	4038347	8.0	9.0	30156715	This was a great spot, close to a bus and as described. It was for my son to stay while relocating to the area and it was a great value and good location. 
41336	4038347	8.0	9.0	30747013	I was comfortable at Lisa's house.  I had what I needed, a private space to rest at night while busy with work in the city.  If the timing works out I'd like to stay at Lisa's house again.
41337	4038347	8.0	9.0	31219539	The room is exactly as shown in the photos. The neighborhood is relatively quiet, and there is parking on the street. It is very close to stores and restaurants.  Lisa is good at making you feel welcome and making sure your are comfortable.
41338	4038347	8.0	9.0	31615553	The room was clean, and Lisa was very welcoming. The place was near the public transportation stops which made it convenient to get around
41339	4038347	8.0	9.0	32134502	I had a great time staying at Lisa's house. She was very welcoming and the room was bright and homey. The neighborhood was great and close to lots of tasty restaurants.
41340	4038347	8.0	9.0	32284833	I good a good experience staying at Lisa's. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Lisa was very welcoming and friendly. This place is perfect if you need easy access to I-5.
41341	4038347	8.0	9.0	35617292	"Lisa was a fantastic host. Although, I arrived very late in the day to her apartment, she ensured to welcome me and provide the basic stuff to have a nice stay. The location was very nice in a safe neighborhood with easy access to bus to downtown. 

I will definitely stay again at her place!"
41342	4038347	8.0	9.0	35891267	"The room was exactly as advertised. Lisa was very nice and offered water, towels, and key to the house. She was able to accommodate my last minute reservation and late checkin! I felt comfortable coming and going as needed and parking in the area was just fine.

A few things to note: Lisa does not run the house much like a B+B or hotel. You are simply renting a room in an active, busy house. She has a kid who stays with her some of the time. So, be forewarned it's just going to be a bit louder if he is there. Bathroom is shared (and quite messy) but close to the room. 

This was a great place for me and for the price."
41343	4038347	8.0	9.0	36578397	"Lisa is Very nice and friendly person.
The Room was very clean.
She provided me iron for clothes.
I am very happy with her.
Suggestions : 
1. Please provide Fan in the room in summer time.
2. Bathroom have so many used/ unused thing. Please keep the only things guests needed."
41344	4038347	8.0	9.0	36919811	Lisa was very friendly. It was very hot in Seattle when i was there and she gave me the fan out of her room to use, which was very nice. She also provided bottled water upon arrival. Her place is a short walk to the restaurants on Greenwood. 
41345	4038347	8.0	9.0	38110808	"I am very grateful for the hospitality and friendliness of Lisa.
  It was a great experience I had stayed at home.
The habtacion is spacious and bright, with a large, soft bed, where sleep is placentero.El bathroom is shared with a large shower pressure.
  His home has fruit trees (fig and apple trees), which dated back to me my childhood.
  The neighborhood is aromatic and peaceful, with large gardens, with rosemary, lavender, pine and cypress.
  One block no public locomotion, which is very efficient and punctual, which allows to reach the center of Seattle in an expeditious manner.
   Lisa was very friendly, she kindly helped me meet my requirements."

This   was my first  experience with Airbnb, and it  was  a very 
positive  experience....My flight got in later than I anticipated,
but she told me   not to worry..I arrived at the house..she showed me the room and the (email hidden) it all went  well...I would get up early 
and  try to see as much of  Seattle as  possible..I would be  gone all day,and come back and go to bed..so we did not really have much
chance to interact...as I was  leaving, she came out and said good by
The bed  was  comfortable, the shower was  great , nice residential
neighborhood ..the  bus  stop was only two minutes from the house
and took me  downtown in about 20 minutes....there is an area
about  10 minutes  from the house with lots of restaurants all in all
a  pleasant  stay "
41347	4038347	8.0	9.0	39416729	Lisa is a kind and friendly person. The room was clean and comfortable. The place is easy to find and close to bus stations. I could walk down to Green Lake and the lake is a great place to relax and for walking or running.
41348	4038347	8.0	9.0	39711844	"Had a lovely time here! Lisa is a communicative and gracious host, and made everything quite easy. House is on a hill, and there's a great backyard / patio section that she invited me to use, which I did, doing work on a laptop. Backyard has some adorable chickens and a fig tree (Lisa let me have a sample: was delicious). The bed was quite comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. Pleasantly woke up each morning to the sound of birds. Would come back here for sure.

If you're coming to town to check out UW, I would recommend staying here, as it's a quick 10-minute drive away, but more charming and quiet than anything you'll find in the U-District.

41349	4038347	8.0	9.0	39888986	Great stay for my first airbnb. Confortable bed & clean room.

Since I am an ex-Seattlite Lisa didn't have to guide me or provide suggestions but my guess is if you needed help or suggestions she would not hesitate.
It was easy to come and go which I appreciated.
Thank you, Lisa!!!!!"

41357	4038347	8.0	9.0	45608593	Lisa was a very nice host. She even prepared some food for me when I got in late from the airport on the first night. The room is comfortable and clean, and there is a good bus connection to downtown.
41358	4038347	8.0	9.0	46531743	She is awesome! she always welcomed to ask any questions or helps. The location is very nice and quiet and the bus station is just 5minuts walk from the house.

She even brought me delicious homemade cookies when I first arrived!

The house was just what I was looking for-- close enough to downtown, but quiet enough to find some peace and calm. Lisa was very accommodating-- she was happy to talk about local places to eat or see and offer recommendations. Overall a very nice experience.

41566	4863533	8.0	10.0	39996179	I would like to start saying thank you to the tucker family. They were not there and didn't barge in or call, text, email etc. Me. So that was nice.  He left clear Instruction for everything. The space was great for what I needed. There is an odor not bad but strong. Maybe due to old carpet? Pet hair was everywhere. Other then those two things the place and the host were awsome. I would stay there again.
42951	7828509	8.0	10.0	50385582	The room I stayed in Matthew's place is cozy, comfortable and convenience! It's just several stops from the airport by taking the Link Light Rail and also several stops to Seattle city center. Very easy to get to and go around even though not staying in the city center. There are also two cats in the apartment. And I just can't stop my love to them cause they are way too cute! Bakery, atm and grocery store are available just 5 mins walking. Though I didn't see Matthew much, he's nice and care-taking during and before my arrival to ensure me having a smooth check-in and stay. So thanks for the accommodation, I had a great time in Seattle and will recommend others to stay there.

43056	8737284	8.0	9.0	52259814	Emmett and Barbara were excellent in terms of communication and very flexible. The apartment was just what we were looking for in terms of location and space. Very cute and cozy, making you feel right at home. Awesome cafes and restaurants in close proximity and the views are spectacular. I left some belongings there and Barbara was kind enough to offer to send them to me! Great people, great spot!
44625	6796066	8.0	10.0	37618552	The place was very cute and very girl & LGBT friendly. Everyone I met was really nice. Thanks for letting me stay! :o)
44626	6796066	8.0	10.0	38033884	The location of this house is very good，public transportation convenient. Super market and grocery store and restaurants are all within walking distance( 5 minutes at most ). Ane is a nice and considerate hostess,  the towels, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body cream are all nicely prepared. The room is beautifully decorated. She even prepared the membership cards for shopping around. Sending me messages to make sure our arrival go smoothly, providing aroma oil therapy advices by leaving us notes. Besides, the other 3 housemates are friendly and helpful too.  A great experience ! 
44627	6796066	8.0	10.0	40122127	I had a nice stay here. The location was great for using public transportation.  Ane's roommate are very helpful and nice.

44629	6796066	8.0	10.0	43577041	Ane and her housemates were all really friendly and welcoming. A funky bedroom with good transport links into the city.
44630	6796066	8.0	10.0	45161949	Ane and her housemates were amazingly welcoming and made me feel like the house was a warm home to come back to.  The house is filled with colorful knickknacks and cool art and the cat is full of love and can't stop craving cuddles.  Best experience I could have hoped for!
44631	6796066	8.0	10.0	46760861	A truly magical room in a beautiful home! Ane welcomed me as I was arriving and offered support throughout my stay. Added bonus: I got to snuggle with a roommate's cute cat! The photos do not do the garden justice. I would recommend this for someone looking for a safe space to stay with good vibes.
44632	6796066	8.0	10.0	48616949	"This room was charming, clean and comfortable! Since this was my first trip to Seattle, I especially appreciated how accessible the house was - just a quick walk following an easy light rail trip from the airport.
Thanks to Ane and Lacy for making my first nights in Seattle so pleasant!"
44633	6796066	8.0	10.0	50706655	"Ane and her housemates were very welcoming and made me feel right at home amongst the succulents (and there are many succulents indeed)! The house constantly smelled like good food as someone always seemed to be cooking up a delicious veggie concoction in the kitchen (some ingredients locally sourced from their garden in the front yard). 

Ane was very thoughtful and provided me with everything I needed for my stay - maps, information about Seattle and even discount cards for the local grocery stores. The house is conveniently located near stores and restaurants and public transportation in North Beacon Hill which is just a stones throw away from downtown Seattle. Overall it was a great stay!"
44634	6796066	8.0	10.0	53128042	Ane and her roommates were kind and respectful, and the house had a peaceful and gentle vibe. The house was always quiet and I felt very safe. I was cold my first night and let Ane know about it- she then provided me with a portable heater, which kept me comfortable throughout my stay. Parking right out front was easy and always a spot. Highlights: the freshest rainbow chard and herbs from the outdoor garden; queer friendly; Zane the sweetest cat; Ane helped me get in touch with someone for my research (the reason I was in town)! 
46044	4735761	8.0	9.0	30273009	"Skyler was really open and extremely friendly  to host me for 2 nights at Seattle .He explained to me all about interesting places at Seattle. 
 i used a mattress because couch was a bit small for me . Skyler's roommate John was also friendly . At the second day they gave me a key from apartment, so i got in apartment at night without any problem.
it's around 30 min by light rail from  Rainier Beach station( his place )  to downtown and 5 min walking from ap. to light rail station and also  pretty safe at night time caused i got back from downtown around (phone number hidden) p.m.  Also a couple of food markets pretty close in walking distance. 
Bathroom, kitchen and shared space (living room ) was quit clean. If u are not so scrupulous about cleanliness and need just spend a couple of nights i would recommend this  place. 

 
 "
46045	4735761	8.0	9.0	30935558	Skyler is a really great guy and was a wonderful host! He took the time to answer all of my questions about Seattle and gave me a lot of places to check out during my time there. He immediately included me in with his group of friends, all of which are very chill and laid-back. His place is in Rainier Beach which is two blocks from the light rail. Rainier Beach light rail is two stops from the SeaTac airport--very convienent. It's about a 25 minute ride via the light rail into downtown Seattle and is $2.50 for a one-way ride. Skyler's couch is definitely very cozy but I chose to sleep on the air matteress because of my height--whichever option works best for you. I would definitely recommend bringing your own pillow(s) and blanket(s). Skyler will give you a key to his apartment so you can come and go as you please. One additional note, Skyler and his roomate John both smoke cannibis in the apartment but they are perfectly willing to accomadate you and smoke outside or in their friends apartment above them.  If you're looking for a laid-back atmosphere and don't mind crashing on a couch or air matteress, this is the place for you!
46046	4735761	8.0	9.0	40057340	Skylar was an awesome host and I had a great time staying there. He is a really great guy and I couldn't have asked for a better time. If I am ever back in Seattle I will be using Skylar's service again, and I would recommend a stay with him to anyone! 
46047	4735761	8.0	9.0	40877548	"Staying with Skyler definitely made the first day of our roadtrip the best first day of a roadtrip ever! The moment we arrived at his place we instantly felt welcome and comfortable. Skyler and his friends invited us for beer and barbecue and took us to the beach afterwards. He also showed us a little of downtown Seattle and took us to one of the best Sushi places in town. Skyler is an easy going and very nice guy we would everybody recommend to stay with! 
P.S. We loved the blow up matress!"
46048	4735761	8.0	9.0	45646940	Straight forward and near light rail, nice folks, simple and cozy accommodations. Enjoyable :)
46049	4735761	8.0	9.0	45756997	Staying at Skyler`s place was great, and i would recommend it always. If i come back again in USA i will stay there again. Place is well positioned just 2 stops with light train from Sea-Tac airport. And for Skyler and his friends i have just to say, keep it up.
46050	4735761	8.0	9.0	48668489	Had a very nice stay with Skyler and his room mate. Clean house in a convenient location, great conversation and advice. Would not hesitate to stay there again, just a good chilled pad with some swell bunkbeds.
46132	1263470	8.0	7.0	42825542	"My boyfriend and I had the opportunity to stay at Jessica's place for three months. It was a perfect home away from home as were new to the region. She is friendly, accessible and it's easy to sense that Jessica really values bringing people together as a community. 

The apartment itself was newly renovated, spacious and comfortable. I couldn't get in enough time cooking in the awesome kitchen! The garden is beautiful and it was great to have the opportunity to get my hands dirty and participate in maintaining the space.

South Seattle is a special place and Jessica can point you in the right direction of places to eat, connect with others, exercise and adventure. 

Thanks for a great stay and we might be back!"
46133	1263470	8.0	7.0	43546124	Jessica was a sweetheart and a great host. She brought us eggs from her chickens and left us a bottle of wine which was very kind. The listing said there was a washer and dryer in the apartment (which there wasnt) and there was no TV which wasn't too big of a deal, but I would have brought a larger laptop had I been aware of that. 
46134	1263470	8.0	7.0	44442964	"Jessica's basement apartment is actually more like the ground floor in that the floor is level with the back yard.

It was comfortable, well furnished, roomy and clean. There was quite a bit of useful breakfast food in the fridge and the fresh, morning eggs from her chickens were an especially nice touch. 

The kitchen is well outfitted with dishes, pots and pans and utensils, excellent for cooking meals in. The bed was very comfortable; the newly redone bathroom was just fine.

Jessica was attentive and her hospitality extended to her deck and back yard next door, including the choice of fresh fruits and vegetables from her garden.

The wi-fi connection worked well and we didn't care, but some people may miss a TV set."
46135	1263470	8.0	7.0	45378312	We had a fantastic stay at Jessica's apartment while in Seattle for a convention. She made us feel very welcome, and ensured we had all that we needed. The photos represent the space well. It is a spacious, well-lit apartment, only 10-12 minutes walk from the light rail. The property itself is quite nice, if you are at all interested in urban homesteading, this is the place to visit! I was happy to help with the chickens when I could. Would gladly stay again.
46136	1263470	8.0	7.0	49206151	"I have used Airbnb many times prior and have had decent experiences but this will be the first exception.

I did not sleep well during my stay here. I was either woken up by chickens, the creaky floorboards from the upstairs unit, or the strong daylight that seeps in due to the translucent curtains. Even the washer and dryer would wake me up, the machine was very loud and it's right next to the bedroom. The laundry is shared with the unit upstairs. 

The heating doesn't work at the moment and is in the process of being fixed. 

There was a vast amount of spiders in the unit. Since this is a basement, there are crevices in which they can come in from. The spiders are mostly found in the kitchen and bedroom (shelf area) with the occasional appearances in the bathroom. There are also plenty by the door since there is a garden growing outside. Bug spray is highly recommended.

Wifi is very weak and doesn't work in the bedroom, as the router is located in the host's house next door. The host mentioned that she had purchased a repeater to fix it for future guests though. There's also barely any cellular service as well - I had only 1 bar. Stay in the kitchen if you need cellular or data service. I use T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary with different carriers.

The toilet is very weak and gets clogged almost daily. There is a plunger under the sink so get used to that being your new right hand. 

There is no privacy in the bedroom due to the aforementioned curtains. DO NOT change while you're in there because you can be seen from outside the window, especially at night with the lights on. 

Walls are very thin, so don't be surprised to hear the conversations of people living upstairs or the sound of their smartphone vibrating. The floorboards at the upstairs unit seem to be very creaky as I always heard it in the bedroom and kitchen.

The location of the house is in Rainier Valley, specifically the Dunlap neighborhood. It is a 0.6 mile walk to the Othello light rail station, or 0.7 mile walk to Rainier Beach station. The area nearby is a bit rundown and shady. I would recommend driving instead. The light rail is about a 30 minute ride to Westlake station, so it takes about 45 minutes to get there when you include walking. The vicinity is also poorly lit at night so I suggest getting home before dusk if you are traveling by foot.

Participating in housework is expected because it's a solo run urban farm, and there are chickens and a huge garden to attend to. The host calls, texts and touches base nearly everyday to discuss the delegation of chores. I understand that this might appeal to certain people, but if you are the type that values privacy and personal space, I do not recommend staying here at all. "
46137	1263470	8.0	7.0	55567496	We really enjoyed having such a big backyard for our toddler to explore. He really enjoyed greeting the chickens in the morning. They were not very loud as we had read in another post. Othello park isn't far which was nice, and the light rail is so convenient. We went to the tree lighting ceremony and walked home from the train. The neighborhood is very quiet. Boeing has a landing strip near by and our little guy loved seeing all the different planes in the sky. Depending who lives upstairs it can be a little loud but we had a sound machine for sleeping and it helped for the most part. It is so easy to get to west Seattle and downtown. I felt like it is a very convenient location. Columbia city was not a far drive and it had some cool shops and restaurants. We would for sure stay here again if we had the chance. 
49296	8391954	8.0	9.0	54175828	Kaitlyn's house was perfect for a weekend in Seattle!  The view was great and it was only a $10 Uber ride to and from downtown.  The house was clean, the heater heated up the house quickly, and the living room was comfortable.

Also close to a lot of good places to get food.
The house itself has clean and wellkept bathrooms, nice common area, and a great backyard. The area around the house is also very quiet and peaceful (family area).
The host ""Daniel"" is also super friendly and will go a long way to make sure you have a good stay! At least he did so for me.
Also went to my first Baseball game (Mariners game in Seattle) with host and roommates, and had a really good time! 
All in all this is a really good place to stay, with a lot of posibilities to have some fun close by!"
53541	5473498	8.0	10.0	36686622	Awesome place to stay.. Walking distance to the lake which is rad!
53542	5473498	8.0	10.0	37800690	Daniel was an awesome host! Extremely responsive and always giving the best tips on when/where to adventure. 
53543	5473498	8.0	10.0	39005974	"I had a very pleasant stay at Dan's house. I went Seattle for a summer training. Though I only had a few days exploring Seattle, Dan was very informative and responsive. Dan offered plenty info about exiting events and interesting places to visit, which made my intensive training so much fun and relaxed. Being Dan's guest, you will never get bored.

The house is just a stone's throw from the nearby bus stops, which can take you to the University district and downtown within 15 min. Wonderful host, nice location, cozy room, sufficient amenities, quiet and safe. What else you can you ask for?

"
53544	5473498	8.0	10.0	41119755	"Daniel was a super fantastic host. He checked in with me a few times to make sure everything was going smoothly, and also messaged me a few times to let me know about fun events going on in the area. The permanent tenants of the house were also very welcoming and friendly.

The room itself was not luxurious, not a lot of light or airflow, and the mattress was not of great quality. But it was still a bed and a roof, and much better than a hostel. For the price it was still really good value, and for my purposes totally fine. Overall 5 stars, highly recommended especially if you're on a budget."
53545	5473498	8.0	10.0	42426599	"About Daniel:
Dan was an awesome host! He is very very responsive, very welcoming, helpful and always giving the best tips on when/where to adventure which makes the stay a lot nicer and easier! 

Location:  
The place is a good location. It's one/two(depending on how far you can throw :) ) stone's thrown away from the bus-stop serving the U district, downtown etc . The area is beautiful and easy to commute from. There is also a lot of different places to eat and buy groceries. They are 10 minutes walk away.

Room: 
Semi-private access to the finished basement in the back. Pictures well represented what the room actually looks like. It's a private room and shared bathroom. It has a microwave and a fridge. It also had a table and chair. Also a dresser with a mirror and closet space. Light/Air inflow wasn't that great, but it was enough. 

Others:
Laundry(Washer(W), dryer(D), ironing) in the basement for $1 each(W,D). Also having access to the kitchen upstairs. 

Me:
I stayed for a week and my stay was seamless."
53546	5473498	8.0	10.0	45130901	This is a solid crash pad for young travelers. Near Green Lake, UW, and bus stops, it’s a nice neighborhood and a great location for exploring North Seattle. The pictures are accurate, and Daniel gave me lots of suggestions for enjoying the city.
53547	5473498	8.0	10.0	46513450	"Daniel was great! He checked in frequently to make sure everything was okay and also suggested me festivals happening around the city. I loved at the house. Could not meet him as I was there for a very short time, but the housemates are very welcoming and friendly.

I would definitely stay at Daniel's house whenever I am in Seattle."
53548	5473498	8.0	10.0	50294664	Daniel was a great host who was very friendly and reachable. Usually He wasn't in the house, but he always sent me a lot of information for interesting events nearby and checked if everything went well with me. Also, the neighborhood atmosphere near Ravenna was great and the location was very convenient to get to almost every part in Seattle. I recommend this place if you plan to stay in Seattle over one week and have a budget. 
54685	1950446	8.0	9.0	9351766	This loft was spacious and has a homey feel to it...very comfortable Loved the place!
54686	1950446	8.0	9.0	9505266	Although I did not get the chance to meet Anie, the place we stayed at was just as advertised. It was a great space for 7 people with ample space for sleep. We enjoyed our stay here!
54687	1950446	8.0	9.0	10139666	The apartment was very bare-bones and didn't have any kitchenware which made it impossible to do anything at the apartment, such as heat water.  The heat in the apartment was not intuitive and there weren't any instructions (or very many blankets), so it was VERY cold.  There were beds for 4 people, which was nice. The parking was very useful and Gavin was quick to respond to texts and emails. This was my first airbnb experience and it was just okay. I don't think I would rent this apartment again unless it was summer time.
54688	1950446	8.0	9.0	10213638	"This is apartment is adorable! There were 4 of us and it was a great size and very comfortable. Plus, Gavin was able to get it ready for us on just a few hours notice which was wonderful.

Pros: 
- lots of character 
- very clean
- GORGEOUS view 
- easy access to the freeway
- lock box for getting/depositing keys (quick and simple!)

Cons:
- no internet
- designated parking spot is difficult to get into
- on a very busy street
- no cooking utensils to heat water or anything on the stove 

Overall, it was perfect for a quick stay and gave me a chance to see a part of Seattle other than the usual tourist stops."
54689	1950446	8.0	9.0	10328155	Gavin is very responsive and will work with you to make sure you have a great stay!
54690	1950446	8.0	9.0	10868184	"The place was convenient for us to go into Downtown Seattle and not costly. 

Had a good time and place to stay. "
54691	1950446	8.0	9.0	10910933	This apartment was perfect!  Its located close to everything, the location definitely cannot be beat.  It was exactly as pictured and described.  Wifi worked great and kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook/eat with.  We slept so well in the dark bedrooms with blackout curtains.  We would definitely stay here again!
54692	1950446	8.0	9.0	10987871	The place was exactly what we had expected when looking for places to stay in Seattle.  We had a party of 6 and there was plenty of space for everyone.  The view from the patio was just astounding and a great introduction to the city.  The location was perfect, we were close to restaurants and the waterfront, as well as a short drive to downtown and other parts of Seattle.  The keyless entry and the fully stocked kitchen were great additions for our group to get settled in.  Definite recommended place to stay in Seattle.  Great host who was easy to communicate with, great location to explore all parts of Seattle, and the place felt like a home away from home.
54693	1950446	8.0	9.0	11034679	We absolutely loved staying at Gavin's property. It was the perfect size for the 4 of us, loved the porch, and great location. Thank you, Gavin! 
54694	1950446	8.0	9.0	11361482	Great location in the Eastlake area. A native of Seattle myself I was happy to see the place was up the street from my favorite spots (Zoo Bar and Vox Coffee). Front room gets a bit chilly, but rest of house is warm. Perfect place for Spring vacations. Great view from the patio. Front of house faces freeway, but sound is more soothing than anything. Make sure you have a compact car if you plan to use the parking spot, bit of a squeeze!
54695	1950446	8.0	9.0	11621880	The rooms are very spacious! The location is just so great. Though not a walkable distant to pike place, it's a great location to explore Seattle city area by your own car since it's just next to Lake Union with free parking lot in front of the house. Very quiet. Gavin didn't show up but it was great in a sense that v could get in and get out of the accommodation freely without feeling guilty to interrupt the owner or other guests in the middle of the night or in the early morning. Kitchenware is all equipped. Highly recommend for all young travelers whose bio-clock is uncommon or elderly who want to stay in quiet place and easy access to the city for just a few minutes drive.
54696	1950446	8.0	9.0	11663726	"We found the apartment to be bright and airy but smaller than it appeared and not very clean. The kitchen floor was sticky (spilled juice from previous guests didn't get mopped). Living room floor was not vacuumed. Bathroom had no toilet paper (luckily there was a box of Kleenex around). We found a note by the door saying towels were in the dryer in the basement. A glass vase on the high table was cracked with sharp, jagged rims. Kitchen was well stocked for eating take-out food, but not for cooking. We planned to make pasta for 8 people (apt's max occupancy) but only found a tiny pot (less than 6 inches wide) with no lid. 

It's located right next to I-5 -- be prepared for traffic background noise. Navigating our mini-van around a low brick wall to get into the parking space was also quite tricky.  

I'm not sure if we'd go back unless housekeeping improved significantly.  "
54697	1950446	8.0	9.0	11998087	Perfect apartment for our stay in Seattle. Very easy to get around by bus, taxi or Uber. There are some cute little bars/restaurants right down the road as well. I would definitely recommend staying here! 
54698	1950446	8.0	9.0	12563196	This home is located in a great proximity to the city and is only a short cab ride downtown.  Parking is quite easy to find in addition to the driveway parking.  Bring ear plugs as this house is very close to the highway and can be quite noisy (especially if you are used to sleeping in a quiet room)  Kitchen does not have any staples - so if you plan on cooking, bring your own supplies.
54699	1950446	8.0	9.0	12844368	Great place to crash after a day of exploring the city. Note that it is literally right next to the highway but the view from the balcony looks out the other way toward the lakes. Really enjoyed our stay!
54700	1950446	8.0	9.0	12999511	"We were a group of 8 who stayed in the apartment for 2 nights. Overall, the place wasn't too bad but compared to other places I've stayed at through airbnb, this wasn't the best. 

Pros: 
-easy keyless check in and check out
-location (Eastlake, just north of Capitol hill): near a lake and near lots of public transportation and coffee shops. 
-back porch: amazing view of lake union
Cons:
-location: front of house faces the highway which makes for traffic noise at night. 
-parking spot: good for a compact car but we had difficulty maneuvering our SUV around the low brick wall. Only the smaller SUV would fit. The other bigger SUV would not. In the description, it said there was ample street parking for a 2nd car, but all the street parking that I saw required a residential permit. I finally got in contact with Gavin's cleaning lady Pushpa, who offered a parking spot at a church parking alot across the highway near one of her properties. It was great that they were able to solve our parking dilemma but it was also inconvenient to have to walk 10 min. across a highway to get to one of the cars. 
-cleanliness: 3 stars. It wasn't overtly dirty, but there was mold in the shower and cheerios under one of the mattresses of the bed and the sofa. 
-communication: strangely enough, I could never get a hold of Gavin when we had an issue (1. parking when we checked in, 2. when we planned to stay there a few days later and it was double-booked). I mostly communicated with Pushpa, who was very willing to help but didn't seem to be in communication with Gavin. 

We also had the dilemma that we tried to book another night there a few days later which was difficult to do through airbnb. When I talked to Gavin about it, he said not to worry about it and that it would be okay and he would hold the place for us. By the time we were there, he had booked other people to stay the night we werent there and had double-booked us for the other night. Then they wanted to offer us another place that was double the cost. The whole exchange was very shady and we finally just opted to get a hotel instead. 

This place is nice and probably okay if you don't mind noise and don't have a huge car with you. But if anything goes wrong, it might be difficult to get it sorted out with the owners. "

The landlord replies very quickly, the rooms are clean and comfortable. Although the house is beside the highway, it is still quiet at night and we slept well. There is a big balcony with a great view outside. There is only free parking for an hour near the house, if  you want to park over night I'd recommend parking at 2244 Eastlake Ave E Seattle, WA 98102."
54702	1950446	8.0	9.0	13238229	I would of liked to have known there was issues with certain things. The internet was shotty and the dryer didn't work. I had communicated with Gavin asking about where the dryer was located. He informed me that it might not be working. I would of liked to have known these things prior to arrival so I could better accommodate my needs. Other than those things Gavin was prompt to getting back to me and helpful with my questions and the house was a nice place to stay. I'd stay again. 
54703	1950446	8.0	9.0	13351580	The listing was as expected and Gavin was totally and quickly responsive to our questions.  The location, while it can be noisy with the freeway (though it quickly became white noise so did not interfere with sleeping), was terrific; two short blocks from Eastlake's lovely restaurants and coffee (Voxx).  We had a car and  driving around the city was very convenient from Boylston, and though we didn't use it the bus service downtown on Eastlake would be very convenient as well.  We were a group of 4 adults and felt the apartment was roomy and comfortable.

54705	1950446	8.0	9.0	14092961	Great location with access to key points in and around Seattle. Gavin was responsive to us through text. The parking space was very difficult to get into, even with a smaller car. The bathroom is filled with mold, and the shower is very awkward to use The place was clean on the surface, but dust bunnies and dirt lurked in all corners and under furniture. Overall we would stay here again, but only if the place received a thorough cleaning. 
54706	1950446	8.0	9.0	15138189	"Since we arrived in the US we have stayed in several AirBNB places. I always thought maybe we’d get a dud and this place is it!
Gavin was pretty hard to reach but was accommodating once we got ahold of him and Pushpa was easy to reach but needed 24 hours notice..

I will list the top problems ( there are more);
1)      Dirty sheets (That’s just unprofessional and unhygenic).Stains…hair. 
2)      No toilet paper on arrival
3)      1 x tiny pot that you can probably cook an egg in
4)      No kettle to boil water
5)      Dirty Fridge ( all iced up and bits of food)
6)      No microwave
8)      Dirty bath - black scum marks
9)      The entrance way and hall way was caked on dirt (probably from the freeway).
10)   When I rang the manager to tell her we had no toilet paper she said she would drop some around tomorrow. We found a supermarket and bought our own.

Its a  shame as the actual apartment / location is fine ( location OK, Space OK, view OK)…its just really really dirty and has no basic essentials. ( Kettle, Loo paper...a couple of pots..clean sheets!!)

Outdoor furniture on the balcony would also be really great so we could sit and enjoy the view!

"
54707	1950446	8.0	9.0	15526249	This place is close to the bus lines, so transportation was easy.  We watched the fireworks from our balcony, which was excellent.  It was a pretty easy stay.  Everything worked okay, and Pushpa, the girl who took care of any questions we had was attentive.
54708	1950446	8.0	9.0	15908902	"The house is nicely situated by Lake Union. The transit was close to home making all parts of Seattle very accessible for us. The house itself is a nice older craftsman style home that has great charm at first look. 

I enjoyed the city of Seattle very much. However, our short stay was met with abnormally hot weather. While I can usually tolerate mid-nineties weather, we were fairly uncomfortable throughout our stay due to the lack of air-conditioning within the home. When the weather dropped to cooler temperatures, we could open the windows but could not sleep due to the proximity of the home to the freeway (in front of the house). Even with the windows closed, we could hear the roars of every car as it zoomed by on the expressway. To compensate, we slept in the living room (the room furthest away from the noise source) until the traffic and the temperature were compromising (~3am).

The home would be fine during cooler months. I did like how the home looks and the beds were fairly comfy. However, the home needs new windows to dampen the sound at the very least and a portable swamp cooler when the summer temps get above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. "
54709	1950446	8.0	9.0	16075721	The pictures on the website far exceed the interior condition of this unit.  The floors were filthy, the tub was dirty, there were no screens on the windows except for one bedroom and no a/c.  Some windows were painted shut and could not be lifted.  The unit needed airing out! My daughter had to wrap her pillows with sheets since there weren't any pillow cases on them.  The closets had dust balls and garbage from previous renters.  5 towels were provided for 3 nights- no washcloths or hand towels were provided.  The sleeper sofa was in very poor condition and the upholstery of both sofas was filthy.  There were no privacy curtains or shades on the bathroom window and there were houses with views right next door.  We were charged a cleaning fee, but it was quite apparent that the unit had not been thoroughly cleaned prior to our arrival.  We had just come from a VRBO rental for 3 days and this unit paled in comparison.  Mr. Walker has a lot to learn about how to make guests feel comfortable and welcome in this unit.  We couldn't wait to leave each day.  That is not how a vacation should make people feel.
54710	1950446	8.0	9.0	16540524	The apartment was exactly as described. Totally worth the price and the location is great! Great view from the deck. Right off Hwy 5, easy to find and close to downtown and Lake Union. We slept 5 adults comfortably. I'd recommend this place. Thanks Gavin! 
54711	1950446	8.0	9.0	16651212	"Gavin was quick to respond to any questions that we had.  He made it easy to get into the property with detailed instructions.  
The property was in a good location for what we wanted to see and do.  We were able to walk a few blocks to catch a bus to Pike Place.  There were a few restaurants that we were also able to walk to and two grocery stores.
The only warning I would share with potential guests as that the property is located on a busy street and right next to the interstate.  We found it very loud.
We were disappointed that there wasn't any patio furniture as we were looking forward to sharing a drink on the deck after our children went to bed."
54712	1950446	8.0	9.0	17142465	"The best part about this place is the location. The neighborhood was great to walk around in & it was easy enough to get in/out with our (small) car, with quick access to anywhere in the city. The inside of the house itself was OK, but certainly not the best or cleanest. We stayed during one of the hottest weeks of the year & we could only find one fan, so it was a bit difficult to fall asleep each night.

Gavin & Pushpa were both very nice & easy to get a hold of, and while it wasn't the best place I've ever stayed, it suited our needs just fine."
54713	1950446	8.0	9.0	17243778	Awesome location, and we really loved the balcony with views over the lake. Great place, thanks Gavin!
54714	1950446	8.0	9.0	17399521	"House was as described and fit our needs perfectly for a quick overnight stay. We actually didn't meet Gavin but he was very easy to deal with through messaging always responding very quickly. Nice area of town, couple of cool coffee shops down the hill to the water.  Only $12 taxi ride to downtown, so pretty close.
Thanks"
54715	1950446	8.0	9.0	17472673	"Location and size was perfect for two adults and two kids -
As we did have a car the apartment was conveniently located off the freeway with a parking space and SO SO close to where we wanted to be. 
Upon arriving we took a stroll in the area and found a great playground for the kids to play and closer to the apartment a great pizza restaurant and convenience store for snacks. 
Gavin was quick to respond with all and any questions.
Cleanliness was 3 out of 5 which is a bummer since we are charged for cleaning service. :-/
"
54716	1950446	8.0	9.0	18396009	Our stay was a pleasant one in this very spacious and conveniently located unit. When we had questions and concerns, the host answered us immediately and completely.  
54717	1950446	8.0	9.0	18701045	Great place, wonderful location near a cute village and supermarkets and the floating houses! We found the place very clean and elegant, the only issue was the lack of chairs and a dining table to sit around and eat. There weren't many wine glasses or cooking implements either, but on the whole we would definitely stay there again.
54718	1950446	8.0	9.0	18864955	This place was great! Having a view of the water, and watching the pontoon planes take off and land, was fun for all of our guests.  The neighborhood was beautiful and the home is easy to find and return to after a night out. House was clean and quiet. I would definitely come back
54719	1950446	8.0	9.0	18977448	Fastest response ever which worked out perfect t since it was a last minute idea and getting a little late. The location was perfect, almost could see downtown from the front. The beds were very comfortable, which was about all I cared about after my drive in from Portland. I was surprised there was no TV, which didn't bother me since I do not watch TV . My only complaint was after seeing the photo of the tub, I had in in my head to take a hot bath. There was no stopper so I used a pillow case, worked for me but I did have to fill the tub up with the shower since it wasn't even set up for a bath. So my 2 recommendations would be 1. Buy a tub stopper and 2. maybe invest in a nice set of towels since people could go pay 200 for a luxury hotel with nice towels. Other then that I loved the place, great view, great location and comfy beds. Thanks again. 
54720	1950446	8.0	9.0	19354223	"A last minute trip to Seattle left me not worrying about hotel rooms until arrival - mistake, as everything was booked. Prices by the airport were $500+ a night. 

Luckily, Gavin was there with instant booking. Basically a suite that I would have been paying $2k for. Place was clean, centrally located, with parking with very comfy beds. 

Some freeway noise, but the price you pay for easy access. Water pressure was good, wifi excellent and view of the Lake/balcony was a plus. "
54721	1950446	8.0	9.0	19909069	"We arrived only for one night & found the place easily. Great location, as long as you are comfortable with the sound of the freeway. Close to lake union and very accessible to many areas of Seattle. 
Gavin was very nice and responded to all questions, as did the house cleaner, Pushpa. 
The internet didn't work. There isn't a TV, which was perfectly fine for us, we don't watch it--but to do any kind of work on our commuter was not possible. 
Overall, the place was dirty. The oven had foil with remains of food from the last person staying there. The couches, walls, and floors all seemed like they needed a good cleaning. The place could be rad, but needs a serious makeover. The screens on the windows were old, and some of the windows stick and are hard to open for fresh air. 
There was only enough hot water for one shower, which was a bummer.
There wasn't any hand soap in the bathroom--or any soap for that matter. The top two towels had a smell of cologne, which was a big turn off. 
My husband and I felt a little ripped off and would have paid more for a cleaner place. We pay the cleaning fee, so I am confused what this charge is actually for. I guess peoples standard of ""clean"" varies from the next...

54722	1950446	8.0	9.0	20636585	It was great to book instantly with prompt communication.  This is a super cute older 2 bedroom apartment.  Very very basic amenities.  No tv, radio, ipod dock, soaps, kitchen supplies or anything.  It's a great location that's easily accessible on and off freeway.  The back porch has a nice view.  Highly recommend Sarafina's happy hour just around the corner.  Superb Italian food = hand made pasta dishes for just $7!!  It's nice to have several stores, bars & restaurants within a couple minute walk.  Free parking onsite is excellent :)
54723	1950446	8.0	9.0	21566266	Nice place and was as described. Easy to get in with door codes. Clean house and nice large patio. I never had to deal with anyone and had no problems. 
54724	1950446	8.0	9.0	21649021	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
54725	1950446	8.0	9.0	21899383	Great experience!  The house was a good size and a wonderful, big patio that had a view of Lake Union.  Excellent location!
54726	1950446	8.0	9.0	22131618	"Très chouette appartement, avec un emplacement de parking, facile d'accès. L'utilisation de codes pour rentrer plutôt que d'une clé est très pratique.

L'appartement était très propre. Apparemment, il y aurait eu un changement de service de nettoyage depuis les dernières reviews. Trois lits très confortables, et un salon avec deux fauteuils. De quoi loger pas mal de monde ! 

Un arrêt de bus juste en face de la maison fait qu'on peut se déplacer assez facilement. Seulement 10 minutes de bus ($2.25) pour aller à Pike Place.

On est juste à côté de l'autoroute donc on entend un peu les voitures, mais pas vraiment dérangeant si vous avez l'habitude d'habiter en ville.

Le seul point négatif concerne les fenêtres qui sont aussi vieilles que la maison et parfois ne s'ouvrent pas, parfois ne se ferment pas. C'est le cas dans l'une des chambres : une fenêtre est bloquée et laisse une petite ouverture, ce qui risque de faire un peu baisser la température en hiver."
54727	1950446	8.0	9.0	22525491	Nice place. Plenty of towels and blankets. Good central area not too far from downtown, Capitol hill and UW. Enjoyed the place, would stay here again.
54728	1950446	8.0	9.0	22639292	Such a beautiful home!  We really enjoyed our stay here. Everything  was easy about the process. 
54729	1950446	8.0	9.0	22783843	The place was just as advertised, easy to access and Gavin was very reachable.  I would stay at the residence again.
54730	1950446	8.0	9.0	23114013	Great place for a weekend trip! Clean place, comfortable beds and lots of character. Super easy to get in and out. Driveway parking is a nice plus!
54731	1950446	8.0	9.0	23730492	I had a wonderful time staying at Gavin's place. The apartment was beautiful and spacious and had a fantastic view of Lake Union from the balcony. Even though it was situated next to a highway, the noise was barely noticeable. The neighborhood is great and it was surprisingly easy to walk to bars and restaurants. My favorites were Voxx Coffee Shop and Little Water Cantina. Gavin was a gracious host and I highly recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a place in Seattle/East Lake area.
54732	1950446	8.0	9.0	23806534	Great place, clean and easy to find. 
54733	1950446	8.0	9.0	23965848	We had a great experience here. While the street is busy, the space is far removed from the hustle and bustle. It's very relaxing, warm, and has great views (even while on the toilet:) The entry situation was super easy and the host was very accommodating. The decor is welcoming but not cluttered. Thanks!
54734	1950446	8.0	9.0	24078874	I had booked this for 3 guests from out of town. They very much enjoyed their stay. The apartment was clean and cozy, exactly what we were hoping for. Gavin was prompt to address all our questions. I would book it again for sure.
54735	1950446	8.0	9.0	24217250	We had a really great stay here. The location is really central, and was a short distance to Capital Hill and downtown, which is where we spent most of our time. Gavin was sure to check in with me as soon as we arrived, which was nice considering that this stay has key less entry which eliminates the need to coordinate meet up ( which is also awesome). The neighborhood is really cute with a few convenience stores, bars, and restaurants, and there are pamphlets and other info available to you inside the foyer of the building.
54736	1950446	8.0	9.0	24230556	This place is sweet. Definitely built with a great deal of care. The back porch has a sweet view and check in was very easy. Know that the parking space he's referring to is a sideways spot right in front of the brick porch. We were confused about that at first. Lots of natural light. Overall an awesome stay, I wish we had had more time here.
54737	1950446	8.0	9.0	24402909	The house was easy to find and the entry lock system worked well. Gavin was very responsive when we had questions regarding the apartment. Great little neighborhood.
54738	1950446	8.0	9.0	24861752	We had this wonderful spacious place all to ourselves which felt like a cozy urban cabin. It was so well situated, with great Italian and sandwich and coffee shops nearby (plus a market!) and easy access to the highway. Gavin was excellent about reaching out. 
54739	1950446	8.0	9.0	25118823	Gavin's apartment was perfect for us. The neighborhood is safe and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance but having a car is a plus. There is a parking space provided which is a plus for us. In better weather there is a great porch with views of of Seattle. There is no microwave or TV but the internet worked great. There was an electric heater for some extra warmth. We also noticed a pack and play in the closet. Don't worry about being near 5 we hardly heard anything from street noise. It is especially nice to have key pad entry. Thanks Gavin
54740	1950446	8.0	9.0	25211898	Gavin was great at communicating quickly.  His place is in a convenient location central to downtown Seattle, freeways, restaurants.  It is a large unit with lots of space for multiple people, plus a deck.  If you're sensitive to noise, it's a close to a freeway, but inside the living area is just fine.  This is not an owner-inhabited unit, so there are no knick-knacks or clutter.  If Gavin's cleaning people did a good job, this unit is a good value for inner-city living and has it's own parking spot, which is a plus.  This is a super-convenient place for a stay in Seattle.  Thank you Gavin.
54741	1950446	8.0	9.0	25315671	Loved this place! The flat was cozy and quaint with lots of light. There were plenty of essentials and didn't feel that anything was lacking. The place is centrally located with easy access to highway. The parking spot was a plus. Thanks for having us Gavin, we had a great time in Seattle!
54742	1950446	8.0	9.0	25412285	Gavin has a great house, and was very accommodating. His house was clean and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Gavin! 
54743	1950446	8.0	9.0	25912994	"Definitely an amazing space to be! Awesome location. We will definitely be back
"
54744	1950446	8.0	9.0	26011488	Great place! 
54745	1950446	8.0	9.0	26070545	This cozy apartment was perfect for our little weekend getaway! Gavin was excellent at communicating and his recommendation for a great place to watch the Super Bowl was spot on! It was so relaxing to  walk into a clean and well presented home. I wish we could have stayed longer. 
54746	1950446	8.0	9.0	26137013	A family emergency came up and I was unable to make the reservation work. Unfortunately, there was a strict policy so couldn't cancel, but Gavin was helpful and communicative regardless. 
54747	1950446	8.0	9.0	26302604	Our visit was great in Seattle. The location of this stay worked really well for us to explore many different areas of the city. It was near bus lines and close to a few useful spots (food/convenient store/coffee). The patio was nice as well. Thanks for the stay!
54748	1950446	8.0	9.0	26456023	Loved our place, location is great, free parking was a bonus, tons of sleeping space, there was a large deck attached to the unit we rented and it was fantastic! 
54749	1950446	8.0	9.0	26601512	The host was very good.  Gavin and Airbnb were prompt and professional.  The neighborhood was OK.  The location was good in terms of proximity to things important to us but looks out on I5.  The other side, however, had view of Lake Union.
54750	1950446	8.0	9.0	26745480	Nice and fit the description - great to have your own parking spot.
54751	1950446	8.0	9.0	27076497	My flight was unfortunately overbooked so I was unable to stay at the place but my friend who I originally was traveling with did stay and said that the place was great, everything was as expected. Sad I wasn't able to make it. 
54752	1950446	8.0	9.0	27119837	It was a great place to stay last min!  Good location!  Cute unit with great features!
54753	1950446	8.0	9.0	27318759	Gavin's space is clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced. We enjoyed our stay. The front bedroom does have a fair amount of traffic noise, but the other bedroom is well sheltered from this. The apartment does have a pack and play crib. If you're traveling with an infant like we were this is very helpful!
54754	1950446	8.0	9.0	27852097	The place was decently priced. Great location close to downtown area. 
54755	1950446	8.0	9.0	28213507	Gavin was quick to respond to any question by phone and by email. Very easy to work with. Great stay and we have future area already booked with him. 
54756	1950446	8.0	9.0	28304502	"Lovely old house. Close to highway so very easy to find and great that it has a parking spot. We discovered the neighborhood by foot and
took the bus to downtown (bus 66)
Also some great restaurants close by. 
A welcome guide with tips about neighborhood and bus routes etc would be helpful. I'm glad I brought my computer so we could google all that we needed. 
"
54757	1950446	8.0	9.0	28612067	Nice place to stay....fairly close to all the attractions LOL
54758	1950446	8.0	9.0	28698584	Our stay was wonderful! Gavin's place is beautiful. It slept 6 adults comfortably and we loved being able to make breakfast for ourselves in the morning. There is a great convenience store just down the hill. The linens were nice and check in/check out process was a breeze. The one suggestion we have is to improve the toilet function. We had to wait long periods of time for the bowl to refill. We think it had something to do with water pressure but aren't sure. Not a huge problem though! We enjoyed our stay so much :)
54759	1950446	8.0	9.0	28989735	We were so happy and satisfying for this house. We got just what we expected. The house in a great location close to downtown. The house was clean. The most important thing that the sound insulation is very good.
54760	1950446	8.0	9.0	29387579	The apartment was in a great location and had a beautiful view of the city. Plenty of space for 4 people, but I could see it feeling a bit crowded with more. We didn't communicate with Gavin while we were there because we had a friend in the area who helped us navigate the city, so that wasn't a problem for us. The plumbing/water pressure in the bathroom wasn't great and made showering and toilet flushing difficult. It wasn't as clean as we expected, the floor was pretty dusty and the shower curtain wasn't great. Other than those issues we were happy with the stay. 
54761	1950446	8.0	9.0	29597221	House was clean, getting in and out was easy, everything was exactly as advertised.
54762	1950446	8.0	9.0	29919501	The location of this place is awesome. Despite its close proximity with I-5, we didn't hear any noise as long as we didn't open any window or the balcony door. Gavin provided some coffees and teas for us and few amenities in the pantry. Wi-Fi connection was fast. The beds were comfortable. There was no TV, but we didn't need one since we only use the place to sleep. It would be nice to have washing & drying machine though. Check in/out was easy. This is an upper level area and we love how it has a lot of windows (thus lots of natural lights) and the view of the lake is great. The water pressure in the bathroom wasn't great in terms of taking shower and flushing the toilet. It took a while for the toilet bowl to fill up. The bath tub can be deep cleaned since there were some lime build up on the side. Other than those issues, we were happy with our stay.
54763	1950446	8.0	9.0	30442829	Gavin was easy to deal with and the place way perfect for our group of 5. Very cosy and had everything we needed, would definitely stay here again. 
54764	1950446	8.0	9.0	30875977	This place was perfect! A great space for my 2 friends and I to use as home base. Close to Eastlake to walk down and grab a coffee and close to public transportation. Capitol Hill is only a 5 min drive if you have a car or a $6 uber. Gavin was super nice, I met him the day I arrived the space was quaint and clean. I would definitely use this bnb again.  
54765	1950446	8.0	9.0	31050048	We were 5 adults passing thru Seattle looking for a place to stay close to the downtown area for one night. Gavin's place is a nice heritage home close to town and bus routes. The apartment is nice and comfortable and worked out well for us. The bathroom shower was a bit limited and it's close to the highway so it's a bit noisy but expected as its close to town. We would still recommend it for its convenience and it was clean; it's also a much better option than boring expensive big chain hotels! Thanks for the stay Gavin.
54766	1950446	8.0	9.0	31195723	Our entire experience was wonderful. Gavin gave us all the information we needed, and the apartment was adorable. 
54767	1950446	8.0	9.0	31831422	For the price it was expected. The smell was a little musty in the apartment and the hallway smelled like hot garbage. The shower was full of character. It was great having parking and the neighborhood was really awesome. Gavin was very attentive via email.
54768	1950446	8.0	9.0	31944897	Gavin à  un appartement qui est parfait pour aller visiter la ville à  pied... à  maximum une heure  du centre ville et de tout ce qu'il  faut  voir.  Un vieil édifice  donc rien de droit et un peu de moisissure.... ( c'est normal vu l'âge  du bâtiment )  La cuisine est équipé pour un déjeuner  ou un dîner mais pas un grand repas gastronomique. ... pas de table pour manger donc la table du salon nous a servi de salle à  dîner.   Merci Gavin
54769	1950446	8.0	9.0	32138669	Gavin's place was exactly as advertised. We had no problems while we are staying and everything was clean and cozy. The location was great too- central to everything and easy access to the freeway! Parking was convenient and we loved the back porch with a view of the city! Gavin was easy to communicate with and responsive via phone and text. 
54770	1950446	8.0	9.0	32314363	The space was wonderful. Our group had an easy time getting into the unit with Gavin's clear instructions. Everything was clean and tidy with charming details of an older well-loved home. Really enjoyable stay!
54771	1950446	8.0	9.0	32677828	We had a great time at Gavin's place. Everything was clean and well prepared. Great location as well! Would definitely stay here again.
54772	1950446	8.0	9.0	32895044	Definitely a cute little place conveniently located right next to the i5. Parking right next to the house made it easy to park our rental car. The bathroom was a little cramped and could use some updating, but the spacious rooms and the cozy living room made up for that. Could get a little noisy since it's right by the freeway, but as long as you keep the windows closed it should be fine. Overall a nice place to stay!
54773	1950446	8.0	9.0	33662823	The three day stay there is great. We pretty enjoy seeing the beautiful sunset while sitting at the balcony, feeling the cool wind. And the host offers a complete set of cookers, so mom can make delicious home made food. But during the day, it can be kinda hot without air conditioner. So I do suggest the host can offer a fan. That would be much better :]
54774	1950446	8.0	9.0	33824611	Gavin's space was great for our brief stay - spacious and comfortable, not to mention the view off to the side on the patio. It's also near a bus line, which was ideal for us in a pinch. Thanks for everything!
54775	1950446	8.0	9.0	34043852	As usual since I've stayed at Gavin place before the check in was very easy and check out was very smooth allowing me extra time to pack and get ready. the place was very clean and had all the extra amenities in the bathroom and kitchen.
54776	1950446	8.0	9.0	34146413	Great place and location! Great view of Seattle, parking spot and good access to highway. The shower is the one moot point and could definitely use an upgrade. Overall, great experience 
54777	1950446	8.0	9.0	34766815	Just as described, it was a great stay and the lake view cannot be beat.
54778	1950446	8.0	9.0	35349370	Check in so easy, and parking spot very useful. Shower leaves a little to be desired!  Great proximity to walk to shops, restaurants and the harbour.
54779	1950446	8.0	9.0	35466839	The host was prompt with communication and answered all of our questions. The apartment is in a great location for both walking and other transportation (right near the I-5 on ramp and the buses and transit in Eastlake). The entry keypad is very convenient, especially if you arrive in Seattle very early or late. The apartment was clean and spacious. The shower leaves a bit to be desired but otherwise I have no complaints about the apartment.
54780	1950446	8.0	9.0	36011494	Appreciated the coffee and found the listing exactly as stated.
54781	1950446	8.0	9.0	36172183	The place was great, very clean and in a good location. Very soft bed sheets! And the place is very easy access due to the code lock doors. Thank you!
54782	1950446	8.0	9.0	36757501	Everything was as it was mentioned in the description. 
54783	1950446	8.0	9.0	37601989	Josh's place is well represented on the site. His itinerary communications provide all you need for easy entrance and exit. Josh is highly responsive to  questions and offers helpful tips about the surrounding area. The area is safe with easy access to downtown. Two moms traveling with two boys felt safe. Easy walking to coffee and restaurants. The bathroom tub could use a resurface for aesthetics. All in all great place in convenient location.
54784	1950446	8.0	9.0	37759627	"Our AirBnB experience with Joshua's apartment was mediocre at best.  Let me start of first by saying that Joshua was a great host. He responded to all my inquires promptly and even let us check in a little early. The location of the apartment was amazing. It was so convenient to get to everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle, and it was wonderful to have a parking spot since street parking is pretty tricky. 
What we were disappointed with was the actual apartment. The apartment was spacious, however, the photos we felt were a little misleading. The bathroom was growing mold all over the ceiling, and there was no curtain for the window so anyone could see right in. It also looked like there was water damage on the ceiling in the bedroom with two beds because the paint was bubbling quite a bit over one of the beds. The ""patio furniture"" on the deck only included two chairs and a small table. Not really what I was expecting. It had been unseasonaly hot in Seattle, and the apartment did not have any air conditioning. I knew this from the listing, so I requested some fans to help with the heat. We only got one, so that meant that only one room got to take advantage of it at night. 

Overall, we had a great time visiting Seattle, but the apartment needs some help. We understand that it an older place, and it has character, but I would prefer no mold on the bathroom ceiling and a ceiling that doesn't look like it is going to fall on you. "
54785	1950446	8.0	9.0	38460847	"Josh was great - answered phone when I accidentally called him and was very pleasant.

Likewise, place was fantastic.  A great location and very spacious and well maintained.  Probably the only downside was I couldn't figure out the hot water on the bathtub so had a few brisk constitutionals during my stay. :)

Would absolutely go back if I was in Seattle.  Fantastic BnB."
54786	1950446	8.0	9.0	38598530	"Entry/exit really easy.  Apartment was clean, comfortable and spacious, just as advertised.  Good ventilation.  Nice beds and towels.  Kitchen had what we needed.  A little noisy, being so close to US 5, but it's the city.  I recommend this place.

54787	1950446	8.0	9.0	38750369	Thanks Joshua for the amazing place to stay! :) it was just as described in the listing... I had texted Joshua a few times during our stay with questions and he replied back promptly and was very kind. The place has a great view and www the perfect place for my family and I to stay. Thanks again Joshua big we ever need a place in Seattle again we will look you up! 
54788	1950446	8.0	9.0	39045326	This was a great loacation. We were able to walk to the water, coffeeshop and market.  Easy drive to everywhere else we went.  House was clean, beds were comfortable. Everything you minimalistically needed was provided.  The shower really needs to be fixed/improved.  This was a great spot to stay.  
54789	1950446	8.0	9.0	39557093	Quick response, nice host, but The property is on the busy street, too much noises 
54790	1950446	8.0	9.0	39734877	Overall our group had a nice stay. The general consensus was the location & amenities served their purpose. Since our group rented both sides of the duplex we were able to have double the room to roam and relax which was excellent. Our only problem unfortunately was the cleanliness of the floors. Our feet were black from the soot/dirt. We found this problem in both units sadly. There were also misc items in the fridge (roast beef, ice cream, half container of juice etc) from previous guests. We did find everything to be accurate from the photos and enjoyed the central location. The house has it's charm and we very much appreciated having a comfortable bed to sleep in. The linens that were provided were great as well. The door key pad was a great feature and had no problem accessing either unit or the front door. Parking was also a plus.
54791	1950446	8.0	9.0	40019738	My friend and I stayed upstairs in the 2 bedroom for one night to attend a wedding in Seattle.   We enjoyed the vintage modern feel and look of the place.  It was a nice pleasant stay and a great deal for the area with parking.   I will definitely consider staying here again.
54792	1950446	8.0	9.0	40090910	I came to Seattle with my parents, my aunt and two cousins so the six of us stayed in the apartment. The apartment was great and served our needs. It was clean but the place did have character. I received the wrong code to get into the front door but Joshua picked up my call and that was rectified quickly. 
54793	1950446	8.0	9.0	40321499	Communication with the host and checkin was seamless. We loved the location and the place was very comfortable. The bathroom is a little small for 4 people to share, but all else great.
54794	1950446	8.0	9.0	40611573	Everything was provided as advertised in the listing.  The condo is in a great location and the space worked great for the bride and her bridesmaids as a location for getting ready for the big day!
54795	1950446	8.0	9.0	43331291	Big enough for four of us to sleep comfortably. Easy to find. 
54796	1950446	8.0	9.0	43468817	As expected. Clean, quiet, and a nice view. 
54797	1950446	8.0	9.0	43570296	Joshua's place was nice. Had some character and was in a cool neighborhood.  Definitely would recommend staying there.
54798	1950446	8.0	9.0	44452309	Nice apartment.  Walking distance to Union Lake, good restaurants as well as nice coffee shops.  I stayed with my wife and three children. We all enjoyed our stay here.   It is close to busy freeway but we closed the windows at night so the noise was not disturbing. 
54799	1950446	8.0	9.0	45283556	"Apartment was overall good. Good localization, very comfortable beds. Wi fi worked great. We also loved the speakers for music being available. Easy access, no Problem with door codes. Nice toiletry and blow dryer. Very close to small restaurants, very good mini market and coffee shops. Tranquil area and convenient 15min cab to downtown. Cute apartment with nice decor. 

Cleaning was alright but not amazing, specially some stained bed sheets. General state of apartment was good. Would also appreciate if there was more towels available for a longer period.

54800	1950446	8.0	9.0	45624470	Place was great and josh was very helpful to all our needs
54801	1950446	8.0	9.0	46675795	We had such a nice time at Joshua's apartment. It was clean and the view of the sunset was amazing! The traffic is a little noisy but in a white noise kind of way. Communication with Joshua was easy and It was easy for us to grab an uber and see the city. Would definitely recommend Joshua's place!
54802	1950446	8.0	9.0	46947878	Great Location and view of the Lake, couldn't have picked a better spot! Close to the nightlife and restaurants of Capital Hill and close proximity to some great parks! 
54803	1950446	8.0	9.0	48113280	Joshua's place was inviting and very easy to get to. Joshua was a fantastic host. He was welcoming and responded quickly to messages. The location was ideal - centrally located and easy to get to. 
54804	1950446	8.0	9.0	48404408	"Joshua was a great host. Very quick on response, and the property was acurated as what described on the site. 

We had total 5 people eventually stay at the property. It was a family vacation, with two seniors. The property was nice and comfy. Clean, and had a fully functioning kitchen.

Location was great for guests who drive. 5-10 minutes drive to DT Seattle, super convenience. 

Only disadvantage of this property will be too close to I-5 so there is a noisy level there. It was fine with me, but two seniors did complain a little. 

Overall, highly recommend, especially for group who has car!!

"
54805	1950446	8.0	9.0	48590145	The place was nice and pretty cute - great for a group of 4 in Seattle for the weekend. Joshua was good at communicating with me about any questions I had. it was well located to get to downtown and many other neighborhoods in Seattle. 
54806	1950446	8.0	9.0	49280803	A real nice nook for writers. My first time using Airbnb. Checking in and leaving was a real breeze, the house and units are beautiful. I can't remember now why I used to do hotels. I feel like I was asleep.
54807	1950446	8.0	9.0	49687088	Me and a few friends (4 people total, one couple) shared Joshua's place for a weekend and it turned out to be the perfect option.  Great location, clean apt and easy check-in/out.   
54808	1950446	8.0	9.0	50070986	This house was perfect! It housed me and my 4 friends with plenty of space. It was in a great location and the parking space was definitely a plus! The view on the deck was amazing. 
54809	1950446	8.0	9.0	50530914	The place was bright and welcoming, exactly as described.  Easy access via car.  Great view from a large balcony.  Nice quiet area.  We walked a few short blocks to find good coffee on a street a couple with small shops, markets and restaurants.
54810	1950446	8.0	9.0	51158173	"We arrived in Seattle for one night and found the house easily! (Just off the highway),  we and 4 friends stayed on the top floor of the house and we all found it very spacious and well kept for a quick overnight visit to the city. 

The neighbourhood was great, lots of great restaurants and an amazing bar (Eastlake Tavern Zoo) . Close to downtown and transit was the easiest way to get around! 

Good house for a quick trip to Seattle! "
54811	1950446	8.0	9.0	51516982	"So I needed a very last minute booking for two nights somewhere that was close to where I needed to be (for work) and had internet and a parking space. With those requirements this rental unit was perfect. Read the other reviews (as most are spot on regarding the current condition of the unit) for more detailed descriptions of the place but if you just need a place to rest your head at night it's perfect. Little to no water pressure if both units are using the sink/toilet/showers , no tv, located on a busy street (which can be noisy if windows are open), some windows are permanently open (see my last point) and it could use a good mopping (floor is a bit dirty but the rest of the place was pretty clean). Take the photos with a grain of photoshop as nothing in that place is that white. It's a cute little two story house in a great neighborhood, walking distance from not only a small market but some good places to eat. The units both come with a parking place and thanks to keyless entry you don't need to meet with Joshua for check-in/check-out.  
the tldr: If you're looking for a cheap, clean unit in a great neighborhood that you're only going to be using for sleep then this is your spot (especially if you have a car), if you're looking for a full hotel experience you should weigh your options. This might sound like an overly bad review but honestly for the price I paid it was a great choice. I would have no problems staying there again the next time i'm in town. Great view from the upstairs deck btw.
~Brent"
54812	1950446	8.0	9.0	51924525	"Pros:
The apartment is spacious, the location has easy and convenient access to highway and city. The check-in was straightforward with the door codes. Nice view, good natural light, appreciated having a parking spot. Joshua was easy to contact and quickly responsive.

Cons:
Overall feeling of cleanliness was not great. Stains on bed coverings. Towels were older. Pans were very used/old. The bathroom floor in particular was grimy/dirty around all the edges. Bathroom cabinets completely full of leftover random toiletries, which we re-organized to make room for our own. Fridge also contained a few half-used items. The only radiator that seemed to work was the one in the living room - the others (bathroom and both bedrooms) stayed cold the entire stay.

In bedrooms at night, we used white noise apps on our phone to soften the murmur of the highway, and the occasional loud truck/motorcycle... and that worked fine. Other than that, the apartment was calm and quiet in the living areas."
54813	1950446	8.0	9.0	52447512	"This unit is as described reasonably accurately by Joshua and the other reviews. For me it was unpleasant because 1) the heat didn't work in the upper unit I rented. 2) The shower pressure is incredibly poor and the hardware of the shower fairly antique making good control difficult as well as the shower curtain being hung somewhat askew keeping it in touch with your body basically at all times. 3) The downstairs unit tenants disrupted my evening trying to access the upstairs unit I was renting ""just checking the house out."" 4) The road noise was pretty bad.

I reported the heat issue almost immediately and Joshua was fairly dismissive of my concern until my 2nd request for assistance when he offered to come over when convenient for him after work, and then didn't come by at all. This was an underwhelming reaction to what I feel is a very serious issue in the unit during the cold of night."
54814	1950446	8.0	9.0	52667191	This upper unit was a nice option at the last minute for us in Seattle. Just minutes from downtown and there is a cafe around the corner and down the hill a couple of blocks. It's not fancy, but it is a good option if you want to be close to the city. Security locks at main entrance and also into the unit. Parking is very tight for an Suv in the front of the home but manageable. Thanks!
54815	1950446	8.0	9.0	53150456	Joshua's place great, clean, nice and cozy. Location was convenient because it was near the highway and close to downtown. I enjoyed my stay here.
54816	1950446	8.0	9.0	53426591	Joshua's place was a great space for my family and I to spend a couple days in Seattle. The apartment was warm and cozy. The beds were super comfortable and we were close enough to all the sites we wanted to see. Proximity to the highway noise was noticeable but quickly turned to white noise, which was actually quite pleasant. The parking space was used and appreciated!
54817	1950446	8.0	9.0	54385313	Great location and communication. Great view from the deck. Only negative is that the shower is pretty awful. Would make a huge difference with a new shower. Otherwise, great place and will definitely stay there again inmost next visit to Seattle.
54818	1950446	8.0	9.0	54569782	It was a pleasure staying there very spacious and very close to most attractions and very clean. 
54819	1950446	8.0	9.0	55088390	Gavin made us feel very welcome. The home was beautiful and was very spacious. It was located very close to downtown which made it very easy for us to get to places that we wanted to visit. We would love to stay in it again the next time we are in Seattle. 
54820	1950446	8.0	9.0	56161733	Absolutely beautiful, tasteful upgrades to a classic house. Immaculate.  The host lives in a building behind the house. He basically checked us in, saw us out and left us to our own devices otherwise.
55303	385438	8.0	8.0	1717973	The home is lovely, but the pictures make it look much larger than it is. It is ideal for 4 people. The extra mattress to put on the floor of the living room can accommodate one additional person. The garage is useful for keeping vehicle safe, and it is important to know the number of the space to occupy. I was initially nervous because I did not have a number of a local person for emergencies, but we did not have any emergencies, so that was not a problem. We were not able to figure out how to operate the TV, though it did work, it was just too confusing for us. We could not get the coffeemaker to operate either, though I believe it did work. The ice water from the fridge was delicious. We enjoyed using the nice cutlery to prepare fresh fruit purchased at Pike Market. We made eggs one morning for breakfast. There were no instructions for us in the kitchen, so we were not sure what was for our use. The beds were very comfortable. They had air conditioning which was nice in the warm weather. It was not within walking distance of any grocery stores or restaurants that we could find. It would have been great to have had a list of recommended grocery stores and restaurants nearest. I wasn't sure how to operate the broiler, and we chose not to use the grill outside, so we did not cook supper there. Since we were their first AirBnB guests, and it was our first time to be AirBnB guests, it all was really great in the end. Thanks for sharing your home with us!
55304	385438	8.0	8.0	1754639	We stayed here for 3 nights while visitng Seattle.  The condo had everything we needed including a parking spot for our car and was very close to the Space Needle and Downtown.  
55305	385438	8.0	8.0	45154263	The condo was amazing, really great location and great place.  The host had the best communication I have ever experienced, everything was perfect.
55306	385438	8.0	8.0	46187468	Our stay was quite nice, the condo was clean and welcoming. Also, the host was very helpful and easy to work with.  The location of this listing is great- Within walking distance of many cool stores and restaurants and easy access to the highway. Parking was a little bit of a struggle after 5pm. There is a parking lot in front of the building however it fills up quickly so once you park try not to move. This is when we relied on other services to get around. 
56190	882274	8.0	9.0	3473940	This was a great place to stay in. It was located in a prime area where I can walk to coffee shops, stores, and restaurants. Nick was a great host! He always responded to my questions almost immediately. The place is clean and there are tons of heater in the room. It was also really cool that Nick has Roku. Overall I would definitely go back again when I'm visiting Seattle.
56191	882274	8.0	9.0	3490882	Nick was very flexible and great to work with. The condo was great for the price and easy to get to places.  Thanks Nick! 
56192	882274	8.0	9.0	3523275	It was a great place to stay! Very good and prompt communication with the host, the place was nice and clean and in a really good location right at the bottom of capitol hill a few blocks above downtown. Really easy access to public transportation and just 1 block off of pike/pine corridor. 
56193	882274	8.0	9.0	3552248	"  Location, location, location! This sweet little apartment is perched at the corner of Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle. The apartment itself, located in a secure building, was cute, clean and perfect for my boyfriend and I. The space is huge for one, great for two and equipped for three (the couch in the living room folds out). Nick was so easy to communicate with in the weeks leading up to our trip, quick to respond to inquiries and pleasant to work with. We were met and let in by Nicole, as Nick was unavailable. We didn't have to call them for anything during our stay, but they were always available to us, just in case. 
   I cannot stress the awesome-ness of the location enough- surrounded by cafes, bars and restaurants, a block away from major bus lines,  and gorgeous views everywhere you turn. We were so busy taking advantage of all the great things to do, we basically just slept, showered and geared up for the day at the apartment.
   Do yourself a solid and visit The Pine Box, a sweet bar with pizza oven, located 20 seconds away from home.
   (The building is near the freeway, so if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs.)
     Thanks Nick and Nicole- we'll be back! (in the friendly 'we enjoyed our stay' way, not the Terminator way!) "
56194	882274	8.0	9.0	3602556	You can easily walk to downtown from this place and also the neighbourhood, Capitol Hill, is fun to explore! Nicole and Nick were both very helpful and immediately responded when we had questions. 
56195	882274	8.0	9.0	3627310	"We ha a wonderful stay at Nicks Apartment in Seattle. It was a great location and we had everything we needed. Close to all the great neighbourhoods and much cheaper than trying to find a hotel. Even when the fuse didn't work Nick was quick to fix it which was great! All in all Id recommend it for anyone laid back who wants a cozy stay that is affordable and close to all the great spots in downtown Seattle. Making our way back to the airport was a breeze as well! 

Thanks Nick :) "
56196	882274	8.0	9.0	3673280	Super clean, GREAT location, steps to great bars and restaurants but safe and quiet building. Perfect for one person or a couple. The bed was SUPER comfortable. Nicole, who takes care of check-in, was very friendly and is around if you have any questions. This was my first Air BandB experience and I will definitely be back! 
56197	882274	8.0	9.0	3676483	Nicky's place is in a great location and everything about using the space was easy. It's pretty basic accommodations but clean and equipped. The manger was great to work with although I didn't meet her. 
56198	882274	8.0	9.0	3737702	They were very helpful and provided a clean place to stay. My girlfriend and I were visiting Seattle with no car, and this was a perfect location to walk or use public transportation all around the city (including to/from the airport).
56199	882274	8.0	9.0	3773382	I throughly enjoyed staying at Nick's listing.  It put me in a fantastic spot in Capitol Hill close to great food, great coffee and night life.  This would be the first listing I look at when I go back to Seattle.
56200	882274	8.0	9.0	3853060	As mentioned by other reviewers, the location of this apartment is spectacular.  Comfy bed, well-equipped kitchen, and TV with Netflix! Accommodations were exactly as described, and Nicole was very responsive with any questions we had.
56201	882274	8.0	9.0	3883261	Pretty good place and help from the manager! All worked perfect and it was right next to the convention center... a bunch of cool little restaurants and cafes right by your door steps... def recommend!  
56202	882274	8.0	9.0	3936981	If you only care about location, then this place is great because it is right next to the bar, club, and restaurant scene and a very short walk away from downtown. They were also flexible for letting us check in early, however the apartment is much dirtier than it looks in the pictures. There is mold on the wall and they didn't clean or vacuum anything before we checked in, so I actually would have rather waited until they cleaned everything thoroughly than check in early to a dirty apartment. There also was no extra blankets for the sofa bed, but to be fair we also didn't try to call and ask if they had one either.
56203	882274	8.0	9.0	4001889	My friend and I had a great stay, The place was clean well stocked kitchen, is close to restaurants, and a short walk to the convention place definitely recommend.
56204	882274	8.0	9.0	4137404	Great place! I got it for my grandparents for a couple days stay and they were very happy with the accommodations. 
56205	882274	8.0	9.0	4182641	"I stayed at 304 last weekend with a friend who flew into town. The apartment was absolutely perfect for our needs.

The location is incredible, nestled on the edge of Capitol Hill, close to cafes, bars and coffee shops. At the same time it only took us about 20 minutes to walk to the waterfront downtown. We parked on melrose and didn't have any issues.

The apartment isn't huge, but for the two of us it was fine. The bed was very comfortable, and even though the place is right off I-5 neither of us had trouble sleeping with the window cracked open. I can't say we had any complaints about the place.

After putting in my request to book Nick got back to me within an hour. We didn't get to meet him personally, but Nicole was easy to work with, available and accommodating. 

If you are 2-3 people I'd definitely recommend staying at Melrose Court.

"
56206	882274	8.0	9.0	4204524	I only stayed a night but my stay was great -- even if I arrived late (12 midnight) and had trouble getting the locks to open, Nicole was easy to reach and patiently helped me get in. If I get a chance to visit Seattle again, I would definitely recommend this place!
56207	882274	8.0	9.0	4319342	It was a nice experience. The place was safe and the distance was cool with me (all within walking distance to the downtown attractions and the nightlife). The parking situation was terrible though (I had to pay for parking on one day and and took 30 minutes to find free parking on the second day). Nick & Nicole were very cool people and easily accessible during the whole trip being perfect  hosts.  I'd recommend this place with anyone. They will have everything ready right for you and even recommend places to go in the area.
56208	882274	8.0	9.0	4400107	"Our stay at Melrose Court was very pleasant. The location was excellent - close to the vibrant cafes, eateries and shops of Capitol Hill, and a short walk to downtown Seattle.
Our hosts were very attentive, thorough and flexible, and left us all the information we needed to make our short stay in Seattle a rewarding one!
Thanks again, we'll be back!"
56209	882274	8.0	9.0	4519214	"Checking in and leaving was effortless and streamlined, this was perfect for a short trip to Seattle. It was well equipped and would have been suitable for much longer-term stays. The location is excellent for work activities downtown and also for enjoying the nightlife and restaurants of Capitol Hill. 

"
56210	882274	8.0	9.0	4534798	perfect little place in the ideal location. This will be our new home when in Seattle. 
56211	882274	8.0	9.0	4569660	"Good location and easy to access, you may take some time to find the street parking but normally free, apartment is a little older than expect but is worth the price. 

It is recommended."
56212	882274	8.0	9.0	4607383	A very conveniently located, no-frills apartment. Clean and comfortable. The price can't be beat for the location!
56213	882274	8.0	9.0	4675063	"Nick's apartment was a great place to crash after long days of tourist activities and bar hopping.  Nick and Nicole were great at following-up with me before/during/after my stay.  It was my first time using airbnb and both Nick and Nicole made it a smooth experience.  
The best part about the apartment was the location.  The Lightrail was within reasonable walking distance and there are excellent bars/nightlife yards from the apartment.  "
56214	882274	8.0	9.0	4730377	Two friends and I stayed here for one night in May.  We arrived earlier than expected and Nicole (who works with Nick) offered to let us pick up our keys and drop off our bags early - so helpful!  Heading in to our stay the communication was great and once there Nicole was a treat to deal with had us all in smiles.  I wouldn't say this is five star accomodations but for the location and the price I really don't think it could be beat.  The spaces were clean and had everything we needed.  Located within walking distance to both downtown and Capitol Hill it really is the best of both worlds.  For only having one day in the city we covered a lot of ground thanks to this place.
56215	882274	8.0	9.0	4832282	"We had a wonderful stay at Melrose Court.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed working with Nick and Nicole after we made our reservation and while on our trip.  

The apartment is part of a a larger building with the apartment doors opening into a courtyard with beautiful trees.  Access to the building is restricted to one central door.

Prior to our arrival, we set up a time to meet with Nicole and get the keys and a tour.  Unfortunately, she was unavailable when we arrived but made sure that we had access to the keys (lock box) and knew how to get in.  This made check out a breeze as well.

The neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance of both downtown and capital hill. (It was a great place to stay for Camp Jitterbug.)  The binder in the living had good descriptions of things to do in Seattle and good places to eat. 

We enjoyed our stay!

"
56216	882274	8.0	9.0	4937777	Nicks's place is perfectly located within a 10 minute walk of downtown and close to many other amenities in Capitol Hill. It was clean and tidy with everything required so I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
56217	882274	8.0	9.0	4973546	Easy stay, centralized.
56218	882274	8.0	9.0	4990226	The apartment was just what I needed for a short, one night stay. Clean, in a nice location, and Nick and Nicole were great about responding quickly and keeping me updated (I was able to check-in early, which was super helpful). Had a great time!
56219	882274	8.0	9.0	5225124	"The location is ideal, within walking distance to Pike Place and other central places. It takes less than 10 minutes to walk to the station of ""Convention Place"" and a little bit longer to ""Westlake""(both are big stations) where we board buses to different  destinations, as well as the LightRail to the airport. 
The apartment has everything we need. Nicole is nice,  friendly and very helpful. Very easy to communicate with. Seattle was our last stop in the whole trip and our choice of the apartment was so right :)"
56220	882274	8.0	9.0	5286169	"Nick's Melrose Court 304 is a small but reasonably comfortable 1 bedroom unit, next to downtown Seattle at the western edge of Capitol Hill. Location-wise it doesn't get much better -- convenient to energetic Broadway, trendy Pike-Pine corridor, and nouveau upscale South Lake Union.

First off, the service was excellent. There are multiple points of contact in case you need anything. They were very flexible on check-in time when my timetable unexpectedly moved up by a few hours.

The basics -- kitchen, appliances, bath fixtures -- were clean. I would have preferred if all surfaces and furniture had been dusted, but I did arrive early. The only basics that could said to be lacking were a kitchen recycling bin and icecube trays.

Kitchen and bedroom appear to have been outfitted from Ikea, which was very nice. Clock radio. Stove with oven; drip coffeemaker; cutlery. No microwave.

The living room has used but good condition sofa, upholstered chair, desk, a 24-26"" CRT television with Roku box, and DSL wi-fi.

Bedroom and livingroom have been updated with laminate flooring. The bedroom closet doubles as storage for the unit and really ought to have a door instead of a curtain, but that's probably the responsibility of the building management and not Nick.

Security-wise the building felt safe. I found the lock on the main entrance to be a little tricky, but I suppose that makes it even more resistant to break-ins. I should note (as a lifelong resident of Seattle until 2012) the neighborhood is one of my favorites in town, and I rate it quite safe.

In summary, while the building dates from the early Sixties, 304 is in good shape, and Nick and his helpers do an admirable job. I definitely recommend Melrose Court 304 to others."
56221	882274	8.0	9.0	5365072	"Had a lovely stay at Nick's place this past weekend! We were there for a music festival and were there mainly to sleep, so the no-frills apartment suited our needs. The location couldn't be better and we were able to find parking in the neighborhood for our rental car. Nicole was a great liaison and was easily reachable by phone. She was also very helpful during the reservation process and even helped us figure out which bus routes we needed to take during our visit. 
There were 2 things that kept me from giving this place a 5 star review - 1) the internet connection was poor. We were hardly ever able to connect the roku box which was frustrating. 2) There's no door on the bedroom, which made having our 3rd guest awkward. If I had known there wasn't a door I might not have had a 3rd person, but since it's a 1br how could I have known? There's also no AC which is standard in Seattle (we were able to keep the place pretty cool) but this week it's going to be in the 90s and that could make it tough for some renters during the summer.
Overall I would/already have recommended this place to people sightseeing in Seattle. It is a comfortable crash pad, the service was friendly and nearly all of our needs were met. We will stay again if we come back! "
56222	882274	8.0	9.0	5395952	Apt is a bit dated. Had trouble with key opening front door to enter complex. Nicole communicated well. Apt was clean. Not sure I would return. 
56223	882274	8.0	9.0	5690696	I stayed for 11 days and found the apartment to be just as advertised; very convenient location, WiFi was fast and secure.  Nick and Nicole were excellent hosts, they answered all my questions promptly and were friendly and professional.  It was apparent they were well practiced on taking care of the property and their guests.
56224	882274	8.0	9.0	5713711	The apartment was great for my needs. It was clean and conveniently located. The host made check-in and check-out very easy. I'd definitely stay again!
56225	882274	8.0	9.0	5905809	"I stayed at Nicks place July 19th for a quick weekend road trip. The apartment was centrally located, and I was able to walk to Pike Place Maket, the EMP Museum, and all the great Bars and Restaurants on Capital Hill.

I was initially concerned with parking, but found a free site just north on Denny on the overpass in front of a few apartment complexes. Otherwise you will need to drive East on Pine to look for one of the paid parking sites. 

The apartment is in an older building, with a few young/hip tenants. It was great to use as a base for exploring the Hill & (website hidden) Bar was a great Thai restaurant for dinner, Skillet was a great Breakfast place with awesome Bloody Mary's, and the Pony Bar with it's outside Patio was a lively gay/mixed bar with plenty to see.

As this was my first AirBNB stay it turned out to be a pleasant experience. Thanks!"
56226	882274	8.0	9.0	6242273	My friends and I stayed at Nick's apartment for a weekend. Nick and Nicole were very good hosts and answered any questions my friends and I had in a timely manner. The apartment is a little dated but clean and fit three of us comfortably. The apartment is in a great looking. It is walking distance from Pike Place/the downtown area, Seattle Center, and everything else we went to see- no public transportation needed!
56227	882274	8.0	9.0	6455919	The apartment was on Capitol Hill and really close to a bus stop that can take you downtown,  less than 5 minutes walk to the stop. It was in a quiet area and walkable distance to a lot of good food places. We were out most of the day and were only back past midnight and left early in the morning but we never had to deal with any loud noises from the neighbors or from the street. Conveniently situated close to the freeway but it wasn't necessary for us as we took public transportation the whole week. Parking did seem difficult to find in that area though. The unit was clean and had everything we needed for our trip. For the price and location, it can't be beat. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and I would not hesitate to stay here again.
56228	882274	8.0	9.0	6727770	"Great location!  Nick was super responsive and helpful.  Would recommend to anyone!

Thanks!"
56229	882274	8.0	9.0	6769535	I only stayed at Nick's for one night.  The place was extremely convenient (right off the freeway, and close to bars, downtown, ect.) and it was clean and quiet.  Great spot if you're in town and need a spot to rest your head!
56230	882274	8.0	9.0	6891059	"The experience was good overall, the place has a great location and the apt is very comfortable. Also the availability of a good Wi Fi connection is a definitely a plus. The problem is the cleanliness. I understand that the concept here is that each guest leave the place clean, but you can't expect guests to remove the dust from the furnitures or make a deep clean in the bathroom. For us, it was a bit shocking find the bathroom so dirty... looks like it wasn't cleaned in weeks! Me and my wife needed about an hour of cleaning to felt comfortable. 

As an advice to Nick, I think that is really important that you consider a deep clean at least once a week.

We had a very good stay in the apt anyway, but I think this matter definitely has to be revised for future guests."
56231	882274	8.0	9.0	7005600	"Great location for this apartment, 10 minutes walk from the Convention Center. Place was clean and I was given clear instructions on how to grab the key to gain access to the apartment on my own.

I've seen bigger kitchens, if your main goal is to cook for yourself, it offers most things you'd need, though the stove has seen better days.

Recommended."
56232	882274	8.0	9.0	7296883	Awesome location - can walk to so much!  We walked to Pike's Market, tons of restaurants, coffee shops, pubs and shopping. Parking was free but you just had to find a spot.  As others have said - not the cleanest place but so conveniently located and the price was great that we overlooked that.
56233	882274	8.0	9.0	7324650	Location, size and amenities were great but the place could definitely use a deep cleaning.  We were hoping to do more cooking but the kitchen was lacking. Nicole was nice and even let us store our luggage before check-in.  Would recommend for people who will be out a lot.
56234	882274	8.0	9.0	7573654	"We stayed one night at Nick's place, using the lock box to get in so we never met anyone. That was easy and painless. Unfortunately we chose the apartment specifically because it said there was laundry, not realizing that that meant ""at the complex"", not ""in the apartment"". We were quite disappointed as we'd been out backpacking and had lots of laundry to do, but were too tired to track down the facility and sit there waiting. Also, parking was definitely tricky (as advertised) - we arrived on a Sunday night and ended up quite a ways away -- if thats an issue for you I'd suggset somewhere else. The apartment was fine, with a nice big bed and everything we needed for that one night - close to a lot of fun things, too. If you're not looking for anything fancy and are on foot, this would be a good place to crash while visiting."
56235	882274	8.0	9.0	7618680	"Location is perfect, very convenience to all places we planned for visiting in the city. Also very easy to find, we found it's easier to follow the PINE street instead of the PIKE street as instructed though.
Nicole, who's taking care of the place is very helpful and response to our request very quickly.
The cleanness of the place is fairly OK, although the couch can really use some wash.
Overall, the place is a very good stay."
56236	882274	8.0	9.0	7690832	"The apartment was everything that we were looking for! The complex was in an ideal location- close enough to downtown to walk, close to great restaurants and bars, etc. Nicole was really easy to get a hold of and extremely friendly. The check-in/out process was quick and easy as well.

The only negative was that the light in the bedroom was tricky. Something had to be plugged into the outlet and wiggled just right in order to get the light to turn on. Other than that, everything was great. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."
56237	882274	8.0	9.0	7939031	Nick was out of town so his friend Nicole assisted us. My wife and I moved to Seattle on a whim and needed a place to stay last minute the first night we arrived. Nicole was very quick to respond and set us up with this apartment. It's a great full-size apartment right in the heart of Capital Hill. Perfect location for walking/biking to everything in the city! We only stayed for one night but we had a nice sleep and were able to make coffee and breakfast before leaving. The wifi is super fast and parking wasn't a problem for us at all. I'd recommend this stay for others.
56238	882274	8.0	9.0	7966772	"The location of the apartment and the communication with Nick/Nicole were perfect.

However, we were disappointed by the overall condition of the apartment as everything was dusty and full of hair from previous guests. You cannot expect every guest to remove the dust and to clean the whole apartment. 

"
56239	882274	8.0	9.0	8022446	"Tiny little apartment in an awesome location. Whether you want to go downtown or hang out in the hip Capital Hill 'hood, this place is within walking distance from both. Check in and check out was super easy — didn't even have to see a person due to the lockbox. The property manager was super communicative and gave thorough instructions.

The apartment itself was furnished decently, but overall was slightly rough around the edges. The bathroom was tiny and the old plumbing and fixtures didn't make for the most pleasant of showers. My main complaint was that it was all a bit dusty, especially in the bathroom. But bonuses were: The kitchen had a brand new and clean fridge, and the mattress seemed very new and was comfy enough with a foam topper.

Ultimately, if you value location and convenience over comfort, this is a great place to stay at and very reasonable price. "
56240	882274	8.0	9.0	8057298	Apartment was perfect for what we needed. Price was right.
56241	882274	8.0	9.0	8182201	Perfect location. Walking distance to many great local coffee shops, and restaurants. There's a market up the hill with incredible sandwiches, made with locally sourced foods. Great place to stay.
56242	882274	8.0	9.0	8188850	Space was clean and comfortable. Great location!
56243	882274	8.0	9.0	8217968	Excellent experience. Easy check-in and a great spot for a quick trip to Seattle. Plenty to do nearby in the neighborhood. Will be sure come back in future trips to the city. Thanks!
56244	882274	8.0	9.0	8252099	Great experience. 
56245	882274	8.0	9.0	8287875	Apartment exactly as advertised. Simple, convenient, and clean.
56246	882274	8.0	9.0	8365263	Convenient, comfortable, and easy. Thank you!
56247	882274	8.0	9.0	8464965	Clean, comfy, and perfect location!
56248	882274	8.0	9.0	8512896	so clean! super comfy! great host! great price! awesome location! 
56249	882274	8.0	9.0	8599510	Cozy apartment in an amazing location between downtown and Capitol Hill.  Bed and overall stay very comfortable.  Key pickup and check out couldn't have been easier.  Great deal, highly recommended!
56250	882274	8.0	9.0	8689844	The space was clean and cozy; it was exactly as pictured.  It was right on the edge of downtown and Capitol Hill, and it was relatively easy to walk everywhere or find public transit.  Messaging with Nick and Nicole made the trip so much easier!  They were able to accommodate my late arrival into town, and were willing to let me keep my luggage in the building after my flight was delayed 4 hours.  Will definitely check this place out again if I am visiting Seattle!  :) 
56251	882274	8.0	9.0	8760353	I never actually met the hosts as it was a single serve apartment and we arrived later then we had originally intended, but the key was waiting for us in a lockbox and the apartment was totally cozy for our evening sojourn. They provide all the basic amenities and the bed is rly comfortable. The apartment is very conveniently located. The price and location alone sell this airbnb for what you come home too. :) Thanks Nick for contributing to our awesome weekend in Seattle.
56252	882274	8.0	9.0	9095485	Very professional.  A credit to Airbnb.  I definitely recommend staying at Nick's place.  Location was great. Apartment was perfect. Parking was tricky but I always found one.  Great restaurants in the area too.  Thanks Nick
56253	882274	8.0	9.0	9389849	We had tickets to attend a theater performance in the area, and this was a very convenient place to stay.  Basic but comfortable, and close to both downtown and Capitol Hill neighborhoods.
56254	882274	8.0	9.0	9961985	Nick's place was ideal for walking around downtown Seattle. There's a ton of restaurants in the area, and its easy walking to the waterfront and Pike Place. Be aware that if you have 3 people staying, the pullout couch/bed is not the most comfortable - it has a bar that kinda digs into your back. Also, the parking is quite difficult to find during some parts of the day (like mentioned in the details of the description) especially if there is a large event going on downtown.
56255	882274	8.0	9.0	9999070	Like others, I had no one helping me check in or out (which is fine; until recently, I lived a couple miles away).  Ridiculously awesome location, and it's even better for the price!  Will definitely be back when I'm in town.
56256	882274	8.0	9.0	10020445	No fluff and frills accommodation but in an ideal location. We did not rent a car and were able to walk to downtown in 10 mins and within touring the city, we either walked or took the bus.  Nicole greeted us at the door and allowed us to drop off our luggage in the storage unit. She provided us with instructions for us to check in later the evening. The place was somewhat tight for 3 people but doable. If you're looking for a safe and ideal place to stay, I would suggest staying here for the price!
56257	882274	8.0	9.0	10418638	"The location is absolutely perfect. The bed was extremely comfortable and seems fairly new. Check-in and out was really easy. The only complaint was the couch- it looks filthy and kind of smells mildewy on one side- not a huge issue as it's ignorable but I wouldn't want to sleep on it as a pull out bed.

I'd definitely stay here again next trip (though possibly in a different unit)."
56258	882274	8.0	9.0	10566829	"This location is great. You are going to be very close to downtown and to a lot of great pubs and hipster bars. On our final night we had drinks at the ""Knee High Stocking Company"", which is right across the street. One important note, free parking on Friday and Saturday night seemed impossible to find. If you are driving you can save a lot of time by just paying for parking a few blocks away from the apartment.

I would definitely stay here again the next time I am in Seattle."
56259	882274	8.0	9.0	10772905	Great location. Great price. Comfortable bed. Thank you! I will use your listing again. 
56260	882274	8.0	9.0	10887556	My family and I enjoyed our stay. The place was clean, convenient and quiet. The only negative I have is that parking is kind of tough, so you might have to circle around everytime you want to park. Other than that I would recommend this place to all who would like to be near the all the action on Capitol Hill and close to downtown.
56261	882274	8.0	9.0	11094573	Melrose Court 304 worked perfectly for us.  Check-in was straight-forward and convenient. Location was really great, right on the edge of Capitol Hill.  The apartment wasn't fancy but that's not what I look for.  It was  clean, comfortable,  and very quiet.  I would highly recommend.  Nick's friend Nicole was very helpful in the planning, booking, and arrival.
56262	882274	8.0	9.0	11258071	The apartment was perfect for a place to sleep and get ready. I honestly spent very limited time in it, but it was quiet and had a great location with a short walk to basically everything. Nicole was very friendly and available to answer questions whenever I had them. I would definitely stay here again.
56263	882274	8.0	9.0	11294419	"Fantastic location!!!!  
Building is a bit old but unit was clean, very confortable bed and it has all the basics you need for short stay in Seattle.  
I book the place within hours of arriving and Nicole's response was quick, helpful and efficient. Thank you so much!!!! Will be back for sure."
56264	882274	8.0	9.0	11393249	Nice place at a decent price. The hosts were very good at communicating and was available throughout the day. It was very easy to get in and get out of the place, given that I didn't have to schedule a meeting time with the host for check-in and check-out. Overall a good experience. The only thing that you should be prepared for is that the sofa bed isn't very comfortable. It works, I still fell asleep on it and what not. The normal bed was much better. The heaters worked, neighborhood was on the most part quiet.  
56265	882274	8.0	9.0	11475424	This apartment is all about location. There are a ton of great coffee shops and bars literally around the corner, and downtown and the waterfront is also a short walk away. The unit smelled a bit like cigarette smoke and felt humid, but overall met our needs comfortably. 
56266	882274	8.0	9.0	11551569	The apartment is in a great neighbourhood and I'd say a 15 minute walk to pike place, it was small but good enough for us, the only downside was that the only bathroom in the suite was in the bedroom so the person who stayed on the pull out couch had to come through the bedroom to use it.
56267	882274	8.0	9.0	11677638	"You get what you pay for.  After a long day of travel, my friend and I were ready to clean up and sleep!  Unfortunately, the restroom's light did not work when we arrived and we found the pullout couch to be pretty filthy.  The springs under the pullout couch did not support the mattress, so we had to take the sofa cushion to provide additional support.  Minimal accommodations, but there is a fully equipped kitchen, city maps, guidebooks, plus Shampoo and Body wash in the shower.  

We did not get to meet the host, but Nicole who was helping manage the apartment was very kind and helpful.  She answered every question we had promptly and attempted to address any issues we had as quickly as she could.  Thank you Nicole!
"
56268	882274	8.0	9.0	11984676	"Communication was great in regards to getting there. With all of the information provided it was very easy to get in and situated. with that said the quality of the apartment and the help to resolve issues was not of high quality. 

On the first night there we found out that the stove did not work; we were able to contact Nicole who helped us finish cooking our meal and said that she would let the landlord know about it immediately so it could be fixed ""tomorrow"". The stove was broken for two and a half days by the time we were leaving the apartment to go home; while leaving we ran into the landlord who said that he had just been notified about the stove by Nicole. During the two and a half days we were not able to contact Nicole so we ended up having to go to a local Target to buy a burner so that we could cook our food since we did not know what was going on with the apartment."
56269	882274	8.0	9.0	12209325	"Let me start by saying this is my first time on Airbnb I don't have any previous experiences to compare my Seattle trip to. 

Communication:
Good but in need of improvements. I wished the instructions were sent before having to ask for them myself the day of needing them. However, Nicole always kept an open connection and was very nice and accommodating. Everything was as stated and expectations were met. Instructions clear.

Location: 
Very good. Within walking distance (10-30min) to spots of interest and also easy to get to from the Sea-Tac. Near Space needle, Chinatown, downtown,  pikes place, and amidst a popular part of town: Capitol Hill. Safe neighborhood. 

Apt:
For the price, very nice. Has all the necessities. Nothing fancy, but it's cozy and more than I need to be comfortable. Cool Muhammed Ali posters. Gets cold, but heaters were slightly helpful. The bed was very comfy for two, soft and warm. Felt CLEAN overall.

As a side note, the stove was not working until the very last days of my vacay. Unfortunately, it was very inconvenient bc my boyfriend and I have some food sensitivities and thus prefer to cook at home. When we mentioned it, Nicole was polite about it and eventually did fix the issue, but like I said, inconvenient. I realize things like this happen so I got over it and the apt is still worth the price even without the stove. (new occupants should not have a prob since it's a new stove) 

Overall:
I thought the apt was a GREAT DEAL and a good haven for my Seattle trip. "
56270	882274	8.0	9.0	12336731	"We stayed for 3 nights and were really pleased with the location of the apartment - it was great being able to walk everywhere and not having to use public transport! The apartment is basic but is fine for a place to sleep for the night. Nicole was really helpful and was quick responding to our queries. We would recommend! 
"
56271	882274	8.0	9.0	12446440	His place was just what we were looking for: simple and affordable, in a great location! 
56272	882274	8.0	9.0	12656815	Nicks apt was perfectly located to explore Cap Hill and Downtown. Seattle is very walkable from this point, convenient to transit, restaurants, drinks and etc. The building sort of looks like a motel, was clean, safe and secure. Washing machines on site worked great, and Nicole arranged for us to leave 2 bags for 2 days after checkout. This was a great economy find!
56273	882274	8.0	9.0	12721033	"I thought this place was great overall!  Nicole deals with Nick's listing and she was very responsive via text and calling.  I'd say that overall, for the price and location, this was a wonderful deal!  It is a compact place in the heart of the city and allowed us to walk everywhere.  It was neat and clean and perfect for us because we just wanted to hang our hats somewhere and sleep after a day of exploring.  However, there were a couple of issues.  
Upon arriving, there was no key available to us upon check-out, as arranged.  A quick call to Nicole resolved that, but it would take about 2 hours.  A storage locker was available and very helpful.  However, if we had needed to settle in as arranged and didn't have the luxury of being able to explore, this may have been an issue.  Next, there was always a damp smell in the apt and we were advised to keep the windows open as much as possible.  We did, which really did help, but since we weren't home most of the day, we didn't want to keep the windows open, even at the smallest opening setting.  There was a bit of mold on the ceiling of the bedroom.  Finally, our internet/tv was sporadic, though stayed on during our last day.  
I would say that the above issues were easily resolved and really weren't an issue.  The people who deal with the apt are responsive.  You'll be happy with the place if you're just looking for somewhere to sleep which isn't unreasonably priced and in the middle of the city.  It was overall (despite the mold) very clean, neat, and simple.  I would definitely recommend this place."
56274	882274	8.0	9.0	12880066	"Great location! Nicole was pretty good with correspondence and we had no troubles finding or accessing the apartment on arrival. It's pretty basic but pretty clean. We did notice a bit of mold in the corner of the bedroom ceiling but hopefully that will be addressed soon. The TV worked well with the digital box and the bed was super comfy. 


"
56275	882274	8.0	9.0	13077749	Overall, this apartment is a great deal for its price. The check-in/key pick-up was very easy and the check-in time was flexible. Parking on the other hand was a bit of a pain point; we got lucky one night and parked on the streets but opted for a paid lot on the other night. As other guests have mentioned, the location of the apartment is perfect. It is a reasonable walk to both downtown and the popular capitol hill areas (or a very short uber/lyft ride away). Lastly, the apartment itself was a bit smaller than expected, but we didn't mind as we were mostly out. I would definitely recommend this apartment! 
56276	882274	8.0	9.0	13194780	Nicole who manages the listing was very responsive and provided clear instructions on the check in process. There were no problems finding the place or getting access. The location is great! There are not many hotels in the area and I found it conveniently located. The sofa in the living room was not very comfortable to sit on for any length of time. The listing, as well as the book of guest information in the apartment, stated laundry soap could be found in the apartment and there was none. Since my stay was so short, I did not contact Nicole to ask about it but was counting on doing a load of laundry since I'd already been on the road a week before checking in here.  There was quite a bit of street noise throughout the night, but it is Seattle. If you are a light sleeper, you probably already travel with earplugs. Also, there is no microwave here.
56277	882274	8.0	9.0	14193527	The location of the apartment is very convenient，also it is pretty safe, I lived with my parents, so I slept on sofa bed in the living room. Actually the windows can't block noise and the blind windows can't stop the light from the corridor. So I suggest two people to live in this apartment will be better. 
56278	882274	8.0	9.0	14341366	"Great stay at Nicks place (304 Melrose Courts).  Its not high end.  Small and sparse.  But it was clean. Bed was very comfortable. And the location and price were both great. You can walk straight down Pine street to the wharf and all its sites.  And Capital Hill is very cool.  Lots of great shops and bars, etc.   Good communication throughout.
All in all a very positive experience.  "
56279	882274	8.0	9.0	14489197	"My Gf & I had a great time! From the instructions on how to get to the apt to where to eat and places to see, they were the best of hosts! We will definitely rent this property again. 

The place is located on the border of Capitol Hill and downtown. We caught a movie. Saw Bruce Lee's grave site, the space needle, glass garden. Pike's market. All the while we took public transit. Very efficient. Cheers to Nick & Nicole!
"
56280	882274	8.0	9.0	14685269	Nick's place was a perfect fit for our stay. Great location, 15 min walk from the space needle, 10 min from downtown and light rail station. We where in town to run the rock-n-roll marathon. We had a great time and a worry free stay. 
56281	882274	8.0	9.0	14767051	The entire experience was simple and easy. Let ourselves in with a lock box and checked out the same way. The place is clean and orderly. Everything is spelled out clearly. And it is in a great part of town!!! Many bars and restaurants within walking distance. 
56282	882274	8.0	9.0	15040229	Great neighborhood and location! Nicole provided lots of information about how to get to/from the apartment and everything we needed to have a comfortable stay. Thanks!
56283	882274	8.0	9.0	15149520	Nicole (who helps Nick manage the apartment) was very friendly and prompt to respond! We used the locked storage to hold our bags before checkin, and Nicole made it a very smooth process. Overall, the apartment was quaint, clean, and had good furnishings. Thanks!
56284	882274	8.0	9.0	15307595	"The place was perfect for my sister and I. It was small, but it turned out to be just like how it was described on the listing. We really enjoyed the neighborhood and liked how central it was to everywhere we wanted to go. 

Pros: Cost, location, super comfy bed

Cons: We had the windows in the bedroom open at night to let some air in and at times it was quiet loud, but it was still bearable. Also, there was an iron, but we couldn't find an ironing board, but again, not a huge issue. "
56285	882274	8.0	9.0	15457053	Nicole, who handles Nick's place, was great. She was very accommodating in letting us store luggage before and after our stay. Although we didn't get the chance to meet her, she was easy to contact and answered all our questions. The location can not be beat! Melrose Market is steps away. Short walk to Pike Place. Great value.
56286	882274	8.0	9.0	15920133	The apartment was in a good location and clean. The check in process was simple and the apartment was as advertised and looked just like the pictures. Overall it was a great stay. 
56287	882274	8.0	9.0	16198801	Place is very well kept, everything was very clean.  Both the bedroom bed and couch bed are very comfortable.
56288	882274	8.0	9.0	16640401	"Simple set-up in a great location near all Capitol Hill food + drink spots. Complex seemed a bit ""well-worn"" but is probably hard to beat for the price. Nick's instructions for accessing the apt via an on-site lockbox were great, and the cleaning lady was arriving just as we were leaving and was very friendly. "
56289	882274	8.0	9.0	17152079	"Nick's apartment is a good crash pad for a couple out exploring the city. It's just up the hill from downtown, and near all of the Capitol Hill amenities. We enjoyed the easy transit and walking access (walking if you're okay with a hill).

Simple apartment located in a building that is very much of the era it was built."
56290	882274	8.0	9.0	17373374	The apartment was nice and as advertised.  It is in a great location (though parking is tricky as he mentions).  I did not meet him but need to contact him regarding the cleaning person being in the unit when we checked-in and he responded quickly (and pleasantly).  The only issue was that the Wi-Fi was really slow and we were not able to watch something on our computer after a long day out and about.  I would recommend this place to others.
56291	882274	8.0	9.0	17504307	"The instructions from Nicole (apartment manager) were clear and easy to follow.  The neighborhood was fine with plenty of food/drink options nearby. There was a bit of noise from the nearby cross streets but we didn't plan on sleeping in or spending much time in the apt, so it didn't pose a problem. The walk from the nearest light rail station, Westpark stop, was approximately 15 minutes.   Overall, we had a pleasant stay in a a convenient location.
"
56292	882274	8.0	9.0	17756124	"Nicole, who is the point of contact for Nick's guests, was great. She was extremely responsive and helpful. When we arrived, there was a binder with the house policies and suggestions of Nick's favorite places to go in Seattle.

It was great to have the place to ourselves, and the location was ideal. It was a fifteen-minute walk to downtown, and we walked to Pike Place Market our first morning there. There's so much else to do within walking distance—food, cocktails, and the barcade around the corner were all great. (You can walk to the Elliott Bay Book Company!)

There's a market a block away (City Market, at Bellevue and Olive Way) where you can pick up essentially anything extra you could need here, like extra toilet paper or coffee.

The apartment was a little stuffy, so we kept the windows open and used the fan in the bedroom. This is obviously a matter of personal preference, though. It wasn't overwhelmingly hot.

All in all, the place was great and the hosts were too. Highly recommended!"
56293	882274	8.0	9.0	19013817	The apartment was lovely! Great neighborhood, very clean accommodations, overall a great night spent in Seattle! We were able to walk everywhere- dinner, a cozy bar for dessert and a drink, and even a breakfast place when we woke up! The apartment was perfect for a couple. Thank you Nick! 
56294	882274	8.0	9.0	19728514	"In a neighborhood of nice apartment buildings, this building was quite run-down.  Inside the apartment, new flooring throughout offset the overall shabbiness.  Neither living room or bedroom windows had curtains, the venetian blinds were broken, so we were pretty much on view to neighboring residents once it got dark.  The sofa springs were shot, so when we sat on it our bottoms were nearly on the floor; the black and white chair featured in the online ad was quite comfortable.  The kitchen contained the standard coffee maker, but no coffee.  We've stayed in airbnb apartments in other US cities and in Paris and never before had to go out and buy our own coffee.  The info email said there was laundry soap under the sink; there wasn't any.  The fridge had a nice freezer but no ice cube trays.  Worst of all, there was no backstock of toilet paper.  Two of us checked in for 6 nights and we were provided with one partial roll of toilet paper.  
All this after we had trouble with our check-in.  We were not met.  We had an earlier email saying we  would receive access instructions 48 - 72 hours before arrival.  In fact the email was sent on the morning of our arrival, so we had no way to access it while we were on the road.  When we arrived and couldn't gain access, I called the contact phone number and got voice mail and had to wait a while to receive instructions to get in."
56295	882274	8.0	9.0	19824400	"I stayed with two other travel companions and it was exactly as described. Location was extremely close to popular landmarks - it took us about 15 minutes to walk to Pike's. Nick/Nicole have thoughtfully put together a binder of nearby places to grab food, as well as maps/brochures, and a gallon of drinking water!

As others have stated, you get what you pay for in terms of size. The bathroom is located off of the bedroom, so hopefully you're traveling with friends you feel comfortable enough with to walk through their temporary room in the middle of the night when nature calls. The pull-out couch was fine to sleep on for a couple nights. No A/C, but plenty of other tenants left their doors open while they were inside. We did the same, and it cooled down the unit fairly quickly.

This was our first excursion to Seattle, and we mostly used the apartment to sleep and store our belongings, which it was perfect for. Nicole is extremely well-organized and provides detailed instructions for anything you require assistance with. There is a storage unit onsite that we used to store our belongings after check-out and before our flight home. Overall, the description and reviews painted an accurate picture of what to expect. Remember that you get what you pay for in terms of luxury - we opted for bare minimum in order to spend more on food! :)"
56296	882274	8.0	9.0	20137286	"This is nice and convenient location if you are attending conference in convention center or wish to visit downtown. Both are within walking distance and yet the apartment is in quiet location. It will take about 10 min to walk. However walk is up the hill.

Apartment is good. There are no complains. Its upkeep could be improved a little but that does not mean one should not consider it. This is not a adverse comment, it is just a suggestion. 

Nick was quick to respond to all my sms request.  Though by nature I prefer personal meetings and voice calls. This is again personal preference.

From the airport I took a Light rail to down town. Nick had given excellent guidelines. 

If you decide to cook etc. then request for more vessels/cutlery etc.

If I have to stay again and purpose is to visit town whole day I would choose it. It is value for money."
56297	882274	8.0	9.0	20468997	I stayed here for 2 nights over the weekend.  I had excellent communication with Nicole (Nick's friend who manages the property) prior to my arrival.  The apartment was great and exactly as described.  The location can't be beat - 15 min walk to Pike Market, 2 min to Pine/Pike St.  Lots of cafes, restaurants, and pubs in the area.  Overall a great experience, definitely would stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle!
56298	882274	8.0	9.0	20960817	Apartment is pretty no frills - but it works and you can't beat the price/location. The place is in a fun neighborhood close to some great shops/restaurants. Also walkable to all of downtown/Pikes Place/Space Needle. I would definitely recommend it and would certainly stay again. 
56299	882274	8.0	9.0	21284825	Good value for what we paid. Apartment is in a great location and within walking distance of majors attractions, etc. Apartment is ideal for 1-2 people. The host, Nicole, was easily accessible and arranged for the storage of our luggage. 
56300	882274	8.0	9.0	21380028	"The apartment is well situated, close to Seattle downtown. A good place to visit the city! A good choice of restaurants and fancy places around the flat.
Nicole's is very reactive and very helpful!

There is a laundry in the building - quite convenient - don't forget to have some detergent with you if you plan to use it!

However, the place is quite noisy (I recommend that you bring along earplugs). It is also noteworthy that there is no door between the living room and the bedroom. It is essentially a student place so do not expect more than that. But I think this is in line with the low price tag for the area."
56301	882274	8.0	9.0	21468512	"Five star location! Great neighborhood. We felt safe walking to downtown and around the area with our child. 

Nick (and Nicole) communicated great. The descriptions of the place is acurate. The place was easy to find and the step-by-step instruction to check in was helpful. 

As some of other reviews states, upkeep can be improved. I would have given 5 stars only if they had a set of newer fresher linens. 

But again, the location cannot be beat. The place was adequate and a great deal for what we used it for - just a place to sleep after all day sightseeing. Thank you very much! "
56302	882274	8.0	9.0	21595136	Really great location.  The major tourist attractions can all be walked to in under 20 minutes and the Capital Hill neighborhood has plenty to offer.  Parking was the only downside (no dedicated spot), but we were able to find street parking close by both nights.
56303	882274	8.0	9.0	21742196	Nick's apartment was the perfect base for me and my partner while in Seattle. It's literally a few minutes from downtown Seattle (we're fast walkers!) and Westlake station. The apartment was a great size, was very clean and had all the amenities you'd want from an airbnb place, including recs for good eateries in a handy little folder. Nicole, who handles Nick's apartment, was wonderfully accommodating and very responsive. We particularly appreciated the secure luggage storage facility that was made available to us on our last day, on which our departing flight was very late at night. I'd definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back next time I'm in Seattle!
56304	882274	8.0	9.0	21849122	It was a great location, very walkable which was great since we didn't have a car. Nick was quick to respond during the reservation process and our stay there. 
56305	882274	8.0	9.0	22020037	Had a great time! Thanks Nick. Will definitely come back.
56306	882274	8.0	9.0	22394942	Overall this place worked really well for me and my wife.  The location was unbeatable as we were less than a mile from most places we wanted to go.  We did have a car and parking for the most part was not a problem around the area.  Nicole gave great instructions on how to get into the apartment and checking in and out was very easy.  There were some negatives including the mold growing on the edges of the ceiling at the front and back of the apartment and the also the cleanliness could be slightly better.  Again these issues were not a deal breaker for us but we would have preferred to have been given a heads up prior to making a decision on where to stay.  The nice thing is I believe these issues are easily correctable and the next people renting should hopefully have an upgraded experience.   Overall the place was very good and with a few changes here and there it could really be great.
56307	882274	8.0	9.0	22740868	Had a wonderful time in Seattle. Apartment is located within 15mins walking distance of the space needle and pike market. 
56308	882274	8.0	9.0	22945558	Great location Capitol Hill that is walking distance from the light rail if you're coming from SeaTac.  Clean, dormitory-like apartment.  The bed was comfortable and we definitely used the extra duvet due to the unexpected cold weather.  We didn't hear a peep from neighbors either. Right near the Melrose Market, which was great. A good stay! 
56309	882274	8.0	9.0	23241122	Host was very thorough with arrival instructions and communicative about the location ahead of the process. Very easy to find and gain access to the property. The apartment was very clean and the location can't be beat. Highly recommend this property.
56310	882274	8.0	9.0	23491029	The hosts were so nice:) they answered every questions what I had. The place was clean and the area was really convenience. My friends who from Seattle they said this area is their dream place to stay at.  if I go back to Seattle I will definitely go back to stay this place for sure.
56311	882274	8.0	9.0	23609965	Great location. Apartment was fine for the price. Hassle free, easy and a great deal for Capitol Hill. 
56312	882274	8.0	9.0	24732319	The unit and the building were quite run down but it was a great location and an easy walk to downtown and capitol hill. The place could have been cleaner- there was a thick layer of dust bunnies on the floor of the closet in the bedroom, the shower had a constant leak the host said was going to get fixed during our stay but I don't think this got done, and the sheets for the pull out couch did not fit. The pull out mattress was quite coil-y and very uneven (it dipped up and down in places), so would definitely not recommend 3 people stay here. The Roku box was also nice. But overall, for the price I would have rather paid a bit more and just stayed at a hotel.
56313	882274	8.0	9.0	25083837	Location is good. We are only 10 minutes' drive area from Pike Place Market and the Seattle Art Museum. The apartment itself is not very clean though. The couch in particular is pretty dirty and we cover the cushion with linens before sitting on it.
56314	882274	8.0	9.0	25162492	The location of the apartment was as convenient as described. My friends and I were able to go everywhere we wanted without a problem. We only slept there so it worked for our needs
56315	882274	8.0	9.0	25623257	Great space for a weekend trip. We were with in walking distance to so many great restaurants and it was only a ten minute walk to downtown. The bed was super comfy, and after a long day on the city, we wound down with a cup of tea and some Netflix. Nick's place made our stay in Seattle very enjoyable.  We've already recommended to friends! 
56316	882274	8.0	9.0	25716415	The apartment was a little old, but the location is great. The heating system is old too. There are one bad and one sofa bed. But because the sofa bed is broken, 3 of us had to squeeze in one bed. Also, the beaker tripped for several times. But the Host is really nice. She answered any question I had even if it's late night. She also gave us very detailed direction to get the apartment. 
56317	882274	8.0	9.0	26162375	Really kind and concerned host, he was always keeping an eye on the process. Everything was perfectly fine.
56318	882274	8.0	9.0	26321924	The apartment was super cozy, and getting access to the room went without the a hitch. There was consistent communication from the time that I booked the place, and up until I got there which was extremely reassuring. The place is in such a great spot of Seattle, access to so many places (bars, food, and downtown). It was quiet in the evening, which was also really nice. I would definitely stay with Nick again should I ever find myself in Seattle. 
56319	882274	8.0	9.0	26595918	"Nick did a great job of insuring I knew how to find the apt and how to get in. The listing is accurate in terms of looks and what it provides. It's a pretty bare minimum unit, but great for those who are not looking for much during their stay. If you're focused on being out and about then this place will do the trick. 

The location is PRIME in terms of getting around all over mayor parts of Seattle primarily by foot. Could not have picked a better location for that. If you visit here, be sure to walk around the neighborhood you're in, as there are some amazing small restaurants, bars, coffee houses.

The place is a lot older than you may think as it's in a pretty classic Seattle neighborhood. The place overall could use a few touch ups in the bathroom/shower to really make it ""cozy"". 

Thanks Nick for a great stay!"
56320	882274	8.0	9.0	26761233	Clear and thorough directions. Easy stay. Everything was as pictured. Good location, close to downtown and walkable to Pike Place. Would stay here again!
56321	882274	8.0	9.0	26889974	"Nicole's space (I never dealt with Nick during my stay) was great way to begin my first visit to Seattle. Location was right off the freeway entrance making it was to reach her space. My first impression of the area was the parking. Parking was very tricky around the location. Everything is metered and very compact. Make sure you come as a pro at parallel parking. Upon entering, I then noticed all the posters on the wall which was very motivational. It's always a good reminder that we can always become better than we were yesterday. Amenities were very limited; A TV with access to Netflix for entertainment, an empty fridge, comfortable bed, and a shower with less than spectacular shampoo & conditioner and body wash. Her instructions can feel very micromanaging but rules are rules. 
But nevertheless, I was here specifically for the location. Capitol Hill is the center of the lively part of the city and I wanted to be apart of it. 24 hour fitness was a few blocks away, as well as all of the food and bars in the area. Capitol Hill has some of the best foodie joints and coffee IMO. But that's for all of you to find for yourselves ;) 
All-in-all I had a positive experience. Would I come back? Well, that's for me to decide another day. "
56322	882274	8.0	9.0	27046106	"Nick's apartment was a great place for a short stay in Seattle. It is perfectly located in Capitol Hill and makes a great base from which to explore the city. 

The only real draw back is that if you need two beds, the pull-out couch can be a bit uncomfortable. The bed in the bedroom was perfectly comfortable, though. "
56323	882274	8.0	9.0	27434428	I like the cozy apartment, bed is soooo comfortable maybe a bad thing combined with the rain... You won't get out of bed! Locations is perfect - between Capitol Hill and downtown is like been in both places. Never took bus which I love. 
56324	882274	8.0	9.0	27636698	The location is AMAZING and totally worth it just for that, but I wouldn't stay here if you think you're going to spend much time there. The apartment isn't very well kept up (generally clean, but moldy and old electric/windows/furnishings/plumbing), and the living room is super drafty and you can really hear traffic noise. All the basics are there (coffee maker, etc) but Nicole was pretty checked out. We needed a second set of keys and didn't get them until our 3rd day, and then it was only 1 of the keys we needed. I'd recommend it for a couple that's looking to explore. Probably wouldn't stay here again though.
56325	882274	8.0	9.0	28249519	The place was perfect for what we were looking for in a room. One of its best qualities is the location, it's unbeatable. Just a few-minute walk to the center of downtown, and in a great neighborhood. We rarely heard any noises from the neighbors, which is always a plus. The apartment itself is cozy and the bed is extremely comfortable, I slept like a rock every single night. If you're looking for a place that is totally up-to-date (you can tell the building is old), this probably isn't for you, but it wasn't bothersome to me. All in all, I would definitely stay at this location again on my next visit to Seattle! 
56326	882274	8.0	9.0	28469003	Perfect location, we parked the car and walked straight down Pine to the heart of downtown Seattle. 
56327	882274	8.0	9.0	28601373	Nick's apartment is in a great location. It was an easy walk to Pike's Market and other tourist attractions. The apartment was clean. The sofa bed needs to be repaired or replaced. A few of the springs are missing. Nick doesn't charge for a third guest, so this might be a case of getting what you pay for. The shower works, but the water comes out in a single flow like a garden hose. These were small inconveniences for a nice place to stay in a great location. 
56328	882274	8.0	9.0	28667374	"The place was affordable and in a good location. 

Advertised as two beds but one was a pull out sofa. Realllly worn in. And the sheets did not fit. That was a bigger issue because the mattress pad had rust. 

So, affordable and great location but not good for two"
56329	882274	8.0	9.0	28861364	Overall, our stay was pleasant. I really appreciated the fast communication from Nicole and the friendly staff we came across. There were a few hiccups along the way but they were corrected. Would have loved to have someone on site to speak to personally, but I loved the location and the price was great. 
56330	882274	8.0	9.0	29387279	The description of the place was very accurate It was clean and close to any amenities that I needed. I will be staying there again
56331	882274	8.0	9.0	30084343	 Nick's apartment is a simple and clean space. It is exactly as described. It is walking distance (10-15mins) to the centre of town. One bed and one pull out sofa was enough for three people. We had a good stay. The check in procedure was easy and stress-free. 
56332	882274	8.0	9.0	30169998	This was my second time staying at Nick's place and it was just as good as the first.  Simple, clean space walking distance to everything I needed.
56333	882274	8.0	9.0	30491693	All went smoothly.
56334	882274	8.0	9.0	31241660	"The apartment was as described in the listing and the pictures are an accurate representations.  Nick's friend Nicole was helpful in getting me checked in.  Once I was checked in I had no more contact.  

The place was basically clean, but could use a thorough dusting of the pictures and especially the cabinets.  It was well stocked with the basics.

The neighborhood is very cool, but maybe not very suited for those looking for peace and quiet.  There is a lot do just around the corner and a wide variety of bars and restaurants within a few blocks.

I never could figure out the tv, but that is ok since I had my tablet and the wifi worked well.

I would recommend this place especially for college students and young people wanting to experience the Seattle night life."
56335	882274	8.0	9.0	31933718	Good communication with hosts Nick and Nicole, apartment as listed, great location.
56336	882274	8.0	9.0	32288241	Great apartment and location in Capitol Hill! Would highly recommend!
56337	882274	8.0	9.0	32484318	The host made us feel welcomed in the apartment. The listing was quite accurate. Nick emailed us detailed instructions on how to get into the apartment and to check out. There was even a binder with special instructions to use the wifi and the tv. The neighborhood was close to the downtown area however, it was a bit noisy at night. We heard lots of car screeches at odd hours of the night. Overall we felt safe in the apartment and the ROKU box was nice to have around. The apartment was good for the price we paid. It is a bit small if you have a large party but we found it manageable for 3 people. 
56338	882274	8.0	9.0	32861451	The place was decent but the pictures are a bit deceiving. It smells a bit musty and it's pretty bare bones and outdated. The wifi didn't work the entire time I was there. But for the price you really can't complain. The bed is comfy and the hosts are nice and allowed me to check out a bit late. It's in a great location near a ton of restaurants and bars. I would definitely stay there again if I was on a budget.
56339	882274	8.0	9.0	33247508	Nick communicated very well, also keeping connected from the beginning of the process till the day I arrived.  The location was amazing!  Parking was tough 1-2 days, I had to park about a mile away from the apartment.  The apartment was cozy.  A couple of opportunities, the sofa bed was broken, so my friend who slept on it was disappointed about the experience.  The shower head was broken as well, so taking a shower was a little challenging.  Overall we were pretty happy with our experience.  
56340	882274	8.0	9.0	33402148	The apartment is located in a great area, close to highway and hang out places. The apartment was simple but quite good for the price and had everything that we needed. 
56341	882274	8.0	9.0	33455130	The place was easy to find. Had to pay for parking was the only downside. Very simple place beds are comfortable. 
56342	882274	8.0	9.0	34004160	The host was great and very accommodating. The apartment was ok if you are just looking for a place to crash. Great location however don't plan on sleeping in because it is loud. Also, the cleanliness of the apt was questionable. 
56343	882274	8.0	9.0	34685413	I love his space! And His directions were very helpful. His cute little apartment is right in capital hill! There are cute shops and restaurants everywhere! We definitely had a lovely stay!
56344	882274	8.0	9.0	35203377	The neighborhood was fantastic! My friend and I were able to walk downtown with ease, as well as being ideally situated near great restaurants and bars. The apartment suited our needs since we had planned to be out and about most of the day. We were able to cook breakfast in the morning before starting out day, courtesy of the host's kitchen (equipped with pots/pans/plateware). As Texas girls, we are accustomed to always having AC (you kind of need it when temps go over 100 deg F during the summer), but Seattle's weather was termparate enough without it. When we had issues with the internet connection at the apartment, the host was quick to work with us to rectify it. 
56345	882274	8.0	9.0	35409868	This was the first time my friends and I used Airbnb and the experience as a whole went well. There were aspects that could have gone smoother, specifically the communication. While the host did reply to my messages I felt too many times I had to send a second message because my question wasn't answered or I was waiting for info they said they would send me the day before. Obviously I know they can be super busy with all they're reservations but it just added some stress to the trip. The only other thing is as people have said the pullout couch which was missing springs that almost left it unusable leading my friend to sleep on it unfolded instead. Other than these two things the space was great. The location was extremely convenient, the place was clean and more than enough space for the three of us. I would recommend this space to others.
56346	882274	8.0	9.0	35475606	The location of this apartment could not be more convenient! It is up a few flights of steps and cozy, indeed, though, so it could be challenging for people traveling with a lot of luggage. The apartment itself is no-frills, but colorful and has with everything needed for a comfy stay. The hosts are very welcoming, do a great job of giving instructions, and respond super fast to any question you might have! We're glad we found it!
56347	882274	8.0	9.0	36167185	We had a very nice stay at the apartment.  It was clean and a great location for us.  Nicole was extreme helpful and accommodating.  Thank you!
56348	882274	8.0	9.0	36911784	The studio was nice and in a great location (Capitol Hill). The street noise was a bit noisy (summer - so slept with the windows open), but besides that the unit was nice. The host gave great instructions and arrival and departure were both very easy.
56349	882274	8.0	9.0	37071308	"It was overall a good experience to stay at Nick's apt 304 Melrose Ave.
Pros-
1]Nick and Nicole were excellent in correspondence. So booking and other getting answers to any of your queries was quick and prompt.
2]  Since we were arriving late around midnight the lockbox for keys was very convenient.
3]Apt was small but clean 
4] The biggest plus is pretty close to downtown and highway 5!
5] Nice to have a kitchen for light cooking.

Cons-
1] If you have a car , street parking is little difficult to find :(. Outside apt it has 2 hrs parking restriction.
2] We stay in july at it was extremely hot and AC would have been comfortable.
Apt has just one ok fan.
3] As soon as you open the door there are railing not pretty safe for younger kids.
You have be little careful if you have kids.
4] No elevator so if you have luggage you need to climb the staircase to reach the 3rd floor!
5] Street noise is a pain if you are used to silence while sleeping.

Overall it is a good place to stay if you want to visiting Seattle!"
56350	882274	8.0	9.0	38253641	I stayed for 10 days and have stayed here before, as the location is great and the service from the host is very prompt.  It is walking distance to downtown and many other Seattle neighborhoods and attractions; and buses are nearby and plentiful.  The host made checking in and out very easy, and when I had questions or needed some supplies, they were very prompt and friendly.  Good value for the money.
56351	882274	8.0	9.0	38499723	Stayed at this lovely little apartment during a recent trip to Seattle. Nick and Nicole were great hosts. They check in process was easy and the stay was terrific. The unit does not have an A/C but this is normal in the area. If you are travelling in the summer months, you might need an extra fan as the one that is provided does a good job, but the apartment needs a fan in both rooms. Other than that, the location is great and the apartment is very clean and comfortable. Nick and Nicole are very easy to communicate with and answer emails/texts very quickly. Thanks for a great stay!
56352	882274	8.0	9.0	39506464	Nicole provided detailed directions/ instructions which made key pick-up easy, and she was available to answer questions we had about the WIFi not working which was very helpful. The apartment is in an older building in a great location. It was summer when we were there so the apartment got very stuffy during the day but if you're staying here you'd be more interested in going out and about and can just open the windows up when you get back.
56353	882274	8.0	9.0	40647153	The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. Instructions from the host were helpful and access into the building and apartment was seamless. With the windows open (hot summer nights), it's a bit noisy, with the I-5 freeway buzzing by. It's a motel-style building, with external entry-way facing a courtyard. 
56354	882274	8.0	9.0	41060697	Great proximity to downtown and all of Capital Hill with its great neighborhood restaurants and bars. Small apartment - perfect for a couple of guests for a weekend escape. 
56355	882274	8.0	9.0	41360832	This apartment was just as described.  Perfect location close to lots of great restaurants, easy access to public transport and downtown/the pier was just a short downhill walk.  The place is simple, but that is what we were looking for and expected.  Perfect for a couple who want convenient place to crash.  The wifi was the only thing that gave us an issue, but there are so many coffee shops with free internet access that it was hardly a problem.  Thanks for a great stay!
56356	882274	8.0	9.0	42510373	Very good location with lots of restaurants and tourist attractions around. Accurate description and photos of the place. No elevator so bringing up heavy luggage can be painful.
56357	882274	8.0	9.0	42869533	"The apartmant is nice.
Perfect locacalization.
Could be a little bit cleanner"
56358	882274	8.0	9.0	43357947	Nick gave us very clear instructions for finding and letting ourselves into the apartment. He was also very quick to sort out an issue that we pointed out to him. The apartment was clean and comfortable and in a great location for walking to all of the tourist attractions we wanted to see. I would recommend this place for a young couple.
56359	882274	8.0	9.0	43797705	"First off, I would definitely book this apartment with my husband again (read next paragraph for the ""you should know..."").  It was very clean, we had everything that we needed, and the location was amazing.  When I travel, I love getting a real feel for a city.  Capitol Hill had a ton of great bars, restaurants, and coffee shops.  We went for a quick run up to the water tower in the nearby park where you can see the whole city.   You are on the edge of the whole downtown- minutes from Pike's market and the ferries.  AND when we rented a car to go to Mt. Ranier, the rental was 2 blocks away and you just hop on the highway and go. Really great experience overall!

Here's what I wish I had expected though:  The apt building is set-up like a motel facing in on an unkempt courtyard.  As east coasters, this was weird and made us pretty uncomfortable when we arrived.  It took a few hours for us to feel good about it, but when we did, we realized that we were perfectly safe. The courtyard is really well lit at night and a few neighbors even have their bikes permanently stored outside.  I probably wouldn't book it if I was traveling as a single female, but I probably wouldn't do airbnb if I was traveling as a single female so...

In conclusion, for a clean and affordable housing option, I highly recommend it. 

 

"
56360	882274	8.0	9.0	44106978	Nick and Niki were very communicative.  This place is little and has very simple amenities but the lively neighborhood, its proximity to the Convention Center, great nearby stores and restaurants makes it a really great place to stay. 
56361	882274	8.0	9.0	44658000	"Logement tout à fait convenable compte tenu du prix, facile d'accès et dans un quartier tout à fait plaisant. Les principales attractions de Seattle ne sont pas très éloignées même à pied....
Excellent séjour, merci!"
56362	882274	8.0	9.0	45657021	Nick was a great host!  All of my last minute questions were answered quickly.  He allowed us to check in early.  His place is nothing swanky, but it was clean and in a cool part of town.  easy to get to from the light rail. We definitely got a lot of exercise hiking up and down all the hills.  We'd stay there again.  
56363	882274	8.0	9.0	45812475	Nick's place is fantastic and really easy to get in and out of. Highly recommended for great neighborhood and well prepared hosts.
56364	882274	8.0	9.0	46714251	BEST LOCATION! This apartment, may not look like a lot from the outside, but honestly it was a great stay for us. The  Pillow Team was extremely attentive - although I never met them - they were still  made us feel very welcome & left us very clear instructions on how to access the lock box for the apartment. It was just my husband and I who stayed, but the space definitely could accommodate another 1-2 people (as the couch pulled out). Everything was very clean and cozy - also they had a Roku & instructions on how to use it, which was a nice touch! Honestly, the best part about this apartment is the location - you truly are in the heart of Seattle in Capitol Hill with tons of bars & restaurants nearby - only a 15-20 minute walk to Pike's Place as well!
56365	882274	8.0	9.0	47362130	The basic description of the apartment was as listed. The only discrepancy being that the owner listed it as his home. Just a small thing, but this is clearly an apartment furnished for AirBnB. Not a problem, just stating a fact. I missed that the Pillow management co. was actually renting the place for the owner and that was my only problem with the apartment. Otherwise, it is a good price in a convenient neighborhood. Caveat: do not bring a car.
56366	882274	8.0	9.0	47996233	We enjoyed our stay at Nick's apartment. It was exactly as described, in a great location, and very clean. We appreciated that access was super easy, thanks to clear lockbox instructions. Communication was especially outstanding. Thanks for a great experience!
56367	882274	8.0	9.0	48866721	The room was clean, convenient, and close to everything. Plus, there is a late night walk-up window where you can get pie right around the corner. How great is that?
56368	882274	8.0	9.0	49448373	Nick uses the service Pillow to assist guests with check-in and any inquiries. We had all the information needed before check-in. We arrived after midnight and had absolutely no problem with getting the key to the unit. The unit is as described; cozy and in the heart of Capitol Hill. It was our first time visiting Seattle and we only used PT during our stay. Bus routes run nearby and frequently to the Space Needle Center and the Pike Market. If you're on a budget and looking for a vibrant, young, neighborhood - this is where  you want to be. 
56369	882274	8.0	9.0	49974822	Nick and Pillow were very accommodating and responded to my emails quickly even when they were sent short notice. The directions given were easy to follow. The location of the apartment was PERFECT. Everything that I wanted to visit was within walking distance. The location was close enough to restaurants and coffee shops, but far away enough from the bumbling noise of the city. I will definitely recommend this spot to my friends and hope that there will be open availability for when I visit Seattle again. Thank you Nick and Pillow! 
56370	882274	8.0	9.0	50181643	"it is really good location!
there are restaurants near the house.
and there is new starbucks. it is really good. 
i think don`t need to go the starbucks in pike place market. 
here is better than there.
"
56371	882274	8.0	9.0	51011363	"Nice apartment, with plenty of space for 2 people. Perfect location.

The booking was managed by a third-party website on behalf of Nick. They responded very quickly to my messages. Before you can receive the codes needed to access the apartment, you have to go to their site (not Airbnb) to confirm your arrival time and accept their terms and conditions. On my link the arrival date was wrong, so I was reluctant to confirm my arrival for a wrong date. However, this could not be changed and it was the only way to get the information on how to access the apartment.

The instructions eventually were clear and check-in was very easy. Apartment could have been cleaned better, though."
56372	882274	8.0	9.0	51527951	Nick's place in Capitol Hill was amazing. It looks a bit sketchy at first but it is really very safe and with so many restaurants and bars all around. This place is great if you're going to walk everywhere like we did! Would definitely re-book this place. 
56373	882274	8.0	9.0	53673878	the apartment was basically as advertised.  The pull-out couch was offered as an option for a 3rd guest, which we had.  However, the couch was flimsy and is collapsed in the middle.  the check in was very convenient and the neighborhood was great.  there were so many restaurants, bars and coffee shops within walking distance.  
56374	882274	8.0	9.0	55110797	Nick's AirBnB was just what I need for me visit to Seattle.  The location was great, just 2 blocks from my daughter's place so it was very convenient.  There are plenty of great coffee places within a couple of blocks. There was a slight mix-up regarding the keys when I first arrived but it was corrected quickly. 
56375	882274	8.0	9.0	55416229	Overall cute place an great location, but I had a few issues. First it was a hit challenging to find and parking was tricky since you are not provided with a permit. Secondly the cleaning fees are way to high and make the place not as a great of a deal as it seemed initially. Also pillow--the third party you have to use--- is not helpful and intact more work for the guest. 
56376	882274	8.0	9.0	55653726	"This listing was not at all as it appeared on Airbnb. First of all, we booked this apartment with Nick and about 4 months out from our stay, Nick let us know that that apartment was no longer available and that we would be moved to a different unit in the same apartment. The unit we ended up staying in was dirty and had a horrible musky smell. It was listed as a 1 bed/1 bath, which it was not. It would be considered a studio, as there is no door to the bedroom; unfortunate to find out when you were expecting a 1 bedroom apartment. The kitchen wasn't a complete or clean kitchen. There was no microwave or dishwasher (workable), however the water in the kitchen sink DID NOT WORK (only a small dribble). So if you expect to use any dishes in the kitchen, be prepared to wash your dishes in the bathroom sink...gross. Also, be prepared to have to walk through the ""bedroom"" to get to the bathroom.. The second bed in the apartment was an Ikea futon..a very small and VERY uncomfortable couch AND bed. The living area was extremely unlivable and unsleepable. At the end of our stay, we could not find the check-out time listed anywhere on the Airbnb website (Nick uses a host site called Pillow that is very un-userfriendly) so we were intruded on by Nick's cleaning staff and were nearly charged for a whole extra day of staying there. Luckily we were able to solve that situation, but it required us to head to the airport early and completely cut out our last day in Seattle; very disappointing as we had planned and saved up for this trip for quite some time. Overall I would not recommend staying in this apartment complex. The one redeeming quality of the apartment was its proximity to Pike Place Market and downtown Seattle."
56377	882274	8.0	9.0	56059741	The location was the best part of the experience - smothered between Capital Hill and Downtown was excellent and many bars and restaurants within walking distance.
56378	882274	8.0	9.0	56516478	This apartment was in the perfect location! It is a 12 minute walk to Pike Place Market, right next to a great Mediterranean place called mamnoon and the Starbucks reserve.  I would definitely stay here again!
56379	3594885	8.0	10.0	16931898	The unit was as advertised, clean, and well maintained.  The building was in a great location and the price was fair for the area.  Matan was a great host: quick responses, seamless check-in/out, eager to make sure his guests were well accommodated.  I would definitely recommend renting from Matan.
56380	3594885	8.0	10.0	18921106	"Matan is a great host! He is very quick to respond to messages and accommodating to questions and needs for your trip. Check-in/check-out was a breeze and completely stress free. The location of his apartment is tremendous, there is so much to see and do in the area, you definitely will not be bored! 

The apartment itself was extremely clean and spacious. We had a party of 4 and Matan had two air mattresses inflated and prepared with bedding ready for us which was very much appreciated! 

The apartment building is very cool. It's a modern place, very secure, and it has an amazing rooftop to enjoy.

This was our first time in Seattle and staying at Matan's made everything very smooth and enjoyable. From location to Matan's hosting, staying here sets you up to have a tremendous stay in Seattle!"
56381	3594885	8.0	10.0	20042434	"Neighborhood's cool. To us, it appeared to be college-aged bar hoppers, 20's-30's something hipsters and gutter punks mixed in with the local gay scene. The bars/restaurants were good, not tourist traps. We much preferred this area to the others we visited: downtown, U-District and Fremont.

Matan was the ideal host. He was one text/phone call away, but he didn't meddle. Checking in/out was easy."
56382	3594885	8.0	10.0	26683496	"My girlfriends and I wanted to escape to Seattle for a long weekend and came across Matan's listing. I messaged him and heard back right away. He made it very easy- from helping me book my first airbnb stay, to giving my friends and me directions and instructions for the weekend. 

We arrived late on a Friday and he was kind enough to set up two air mattresses in the living room and to set out towels and the like for the duration of our stay. Any questions or concerns were answered immediately. We had mixed up our departing flight times and he was gracious enough to let us stay later in the afternoon than we had intended originally. I would definitely look to stay at this apartment again if I make it back to Seattle. It was clean, convenient, and easy. "
56383	3594885	8.0	10.0	28824218	The condo location is fantastic, can't be beat.  Otherwise, the interior is clean and sparse (as the photo shows).  Overall, I enjoyed my stay here.
56384	3594885	8.0	10.0	31065114	Stayed at Matan's place for 5 nights, two weeks ago and would gladly stay again. The location was perfect, the house was lovely and it was close to everything. Matan was a fantastic host and extremely helpful. I would highly recommend staying here if you visit. 
56385	3594885	8.0	10.0	31918482	Great place and location! Matan was a fantastic host and made sure we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend! 
56386	3594885	8.0	10.0	32285931	The perfect location for staying in Seattle. You're close to everything...great restaurants are within walking distance. The roof top area is great to enjoy and the gym has everything you need to keep in shape. Maten was a great host and would certainly stay here again when working in Seattle. The apartment is exactly like the pictures show. If you're wanting to stay in what will be the new hip area of Seattle, this is the spot. 
56903	7872980	8.0	10.0	43862054	Glenn was an incredible host. We had great communication leading up to my arrival, and when I got to his place, I was delighted to see how he had tidied up the place and left a list of restaurants/bars/coffee shops to check out in Seattle. The room was great. The apartment was even better. The view from the rooftop is worth checking out. Getting to and from downtown from his place is easy, and the Capitol Hill location is both very active and safe as well. I would highly recommend this place and Glenn to anyone checking out Seattle.
56904	7872980	8.0	10.0	44988140	Glenn hat uns sehr nett empfangen und im Apartment fanden wir wertvolle Tipps zum Ausgehen. Die Lage des Apartments ist ideal um abends in die hippesten Viertel der Stadt bequem zu Fuss zu gehn. Die Tatsache, dass es einen Tiefgaragenplatz gibt, ist sehr bequem und kostensparend. Zur Waterfront läuft man in ca. 15 min durch spannende Strassen.
56905	7872980	8.0	10.0	45838718	Glenn has a convenient spot close to many great bars and restaurants in Capital Hill. His apartment was clean upon our arrival and he even recommended places to visit nearby. Overall a great experience!
56906	7872980	8.0	10.0	46567225	The location is perfect. You won't need to drive if you stay in this apartment. Glenn was really nice and helpful. I fully recommend to stay there.
56907	7872980	8.0	10.0	48233238	Staying at Glenn's was awesome! Super responsive and accommodating and the space itself was perfect. In a great location walkable to several restaurants and bars. Beds were comfortable, and lots of space to relax in. Would definitely come by again when visiting!
56908	7872980	8.0	10.0	48261246	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
56909	7872980	8.0	10.0	48409625	Glenn's place is amazing.  Perfect location and all of the amenities you would need.  Location is in the middle of Capital Hill and right in the middle of amazing restaurants and bars.
56910	7872980	8.0	10.0	50204348	It was a nice area. A little further from Pike's than we thought but just a little longer walk. The accommodations were adequate. 
56911	7872980	8.0	10.0	51383475	Glenn's place was great. Everything was as described. The location is very convenient, and Glenn went out of his way to make sure we had a good time. I'd definitely stay at his place again.
56912	7872980	8.0	10.0	52377879	Great host and lovely apartment. Extra bonus: unit is a Valhalla of USB charging options! Thanks for everything!

57196	3424991	8.0	10.0	15428702	We stayed 4 nights at this place! And it was perfect! The place is really close to anything! You can walk to downtown, to the quay or Union lake. Around the place, there is pleeenttyyy of food or drink place really cool! Definetely a good place to stay!
57197	3424991	8.0	10.0	15841466	Everyone in the house was very welcoming. The house was clean and comfortable. There was coffee and iced tea. Leah gave us a fan, which made the record heat much more comfortable, and Michael helped us find parking (there isn't much parking in the neighborhood).
57198	3424991	8.0	10.0	16309480	The neighborhood was a very cute area. It was a easy bus ride to downtown Seattle. Micheal was welling to work with me on my arrival time.  I did not have a chance to meet Micheal but it was  great place to stay   
57199	3424991	8.0	10.0	16417228	"Feedback for seattle

The house location is good if you want to hang out in funky Capitol Hill. Buses run to the area fairly frequently.  The room is basic but all you need sleep. There a double bed, desk, chair and wardrobe space. The wifi is strong and fast. There's two flights of stairs though so keep that keep that in mind if you have lots of bags. I had an early flight out so I packed early and left my largest suitcase down stairs the night before so I didn't wake anyone by dragging it downstairs at 5 am. The area's not noisy so you'll sleep well. Although the shower pressure is the only thing I'd warn you about. It's like a mist which is unfortunately not great for washing your hair. But Leah and Michael are friendly and very welcoming. Leah was proactive with communication,  confirm the reservation and letting me know about an event happening in the area. She also accommodated my changed check in time."
57200	3424991	8.0	10.0	16577029	Michael's place was a great starting and end point to each day while visiting the neighborhood of Capitol Hill. Location is right off of Broadway in the heart of it all. Very accommodating with our questions leading up to check in and met us shortly upon arrival. 
57201	3424991	8.0	10.0	16684497	Staying at 419 is the bees knees! Everyone that lives there is incredibly nice and welcoming, and I felt at home the entire time staying there. Their friendliness, helpfulness, and flexibility made my move to Seattle so much easier than I thought it would be. My stay here also made me really appreciate the neighborhood, which partly led to my getting an apartment just down the road. 10/10, would recommend.
57202	3424991	8.0	10.0	16853917	The house is located in a really cool aera, near from everything by walk or by bus. Michael and all his roomates were very helpful and give us a lot of advises. The room was ok. It´s a good place to stay.
57203	3424991	8.0	10.0	17002108	As promised, a clean and quiet bedroom in Capitol Hill. Great location - was about five blocks walk from basically anywhere I went all weekend. 
57204	3424991	8.0	10.0	17227719	Really nice guy who made our stay for comfortable. He left a key in the mailbox so we were able to check in as soon as we got there whether someone was home or not and let us keep our luggage at his place late on the evening we checked out. Great first airbnb experience and would definitely stay with Michael and in this awesome neighborhood again! 
57205	3424991	8.0	10.0	17377734	"This was our very first airbnb stay, so it was a new experience for us. Michael was a great host. We got in kind of late, so we didn’t end up talking that much, but he was very conversational and friendly. I got the feeling he would talk as long as we wanted to talk, but he was super gracious when we said we couldn’t stay up long.

The room was just as pictured. The bed was comfortable. The kitchen was nice. 

Our only complaint was the bathroom. It wasn’t that the bathroom was dirty, per se, but it felt very lived in, and maybe that is really normal for an airbnb but it was slightly discomforting to us in the bathroom. The airbnb description does note that the house is “lived-in”, and that was fine everywhere (charming really) except the bathroom. That may just be our own personal hang-up though. Again, it wasn’t that the bathroom was notably dirty- it just felt like we were using someone else’s used bathroom. 

Aside from that one personal issue with the bathroom, we enjoyed the stay. The location is great. A couple bus routes stop close by, so there is easy transit access. The price was good. Michael was enjoyable."
57206	3424991	8.0	10.0	17784449	Michael is a terrific host. My situation was a little different in that I wasn't visiting  Seattle for tourism, but rather moving here from across the country for work and needed a flexible option that allowed me to move into my new digs whenever I found them. Michael was that flexible, on both ends of my stay. Key exchange was easy. Room and house were as described. Great conversations, too. The house is in a fantastic part of town, two blocks west of Broadway. I would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the heart of the best neighborhood in Seattle. 
57207	3424991	8.0	10.0	17921173	Groovy roommates, nice neighborhood, and the room is exactly what it looks like in the pictures.  
57208	3424991	8.0	10.0	18210491	Good location in a great neighborhood. Roommates were helpful, room was comfy and quiet. Recommended!
57209	3424991	8.0	10.0	18435505	The room is exactly as shown in the pictures and also exactly what I was looking for. It's a little bare but I don't what else you'd want in it. The roommates provide some Seattle sightseeing suggestion material in the room, also great suggestions for local spots. The area was pretty great, extremely easy to walk downtown. Also plenty of shops, restaurants and night life just blocks from the apartment. Didn't see much of the hosts but was out and about most of the time. They were extremely quick on their responses to any texts though. Overall had a great trip, would definitely stay again.
57210	3424991	8.0	10.0	18738954	"I communicated with Leah and she was very responsive throughout our stay. I felt I could text her with any questions/concerns. 
The room is very simple if you need a room in a good location to explore Seattle. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood. 
There were maps and recommendations in the room to help us explore the neighborhood.
My only negatives for this stay were the shower with very low water pressure and the fact that the smoke alarms had been disabled. Perhaps there is a good reason for this, but it seemed unsafe. 

Otherwise the house was quiet and the roommates were respectful. 

Thanks Leah and Michael."
57211	3424991	8.0	10.0	18890769	The room was set up for us when we got there with a nice welcome letter and information sheets. It was super easy to get to and from downtown, and while we didn't see the hosts very much, they didn't mind that we were back late and out early.
57212	3424991	8.0	10.0	19306290	"The host was very quick to respond and was super accommodating. The room was exactly what I needed. Nothing fancy, but it's a really great location. Tons of cool bars and restaurants in walking distance.  I only met two of the roommates when I first checked in and they seemed like nice people. 
The host acknowledged some of the negative aspects highlighted in the previous reviews. Mainly the bathroom cleanliness and shower water pressure. The bathroom was clean. I could tell they recently replaced the shower head to try to fix the pressure issue, but the pressure was still humorously low."
57213	3424991	8.0	10.0	19353004	The house is in a great location and the roomates were super nice and very easy to work with.  The house had a great community feel and I would definitely stay here again. 
57214	3424991	8.0	10.0	19447326	"I communicated with Leah regarding the details and the booking. She was very good and very responsive, although we never met in person. I did meet Michael, Nick and Austin, i believe, and they were solid guys and cool. 

If you are young, single and looking to experience Seattle, then this is a great crash pad. Very close to bars and restaurants and a quick, cheap cab ride to Pike's and downtown. 

The comments from the other reviewers about the shower are fair and accurate. Another key point - there's zero parking so if you have a rental car or something, it's a big problem. "
57215	3424991	8.0	10.0	24132505	The location is great, expect to be in walking distance of most things within the city. Leah and Michael take requests very well, and work to accommodate as best they can. The house can get really loud when people are leaving and entering, and sound bleeds through many of the walls here. The shower pressure here can definitely throw people off, so be prepared! This room would be your perfect stop in  Capitol Hill for a short stay while you are out exploring Seattle. 
57216	3424991	8.0	10.0	24311434	"Leah was responsive when we were communicating before the stay.  During my stay, I met Austin and Leah.  They are both friendly, welcoming, and caring.  Capitol Hill apparently is a great location to travell around Seattle, with quite a few pubs, cafes, restaurants, etc, and I enjoyed the convenience and the quiet environment around the house.  The house feels lived-in, and well maintained and clean.

Shower water pressure was very low, but it's got good hot water so that wasn't a big problem for me.  I would imagine it would be even less so in summer time."
57217	3424991	8.0	10.0	25115298	"Leah and the team at the ""Capitol Hill Excursion"" did a great job! Cosy place, a great location close to all of the fun spots on the hill, and easy access to downtown. "
57218	3424991	8.0	10.0	25336218	Everything was perfect. It was a great stay and we lived the space. Check in and check out was easy and everything was comfortable. I would stay again! 
57219	3424991	8.0	10.0	25376721	unfortunately we did not meet in person, but the flat was neat and clean, and the neighbourhood (capitol hill) is cool too.
57220	3424991	8.0	10.0	25880377	The hospitality and environment were fantastic! Had a great time, definite recommend. 
57221	3424991	8.0	10.0	26056610	Leah was attentive to our needs and was able to accommodate my early arrival easily. She's helpful if you need recommendations around the city and great if you need some pointers around the city. Everything is as described. I had no problems with the water pressure for the shower but the toilet took some time getting used to as it won't flush until you wait awhile longer but that wasn't a big concern for us. I'm glad that there was a heater in the room because it can get real cold during the winter for someone who lives in socal weather. Overall, it was a great stay for this price!
57222	3424991	8.0	10.0	27320036	Spent a month here during my recent work trip to Seattle. Leah was very responsive and helpful during my stay. I was on a weird schedule so I didn't interact with many people but everyone I met was very nice. I appreciated being able to come in and out at all hours of the night and can't beat the location. Bathroom was clean and always available when I needed it and shower pressure issue seems to have been resolved.
57223	3424991	8.0	10.0	27686511	Their place was very welcoming and walking distance to everything! We had a great time visiting Seattle!
57224	3424991	8.0	10.0	28138745	Very comfortable spot in a great location! Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to stay in capitol hill. 
57225	3424991	8.0	10.0	29271251	Michael, Leah and their roommate were very informative and welcoming. The room is as described and is in a nice are in town. They were responsive and easy to communicate. Everything was clean and neat.
57226	3424991	8.0	10.0	30410784	Everything as described. Great location for exploring the city and the neighborhood. Communication was excellent. I would definitely stay here again.
57227	3424991	8.0	10.0	30654284	Perfect for what I was looking for. Great location and the house has all the basics covered. 
57228	3424991	8.0	10.0	31831454	I had a wonderful experience here! The room was exactly what we needed and the location was very convenient. The hosts were very informative and friendly while also giving us privacy. They went above and beyond making sure that guests were comfortable and satisfied! Parking was a little difficult but not impossible. I would absolutely stay here again next time I visit the city.
57229	3424991	8.0	10.0	32009845	"Michael and Leah were quick to respond to any questions I had. They provided very thorough travel instructions and welcoming emails that I felt as though there wouldn't be any problems (and there weren't!) arriving rather late after a long train ride. And they even had house food available, in the fridge and countertop, which was awesome because I was starving when I got in. 

The house was in a safe (from what I could tell) neighbourhood and was quite easy to find. Bars, coffee shops and a grocery/pharmacy store are minutes away. As they say in their description, it's not a new house, but it had a warm and cozy feel. The kitchen and living room were open for use. The room itself was clean, large enough for 1-2 people with a bed (with warm blankets) and desk. There was even a personal electric kettle in the room.

My stay was very brief, but I would definitely recommend!"
57230	3424991	8.0	10.0	32619831	Hosts were great. Super friendly, great place. Fun neighborhood. Would totally stay again.
57231	3424991	8.0	10.0	33921458	"Very comfortable clean room with coffee and nice assortment of teas. Shared items available in kitchen. Wifi naturally.
Immediate response from host for my questions.
Quiet residential neighborhood but just a couple blocks from commercial activity. Major food supermarket, restaurants and of course, a Starbucks were a few minutes walk away. A perfect location.
"
57232	3424991	8.0	10.0	35702697	Great host.  I had a fine experience. They were very attentive to my needs and very welcoming.
57233	3424991	8.0	10.0	36680639	I'm so happy my friend Veronica and I were able to stay here at 419! Though Michael wasn't home, Leah was super welcoming and made sure all of my questions were answered. Communication was excellent and I knew all that was required of me as well as was given suggestions of where to go. Leah brought us guests doughnuts one day which was really sweet 3 Austin was also very nice! The neighborhood was amazing and very close to lots of shops :) Thanks to 419 household it was a very enjoyable stay, I would definitely stay here again. Thank you thank you!
57234	3424991	8.0	10.0	37078324	"I always love staying at Michael and Leah's home. The neighborhood is beautiful and the house is located within a very quick walk to grocery stores, restaurants and coffee, as well as the bus to take you downtown. 
I will always stay here when I visit Seattle. I stayed here last March and it had only gotten better!"
57235	3424991	8.0	10.0	37379747	It was fun to stay at Michael's house. I did not meet Michael in person but everything was well organized and Leah communicated excellent. I met nice people and spent the 4th of July at beach party organized by the house which was a great welcome.  
57236	3424991	8.0	10.0	38518343	"This was an excellent stay! I never had much issue getting into the (one) bathroom when needed, the location is close to bus lines to make it easy to get around the city, and the neighborhood has a great vibe. 

Hosts were very accommodating and we were able to leave our bags before/after checkout for a little extra time as we walked around the city. "
57237	3424991	8.0	10.0	38744517	Leah and Austin were great hosts (Michael was out of town). I needed a place to sleep and shower while I was in town apartment hunting and interviewing, and their place suited my needs just fine! I was able to check in way earlier than what was planned, which was wonderful, and they were flexible with my check out time too. Great location, super close to Broadway, lots to walk to, and Leah offered helpful suggestions, was nice to talk to and easy to get in touch with via text. I wasn't around often and was up super early, so I never had a problem getting into the bathroom or kitchen. Would stay here again for a short trip (but I won't need to since I'm moving to Seattle now)!
57238	3424991	8.0	10.0	41458077	Great neighborhood with fast access to highways, center of Seattle, and good restaurants within walking distance.  Great checkin and checkout instructions for the house and good communication throughout stay there.
57239	3424991	8.0	10.0	42392677	Great location and good price.  I never met Michael or Leah but everything was in order and I never had any problems.  Would stay there again.
57240	3424991	8.0	10.0	43102121	Michael and Leah were great hosts! Leah was the primary contact during our stay because Michael was out of town, but she was super accommodating and was quick to respond with texts. Their location was close to all the bus lines so we were traveling around town like locals. The binder provided in the room had directions were written out clearly so we didn't have any trouble navigating ourselves around the house from the get go. Will definitely be looking forward to stay with them again the next time I'm in town! 
57241	3424991	8.0	10.0	44496259	I had a good experience staying with Michael and Leah. The place is close downtown and convenient with buses. They make everything pretty clear and easy. 
57242	3424991	8.0	10.0	46558529	This was a great place to stay.  First off it is well located walking distance from downtown, and in a neighborhood with lots of great bars and restaurants.  The room was clean and had everything needed. Overall it was a great place to stay.  
57243	3424991	8.0	10.0	47823159	"Awesome location and price. The apartment was as described in the listing. It's by no means new or pristine, but works well if location is more important to you than luxury. The hosts were helpful and provided us with some nice amenities like a coffee maker, hair dryer/straightener, irons, city maps, etc.
"
57244	3424991	8.0	10.0	48593190	Nice neighbourhood and warm welcome.
57245	3424991	8.0	10.0	49062311	Great location. I was a little scared to enter as none of the entryway lights were turning on. But after I got upstairs I realized I in fact was in the right place! The visitors manual was very useful and helpful. 
57246	3424991	8.0	10.0	52847610	My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying at Leah's. The room was furnished with a lot of goodies (french press to make coffee, a list of places to check out) and the bathroom even contained necessities that guests may need to use. Needless to say, we were immediately able to make ourselves at home. The location is stellar, as it is conveniently located on Capitol Hill - bars, cafés, and little shops aplenty. Not only that, a QFC grocer is only a few steps away. Amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anybody. Thank you, Leah!
57247	3424991	8.0	10.0	54116274	Had a great stay. Michael and Leah  made it really easy to check in and out and had everything labelled very well for the guests. As well as an extremely thorough visitor's guide which was very helpful. Outstanding location, we were able to walk, or take a quick bus, to all the places we wanted to go. Excited to come back!
57248	3424991	8.0	10.0	54757263	We had a good stay at Michael. He and Leah provided plenty of information upfront. We had close contact to them though we never met each other. Bars and restaurants are close by, it's a great neighbourhood.
57249	3424991	8.0	10.0	55074633	In big city, it is very hard to find a clean room at this price. The room make me feel like a better hostel.  We have our independent room. The host  is busy doing her own thing, coz thanksgiving. Everything is on the handbook, you just need to follow instruction. Still a good place to stay.
59935	4808173	8.0	10.0	24439789	We didn't get a chance to meet Caitlin on this trip, but she was very communicative and helpful beforehand. Her instructions for getting into the apartment were very thorough and easy. The apartment itself is wonderful. It's in an amazing location, and yet very quiet despite being so near such a busy part of town. Her place is very comfortable (the bed was amazing), and has everything one would need for a Seattle stay. It was a perfect apartment and a perfect stay!
59936	4808173	8.0	10.0	24795534	Caitlin and Charlie's flat is in an excellent location and is super comfortable. We loved feeling like we had our own place in Capitol Hill with everything in easy walking distance. Caitlin's communication before arrival was outstanding. We would love to stay here again. Thanks for a great stay guys!
59937	4808173	8.0	10.0	28373843	Absolute best location in all of Seattle! Both Caitlyn and Charlie were professional and helpful. Their house was clean, comfortable and literally a 5 minute walk to all the best venues. I was very happy with my stay at their house and would gladly stay again.
60475	6216116	8.0	10.0	32709549	It was a great location (plenty of walking distance spots) for a really good price!
60476	6216116	8.0	10.0	36684028	The place was right in the middle of everywhere we wanted to be! It was a hot weather, a few more fans to help cool the place down, would have helped. But I do know, that it doesn't usually get that hot. Michael was prompt and getting back to me, which was great! I'd stay there again!
60477	6216116	8.0	10.0	37720854	A simple comfortable place in a great location. Good communication and a smooth connection
60478	6216116	8.0	10.0	37896816	Micheal's apartment was an AMAZING deal! Walkable to anything in Capitol Hill as well as pretty much anywhere in downtown Seattle. It was an amazing steal to have the entire apartment to ourselves, at a rate much cheaper than most downtown hotels. Additionally, he went out of his way to make sure we could check in early by hiding a key for us. 
60479	6216116	8.0	10.0	38960463	"It is a nice, clean, comfortable apartment in a perfect location and a very good skyline view.  It was helpful that Michael was able to meet me earlier and tell me a little about Seattle. 

I would definitely try to stay again if I return to Seattle.  "
60480	6216116	8.0	10.0	40336573	Communication and check-in were fine, with useful flexibility on check-in time. The apartment is in a pretty good location, about 20 mins walk from downtown. There is a nice city view from the balcony, although with the noise from the I5 highway right below you. Cleanliness was a slight issue, with Michael being out of town at handover between short stays I think he somewhat relies on guests leaving the place in a reasonable state for the next people. In all this was definitely better value than any hotel you would get for a similar price.
60481	6216116	8.0	10.0	40734038	Great location, view of the city and easy access. It was warmer than usual and there is no a/c. There were 3 of us and just one fan. A little dust here and there, but overall a nice apt. I would stay again.
60482	6216116	8.0	10.0	48666255	"The host provided quick communication when I asked for a last minute stay, which I appreciated greatly. The location was nice. That's where the good experience stopped. 

I should have read between the lines on Roger's post, but the apartment was not clean. It smelled musty and mildewy. The carpet was spotted and dirty. The bed was not made well, which raised some red flags. Not to mention the stickiness on all kitchen surfaces. I almost left but then thought I was being picky. Quickly I realized I should have listened to my gut. 

When kindly questioned if the sheets were clean, he responded saying of course. It didn't seem like that and I later realized that they most likely were not clean. I got a text at 2:30 a.m. asking me to make the bed before I left. Of course. I do my best to leave AirBnBs better than I found them. Unfortunately, the next people who were staying at his place (he was out of town for the weekend) crossed paths with me, without any cleaning or change of sheets, towels, etc.. I quickly recounted all of the dirtiness I suspected (private body hair in the shower, rumpled towels, and an unmade, rather smelly bed) and quickly realized that nothing was clean. I was so grossed out. And to think the next unsuspecting people were going to sleep in the bed we had just slept in without any sort of cleaning. Not to mention, use the same towels we used. Unacceptable in my book. 

I am a easy going person and know pot is legal in WA. Without sounding square, I don't think it's great practice to leave out your stash when you're renting out your AirBnB. 

After leaving it definitely cleaner than we found it, I got an accusatory text from him verbatim, ""so you trashed my place?"" To which I quickly responded asking what he was talking about. Thankfully AirBnB was quick to react, saw the text exchange, understood my concerns and refunded my money. After a few days, he responded telling me, ""never mind."" All I could  think was that the people that came in after we left expressed concern over the cleanliness issue, he reacted and blamed me. When he got home, he quickly realized that their concerns were due to his own cleanliness issues, not mine. 

I know I sound harsh and I don't mean to. But there are cleanliness standards that need to be upheld when you're renting out your apartment, especially on AirBnB. I have to say that my experience at Michael's was so unpleasant that I'm re-evaluating my loyalty to AirBnB. Granted they were incredibly nice and accommodating, the conditions that this place was rented out was unacceptable. And with no one regulating those standards, it's tough for me to rationalize it again.

I would advise against staying at Michael's if you have any sort of cleanliness standards."
60483	6216116	8.0	10.0	57606171	A great host with a great location! Michael was incredibly helpful and accommodating on our trip, and his place is perfect! It's close to the major attractions, has a great city skyline view and is fully kitted out with all the amenities you could want. Would definitely book up with Michael again :)
60949	1039766	8.0	10.0	5480716	Great host, very friendly, helpful and organized. The room is very private and the house is in a convenient location, close to many stores and a short walk from downtown. 
60950	1039766	8.0	10.0	5802545	Lillian was able to accommodate my last minute booking for the same night and was very fast to respond to all messages. Her place was in a great location for visiting downtown and surrounding areas. Highly recommended!
60951	1039766	8.0	10.0	5848798	Lily was a great host; she was communicative and accommodating. She gave me complete privacy. The location of the apt could not be better, and with parking to boot! 
60952	1039766	8.0	10.0	5931562	Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.
60953	1039766	8.0	10.0	6561229	This was exactly what I was looking for—a clean bed in a great location at an affordable price. Lillian is very sweet and accommodating, as well. 
60954	1039766	8.0	10.0	6787494	"Lilian is a nice host who is nice and accommodating.  The apartment flooring is a bit older than what the photo shows due to natural wear and tear.  The room is a bit small and so is the window.  The living is room is nice and big and Lillian usually has no problem with the guest using that room.  The AC is only in the living room and is not powerful enough to cool the guest room which can get kind of hot in the hottest days of the Seattle summer.
The point of biggest complaint is the smell from the cat's litter box.  The litter box is in the washroom but the smell permeates into the hallway and makes the using of the washroom & kitchen (besides the washroom) a very unpleasant experience."
60955	1039766	8.0	10.0	6839976	Lily was great about communication and easy going about the whole thing. Thanks again!
60956	1039766	8.0	10.0	7068755	"I had a great stay with Lillian, although I wasn't around the house much as I was in Seattle for the PAX 2013 gaming convention.

Lillian was friendly from the moment I entered the door (as was her cat!), and any issues were quickly resolved with text messages (as I said, I wasn't at the house much).

The house was nice and clean, I had the use of the kitchen if I wanted it (although I actually ended up eating out for all of my meals - Seattle has a lot of great places to eat!), and the wifi was fine for catching up on my internets in the evenings.

20 minute walking distance from downtown Seattle (specifically the convention center) was fine for me, I'm from the UK and thus used to walking around cities. It's also a lovely place to wander.

I would definitely consider staying at Lillian's again if I happen to be travelling to Seattle in future!"
60957	1039766	8.0	10.0	7128558	"Lillian was a fantastic host.  She helped me find a restaurant late in the evening after I arrived.  I also enjoyed her cat that is very friendly.
I used her dryer to dry my clothes after I'd been walking in the Seattle rain."
60958	1039766	8.0	10.0	7284670	I had a such a great time here! Lillian is super friendly and willing to give you directions or recommendations. The apartment is in a great location, lots of good restaurants ect., and you can easily walk to downtown Seattle. The room had a big closet and was very clean and the kitchen and washer/dyer were a huge plus. Also, Mushi the cat is adorable and super friendly. I would definitely recommend staying with Lillian! 
60959	1039766	8.0	10.0	7444013	Lillian is a total sweetheart and her sweet little house is located in the heart of one of Seattle's most vibrant neighborhoods. A real gem if you want to experience an authentic Emerald City trip!

The house is in a great location on Capitol Hill which was my favourite part of Seattle, with lots of interesting places to drop into. 

Lily made the whole process really easy and helped me have a great visit. In fact she even put a load of my washing in the dryer for me on my last day which was lovely- thanks!!

60969	1039766	8.0	10.0	9337049	This apartment has a great location if you like urban, walkable neighborhoods. It's right in the middle of everything in Capitol Hill. The parking spot is a big plus too. The other thing I really enjoyed about the apartment is that I had a lot of privacy and space to myself, which was essentially what I was looking for. Thanks, Lillian.

60977	1039766	8.0	10.0	10380748	First time using AirBnB. Reservation & communication with host went very smooth. Received a very warm welcome on arrival. Room & facilities as described. Parking right in front of the door was very nice as I decided while I was there to rent a car. Interesting neighborhood - lots of cafes, bars and restaurants. Very accessible by public transport as well. Would stay again! :-)
60978	1039766	8.0	10.0	10487782	Very convenient location to down town and heart of cap hill.  I was a bit of a ghost (in late out early) but place met my needs readily.
60979	1039766	8.0	10.0	10524513	As my first airbnb experience, I made a last-minute reservation to stay at Lillian's for two nights in Feb 2014. She was the perfect hostess - responsive to enquiries, friendly but not intrusive, helpful and informative - and I had the run of her apartment including kitchen use and living room (which I really didn't have time to take advantage of). Room isn't huge but clean, warm, included wireless internet and was perfect for my short stay. All in all it was just what I expected/hoped for and the price was right. Her Capitol Hill location is perfect - great neighborhood and an easy fifteen-minute walk down to Central Seattle and the conference center which was the reason I was in town. I will certainly repeat next time I'm in Seattle.
60980	1039766	8.0	10.0	10655414	I was in town for a conference so I didn't spend much time at the house.  Lily was very communicative before and throughout my stay.  The accommodations were basic, but the place served my purpose well: safe place to crash, affordable, close to conference.  To anyone out there looking for a place to stay during a romp in Capitol Hill, this is an excellent location.  Thank you Lily!

Also, the location can't be beat -- in a very hip neighborhood and within easy walking distance (though I do like to walk, so my sense of ""easy"" might be warped) to downtown and the waterfront. "
60995	1039766	8.0	10.0	13566362	Our stay with Lillian was great! Her guest room is very clean. We were greeted with a friendly hello and some helpful tips about the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The location of the apartment is excellent, a close walk to many sites in Seattle. The bed is very comfy and she even provides complementary towels, a nice touch. As well, the kitchen is open to use which is very convenient. Thanks so much!
60996	1039766	8.0	10.0	13677143	"Lillian was very warm and welcoming! She made me feel very comfortable in her cozy apartment! The room is exactly as decribed and there is also a large closet (not shown in the photos) with hangers, which I used to hang some wrinkle-prone clothes :) The only minor issue I had was the comfort of the bed, especially since I have bad hips. I mentioned this to Lillian at the end of my stay and she, without hesitation, mentioned that she would have gladly switched beds with me for my comfort, which was very kind. After leaving, she replaced the mattress with a new memory foam one, which I can't wait to try if I am every in Seattle again in the near future! :)

Location, location, location! Lillian's apartment is located near the southern part of Capitol Hill - gorgeous area. I was meeting up with friends around downtown Seattle everyday, and was able to easily walk there in less than 40minutes - even to the Space Needle. I really appreciated the ease of access and gorgeous scenery along the way. 

(Rating is due to the bed, which has been replaced now anyways!)

Thanks Lillian!"

60998	1039766	8.0	10.0	14200521	Lillian's room was in a great area. Clear close by to places to dine. The place was quiet and neat - and Lillian was very kind. I was in a huge rush in and out - so didn't get to spend much time, and had to leave at 4:00am in the morning! So I left in a hurry at dark thirty! Didn't get to make the bed or wash my glass! Sorry Lillian!
60999	1039766	8.0	10.0	14514218	"I had a comfortable stay at Lillian's place. It is awesome to be so close to everything on Capitol Hill and downtown. I didn't see Lillian much because I was busy but she was very helpful. This was my second stay at her place and I would stay here again.

61000	1039766	8.0	10.0	14657472	This was a short but very nice stay on Capitol Hill for me. Lillian is so nice and everything is perfect in the house, near the bus stop and downtown. Thanks again !

61002	1039766	8.0	10.0	14847952	Lillian's home is located two blocks from Broadway, where restaurants and coffee places abound. Her home is clean and she is a friendly hostess. 
61003	1039766	8.0	10.0	15304248	"Lillian est une excellente hôte! Elle peut prendre le temps de répondre à vos questions sur la ville et elle est sympathique et très discrète. La chambre est d'une belle grandeur pour un voyageur seul et très propre. Son appartement est parfaitement bien situé dans le quartier Capitoll Hill, près des rues commerciales mais assez loin pour y être tranquille. J'ai vraiment apprécié y rester durant mon voyage de 10 jours à Seattle.
--------
Lilian was an excellent host. She is open to answers questions about the city or chat with you if you want and she's very discreet too. The room is large and the appartement is kept very clean. Her apartment is perfectly located in the neighborhood Capitoll Hill, near commercial street but far enough to be quiet. I really enjoyed my stay there during my 10-days trip."
61004	1039766	8.0	10.0	16197721	"   The bedroom has enough room, a street front window with good ventilation and a fan, a good collection of brochures on the city, and a selection of books for evening reading.  The living room is spacious with a wide-screen television.  The kitchen and bathroom are adequate.  Security is very good.  The street is tree-lined, with jasmine in bloom while I was there.  The location is wonderful: a couple minutes from four different bus lines to various parts of the city, with two ending in the center of the Downtown after a bus ride of about ten minutes.  These lines also run west to Seattle Center with the Space Needle and other attractions, north past Volunteer Park with the Seattle Asian Arts Museum and its conservatory and to University of Washington campus, and south past the northern end of the International District-Chinatown.  A high-end supermarket is close, a four-minute walk; a cheaper Safeway is a couple of stops away on one of the bus lines.  Overall, a comfortable stay in a very fine location.

61005	1039766	8.0	10.0	17209012	"I had a great time with Lily. Communication with her before rival was great, she helped me find my way to the house. The room is as described, and I slept very well on the big bed. For warm nights there's a fan. I really enjoyed the time there. Lily is a great host, who gave me a bunch of tips and was always helpful. I regret I could not stay longer with her.
The location is perfect, you can't be in a better spot on capitol hill, walking distance to all the bars and restaurants.... I hope I can stay with her again when I come back!"
61006	1039766	8.0	10.0	18236116	"Honestly, I was disappointed. Lillian is a lovely person and I know that she truly tried to give me a good experience, but it was not at all what I was expecting. It is definitely a good value and a GREAT location, but the worst part (for me) was that the entire apartment smells really badly of cat/cat litter. I think the smell was probably the worst part for me to be honest. It also wasn't as clean as the picture makes it seem....just  heads up. 

For the price some of these things may be OK, and like I said Lillian is really very sweet. But just a heads up!"
61007	1039766	8.0	10.0	18443510	"Lillian is an excellent host--helpful and unobtrusive. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was marvelous. I'm a walker, so I was able get downtown easily on my own, but public transportation was also easy to access from the neighborhood.

61012	1039766	8.0	10.0	20497933	Lily's apartment was a great place to stay within a very short walk of Capitol Hill! I've mostly stayed in Airbnbs in Brooklyn previously, many of which were entire places that weren't lived in and basically felt like hotel rooms. This was obviously a bit of a different situation, as a spare room in a lived-in apartment, but that made it feel like a more authentic way to see what it would be like to live in Seattle. We only ran into Lily a couple times, but she was super nice and really communicative during our stay! Would definitely stay here again.

It's a very cool part of town with lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The room is simple and not big on luxury. Don't expect a hotel-like stay, but if you are planning on spending most of your time exploring the city it's perfect."

61058	1039766	8.0	10.0	35788988	"Lillian was a great host. She made sure my late-night arrival was easy. She was very welcoming and answered all of my touristy questions.  

The apartment is in a great neighborhood... short walking distance to so much good food and coffee. Some of my favorites within walking distance - Glo's (amazing eggs benedict), Analog Coffee, Vivace Coffee, Cafe Solstice (cheap/yummy breakfast sandwiches) and Melrose Market (delicious wine + cheese counter). 

I even walked to the Space Needle one day! (It's about 1.5 miles - a good distance but worth it.) 

You are truly in the heart of Capitol Hill when you stay with Lillian. 

I can't wait to visit Seattle again!  "
61059	1039766	8.0	10.0	36206653	Lily is really nice and accommodating to your schedule. Great location within walking distance of downtown. However it could use a deep clean across the board.
61060	1039766	8.0	10.0	36589779	The place is exactly as pictured, and is clean and neat.  Lillian provided directions from the airport  to her place by public transportation, and was waiting to greet me when I arrived.  Her place is only one block from Broadway, which is the fun and lively heart of Capitol Hill.  There's a great used bookstore down the street.  It was only a 20 minute walk (downhill) into downtown and on the way you can meander past the Starbuck's Tasting Room and Serious Pie.  I'd be happy to stay here again.  
61061	1039766	8.0	10.0	36877847	Lillian made me feel very welcome and was most accommodating. The neighborhood is excellent with easy access to a bus that goes downtown and restaurants just steps away. There's a reading light and a fan in the room, and the bed is very comfortable. There's a closet for hanging clothes.
61062	1039766	8.0	10.0	37179353	"Lily was a great host who makes you feel like home from the first minute of your arrival. 

The listing is as described, room is basic and location could not be any better. The room gets some street noise and with the lack of an AC, it may get a bit uncomfortable if it is too hot out there. Fortunately that does not really happen that often in Seattle. "
61063	1039766	8.0	10.0	38132250	Lily welcomed me on a day of arrival and gave a tour of the house. She is attentive and helpful host. Room was exactly as described in listing, the location is great - close to park, restaurants and PRONTO station (bike-share). 
61064	1039766	8.0	10.0	39634377	The host was very nice and helpful who provided all the details about the house and neighbourhoods before you arrived. Cosy room and everything was exactly described in listing. It is definitely the place you wanna choose for your short vacation.
61065	1039766	8.0	10.0	40037519	Lillian was very nice and welcoming. She let me know quickly the details about the house and tips about getting around the neighborhood. Everything was accurate to the description in the listing. She was very accommodating and let me do my own thing. This is a nice, clean private room in a very good location in Seattle's capitol hill neighborhood.
61066	1039766	8.0	10.0	40239461	Great location and Lillian is friendly and helpful!
61067	1039766	8.0	10.0	40656209	"I felt very welcome upon arriving to Lillian's place. I usually woke up and turned in pretty early due to my work schedule while in the city. She is very helpful in getting you to her place and has loads of suggestions as to where to go. The room was comfortable and the mattress (memory foam!!!) was great to sleep in when paired with the clean sheets and cool Seattle air.

The neighborhood has a feel of a college town with older houses and plenty of bars and things to do everywhere. If you're going to primarily be walking or riding a bike beware of the hills.

Overall a great visit and very courteous and conscientious host. Would recommend for a stay."
61068	1039766	8.0	10.0	41086718	Lillian was very sweet and helpful thanks for letting us stay in your home 
61069	1039766	8.0	10.0	41927957	Lillian was a great host, she communicated with me from the start through the airbnb app and let me know of ways to get around the city. she greeted me and showed me around the house her home is a quaint little place. The room was great and very comfy. some street noise during the night but earplugs were provided so it wasn't an issue. the surrounding neighborhoods are lively with plenty of great places to eat at and shops around the area. She has a cat and with me having allergies it wasn't a problem at all. She made my first visit to Seattle wonderfull and go off without a hitch. Would recommend her and her home  to anyone thinking of taking a trip to Seattle. must try Americana brunch spot great breakfast meals.
61070	1039766	8.0	10.0	42252953	Lily was awesome! She was communicative, and really made the point to introduce herself and make me feel welcome. There is no AC, BUT even in one of the hottest months, I didn't mind it at all (this is also coming from a spoiled California boy). She really made the point to be super accommodating about my cat allergy, checking in and making sure I was comfortable. I also spilt a protein shake all over my pants, and she was very nice to allow me to use her washer and dryer. I would recommend this place to someone else, because it is in a convenience location, and Lily was great! Thank you!
61071	1039766	8.0	10.0	42528133	"Lillian was a wonderful host and her apartment is located just a 15-ish minute walk (downhill) to the city center; it is also located a block away from a few bus routes that will do the same. Just in case you want to take the bus, Lillian has a rotating transit card that can be reloaded.

The room looks just as it does in the pictures; quaint with a closet, phone charger, and fan - which was very appreciated in the summer! "
61072	1039766	8.0	10.0	42999713	Clean, quiet space for city adventuring. Adorable cat. Bed is slightly creaky with two people on it and so would recommend that sensitive sleeping couples (we're earplugs + face-mask people) be aware. Otherwise, super wonderful. 
61073	1039766	8.0	10.0	43300551	Lily was super friendly, and the room was very tidy. Excellent neighborhood too!
61074	1039766	8.0	10.0	43718391	The spot was clean and quiet and the cat was pretty cool. I didn't spend a lot of time at the apartment since I was wandering around Seattle most of time, which was very easy given the apartment's great location.
61075	1039766	8.0	10.0	44051794	Welcoming and friendly. Experienced host with all consideration taken care of
61076	1039766	8.0	10.0	44870935	comfy bed right in the heart of town. everything was great.
61077	1039766	8.0	10.0	45206131	Lillian was AWESOME, she's super down to Earth. Showed me where everything was, got me settled in and was an amazing host. Muushi was the best and sweetest cat too. I would definitely stay here again.  
61078	1039766	8.0	10.0	45644059	Great location and Lillian was very helpful!  Place is more rustic and in an older part of neighborhood. Good location to shops and bars. 
61079	1039766	8.0	10.0	46204244	Lilian is amazing. She made sure she disclosed everything about the house and the area. The house is pretty much centrally located so everything is either a walk or a bus ride away, which I loved. I wasn't home a lot since I was out exploring, but you definitely get what you pay for. Small quaint room, the bed was a bit squeaky, but other than that I loved it.
61080	1039766	8.0	10.0	46812906	Lily was a great host.  She was well organized and we communicated well many times before I arrived.  She welcomed me at the door and showed me around her place.  Smooth check in and check out.  She was very warm and friendly.  She was able to answer all my questions about the local area and guide me appropriately.  Her listing is as stated, a nice room in her home.  Her place was clean and tidy.  The Capitol Hill neighbourhood is a great central place to stay.  It was only a 15 minute walk to downtown, and a very nice one at that.  It was very safe walking around at any time of the day or night.  She lives right near a great grocery store.  It certainly was great value for the cost, as the local hotels start at $300 per night!  It was a great experience (my first one with airbnb) to have stayed in Lily's home - including using her kitchen for making breakfast.  Thank you for helping me learn about Uber and sharing your coupon with me Lily!!
61081	1039766	8.0	10.0	48519055	This was a prefect location --two blocks from a close friend's apartment-- and Lillian provided everything I needed. We didn't see much of each other, since I spent the time with my friend, but I loved her friendly cat!
61082	1039766	8.0	10.0	49076708	Lily is extremely kind and welcoming. The room is as advertised. Would recommend to anyone. 
61083	1039766	8.0	10.0	49738570	Lillian was great and Capitol Hill is a really cool area.
61084	1039766	8.0	10.0	50115457	Lillian is a polite, gracious host and her location is perfect! I loved walking the neighborhood and into downtown. It is walkable to a great Thai restaurant, smoothie shop, thrift stores and acupuncture clinic, as well as to Volunteer Park & the Asian Art Museum. A large grocery store and used bookstore is also nearby. I was very pleased and satisfied with my stay at Lillian's.
61085	1039766	8.0	10.0	50599347	Lillian is a very nice girl,she always check me if I need help. Good location also. She has a cat. But if you mind the smell of the cat, you'd better think again before booking.
61086	1039766	8.0	10.0	51103000	Was great. She was super helpful 
61087	1039766	8.0	10.0	52451759	I had a great time staying in Seattle with Lillian. This location in Capitol Hill is super convenient to both UW main campus/ UW Medical Center, Harborview medical Center, and the Seattle Downtown area. It was perfect for me since I had to be in multiple locations for an interview and also wanted to visit Downtown/pike place market and whatnot while I was there. The room was as described with a comfortable bed and fast reliable internet. As an added bonus, Lillian has an Orca card available for guests to use, as well as a clothing steamer! I also appreciated that the house has good water pressure. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a convenient location while in Seattle. 
61088	1039766	8.0	10.0	52949665	Lillian was quite accommodating, bed was comfortable and everything was clean. Great location!
61089	1039766	8.0	10.0	53411566	Great location! Easy to access Capitol Hill and the rest of Seattle from Lillian's place. Lillian was very easy to communicate with and was there for check-in right when she said she would be.
61090	1039766	8.0	10.0	53582549	Lillian was very welcoming and accommodating. I was able to check in early and park my car just in time for my dance competition that morning. Comfy bed. I'm so grateful that she had a washer and dryer available! I am not the best packer and didn't pack enough clothes for the weekend so yay for laundry! Full kitchen and yummy French press coffee. Thank you for a great stay!
61091	1039766	8.0	10.0	54343383	Lillian was a very gracious and accommodating host and her cat Mooshi was very sweet! 
61092	1039766	8.0	10.0	54560823	Great place to stay if you want to explore the city!
61093	1039766	8.0	10.0	55052852	Sweet host, great neighborhood. If you're looking for simple accommodations and a comfortable room in a great area, this is a great pick.
61094	1039766	8.0	10.0	55492911	The stay at Lillians place was nice and the location is very convenient, pretty close to downtown and a minute from a bus stop away. Lillian was also very helpful with answering questions about things to do in the city.
61095	1039766	8.0	10.0	56935428	Lilly was great to stay with! Her place was super convenient to everything and she went out of her way to help me out! It made my move to Seattle so much better! Highly recommend.
61534	8755762	8.0	10.0	54134121	Rah and his apartment were fabulous. Perfect location on Capitol Hill, close to nightlife, cafes, easy walk downtown or volunteer park. Although we never met (he left keys and a code) all of our communication was timely and pleasant. Plus he has the best wifi password ever. Recommend and would stay again. 
61535	8755762	8.0	10.0	54302477	"인테리어와 호스트분의 관대함은 만족하였으나,
청결 상태가 전반적으로 많이 미흡하였습니다.. 특히 샤워 후 몸 닦는 검정 타월은 최악이었습니다. 물도 닦이지 않고 검은 털이 몸에 다 묻어서 다시 씻을 정도였습니다.. "
61536	8755762	8.0	10.0	54475713	"The 4 of us stayed 1 night on our way to Portland. Great location and place in Capital Hill! Building lives up to its historic name and is very old, but it's clean and has well-lit hallways. The 1 bedroom's interior design is very unique and quite roomy. Bathroom has charm, but dated (the separate super hot and cold faucets were not ideal and no one opted to use the shower). However, having 2 sets of keys was useful!

Rah is very sweet and left us morning croissants, which the guys devoured enjoyably. He is quick to respond and always very cheery. I would suggest asking him specific questions, otherwise you might not get the whole answer at once (i.e. when asking about key exchange, we received an answer of building door code but without the actual code numbers...or when asking about WiFi, we just got the password but not the network name). In addition, Rah tried to be helpful when one of us lost his watch (thanks for checking).

On a side note, overnight parking is insanely hard to find (parkade was actually for students only), especially since we arrived late evening. We ended up just using the 2 hour spots for overnight and woke up at 8 AM to pay through the phone, so then at leasr we didn't need to move the car until 10 AM.

Overall, this is a great stay for 1 night. I really liked being able to walk home from a night out in Capital Hill. Thanks for hosting and all your help, Rah!"
61537	8755762	8.0	10.0	54899050	Rah was great! Very responsive to my messages and circled back the day I arrived to make sure everything was in order. I wanted to be in the Capital Hill neighborhood and his place was perfect for exploring the area. Great bars and restaurants and a lot of young people. Definitely would recommend if you're looking for a tastefully decorated flat in Cap Hill! 
61538	8755762	8.0	10.0	55055773	Great neighborhood and location. Capitol Hill has a lot to offer. Rah was super helpful and easy to communicate with. 
61539	8755762	8.0	10.0	55217999	It was great
61540	8755762	8.0	10.0	55662104	We loved staying in this flat!  Very unique and hip, as well as comfortable.  My wife and I loved the decor as well as the chandelier lights being on dimmers.  Only a 10 minute walk to the Paramount theater where we were going to a show.  Location overall was great, although parking was a bit of a pain.  We ended up paying $22 plus tax for 24 hours to stay in the lot a block up the same street (evening/overnight parking only goes until 8am) the parking garage across the street said we would have to be out by 7am to make room for the college students.  Raj was very easy to communicate with and answered texts promptly.  Next time we come to Seattle for a show, we will definitely try to stay here again!

thanks again.
alison | vancouver"
61542	8755762	8.0	10.0	56133794	Rah's place is in an absolutely perfect location. It is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, super close to all of the best bars, restaurants and shops and only a few minute walk from downtown. The place itself has its obvious charm and Rah has set it up in a way that makes you feel very cozy. It is noticeably old and is a bit smaller than you expect it to be. The bedroom isn't properly separated from the living room so there is no privacy if you have more than two staying, but the location, comfiness and interesting decorum more than overcome its shortcomings. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks Rah. 
61543	8755762	8.0	10.0	56608595	Rah's place is glam and so gorgeous!  It's perfectly located in Capitol Hill and walking distance to everything (Broadway, Pike, Pine, even Belltown and downtown if you feel like it). Rah was quick to respond to my questions and I truly felt right at home in his space (I didn't want to leave). I highly recommend staying here.
61544	8755762	8.0	10.0	56729440	The place was a great location in capital hill! Central to lots of amenities. Funky decor and super soft bed. 
61545	8755762	8.0	10.0	57308006	Rah's apartment in Seattle is great. It's really well located, with lots of good bars and restaurants within walking distance. We loved Honey Hole (a sandwich place), and Top Pot (a donut place/bakery). The apartment has a really cool feel and great decorations. Rah left us lots of local recommendations for things to do as well. Great place!
61546	8755762	8.0	10.0	57673106	"Staying at Rah's is certainly a unique Seattle experience with tons of personality. Located in the perfect spot just off bustling Pine Street, the unit is great for people who want to check out Capitol Hill and stay in walking distance of downtown and pike place.  It's an older building so things are a bit ""rustic"", but the decor makes it interesting and fun."
61547	8755762	8.0	10.0	58017735	Our ferry from Victoria was delayed three hours so we arrived quite late.  Rah sent us the code and made the key available so we could slip in and slide right into bed! And the neighborhood - Stumptown coffee was just around the corner along with shops and restaurants just as the ad said, so nice!  The space is certainly different and perhaps not my style however I know good interior design when I see it and this space has it going on!
61548	8755762	8.0	10.0	58321749	Great host!! The place is very cute and vintage, it's in the perfect area too. I will be staying again if the place is available
62616	9411935	8.0	9.0	54418964	Staying at Sebastian's was great.  The place was nice and clean and the location was excellent.  I would recommend to anyone, especially if you like night life and proximity to downtown.
62617	9411935	8.0	9.0	56699332	I was very comfortable with memory foam (perhaps?) Mattress. Sebastion was helpful, even with my luggage. The environment is clean. It is a very small studio. 
63564	1520549	8.0	10.0	9341956	The hacker house was a great place to stay for the 4 months that I was in Seattle. There are a lot of restaurants close by so one does not have to cook, but there's also a QFC within walking distance if cooking is your thing. The house does attract people in their mid-20s, so the cleanliness of the kitchen depends on those you live with. Otherwise, the house captain Matt keeps the place nice and organized. The walk to SLU is around 20-25 minutes, but the walk back is all uphill, so it might take longer. There are a lot of workspaces in the house. Overall, it's a really nice place to stay.
63565	1520549	8.0	10.0	11431143	I enjoyed my stay at hacker house. I felt very welcome. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hacker house to a friend. 
63566	1520549	8.0	10.0	18702488	Matt is awesome! Excellent location (20 mins walk to SLU) and people in the house. I spent three  months there during my summer internship.  However, the cleanliness wasn't good for the first two months (lots of fruit flies at the first floor). After getting weekly housekeeper, it became much better.
63567	1520549	8.0	10.0	49144234	Perfectly pleasant accommodations for a couple weeks while I was getting settled in the city. The house is definitely old and probably overdue for a remodel, but they've made it quite comfortable. The kitchen's a bit crowded with so many people sharing it, and some of the shared ingredients can be dodgy, so watch out for that. The fruit flies mentioned in previous reviews are still around, but kept mostly under control by the scheduled cleanings. The wifi was excellent and the people were all great.
64772	8212190	8.0	10.0	47137930	The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
64773	8212190	8.0	10.0	49503207	The house was adorable & the perfect setting for a girls night. It was comfy & we had a great time. Sabrina answered my questions quickly & was very accommodating. She even left a birthday greeting on the door for my sister. We would definitely stay here again.
64774	8212190	8.0	10.0	52782367	Wonderful house and wonderful host!  Sabrina was very responsive and made the stay very enjoyable !
64775	8212190	8.0	10.0	54110140	It was a great place and Sabrina was extremely kind and easy to deal with. Would love to stay again. Seahawks lost so that was a bummer. 
64776	8212190	8.0	10.0	54590203	Great location, very easy to find. The house is very warm and welcoming and we enjoyed our stay.
64777	8212190	8.0	10.0	56490161	My daughter and I were welcomed with a bottle of wine and lovely note to start off our Mother/Daughter weekend. The house was perfect for our stay. Ballard has great restaurants and the house is close to downtown. We were delighted with this property! 
64778	8212190	8.0	10.0	57527640	We had a great experience at Sabrina's home. It fit our family nicely! She had a lot to offer in the kitchen, in terms of utensils and cookware. Very cute and homey! 
67436	4664312	8.0	9.0	25341443	"Husband and I stayed at Tommy and Tim's place for 3 nights.  They were first time hosts and we were first time guests.

Bus Route 66 and 24-hour Safeway grocery are one block away.  Route 66 was $2.50 per person and a 30 min ride to downtown Seattle.

Friendly and easy going, kicked our butts in Wii Mario Kart.  2 big comfy and clean couches to sleep on with plenty of blankets and pillows.  

The bathroom is between Tommy and Tim's bedrooms- and they are perfectly fine with you walking through either of their rooms to get to the bathroom (even while they're sleeping).

We would stay there again."
67437	4664312	8.0	9.0	32040721	"Tim and his roommate had blankets and pillows all ready for us and offered some nice suggestions for places nearby. Close to the interstate for easy access to downtown. Would stay again.
"
67438	4664312	8.0	9.0	49539778	I spent a happy time in Seattle，Tim and Tommy are nice and cute
69822	8147215	8.0	10.0	50048442	Jaimee provided excellent service, the house is nestled on a quiet street with great beach access. We really enjoyed the stay, it's like a hidden pacific northwest gem. 
69823	8147215	8.0	10.0	51166070	"Our stay at Jaimee's beautiful home was great. This property is perfectly situated in the beautiful North Beach area just North of Seattle. The home decor and layout are great and allow you to feel right at home. The backyard of the property is beautiful and provided for some of our fondest memories of our trip to Seattle. During our stay Jaimee was not available but we were assisted by the ""Pillow"" management staff and they were very helpful and communicative during our stay. We ran into a small maintenance issue which was resolved within hours of us bringing it to their attention. I highly recommend this property and will definitely look to book it during our next trip to Seattle. "
69824	8147215	8.0	10.0	53557966	Jaimee's place was great – super comfortable and great vibes. The house had everything we needed and close enough to all necessary things. The price was right for the location – meaning it's a decent walk to the grocery, so you may need a car. And there is a 3rd Party service called Pillow that manages the listing – they're responsive/attentive if you have issues or questions (though it feels a little less personal than most Airbnb's, it works!)
69825	8147215	8.0	10.0	54324186	We loved the beautiful cozy home with great art on the walls.  It was the perfect size for four persons.  The home is in an lovely quiet neighborhood with a short walk to the waterfront.  The front and back yards are private and (website hidden) on the gourmet stove was a treat.   We travel often to Seattle to visit our granddaughter and daughter, so we appreciated finding this little gem.  We definitely will check for availability at this adorable place next time we are in town.
69917	7219541	8.0	8.0	42778299	We had a nice stay at Mie's house.  The room was clean, quiet, and was in a good neighborhood.  We would stay there again.
70003	6629657	8.0	9.0	35436487	Kirsten was a great host.  She took my request the same day.  She was very easy to communicate with.  The room was perfect an comfortable.  
70004	6629657	8.0	9.0	36154479	The room was clean & cozy just like in the pictures. Decent size room for the price. The area also felt safe enough to go for a run. REAL friendly environment.

70008	6629657	8.0	9.0	40461107	Kirsten is a wonderful host and the rooms are really nice.
70009	6629657	8.0	9.0	42565113	The room is exactly as shown and all basics are covered. Kirsten was polite and helpful. The location is a little bit far from downtown if you don't have a car but there's a direct bus line very close by that makes it easy, just plan for more time. The area is safe and close to a park with good hiking.
70010	6629657	8.0	9.0	42989480	Kirsten's place is conveniently located, 15min by drive from downtown. The room is well sized and the bed is comfortable for 2 people. Kirsten was out of town when we got to the house but she provided all the info before hand and was quick to reply any questions. 
70011	6629657	8.0	9.0	45029458	"Nice experience.  I'd never done just a room before so wasn't sure what to expect.  (I didn't expect the dog but she was friendly.)

The location is excellent -- really convenient to Greenwood and Ballard areas, and not terribly far from I-5 and the university.

The room was exactly as described.  Nothing was lacking: there was soap, shampoo and a towel; internet was a little flaky but usable; there was parking right at the house.  I had a key so I could come and go as I pleased.

The bed was comfortable and the house was quiet.  There is a bathroom shared with other guests so you do have to factor in some possible waiting for the bathroom.  Not a surprise.

There was one mixup with the keys not being immediately available upon my arrival, but Kirsten got on it and within a few minutes had things sorted out and I was able to get in, unpack my stuff and get a key.

At the end of my stay we had a rather powerful wind storm that knocked out power.  Kirsten notified me by phone and had made arrangements for flashlights etc.  I thought that attention to detail was a nice touch.

These are not luxury accommodations, this is a single room in a modest house.  But for what it is, it's a decent value and Kirsten seems to have thought of everything a visitor might need."
70012	6629657	8.0	9.0	45634876	Kirsten was a great host and the room was as described both comfortable and homey.  Location is very convenient to downtown, with lots of stores in the area and in a safe neighborhood.  Highly recommend.
70013	6629657	8.0	9.0	45911556	Great spot! The pup was a nice touch :)
70014	6629657	8.0	9.0	46461060	I stayed with Kirsten a few nights. The house itself is very nice and the room was clean and organized when I arrived. Bathroom is right across the hall and was clean and presentable. Her dog is very friendly but will leave you alone if you want. House is in a nice neighborhood a block away from major streets. Would gladly stay again.
70015	6629657	8.0	9.0	46658307	Kirsten's place is cozy, the room was comfortable and her pup is really cute and friendly! I would definitely stay here again.
70016	6629657	8.0	9.0	46831530	Very easy place to stay. Simple with a comfortable bed. Kirsten communicated well with me although I did not meet her during my short stay.
70017	6629657	8.0	9.0	47405861	"Kirsten was easy to communicate with when planing my arrival. I chose this area to get an idea of the area during a trip for a job interview. 
Overall I felt very awkward about being in a strangers house and think if I use Airbnb again it will be for a full unoccupied home.
As noted in previous reviews, her dog is friendly and adorable. The best part of the stay, really.
Things I would do differently if I choose to host would be to introduce myself to the guests, clean the bathroom/take out the bathroom trash, vacuum the bedroom floor before a guest's arrival and pull out fresh linens so guests don't have to awkwardly pilfer the ""linen closet"" for a clean towel."
70018	6629657	8.0	9.0	48598463	Kirsten was great at keeping in communication. I felt comfortable and at ease at her place. Fell in love with her dog Cali. Loved Carkeek park! So happy I was able to visit. 
70019	6629657	8.0	9.0	49787353	"Kirsten was a nice host we had some nice conversations when I spoke to her in her home. She gave me all the basic things I needed the room was clean, bathroom was across the hall, WiFi was very good, had a very playful dog named cali. From Seattle it was a 20min drive in an uber and 45min give or take by bus and hopping on the link. The neighborhood was fine I walked around at night to a local resturant just fine.

Some things for the host to improve. Maybe to be a little less shy I had to approach her to introduce myself and touch base. Had to approach her to ask for water I felt little things like that should be offered the vibe felt like it was more of a hotel then staying at someone's house."
70020	6629657	8.0	9.0	49965720	Short and sweet.  Kirsten was very accommodating to my last minute booking for just one night.  Communication was very fast and made things simple.  
70122	3263722	8.0	9.0	16161482	We had a very comfortable stay. 
70123	3263722	8.0	9.0	16358922	"The house was great for our group of 4 people. It was convenient to have QFC for groceries and some restaurants nearby. It was also pretty quick to get downtown in the morning - I think it took about 20 minutes on average during morning rush hour. 

While the general items provided are minimal (meaning for a group larger than 4 you might have a hard time making dinner with the provided cookware and bedding will be sparse) we were able to make it work well."
70124	3263722	8.0	9.0	17282549	The house is great and the host is warm and considerate. We have a very nice stay there. 
70125	3263722	8.0	9.0	18680498	We had a pleasant stay and it suited our needs. Thank you.
70126	3263722	8.0	9.0	28883365	Good experience, would reserve again.
70127	3263722	8.0	9.0	29030681	The reservation was canceled 54 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
70801	3925572	8.0	9.0	40453034	Sean was easy to communicate with, flexible about arrival and departure, and responsive to needs.  The house was clean, convenient and exactly as shown in pictures.  I had a good stay.
70802	3925572	8.0	9.0	41838154	It was a really nice place to stay, the description is accurate, you can take a bus to downtown right at the door, or walk for 10 minutes to take a bus to space needle, really nice people, nice room and living space
70803	3925572	8.0	9.0	42796461	Sean was a great host! We experienced a ton of traffic getting into Seattle, but Sean was really easy going and accommodating. The location is in a quiet residential space, close to the delicious Ballard district, and easy to get to. We were driving to Vancouver the next day so being north of the city was an ideal location. Plus, it's close to Discovery Park, which has great trails and a running path along the beach. We got to briefly meet Sean, and he was really friendly and even made us tea in the morning. If you're looking for an easy stay in Seattle, definitely recommended!
76641	1002835	8.0	10.0	13316215	Cristina's condo was perfect for our 3 week stay so we could get acquainted with Seattle while looking for a permanent apartment.  The condo was conveniently located to several bus lines, Washington Park, close to eateries and the supermarket, and was fully equipped with everything we needed for cooking, cleaning, etc.  Cristina was very responsive with communication and I would definitely recommend her as a hostess.  
76642	1002835	8.0	10.0	18702192	Stayed here for three months - it was great. Very good location, accommodating host who wasn't nosy at all but still attentive. I had a great time staying here, would recommend it.
76643	1002835	8.0	10.0	25267687	"El barrio donde está ubicado es lo mejor de este apartamento. 
El lugar definitivamente no está bien mantenido y presentado y el servicio brindado por Cristina no es bueno ya que ella no está viviendo en Seattle y no está al tanto de cómo se encuentra el apartamento verdaderamente. Cuando llegamos el apartamento estaba cerrado y la primera noche pasamos mucho frio cosa que por suerte con el paso de los dias se fue solucionando. No habia toallas en el lugar y luego nos trajeron un juego solamente con lo cual estaba muy justo. Tampoco habia frazadas inicialmente pero luego fueron provistas. 
Respecto a la descripcion del apartamento yo no habia leido que era acceso solo por escalera descubierta y en las fotos se ve un LED TV que no se encuentra ahi. 
Tuve que comunicarme con Cristina varias veces para ir solucionando las cosas que iban apareciendo, lo que hizo que no pueda disfrutar mi estadia como corresponde y hubo algo que me molesto mucho de su lado cuando en una de las conversaciones me dijo que Airbnb no es un hotel.... Para mí este no es el espíritu de alguien que quiere alojar y hacer sentir cómo a alguien en su casa.
"
76644	1002835	8.0	10.0	32117564	We stayed at this condo for a full month when transitioning between houses in the Seattle area. It was a nice clean unit with plenty of space, a good kitchen and a nice bunk bed second bed room for our two kids to share. So the unit is nice, but the location is really the big sell here. It's surrounded by some nice places to eat out (and Essential Bakery right across the street) and the arboretum is in easy walking distance which is a great place for a walk or jog. And from right outside the place there are easy bus lines to Cap hill, downtown, u-district and lots of other fun locations. It was an excellent place to stay for us. The host was very helpful about several aspects of our stay and even helped to take care of a bit of paperwork for us (we had to list our temporary residence when applying for a loan on our new house and she provided a letter for this).
76645	1002835	8.0	10.0	44541845	"The apt is in a good location. There are restaurants and cafes nearby.  A Safeway grocery store is 8 min walk and TJs is 16 min walk. Both have parking. We took a very nice walk north of the apt thru the arboretum and along the waterfront across from the UW stadium.  About 3.5 miles away and a $8 uber ride back to the apt.  Buses stop right at the apt to get downtown. 

The apt served our family well but it is very basic and smaller then I expected. If you are a light sleeper and sensitive to noise and/or light bring earplugs and/or eye mask.  The apt is on a busy street and there was a surprisingly large amount of traffic all night.  The nights were warm so we kept the windows open and thus could hear the traffic. The street lights come thru the translucent plastic louvered blinds so the bedrooms don't get dark at night. 

Having laundry facilities was a plus but remember to get change, you'll need 5 quarters for each wash and each dry. "
76646	1002835	8.0	10.0	57115887	Cristina's place is lovely - it was just as described and had all the required amenities. We had a great time staying there for 3 months and hoping to be back soon.
78568	8463726	8.0	10.0	49579729	Jennifer was a lovely host. She had recently just moved to the area so was still familiarizing herself, however she did take us up to the rooftop patio at night and it was stunning! We stayed up late in the night talking and visiting like we were old friends. We were made to feel very much at home! 
78569	8463726	8.0	10.0	50414886	This Airbnb is in a brand new apartment building that is very stylish and modern looking with lots of interesting artwork on the hallway walls. Jennifer was a wonderful host and very thorough in showing where everything was and where to go in the building.  She even showed me the rooftop lounge and firepit that was really great to hang out there in the evening time.  The private room had minimal things in it,  but the bed was comfortable and I could get good rest. There is a small desk in the living room area that was nice when doing any computer work.  The kitchen was new and very clean with most everything you need.  Overall,  a very nice experience and I would stay there again. 
78570	8463726	8.0	10.0	51409594	"Jennifer's place is well located and the building is brand-new.
The room is a bit small but for one person it's ok.

"
78571	8463726	8.0	10.0	52450310	"Jenny's  place is a brand-new complex right in the middle of the Wallingford area of Seattle. Plenty of restaurants, live music, pubs, and bars within a short walk. The rooftop hangout area is excellent! 
A very quiet apartment, and Jenny is quite busy, so easy to rest. 
It's a rather small place, but the room is fine. Seattle can get cold, so the room has it's own built-in heat and thermostat. 
This is a great place for a busy work traveler, or someone who is looking to be out and about most of the time."
78572	8463726	8.0	10.0	56266439	"Jennifer was great; super friendly.  I had everything I needed in the apartment.  The apartment was clean, conveniently located, quiet.  No problems at all.  I'd definitely consider returning here next time I'm in Seattle.
