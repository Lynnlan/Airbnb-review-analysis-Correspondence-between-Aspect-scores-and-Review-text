Contacted four hosts, and Chris was the only one responded, and responded in time! He apologized for not being able to show me around because his band had a major show during that weekend. (Guys- they do have a GREAT taste in music- come here if you do, too)

The house is in a great neighborhood. You have Trader Joe's right across the street, literally. AND lots of fantastic restaurants, cafe, gift stores, etc. surrounded. This would be the perfect neighborhood to live in. All the things- within walking distance.

You'll be sharing a bathroom with other roommates (but that wasn't a problem for me at all). If you're looking for a place to crash that's within walking distance to everything, this is perfect for you.

I'm very happy with my stay, and hope other guests enjoy the location as well. :)"

Big Friendly house,cosy bedroom in a lively and vibrant neighborhood full of cafes and bars, amazing to chill out in the morning before walking downtown in just over half hour. Chris was also a very sweet host, he came to see me when I arrived to Seattle, gave me the keys and directed me to his house because he was working at that time. 
During my stay I was out all day but we had a few good chat at night. He's really a good fellow! Great music taste and very easy to get along with.
I promised my self to be back in Seattle again and I'll definitely stay at his again!"
1260	5062445	8.0	10.0	35270046	Great location.  Good food nearby and easy bus access.  DEFINITELY give this place a chance.  Chris is super accommodating and if your schedules align is great hang as well.
1261	5062445	8.0	10.0	42254182	Christ is such a nice guy. He gave me a very warm welcome on my first day in Seattle. Introduced the neighborhood and told me a lot of staff about his music. The place is lovely and so quiet at night. I had a memorable stay because of this cute home. And the location is wonderful. Very close to downtown. Just few minutes away. I would definitely recommend Christ's place!
1262	5062445	8.0	10.0	45416946	"Chris is awesome!  Very friendly and welcoming.  Really dig the house and the neighborhood.  

Great location, loved the vibe of the neighborhood and having Trader Joe's and El Diablo Coffee right there.  "
1263	5062445	8.0	10.0	46167437	Chris and his roommates were great hosts! They were very friendly, accommodating, and fun. I traveled to Seattle alone and they made it so I did not feel lonely. The house is located very conveniently to downtown, I did not have a car while I was in Seattle and managed to get around just fine via public transit (and the occasional Uber). I definitely recommend staying at Chris's if you are looking for an affordable and convenient location in Seattle!

Located in the lovely Ballard neighborhood, Lauren's B&B is only a 10 minute drive from popular downtown locations including the Space Needle, is next to a 7-11 convenience store for quick restock, and is within walking distance of awesome Ballard shops. Lauren and Gabriel are also super friendly too! 

Highly recommended especially if you are planning to explore Seattle with a car"

2062	4258515	8.0	9.0	34231248	"Lauren, Gabe, and their children were great hosts during our stay in Seattle. I had previously used an airbnb location in Magnolia which I loved, but it was booked this time around so I hoped Lauren and Gabe's place in Ballard would be as wonderful and it did not disappoint.

Extremely safe neighborhood, extremely close to many big bus lines including 2 direct lines to downtown, and there is even a downtown area a few blocks down from the apartment with major nightlife of its own. 

I didn't spend much time in the apartment during the day but it was a quiet place to sleep which looked exactly like the pictures and I slept more soundly than I ever do at home.

Thank you Lauren and family! :)"
2063	4258515	8.0	9.0	34615698	I appreciate Lauren accommodating us (party of 4) in such short notice. Lauren is pleasant, hospitable, flexible, and unobtrusive. Her home is located in the heart of Ballard near area amenities and attractions. The rooftop deck offers a relaxing oasis above the city streets. Overall, a prime spot with a fantastic host.
2064	4258515	8.0	9.0	36162911	The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2065	4258515	8.0	9.0	36700705	"Lauren and her family were the perfect hosts! Their place in Ballard is comfy, clean and modern and her family were very welcoming and very lovely! 

The location is fantastic, close to so many bars and restaurants, perfectly safe and minutes away from the downtown bus. 

We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle! "
2066	4258515	8.0	9.0	37707338	Lauren was very kind and accommodating. My friends and I loved the neighbourhood! 
2067	4258515	8.0	9.0	38134616	This is the worst experience with Airbnb, we shared a two bedrooms with Lauren's faimillies with 3 kids and a dog, they go out of their bedroom then we are out of the apartment and go back to the bedroom when we come back, which makes us feel not friendly and uneasy, well we still smell the unpleasant smell of the dog. They didn't wash their dishes and damp the gabage bin  in time as well in the kitchen. The most unfriendly thing is that we can not even leave our heavy bags at her home after 11:00 in the morning of the day we leave back home, which she has mentioned when I check in and let us feel very not friendly, and that is not imaginalble that we hadn't access to the WIFI in such a modern day! I will never come back and live in any Airbnb apartments!
2068	4258515	8.0	9.0	39660914	Lauren's kids are adorable and the free parking was great and it was also great to be able to walk to old Ballard neighborhood and all the seaside parts on Puget Sound. What a fun city!
2069	4258515	8.0	9.0	39950203	Lauren was very kind during our stay. The room is clean and the location is close to lots of fun restaurants and shops in the Ballard area. 
2070	4258515	8.0	9.0	40460705	Lauren and her husband were very welcoming and helpful! I was admittedly a little wary as this was our first time using Airbnb but everything went smoothly. We had 4 adults packed into the room so it was a little tight but we made due. The 3 kids were all very well behaved and quiet.
2071	4258515	8.0	9.0	40858427	Lauren and Gabe's place was in a great location. It was safe and secure and both of them were very kind and friendly. Having a parking space available was a huge bonus!
2072	4258515	8.0	9.0	40974304	Thank Gabe and Lauren for waiting us until midnight. The apartment is very nice. The room was very clean. It was a nice experience!
2073	4258515	8.0	9.0	41630323	Overall, we had a great experience! We were only looking for a place to sleep for a cheap price in a clean place - this is exactly what we found! The place is right next to a RapidRide bus stop, which was perfect for getting downtown. There were a ton of shops, cafes, and restaurants a walk down the street. Lauren and her family were very sweet and helpful. They pretty much just let us do our own thing and gave us plenty of privacy, which was fine! Our room was clean and quaint. The fans in the room kept it at the perfect temperature. The only thing that was kind of a hassle was when my friend went back to the condo during the day to use the restroom and the dogs were in there. He didn't want to mess with them, so he had to go somewhere else - but obviously this is not a big deal, just something to communicate! Like I said, we had a great experience!
2074	4258515	8.0	9.0	41939678	Lauren and her family went out of their way to make our experience comfortable and convenient. The space was small, but nice. Thank you!
2075	4258515	8.0	9.0	43508721	Lauren's place was perfect for where we wanted to be in Ballard.. Easy walk to stores, restaurants and bars.  Easy access to buses for a quick trip downtown .. Very nice host with all of the accommodations we needed
2076	4258515	8.0	9.0	43734942	Lauren and Gabe are excellent hosts. The whole place was beautiful and very clean, laundry access was a big plus, dinner on the rooftop was fun. The family was real quiet and accommodating. Highly recommend staying here if you're willing to share a space with the hosts. 
2077	4258515	8.0	9.0	48478264	"This place is in a great location in Ballard! The rooftop area with bbq is quite nice and if you have time to use the small gym, it also looked nice! 
The apartment itself was, however, a bit of a disappointment. Just very awkward... Basically this is their 3 small children's bedroom complete  with bunk beds and hard mattresses that becomes your room.  I am not opposed to bunk beds. The hard mattress, however,  was not great nor was I sure the blankets on the shelves were clean. The first one I pulled out did not smell at all good.  There was nothing but a fitted sheet on the bed. No pillow. Nothing. I didn't think there was a door at all when I arrived because it slides along the wall with no way to lock it. 
While Gabe was friendly and took me on a little tour when I got there, I didn't find Lauren particularly nice. 
You have to walk across the kitchen and living area to get to your room. (All five of them and the two dogs retreat to the other bedroom.) 
There is a hamster or gerbil with a squeaky wheel that I listened to for a while that night. At some point he was also brought into their room. I was grateful for that but, again, just awkward... Quite easy to feel like you are inconveniencing them. 
The bathroom is over next to their room. The thought of taking up the bathroom with five other people waiting was a bit off putting. I did not shower. 
In addition, while I think it's a great thing to homeschool, knowing all three kids were home all the time and I was occupying their room did not leave me feeling secure or that my things would be left untouched by little hands, even if the kids were all very sweet. (They're still small curious children.) 
I did not complete my stay. In fact I only stayed one night of the three I'd booked. It was all just too awkward... Thank you, Gabe, for trying. 
I really hesitated in leaving a review but I got numerous reminders to please do so from airbnb and I guess I feel other people should know my experience. I texted Lauren twice upon my departure to talk to her about my experience. She did get back to me. Kind of the attitude I found from her while I was there as well. I'm sorry it couldn't be a more positive review."
2078	4258515	8.0	9.0	49708595	The perfect spot to stay in if you're looking to explore the Ballard area. We really enjoyed our stay here, and would definitely stay here again. Very clean and easy to get to. No Wi-Fi in the house though, but easy to find at local cafes and bars and breweries. And there are a lot of breweries nearby!
2079	4258515	8.0	9.0	50052961	Awful experience! I was looking forward to staying at Lauren's; however, she was unresponsive, and after several hours, I let her know that if I didn't hear from her I'd have to make a reservation with a different host. She did not reply to that message until after I had made another reservation. I requested she cancel the reservation as it was the fair thing to do. Only THEN did I get a reply that basically stated she has a strict cancelation policy, refusing to work with me. Note she has a mere 40% response rate. I feel absolutely cheated by her and airbnb.  Avoid. 
3377	6337492	8.0	10.0	32633184	"We were in Seattle for the weekend to participate in my great friends wedding and Katelynn's apartment made everything that much more special. Thank you Katelynn for hosting us in your home. We had a great experience, private apartment, walking distance to everything (including my friend's wedding location!), cozy and comfortable. Katelynn was great to work with and communicated everything clearly and timely. She is kind and thoughtful (The ""In case you forgot something!"" Assortment of extra toothpaste, shampoo toothbrushes etc was a great touch!), we really appreciate and enjoyed our stay. "
3378	6337492	8.0	10.0	32937526	A great little apartment that fit the needs of my stay perfectly. Had an excellent overnight stay, and the host was readily available over email to answer any questions we had. 
3379	6337492	8.0	10.0	33036911	Katelynn was a great host. Very helpful and quick at answering questions. The space was clean and quiet. We love the Ballard area and her place was in a very convenient location to walk to stores, restaurants and the farmer's market! Also a short drive to University Village, Downtown, Capital Hill etc. Thanks Katelynn!
3380	6337492	8.0	10.0	33198865	Katelynn was very responsive via Airbnb and text with our last minute reservation for Memorial Day weekend. Being that it was last minute we were back to back with a previous reservation and there wasn't time for her to do an inspection or cleanup after the previous airbnbers, so it wasn't a spick-and-span kind of arrangement. Sheets and towels were in the dryer so they were cleaned already, we just had to put them on the bed ourselves. The place was tidy, although visibly not entirely clean being that someone had just stayed there the night before. The neighborhood feels safe and cozy and in walking distance to the very entertaining Ballard streets and parking was a breeze. Since we were the last to stay in the apartment, we did our best to tidy things that may have been left behind by others before us that we didn't use, like cleaned laundry. It's a great neighborhood and place to stay, although we would have preferred it a bit cleaner and better prepared before our arrival, but for the length of time and short notice it was great for the price. 
3381	6337492	8.0	10.0	50188203	She was very communicative.  Everything was set up just as she said and It was a great experience. 
4325	3155785	8.0	9.0	42231253	Kim was great and responsive to meeting up to handoff the key, provide the address, etc.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was a single female traveling alone and felt very safe at Kim and her roommate's place.
4326	3155785	8.0	9.0	42629386	I loved staying with Kim.  She was a great host and the retro vintage house is exactly as advertised.  My room had a private bathroom which made the stay even better.  Highly recommended!
4327	3155785	8.0	9.0	43310332	Kim was warm, friendly, and real. Thanks, Kim! The room I rented was big and clean. It had its own bathroom with shower! I liked the diverse pictures and sculptures through the place.  And I guess I like short sentences. 
4328	3155785	8.0	9.0	46005974	I did not meet Kim during my visit. I stayed in her room while she was out of town. The room is nice and the bathroom and shower were fine. I only briefly met the other roommates. 
8342	4130112	8.0	8.0	20272324	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8343	4130112	8.0	8.0	29987890	Jordan's place was great. The house was as advertised and the hot tub and grill made it a nice place to come home to after a long day's work.
9388	3732103	8.0	9.0	17317244	This place was great. Andrew and his team are still ramping up, but already, the place has some great amenities and an energetic atmosphere. I'm going to call out the comfortable beds (high thread counts, mmm) and the two huge kitchens.
9389	3732103	8.0	9.0	17655281	"I arrived early in Seattle and they were able to check me in well before the check in time which I really appreciated. The room had 2 bunk beds of which only had one person living on top of me so it wasn't crowded at all. The house is well maintained and clean and they provided with a towel, free laundry, wifi and a nice couch to sit while not doing anything.
The location was also great within walking distance to bus and gas works park. 
I enjoyed staying there."
9390	3732103	8.0	9.0	38048202	I loved my time in the house. It was an interesting mix of young people who are motivated and friendly. I would recommend this place highly if you're in your 20's and want to be around a group of smart people. I loved it so much that I came back to the house after I moved out just to hang out! Also- it is an amazing location walking distance to gas works park, easy to get onto I5, and you can see the lake from the house.
9391	3732103	8.0	9.0	40485476	For the two weeks I was here, the house as a whole was a fun place to be. It's filled with people working in various parts of the tech industry, who mostly seem to be there for at least a couple weeks, if not months, so they try to keep up the house and the community. I was sharing a room with three other women, which I knew when I booked it, but you should definitely be aware of - my roommates were all very nice, but you have to be ready to be sharing a room closely. The common areas of the house were well maintained, and I had a good time hanging out and interacting with other residents. I'd recommend this house to anyone looking for a community while they're in Seattle.
9392	3732103	8.0	9.0	42964749	"Great house captain and owner of house (Paul and Andy, respectively). Super sweet, helpful, open, and willing to work with me. House is full of loving souls who are working hard on their projects. 

What I especially appreciated was the heterogeneous quality of this particular ""startup home."" It's not a hacker home, thank god, so there are more than just IT/web/software/coder dudes there. When I was there, there were Amazon, Google and Microsoft interns, employees from established startups, people starting their own companies, accelerator (Tech Stars) residents, hardware folks, and even a physicist. There was a room for girls/women (occupancy: 4). There were techies and then people like me who are in marketing/business development. The mixed environment lent itself to some very interesting discussions and a free flow of thought, which we all leveraged in our newfound friendships and career connections. Andy even gave me some great VC names to run after who may back my invention.

Some caveats: if living in tight spaces isn't for you, this might not be your best bet. Also tough if you don't own a car, as the nearest grocery store (and attendant bars, restaurants, cafes, etc.) is a one mile hike uphill (carrying groceries over this distance or walking in the rain may prove onerous). Finally, realize that every resident's definition of ""clean"" will vary...and with two bathrooms (soon to be four) and three kitchens used by about 20 people (at capacity), that can be a bit challenging. At present, the house is cleaned once every three weeks. I suggested it be cleaned once a week for so many residents (especially as people keep rotating through and don't feel responsible to keep the place neat, as they know they are leaving shortly)...both Paul and Andy patiently heard my feedback and seemed amenable to improving the cleanliness situation.

Overall, I highly, highly recommend this place to earnest startup folks who want to get involved in the tight-knit upstart community in Seattle. Andy has created a very interesting concept here, which will no doubt keep growing, as it's backbone is a highly-democratized environment conducive to legendary brainstorming sessions, debates and conversations -- not to mention connections."
9393	3732103	8.0	9.0	45425279	I felt welcomed. Everyone was pretty friendly. I stayed for less than a week and was able to get work done as the house is pretty quiet and there is rarely anyone in common areas during the day. My roommate was pretty cool, had good conversations with her. Overall, it was a convenient for my time being. 
11348	7667990	8.0	10.0	46017328	Roie, was an excellent host! He responded to all my texts and emails in a very expedient manner. The property was exactly like it was in the listing---very clean, comfortable and cozy with a nice view of the Seattle skyline. The neighborhood was great---plenty of places to eat and hang out. Definitely recommend the property for couples who are looking to have a good time in the Emerald City!
12681	15108	8.0	9.0	358030	Bob was a great host. His house was very well located for our needs and we really enjoyed his private, tranquil backyard. He was even nice enough to post some clothing home we had mistakenly left behind.
12682	15108	8.0	9.0	396968	Bob was a great host. He was very accommodating, his home and the room were as described, and he was gracious enough to wait up and show me around when I said I would be arriving late. 
12683	15108	8.0	9.0	456716	What a neat place with a lovely backyard - great location, great host, great pets!
12684	15108	8.0	9.0	919284	A friendly place.  Thanks, Bob.
12685	15108	8.0	9.0	2693792	The place was comfortable and it was not difficult to go to the city by a car.  My best things in there is a lovely dog and cats. Super cute.Thanks for making us feel at home.  ありがとう！
12686	15108	8.0	9.0	3962261	Quiet, cozy home in a neighborhood.  Just 1/2 mile from my grandchildren.  On the bus line, easy walk to Green Lake.  Sweet pets, very clean and nice.  
12687	15108	8.0	9.0	4324698	"I am absolutely satisfied with Bob's plaсе. First, it is the best location in Seattle. Green lake- it is something amazing!! Its a perfect place for walking, jogging, bicycling , kayaking, taking pictures and every thing!!  There are a lot of cafes , restorans , but at the same time it's very picefull, not crowded place, very  convenient to get downtown and university district. Second, Bob-is great! Hi is  friendly, helpfull and welcoming like host  and  interesting like a person! And his lovely pets are so cute! 
Thank you, Bob! "
12688	15108	8.0	9.0	5155676	Bob's room was just what I needed. A quiet place to rest and work for a bit before heading to climb Rainier. Bob was welcoming and fun to talk to. He has a lovely backyard with so many cozy places to curl up and read. It was a treat to stay with him! 
12689	15108	8.0	9.0	5201006	We had a quick overnight stay and we had a great time.  Bob was wonderful and we loved the sweet cats! The location to Greenlake was convenient for a morning run and the backyard is fantastic! 
12690	15108	8.0	9.0	5352889	Bob is a great host. Comfortable house with nice downstairs bedroom, comfortable bed. Shared bathroom but not a problem to access. Very close to downtown Green Lake restaurants,  Thanks Bob!
12691	15108	8.0	9.0	5518324	"Real estate agents say, ""Location location location."" This charming home is, ""Location location location location location location."" Oh, did I mention it is in one of the best, hippest neighborhoods in the Seattle area? Green Lake is a scenic country oasis within the city of Seattle. 

I treated a 19 year-old German student, Jasper, to three nights at Bob's house because my place, and the timing, was impractical. Bob was enjoyable to do business with, albeit by phone, and it felt as though we were old pals. I look forward to meeting him in person. The accommodations were delightful as promised, according to Jasper. I did see the inside, and the yard, and agree. Although I am unfamiliar with the German language, I believe Jasper's ear-to-ear grin at Bob's house spoke volumes. "
12692	15108	8.0	9.0	5537121	Nice location. You're sharing the bathroom and house with college students. Bed is ultra firm.
12693	15108	8.0	9.0	5878538	We had a great time in Seattle at Bob's place. The room is nice and cozy, it was great to meet Bob and he gave us some excellent tips on what to do and see in Seattle. Definitely recommended.
12694	15108	8.0	9.0	5993299	I stayed at Bob's five nights and had a pleasant visit. Bob was friendly and helpful, very easygoing. The house is a bit outside Seattle's center but well connected by buses.The neighborhood is nice with a beautiful lake and park, and restaurants, close by. The room was comfortable enough and I had no problems with the other guests or using the bathroom. It's next to the kitchen and you can hear the conversations, but people were respectful and it was not an issue for me. The hot tub in the yard was wonderful in the evenings. It was a good experience and I would definetely stay at Bob's when I am in Seattle again. 
12695	15108	8.0	9.0	6337875	The house was comfortable, and the cats were lovely, but the garden was definitely the highlight. Thanks for being such a nice host, Bob, we'll definitely come down another time soon. :)
12696	15108	8.0	9.0	6377834	bob was wonderful. its extremely close to the lake and an easy taxi ride from most things.  def recommend staying with him and his two lovable cats
12697	15108	8.0	9.0	6440029	This was my first airbnb experience and i'm a fan.  Big thanks to Bob and for him sharing his nice room in Seattle.  He was very helpful in providing quick advice to local eateries and coffee shops as well as make my stay as comfortable and easy as possible.  If you stay here I advise you to check out Green Lake sunsets- stunning views only a few blocks away!
12698	15108	8.0	9.0	6481865	This room was in a great location and the room was clean and comfortable. A surprise bonus was the host Bob, who with his friendliness.generosity and openness made me feel instantly at home. Bob rents out more than one room in the house and I got the impression that it is always buzzing with activity and socializing!  This might not be a first choice for someone looking for quiet, alone time free of pets, but for me, it was a fun experience and I would definitely return! Thanks Bob!
12699	15108	8.0	9.0	6691479	"Bob was an incredibly chill and fun host. We felt very welcome at Bob's place, almost like family! We joined in on one of his many game nights and had a blast while there. He was very helpful, and also let us his kitchen pretty much every day, as well as his collection of spices and seasoning! 

I highly recommend staying at Bob's place if your passing through Seattle, or staying there longer term for school, etc. "
12700	15108	8.0	9.0	6782583	Bob was a gracious host whose location was ideal for me.  His other house members equally nice and sharing.  This was a fine entree back into Seattle after 7 years away.
12701	15108	8.0	9.0	8109789	Bob's place is a true community.  Besides the others rooming in the house, many of Bob's friends stop by for an evening  of pleasant talk and board games.  One can join in around the kitchen table or retreat to one's room without feeling pressured to participate.  Bob is an extraordinary raconteur as well as working actor, songster and piano player.  He is full of energy and skill.  The house is situated just a block from Green Lake which I am told is the busiest park in Washington.  Walking, jogging, or wheeling around the lake is a favorite form of exercise for what seems like the majority of north Seattle.  I stayed at Bob's for a month and a half.  I used the city transit for nearly all my travel and found it to be convenient.  Two major routes stop just a short block away and several others are nearby.  Restaurants, pubs,  Ben and Jerry's ice cream, coffee shops and a couple grocery stores are within walking distance.  Bottom line is I loved my stay and next time I'm in Seattle Bob will be first on my list for lodging.
12702	15108	8.0	9.0	8748809	Staying with Bob was wonderfull! Exceeded all my expectations. Thoroughly enjoyable and very relaxed. The cats are a treat and the hot tub is a dream and Bob will provide great entertainment and conversation. The bed was very comfortable, I didn't want to leave!!! I recommend staying with Bob highly. A home away from home.Thank you Bob, I can't wait to return!!
12703	15108	8.0	9.0	11300173	"The five weeks I spent at Bobs in Seattle passed way to fast! When I arrived I had a warm welcome with homemade soup and waffles. The kitchen was well equipped and it was fun to cook there. It was always fun to meet up for chats in the nice common areas with Bob, the other housemates, friends or the two lovely cats. Also the neighbourhood, Greenlake, is a good place if you are motivated to discover places that are not on every tourists schedule, such as Ballard, Wallingford, Ravenna or the University District - all easy accesible by bus.
Go ahead - if you wanna have a good time in Seattle, book a place at Bobs! :-)"
12704	15108	8.0	9.0	12414291	Very warm and welcoming place. No false advertisements  !!  
12705	15108	8.0	9.0	17264265	All in all it was an exceptional living experience with Bob! It was a friendly, quaint and welcome atmosphere with an awesome back yard to boot.
12706	15108	8.0	9.0	17399370	Bob met me at the door, very friendly and welcoming. The room was exactly as the pictures showed, the house was very charming and eclectic. I really want to know how he got that gorgeous grand piano in there!  He had towels laid out, fresh flowers on the nightstand, and played some great piano music I could hear while I was in the shower. :). His cats were so friendly one tried to stow away in my backpack. 
12707	15108	8.0	9.0	17606809	Bob was very welcoming and really helped us out by approving our stay at the last minute. We were only in the house for one night, so we spent very little time there. House is in a great location...walking distance to a couple bus stops and Green Lake. A little disappointed with the cleanliness of the house and room (the room smelled like cats and mildew). Also did not realize the house was shared with several other AirBnB guests, giving it a hostel feel. 
12708	15108	8.0	9.0	17868554	Bob was a gracious host, very friendly. We felt welcomed in his home and our needs for quiet time were considered. The house is in a great neighborhood in Seattle and has an awesome back yard. It is a little bit of a funky house and I would recommend coming prepared for that experience. Like most older houses, sound travels well. Any comers here should love cats, because there are two very present male kitties living here. 
12709	15108	8.0	9.0	17984735	Bob is friendly and welcoming. The neighborhood is cool. Before booking this place make sure your not annoyed by cat smell. 
12710	15108	8.0	9.0	18685637	Bobs place was in a great location. Close to Green Lake on a quite beautiful street!
12711	15108	8.0	9.0	19766648	We had a lovely time at Bob's house met his two nice cats! Bob is a fantastic nice host en we like to come back next year.
12712	15108	8.0	9.0	20660427	The house is great. Good location, near the beautiful Green Lake Park and close to bus stops. Bob is an amazing host, very friendly and willing to go out of his way to help you. The bed is very nice, the bathroom clean, the kitchen fully equipped. I honestly wish I could have stayed more time.
12713	15108	8.0	9.0	21189557	Bob was very kind and accommodating in letting me stay at his home on last minute's notice, though we really didn't get the chance to meet.  The bed was comfy, and the neighborhood was very quiet for being so close to the bustle of Green Lake--walking distance to shops, restaurants and the local health food store.  Lovely kitties, too!
12714	15108	8.0	9.0	29287529	Very pleasant stay. He respected the fact that I was there for school and therefore didn't have much social time, but always invited me to join him and others in playing board games, etc. He was also very helpful in suggesting directions to places where I needed to go as well as having a genuine interest in what I was studying.
12715	15108	8.0	9.0	33379182	Bob is amazing host, he is very friendly and made us feel at home. The room is cozy and we love it! And Bob is a wonderful singer !! I hope we can watch him in another concert.
12716	15108	8.0	9.0	42658046	The room/ house was everything that it promised to be. A block away from buses to downtown, the supermarket, etc. A block away from Green Lake where I spent many memorable evenings. Bob is very friendly and welcoming. I cooked quite a bit in the kitchen and he very graciously let me use spices/pots/containers etc. The hot tub in the backyard and Pollux, Bob's cat, were a bonus! I grew up scared of cats but I got quite attached to Pollux by the end of my stay. I had a lot of fun conversations with Bob whenever we overlapped in the kitchen. I'd highly recommend the house to anyone looking to stay in a picturesque neighborhood while being close to downtown.
12717	15108	8.0	9.0	45144156	"I stayed in one of the upstairs bedrooms for 6 months, and have visited twice since moving out of the state.  Overall, I had a great experience living here.  Bob is a wonderful host and friend.  Will stay in touch for a long time, I'm sure.  He was very reasonable and understanding with everyone living in his home.  

The house is only 2 blocks from Green Lake and I always felt safe walking nearby.  It's a quiet area with no real noise pollution, like police sirens or thumping bass.  The jacuzzi and garden were great to relax in.  On-street parking was never, ever an issue, and there was plenty to do and see within walking distance.  The nearest bus lines run on Wallingford Ave, only a block away. You can go to U District or  or downtown without having to transfer.  I commuted to Redmond every day by bus and never felt like it was an epic journey.  

Would definitely recommend and will probably return if I come back to town again.
"
12718	15108	8.0	9.0	48715283	"Bob is absolutely fantastic.  With late night conversations in the kitchen, boisterous game nights, morning singing and songwriting sessions, and an overall 'what's mine is yours attitude', he makes you feel as if you belonged at his house all along.

Pollox the cat is reserved, but loves rough attention when he's looking for it.  The house is incredibly eclectic and lived-in, and Bob has a habit of collecting memorabilia.

You'll be missing out terribly if all you're looking for is a clean and tidy place to crash."
12719	15108	8.0	9.0	52845073	Bob's house in Green Lake makes for a great home in Seattle.  The room was exactly as described and Bob went out of his way to make me feel at home.  Highly recommend.
12720	15108	8.0	9.0	53566511	Bob was a friendly and gracious host who communicates efficiently and effectively - he is mature and strikes an excellent balance between giving you your space but also being there if you need him. He is also an excellent source of information about the city's transportation system and anything different, from a tourists perspective, about Seattle. Don't hesitate to book his clean, quaint and well maintained (and sign posted) private room! Pollux the cat is a wonderful companion too! Highly recommended.....
12721	15108	8.0	9.0	54716158	We chose Bob's house because of its excellent location near Green Lake. We decided not to stay when we saw that the room was small and dark, next to the shared kitchen and bathroom. There were more people staying in the house than we expected, making the small, over-furnished space claustrophobic. Handwritten signs everywhere and odor of cat box contributed to the unpleasant feel of the house. The advertised hot tub was without water and clearly hadn't been used in a while.
13827	5364609	8.0	9.0	26969660	This apartment was amazing! It is a great amount of space with a super friendly host. Though we did not meet him in person, he was very helpful and thoughtful via message and text. It is in a great location, close to freeways and awesome restaurants. Easy to find, super clean and welcoming, has great views! We had a wonderful time! 
13828	5364609	8.0	9.0	28335826	Paul's place is awesome. He sends you every piece of information you could possibly need for enjoying his space and he was very responsive to questions even while he was out of town. Highly recommended!
13829	5364609	8.0	9.0	29562648	What a great stay at Paul's place! The neighborhood is pretty fantastic (grocery store, pretty decent eateries nearby), and Paul was super welcoming. Although he was away, he was easy to get in touch with when I needed to, he checked in as well, and did all he could to make me feel welcome in his space... which is gorgeous. I will totally stay here again if I end up in Seattle again.
13830	5364609	8.0	9.0	33332181	Paul's place was lovely to stay at. The place was cozy and well put together. The full sized kitchen was a joy to cook on, and the location was exceptional! Having a place to park our car was another very welcome perk. All things said and done, I would highly recommend Paul's place to anyone visiting Seattle.
13831	5364609	8.0	9.0	38063450	"My GF and I really enjoyed Paul's place. It is well located as you can walk, bike or take a quick Uber the 1-2 miles to either Belltown, Seattle center or Capital Hill. We ended up walking all of it and wasn't too big of an issue. There was a grocery store and a few good little restaurants within walking distance as well.

Getting into Paul's building & receiving the keys was very easy. He gives you all the information you need for use of his apartment. While we didn't cook, we very easily could have as it was a nice kitchen with anything you would need to prepare food.

Clean & in a great location with a responsive host, I'd definitely recommend Paul's spot for anyone traveling to the Seattle area.  "
13832	5364609	8.0	9.0	42566551	Paul was very accommodating and flexible. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and appreciated his hospitality!
16116	9134196	8.0	8.0	55236426	it's ok
16648	7649837	8.0	9.0	41048112	"Nice apartment with great amenities. We were there during a summer heatwave and there was no ac or a fan. We literally barely got a wink of sleep due to just dying of heat. Wish we could have enjoyed the space but it was just too hot. 

"
16649	7649837	8.0	9.0	42940543	"I did not meet Luyan but she was the most gracious communicator.
  
The studio itself was indeed upscale as advertised and well stocked with goodies provided by the host.  The location of the studio is  a good base to see the main attractions of Seattle.  The neighborhood seemed safe and close to Trader Joes and other stores.

Like the previous reviewer, I was there during a heat wave and the studio was very warm during the day and through a good part of the night.  I can say that is was somewhat uncomfortable. Perhaps if a fan was provided it would help. 

The main bed was comfortable.  The other sofa bed was small and short, so if you are over 5"" 6"" or so, you probably wont be comfortable sleeping in it. 

 If you have a car, I found the free parking in the neighborhood to be challenging.  The closest parking was mostly required but there is unrestricted parking on the over side of 45th St but it was hard at times to find a free spot.  There are also some paid parking lots not too far away - but I'm a cheapskate and I did not use them.  

There is constant noise, day and night, from the freeway when the window is open.  This may be an issue if you are sensitive to noise.

The key pickup and drop off was through the service KeyCafe and is located at a nearby coffeehouse, Trabant.  This process was relatively painless.  However, Trabant opens at 8:30 on Sunday and I had 6 a.m. flight so I had to have my daughter drop off the keys later.  A minor inconvenience but may be an issue for you if you do not have someone to drop off the keys for you.

The internet wifi is very fast and I was able to hook up my iPad with the provided cable to the TV and stream movies.  I don't think there were cable TV channels available.

Luyan does not charge a cleaning deposit so the studio is expected to be left clean.  She is very clear on her expectations.  I didn't mind cleaning but this may not be everyone's cup of tea.

All in all, a nice studio in a convenient location that is priced right for this area with a friendly communicating host.
"
16650	7649837	8.0	9.0	43144827	Nice place, almost a hotel room, came as advertised. On the one hand there's cleaning, on the other hand there's saving the money. We lucked into a parking space right in front on Sunday night, had some good Greek food after a five minute walk. Convenient to U of W.
16651	7649837	8.0	9.0	44001490	Luyan is a great host and her place is wonderful. She is very helpful, communicates with her guests very well, and even provides lovely snacks. The apartment is very nice with an awesome view of the city. Some may see the required cleaning as a drawback, but Luyan has set everything up so that it's really quite effortless. The area was wonderful too; it had lots of restaurants and bars nearby, and is just a quick ride to downtown or Ballard. I'd love to stay at Luyan's the next time I visit Seattle, I had a wonderful stay.
16652	7649837	8.0	9.0	44686404	"Luyan is a very responsible host and I spent two great nights at her place. 

Before I arrive, she sent me a clear and detail apartment guide which contained basically everything I need to know for my stay. Her apartment was nice and clean, close to UW and downtown. 

Since I was travelling alone, I had some safety concerns at the very beginning. After I arrived, I found I didn't need to worry about it at all. The neighborhood is safe. In addition, there is on-site building management staffs. Moreover, a key fob is needed in order to get in the building and use the elevator. 

"
16653	7649837	8.0	9.0	45894102	Great location, modern and clean apartment, all you need for a weekend in Seattle. 
16654	7649837	8.0	9.0	46796470	Great place, good location, inexpensive, although the stay was a little bumpy for us. The apartment felt like a very cozy dorm and was very lovely. We had an amazing time in Seattle, and this spot was a perfect launching pad. You do have to do all your own cleaning (and it's a bit of work) but we knew that going in, but somehow we forgot to do the dishes amid mopping, vacuuming, laundry and trash duty :( . Luyan was very responsive, and although it was a little tricky to arrange pickup and drop off of keys with her being out of town - our key pickup window was very small due to flying in at 1145pm and the cafe we were supposed to drop the keys off at was closing down permanently the next day. Everything worked out in the end though! And we even got to spend some quality time on the roof which was furnished and had an awesome view. I highly recommend this lovely pad, and I'd probably stay there again next time I'm in Seattle!
16655	7649837	8.0	9.0	47783951	"Luyan was a very responsive host who clearly cares that those using the space feel comfortable and welcome. She was mostly prompt with email responses to any questions that I had. However, I do not think that the first word in the title of the apartment can be 'Clean' -- I got this place for my parents and when we all walked in, there were dirty dishes in the sink and the bathroom clearly had not been cleaned for a while. 

The location is great, the price is also good for the location -- my folks liked the bed a lot and slept well, they also felt very safe since the apartment is on the 7th floor. 

If you plan to do any cooking, there are extremely limited cookware supplies - we struggled to find plates, cups and a coffee pot - so I would not plan on eating in. "
16729	1773803	8.0	9.0	8144167	"A cozy apartment in the middle of the university district. There's plenty to do nearby on ""the ave."" Also there's a farmer's market every Saturday which has locally grown vegetables/fruits/meats and cheeses. It was only about a twenty minute drive to get to most other areas or sites; the apartment is in a great location.

Sheldon is a wonderful host that will tell you everything you need to know about the city, as well as really making you feel at home. He's extremely easy to contact and always promptly answers any questions about where to eat or what to see. Sheldon even took us tailgating with him to a Seahawks game. He is very inviting and left us with a great experience."
16730	1773803	8.0	9.0	8490699	"Sheldon was a gracious host. He was attentive. He checked in via text message, and ended every conversation/note, asking if there was anything he could do for me and my family. 
The apartment was a perfect getaway for us. We have been at Children's Hospital, and the bed was comfortable and the whole place was quiet. The location is perfect for anyone wanting to spend a week or more in the U District. Or if you are in town for a Huskey/Seahawks/Mariners game. If the Seahawks are in town, you will probably be invited to a wonderful Tailgate by Sheldon.
If you do have any challenges with the apartment, Sheldon will take care of the issue promptly.  He is like the greatest of waiters; there when you need him, but not over-bearing, and lets you enjoy the space and his neighborhood."
16731	1773803	8.0	9.0	8924892	"Sheldon was fabulous! We booked same-day and he responded quickly and was flexible. The apartment is quite spacious with a large sectional and cute den space in addition to the bedroom. 

You really cannot get closer to ""The Ave"" in the University District. This apartment sits in the center of the action and there are no shortages of busses to get around the city.

We would definitely stay here again! "
16732	1773803	8.0	9.0	8988146	"Sheldon was a great host with a lot of advices. The apartment is vast and clean.
As someone said previously, you are right on ""The Ave"" and there are TONS of restaurants around. 
Unfortunately, we didn't find U-district to be a nice neighborhood. Even though we were on the third floor, we could hear very clearly people in the back alley at night as if they were sharing the room with us. 
The kitchen is equipped with a lot of wine-related tools, but has no toaster.
Although the ad says the contrary, there is no wifi in the apt. You are surrounded by cafés and other places offering free wifi, but you cannot check your mails in the comfort of the huge couch."
16733	1773803	8.0	9.0	9106387	Sheldon was a phenomenal host! he made sure that all my arrangements were taken care of, and he was very understanding of my somewhat hectic schedule. His place was in an incredibly convenient location, and if you have anything you need to do in or near UW this could not be a more perfect place. The apartment itself was very clean, extremely spacious, and very comfortable. Highly recommend!
16734	1773803	8.0	9.0	9210221	Sheldon was a very attentive and helpful host who was easy to communicate with. He met with me at a convenient time and helped me bring my luggage in, showed me all around the apartment, and told me a lot of information about Seattle and nearby restaurants. The apartment was conveniently located in the center of the UW campus village area where there are a number of restaurants and shops. He was considerate enough to accommodate my complex travel schedule and I appreciated that very much. The apartment was warm and well equipped for a nice stay. 
16735	1773803	8.0	9.0	9354992	"Sheldon was a great host! Communication was extremely easy which made meeting up no problem at all. He made sure we felt welcome and comfortable in his home which is always a plus. The place itself is better than the pictures. The location is perfect for walking around the u-district; free parking is just around the corner! I would gladly stay here again. 

Thank you! "
16736	1773803	8.0	9.0	9428674	Thanks again for everything. Had a great stay in Seattle, Sheldon was a great host, the appartement is in the student district, very close to lots of good restaurants. 
16737	1773803	8.0	9.0	9800259	His apartment is really great. It's cosy, beautiful, has every tools you need, and the location it's perfect, it's close to everything you need. Sheldon is a really nice host. He was always in touch with us all the time, showing up quickly everytime we needed to solve anything. I'd definetly rent the apartment again if I had the chance.
16738	1773803	8.0	9.0	9841070	"Shel is responsible, personable and no mystery. I prefer dealing with straight forward people and that is what I got with Shel. The location of the apt is great!!!! The building is old, the apartment is a little drafty, you will hear street noise, and the hot water is sparse BUT for the price, location and personality of Shel you will be getting a great deal! I would rent again (I went with my 5 year old and his ""aunt""). We had a great experience! I am already planning my next trip up! Shel is very nice. Check around and you will not find a better crash pad!"
16739	1773803	8.0	9.0	9906044	Shelden and his place were great. Was in town for business at UW and the location was perfect. Area was bustling but apartment away from the street. Comfortable, spacious accommodations. Check in and check out were a breeze and Shel was way responsive. Very highly recommended!
16740	1773803	8.0	9.0	9935340	Sheldon was a good host.
16741	1773803	8.0	9.0	9986292	Sheldon was very hospitable. He was there if we had any questions and let us know about many great places to eat. We liked the grungy University side of town. Apartment is old with no central heat, but with heavy comforter, heated blanket and space heater we were just fine. Good location if you're visiting the university. Only thing I recommend is bringing sheets and wash cloths. Other than that everything was great!
16742	1773803	8.0	9.0	10066612	Shel was good about checking in via text to make sure things were going well (and to recommend restaurants) and the apartment was great - interesting building with a lot of character and fantastic location.  We really enjoyed ourselves.
16743	1773803	8.0	9.0	10122684	Superb location if visiting University of Washington. Wonderful south sun, Over roof view of Space Needle and downtown Seattle. Classic old building with all the unique attributes of such. Many good restaurants just outside door. Multiple flights of stairs. Sporadic internet. OK for cruising more difficult if working from computer. Very low water pressure at kitchen sink but good at shower. Sitting room off bedroom perfect for reading. No tv which was good for me but not for everyone. If you have a car, parking is problematic. You will have to lug your bags unless you find the spot in front on the street. Three blocks away you can park for free. To find the entrance it is difficult. Remember that the Gyro shop is next door to the north. 
16744	1773803	8.0	9.0	10213914	Great communication, extremely helpful and understanding. I will definitely be booking next time I'm in Seattle.
16745	1773803	8.0	9.0	10321677	As many others have said, Sheldon is a great host. He communicated all the details and made sure I had everything I needed. He was able to provide information about the area and some good tips for good food. I'd definitely stay again and recommend Sheldon to my friends. 
16746	1773803	8.0	9.0	10366667	Sheldon was a good host.  We arrived later than expected due to travel delays, and he was perfectly accommodating.  The apartment is very spacious and conveniently located.
16747	1773803	8.0	9.0	10437376	"When renting a place like this, knowing you won't be able to see it before your stay, having communication with the host is vital. Sheldon was excellent at keeping a reliable line of communication, I felt taken care of before, during and after the stay. Aside from the stellar service we received, the apartment was completely cleaned, well-stocked, and the only real difference between it and a hotel was the high-level of direct service we received and how ""homey"" the space feels. A great price for the space and amenities that were given, I am very impressed with the overall experience and I was IN LOVE with the location and how close things were. Getting quarters for laundry from the restaurant next door further proved how nice the people in the area were. I would love to rent this place again :) High marks from this very satisfied guest! Thanks Sheldon!"
16748	1773803	8.0	9.0	10747672	Sheldon was really professional , helpful . The apartment is brilliant and is very close to the university . You have all types of cuisines nearby . Calm locality . Neat and perfect I would stay . Would highly recommend ! 
16749	1773803	8.0	9.0	10978566	"We had a great time, and enjoyed the stay! The apartment was as described, and Sheldon was very knowledgeable about the area. He was available, but not overbearing, and his suggestions definitely came in handy.

The location was great, and we were able to get around easily between public transportation and Uber."
16750	1773803	8.0	9.0	11082434	"Our stay was excellent. The apartment is right in the heart of the university district. We could walk anywhere near UW and the bus stop is maybe 300 feet away, so incredibly convenient to the rest of Seattle.

Sheldon was an excellent host. He met us near the apartment, showed us around, and was always quick to respond by text to the couple of small questions we had.

I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to be near UW."
16751	1773803	8.0	9.0	11216861	"First off, Sheldon is a great host. He was very accommodating when we requested an earlier check in time and overall very accessible yet not overbearing. He provided us with bus schedules, and personal restaurant choices (my boyfriend and I were pretty much on a foodie trip)--even Sheldon's girlfriend made a nice list of restaurants with descriptions and all. 
Now onto the apartment: It was very clean with plenty of blankets, towels and traveling essentials (shampoo/soap etc). Seattle a lot cooler than we're used to but if you turn the heat on and bring out the space heater it wasn't bad. The only negative thing was the bed. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because with every movement there'd be a loud squeak. I mentioned this to Sheldon, who promptly asked whether I'd like the bed flipped. It wasn't a huge deal to me because the couch is ridiculously huge and comfortable so I crashed there instead. 
All in all, a good experience. "
16752	1773803	8.0	9.0	11410139	Sheldon was a great host. The apartment was exactly what was advertised and sufficient for our stay. I would not hesitate to go back and stay again. Any time I needed anything Sheldon was there to help with questions I had. Great trip great place!
16753	1773803	8.0	9.0	12809904	Sheldon was an obliging and unintrusive host. The location is fabulous for anyone needing to spend time in the University District.
16754	1773803	8.0	9.0	13029988	Great appartment, extremely well located!... idealy placed for restaurants, cafes and UW, transportation to downtown almost right in front of the door. Sheldon was really nice, check in and check out went smoothly, also provided me with intersting tips on for seattle discovery!. It was a really confortable stay and an overall positive experience. Thank you Sheldon!.
16755	1773803	8.0	9.0	13117552	Shel's apartment was as advertised. We found it clean, spacious, and comfortable. And Shel was easygoing and friendly. If you want a spot in the heart of Seattle's U district, I would recommend this one.  
16756	1773803	8.0	9.0	13273184	My stay at Sheldon's apartment was great. The apartment was exactly as described, and Sheldon was a wonderful host. Loved how quirky and fun the place was. It's literally in the middle of everything near the UW campus but at the same time nice and quiet. There are blocks and blocks of restaurants around, a Bikram yoga studio in the same building, grocery stores, post office, copy center--all 1-2 minute walk away. The apartment also had wonderful views--of the Seattle skyline, and of a lovely backyard area shared with other buildings. A great place overall.
16757	1773803	8.0	9.0	13407757	Fun and funky apartment for a great price in a great neighborhood! 
16758	1773803	8.0	9.0	13662481	Sheldon was welcoming. He has gone out of his way to make his space useful.  I appreciated having a separate room in which to meditate and do yoga.  The kitchen and bathrooms were a little small.
16759	1773803	8.0	9.0	13793426	Sheldon made it easy for us to stay at his place. We arrived late and Sheldon got us in and gave us the quick tour so we could get settled for the night. The place is very comfortable and met all of our needs.
16760	1773803	8.0	9.0	14391047	Sheldon was an easy host to deal with, very responsive and straightforward. The apartment is convenient, light and bright, and met my needs very well. I would stay here again.
16761	1773803	8.0	9.0	15055120	"Shel's place is fantastic. Great location, everything is just as described and pictured. He was extremely accommodating when we needed an earlier check in. In the apartment you'll find maps as well as great restaurant recommendations within walking distance. Shel was also always available to answer questions and even went out of his way to suggest a baseball game and fireworks happening our first night in town. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone visiting the city.

16762	1773803	8.0	9.0	15162500	Nice, quiet apartment for our family of 4 in a great area of town. Easy transit access to downtown and lots of restaurants, parks in walking distance. 3rd floor of a 3-storey walkup - we were there on a day when it was 33 Celsius outside so the apartment was a bit warm, but cooled off overnight. Sheldon was friendly and helpful.
16763	1773803	8.0	9.0	15300235	Sheldon was very nice. He accommodated our arrival time and showed us around. Place has a lot of character as it is over 100 years old, which we like! sinks did not drain as it was stated an issue from last BNB guests possible pouring something bad down drain. Also remember to close living room window during hot day as bugs from alley way will find there way to the room. Other than that very clean could not have asked for better location, great food. Would recommend. parking on street is free from 8-8 and free on Sunday. Thanks again.
16764	1773803	8.0	9.0	15617821	Easy to book and meet to get a key. Very warm on a 95 degree day. Suggest additional fans. Great location and priced nicely 
16765	1773803	8.0	9.0	15870470	Sheldon was accommodating about check-in and available by text.  Bldg was pretty much as described, but apt was clean.  Bed and couch were very good.  Refrigerator worked well (appreciated in the heat wave). Street parking was available after 8 or 9 pm but not after 8 am.  Wifi worked in the living room.  Quiet at night, even in heat wave, but a lot of morning noise.  Street scene is getting rougher.
16766	1773803	8.0	9.0	16398401	I thought I already left a review. If so, post the previous one. If not here is a short version. Sheldon was very available by text. I responded immediately each time. His apartment is comfortable especially the bed. It is a nice location near the University. 
16767	1773803	8.0	9.0	16704880	Sheldon was a gracious host. He checked in with us during our trip and gave us places we could check out. The apartment is large and the couch is comfortable. It was quite warm during the day but cooled off nicely at night. We weren't home much during the day for it to matter. We were woken up in the morning by noises in the alley. Parking is almost impossible, but Sheldon did point us to the neighborhood adjacent and we were able to snag a free spot on the street. Overall, it is exactly as described. 
16768	1773803	8.0	9.0	16847160	Sheldon was a great host! He was very understanding when we ended up checking in later and he periodically checked up on us making sure everything was alright. He also gave great tips for places to go to. His building is definitely 100 years old and has no AC unit (people don't use it in the NW). The apartment was quite humid and dark during the evenings. In the mornings, we were constantly woken up by loud noises from the street. However, the location of the apartment was great and parking was pretty easy to find. The apartment is very close to the downtown area. 
16769	1773803	8.0	9.0	16911602	Sheldon was super friendly and gave plenty of ideas for neighborhood restaurants and things to do.  The apartment is situated in a somewhat dingy building right in the center of a lively series of blocks filled with shops and inexpensive restaurants catering to students (think Telegraph, Berkeley).  The apartment itself is large, with three rooms and an open galley kitchen.  You won't be doing any serious cooking (nook table's small, only three spoons, etc.) but with the many restaurants around, this isn't an issue.  In general a functional apartment with a friendly host and a location central for the university.
16770	1773803	8.0	9.0	17149919	"Great location, a block from UW. Sheldon was accommodating with our arrival time, and informative with regards to local eateries and sights.
With that being said, the actual room was in a building that is 100+ years old, and has issues that come with a building of that age. It's on the third floor, and with no a/c you will roast during the summertime till the sun goes down. No need for an alarm because the garbage truck will be sure to wake you up daily at 7am since you'll need those windows open for circulation. We also experienced a dirty bathroom and kitchen that unfortunately may not get much cleaner at this point (even if someone had cleaned the tub; we'd also advise bringing your own towels.) The wifi will likely only connect if you sit by the front door of the apartment as it has a terribly, weak signal.
Overall, we would not recommend it to friends and family so I wouldn't recommend it to you. Similar priced listings in other bigger cities have provided more and at better quality."
16771	1773803	8.0	9.0	17232951	Large apartment that had a big U shaped couch which had ample space in addition to the bed. The building is relatively old but the apartment itself clean and well furnished. 
16772	1773803	8.0	9.0	17292638	"This was our first experience with AirBnB, and I have to say it was mixed. Sheldon seemed rushed when he greeted us, and he never mentioned the wi-fi code, but he did let us drop off our suitcases when we arrived at 12:45 and the previous tenants had not yet left. We appreciated that.

The neighborhood was pleasant, and the apartment is spacious and reasonably clean, though hardly immaculate. We were grossed out, however, to find only a bottom sheet and comforter on the bed, with no top sheet or duvet. Worse, Sheldon asked us to straighten it when we left (rather than removing the sheet). It seemed pretty clear that the next guests would be sleeping in it, and we assumed it probably hadn't been changed after the previous guests left. 

The building, too, is pretty down at the heel. The dead flowers in several of the windows add to the atmosphere (in a creepy way). Overall, it was okay, but barely."
16773	1773803	8.0	9.0	17749120	The apartment is in great location, easy access to all the amenities, like bank, supermarket, restaurant and campus.  The host also very helpful to arrange the transportation between airport and apartment.  We enjoy the stay.
16774	1773803	8.0	9.0	17967894	Sheldon did a great job with our first experience on AirBnB. Convenient location and great place to stroll around during down time on our trip.
16775	1773803	8.0	9.0	18012171	"Since we came to Seattle to visit the University of Washington, Sheldon's place right on University Ave. gave us just the right location and feel of a college campus.  We found easy parking nearby and enjoyed the view out the windows of the city lights.  Restaurant options abounded.

The building is urban, college gritty and like most of Seattle doesn't have AC but Sheldon had cooled the summer heat nicely with plenty of fans.
We slept well and it was just the perfect place for us to stay!"
16776	1773803	8.0	9.0	18132916	Amazing location and place to stay. Shel was responsive and courteous. Highly recommend. 
16777	1773803	8.0	9.0	18221439	Great neighborhood, excellent views, very comfortable apartment and great price. There were even earplugs in the night stand! Couldn't have asked for a better host. Thanks!
16778	1773803	8.0	9.0	18669135	Check in/out was super easy but place wasn't clean enough. Location was easy to get to downtown on bus. 
16779	1773803	8.0	9.0	18729905	"Good apartment if you're looking for a place to crash for the night. Sheldon wasn't available when we arrived, but his friend Mark was helpful.  He answered all my texts in a timely manner. 

There was a ton of street noise in the morning,  but that was expected from other reviews.   The bed was very comfortable.  Towels were super crunchy,  so I'd recommend bringing your own.   Only one roll of toilet paper,  which could be risky.  

The U district was a good college town,  but a little grunge.   Good restaurants around and easy to lyft or uber places.   

Overall good experience for our first time in Seattle."
16780	1773803	8.0	9.0	18876050	"When you first see the bldg., do not be disheartened! I see why Sheldon doesn't post photos of the exterior.  The bldg. is old with a neighborhood reminiscent of Berkeley, a bit grungy, a bit rundown. Homeless youths were drumming in the foyer of a nearby Kaplan’s testing center; at night, several homeless were sleeping on the steps of nearby offices; the odor of grilled meats and garlic filled the air for most of the day and night. 
Fortunately, the bldg. has a locked main entry door with three flights of stairs to the unit. No elevator. The unit is in the far back of the bldg. and is surprisingly quiet given that the main façade faces the Avenue.  We had a bit of a snafu getting the key. Sheldon was not around as host and his friend Mark had the key. Unfortunately, we were late in meeting Mark and Mark had a baseball game to attend. We did eventually get the key by meeting Mark at the Mariners game, so it all worked out in the end.
The unit is as advertised: a fairly clean, fairly quiet place. There is one main bedroom, a large living room, one small bathroom, a small sitting room, and a kitchenette. Unfortunately, the kitchen sink was backed up when we arrived and Mark was not able to fix it. 
Sheldon provides soap, shampoo, toilet paper (nice touch – TP rolls in the kitchen drawer), towels, sheets, and ample amounts of coffee (terrific selection) and coffee makers.  He also has suggestions for restaurants which he places near the front door.  Several fans in the unit help to circulate air as it can become warm on the top floor, even for Seattle. The bathroom is small, but the hot water is immediately available. Currently, the only mirror is a small one in the bathroom. 
The décor is late 20th century graduate student – I was having flashbacks to my own experiences as a grad student, down to the ancient harvest gold rug in the living room and the generic posters. The living room has a very large sofa sectional on which we planted our two teenaged sons. Sheldon also supplied wi-fi directions and where to get the best reception in the unit. Pls. be aware that there is no TV or phone. BYOD (Bring Your Own Devices).  We had a rental car and did not take public transit. Parking is paid Mondays-Saturdays, but free on Sundays. We had no problems finding street parking, but it was a Labor Day weekend w/ no college events.
Overall, if you are looking for a convenient place near the University, don’t mind reliving your grad student days (or are a grad student), then give Sheldon’s place a try. Just make sure to be on time to get the key!
"
16781	1773803	8.0	9.0	20843390	"The location is so convenient and the Sheldon provides all stuff you may need when you live in. It's so considerate.
U Disc is really a good area and Sheldon is very nice to share all useful information, including dining, supermarket, farmers market, bus route etc, which are all quiet useful.
So I really enjoy the stay in Sheldon's apartment. "
16782	1773803	8.0	9.0	21286980	"Hi,
The apartment location is very good for the university and for downtown. "
16783	1773803	8.0	9.0	21409663	I had a family emergency occur the day we were planning on staying at Sheldon's so we didn't end up staying at his place. We did meet Sheldon and he was personable and accommodating. The neighborhood is in the heart of the teeming University district with many ethnic eateries right on the street of his apartment. The location is a great base from which to explore Seattle. 
16784	1773803	8.0	9.0	21432821	"host was flexible about arrival time and gave good transit suggestions...he carried a super heavy suitcase up the stairs to the 3rd floor for us!
ideal location for getting a sense of UW..."
16785	1773803	8.0	9.0	21568023	We had a great stay in the heart of the University District. Our host met us at the front door and gave us a tour of the apartment. The apartment was very nice with a great view of the Space Needle! Clean linens were available and the apartment had everything we needed. There were tons of great international restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Our stay was very enjoyable and I highly recommend this listing to anyone wanting to stay in the University District of Seattle.
16786	1773803	8.0	9.0	21726319	My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Shel's place in the University District.  The apartment was clean, warm, quiet during our Saturday-Tuesday stay, and Shel was an accommodating host. He was easy to contact and welcomed us into his home.  If I have the opportunity to visit UW again I will definitely try to stay here again.
16787	1773803	8.0	9.0	21857033	I was late arriving to the city and forgot to notify Sheldon of my tardiness. He touched base to make sure I was doing okay and then we worked out an alternate plan. Sheldon was very flexible and the apartment was great! The couch was super comfortable, as was the bed.
16788	1773803	8.0	9.0	22032722	Sheldon was there to leave me the key. Gave us a tour and also some recommendations. Apt was good size. There were plenty of sheets and towels for use. Went during October so the apt was pretty chilly at nighttime. There was a heater and extra blankets for use. Thanks for hosting Sheldon!
16789	1773803	8.0	9.0	22284938	Sheldon was very accommodating as our travel plans changed last minute a couple of times. The apartment is located in a very central area in the U District. It was spotless and comfortable, with plenty of space. I would highly recommend this space to anyone staying in Seattle for a few days! 
16790	1773803	8.0	9.0	23442963	We lived in Sheldon's apartment for a month, and we felt like at home, Sheldon was very very attentive with us and helped us to practice our english, we went with him to some funny parties and he recommended us a lot of nice places to dance, eat and have fun. Sheldon's apartment is pretty wide and so clean, near many restaurants, a brewery, clothing stores and the UW. We really had fun staying in U-District. Thanks for hosting Sheldon.
16791	1773803	8.0	9.0	23617747	Sheldon was great and very responsive. This is a fantastic location for the U and the apartment is really good also.
16792	1773803	8.0	9.0	23767985	I chose Sheldon's listing for my trip with my sister because she's hoping to go to UW and it's right near the campus. It was perfect for us and Sheldon was very accommodating and responsive when we had issues and questions. It's a nice amount of space and perfect for giving my sister an idea of the university area. It's kind of out of the way, as far as tourist attractions go, but since it's right next to several bus lines, that wasn't a problem. It was perfect for us and we definitely recommend it. 
16793	1773803	8.0	9.0	23957894	Sheldon was a great host. My flight was delayed so I arrived to the apartment much later than expected but despite the hour Sheldon was still warm and welcoming. The apartment was as described with everything needed for a comfortable 4 day stay. It was in a fun part of town with tons of restaurants and a very short walk to the UW campus. Would stay there again.
16794	1773803	8.0	9.0	24443619	"thank you sheldon ! 
our trip to seattle was fantastic, your place is a perfect base to explore from.  "
16795	1773803	8.0	9.0	24930802	Sheldon was easy to connect with and let us into the apartment as soon as we both could get there. I really appreciated how he kept in touch via message/email and showed us around the apartment. The space itself is very welcoming, in a no-frills, student-life way. We really liked the neighborhood (lots of cafes and restaurants, close to where else we needed to be) so the morning noise didn't bother us -- it was great to be in the perfect location for our Seattle trip.
16796	1773803	8.0	9.0	25239269	Sheldon was a very welcoming host. He was kind enough to extend an invitation to a potluck event, and made sure to check in on us to ensure our comfort. The location of his apartment was perfect - one street over from the campus and surrounded by excellent restaurant choices. The wifi did not work very well in the evening, but other than that, I would recommend Sheldon's space to anyone looking to visit the campus.
16797	1773803	8.0	9.0	25772115	Sadly I never made my trip (boo!) but Sheldon was great. He totally accommodated my travel pals and was apparently an A+ host! Thanks again and hopefully I'll make it to Seattle soon!
16798	1773803	8.0	9.0	25825353	Sheldon was a gracious host and the accommodations were welcoming. He gave us great advice on eateries as well as other activities to do. He is easy to communicate with. The apartment is in a great location.
16799	1773803	8.0	9.0	26356842	Sheldon was very accommodating and helpful.  He gave us lots of good ideas for things to do in the area and he didn't freak out when we broke one of his pots and a wine stopper.
16800	1773803	8.0	9.0	26607803	"Sheldon was friendly and helpful while giving us privacy. The location was perfect --it was centrally located and accessible to everything. The apartment itself was very comfortable, private, and had great views.
"
16801	1773803	8.0	9.0	27675264	"Sheldon was a great host and met me as soon as I got there. The place was very quiet inside and spacious. I wasn't thrilled with the location at night at first, but felt safe once I was more familiar with the area. There is only paid parking nearby, if you rent/bring a car.

Sheldon checked in on me the first night to make sure everything was good and it was. Bed was super comfortable too. Thanks!"
16802	1773803	8.0	9.0	27733630	"Sheldon was a great host! He invited us to a party the night before out stay and was accommodating to us checking in late that evening.
The place was beautiful. Big windows, lots of comfy furniture, food, clean, and great location. You can tell he cleaned between guests and was a very welcoming guy. Overall, he was a great host and his place was wonderful!"
16803	1773803	8.0	9.0	28463527	Thank you very much for the stay! Although Sheldon wasn't personally available when we checked in (he gave us advanced warning), he gave us clear instructions on who to see in order to get into the apartment and when I texted him with questions he responded almost immediately! The location was incredibly convenient for our friend's wedding, but was laso steps away from myriad restaurants, bus stops, and Zyp cars. The location was extremely quiet...the only real sound was that of a few neighborhood seagulls, despite being in the middle of the U-District!
16804	1773803	8.0	9.0	28684279	Our stay is perfect. Sheldon is very accommodating, and the house has everything we need. 
16805	1773803	8.0	9.0	28763520	This apartment is an excellent value in a high priced, lively, convenient neighborhood. The price reflects the somewhat spartan, bachelor-pad aura and rather worn condition of the building.  Hey, luxury costs! The unit served our needs well, except for the noise level. We are probably more noise sensitive than many urban travelers so it might not be an issue for others.  Sheldon had the place clean and tidy for us.  We appreciated his encouragement that we use whatever we needed in the apartment. Glad he pointed us toward the Portage Bay Cafe for breakfast, just a few blocks away. Great tip.
16806	1773803	8.0	9.0	29246776	Sheldon was an easy going, yet still prompt and professional host. I booked very last minute and he was prompt in responding to my request as well as responding to any questions I had during my stay. The space is roomy and comfortable, and I really enjoyed the unique old space. I look forward to staying here again sometime.
16807	1773803	8.0	9.0	29347421	Had a nice stay. Prompt easy check in, host did a nice job of showing us around the apartment and recommending a couple of local restaurants. The neighborhood around the apartment is near the college so there are plenty of food options and there's a nice brewpub two doors down, my friends and I had a fun stay.
16808	1773803	8.0	9.0	29635385	The apartment was conveniently located and Sheldon was generally responsive. The apartment also had everything I needed. However, it was not very clean. Not horrible, but floors appeared not to have been swept, counters not well wiped, etc. Also, for some odd reason there were yellow light bulbs in the living room, making it dim and sort of weird. Sheldon did not respond when I complained about the cleanliness level. It felt like a student level apartment.
16809	1773803	8.0	9.0	30052195	sheldons place is in a good location to be in the heart of university district and close to downtown seattle. There are plenty restaurants around the neighborhood. I didn't meet him personally but he left the key for me to acess. The building condition is a little shabby but I think it is the age and there isn't much he can do about it. I think the price should be a little lower for what it was but if you consider having the entire place in somewhere like seattle, it isn't bad.
16810	1773803	8.0	9.0	30259787	" Located in the very busy neighborhood near the University. Good access to public transport. Great location if you are without a vehicle, otherwise parking is VERY challenging. Either expensive and inconvenient or you have to park 5 or more blocks away to park for free. 
Apartment is on top floor and quiet. A bit worn but works OK. My girlfriend had to clean the toilet before she would use it and there was only one towel that kind of smelled. Carpet could stand replacing. Bed was comfortable. Overall not a bad experience, in retrospect not sure it was worth the price. I'd recommend it for a lower fee but if we ever return to Seattle will choose somewhere else."
16811	1773803	8.0	9.0	30591267	Sheldon was there to welcome us & show us around the apartment. He was very resourceful with information about parking, eating & other points of interest. The apartment comfortable with great view to Seattle. The WiFi extremely poor. 
16812	1773803	8.0	9.0	31277262	Sheldon was very accommodating, had everything thing we anticipated for the stay. Made for a great weekend in Seattle, located right on University Avenue. Would definitely stay here again and met all our needs.
16813	1773803	8.0	9.0	31797601	Great experience and wonderful neighborhood. Thank you Shelton for being such a great host!
16814	1773803	8.0	9.0	32475887	"Shel's apartment was just as promised.  Close to lots of great restaurants, basically on campus, and plenty of shopping.  While it is in the heart of the U District, the apartment was quiet and peaceful at night.

Check in was easy and Sheldon was responsive and helpful.

The bed is comfy, the couch is luxurious and there is plenty of space.  The WiFi is pretty weak - so don't plan on a lot of Netflix, but checking email etc. was fine."
16815	1773803	8.0	9.0	33981033	"The unit is spacious and big. It have mostly everything I needed in general. Location is awesome!
However, I feel like the blankets are not super clean. And wifi is super duper slow, or it's on/off all the time."
16816	1773803	8.0	9.0	34569469	"Sheldon is a nice person and so is his apartment! This apartment is very close to UW campus. There is a big bedroom and a living room. And there are also a lot of restaurants around it.
"
16817	1773803	8.0	9.0	35198767	Sheldon, we had a great visit! Thai Tom is our new favorite restaurant!  :)  Thank you for everything & all the best!  
16818	1773803	8.0	9.0	35354129	Location, Location, Location!  This place is perfect if you want to be in the University neighborhood of Seattle.  The apartment is roomy for 2, kids can sleep on the sofa.  Sheldon met us personally to show us the apartment.  Tuesday is garbage day in the street below and it is kinda noisy.
16819	1773803	8.0	9.0	36005891	"First, some positives:

- Public transportation is steps away.
- Dozens of international restaurants are right out the door.
- Good water pressure and hot water.
- Towels and sheets galore.
- According to our daughter, the sofa was very comfortable for sleeping.
- Minimal neighbor noise.
- Aside from flies wandering in from the outside, no bugs!

Now, the negatives:

- Both ceiling fans were broken and so we had to open the windows despite a floor fan; this let in lots of flies where screens were absent.
- The apartment backed up to a very noisy alley. Garbage pickup (see flies, above) started as early as 4:30. Earplugs in the nightstand (some used) were ineffective when a truck was dropping a restaurant dumpster right out the (open) window.
- As others mentioned, the internet was weak.
- As someone mentioned, the carpet was stained and probably needs replacing.
- Speaking of the kitchen, there were...issues. I wasn't expecting anything fancy, but it was barely functional. As someone mentioned last summer, utensils were (still) lacking: two soup spoons, one butter knife, plates for approximately three for one meal, no large pots or pans, no storage containers or wraps, no measuring spoons or cups, dying microwave. (Meals were...challenging.) The kitchen was dirty—not only the dishes and pots, but also the insides of the drawers, fridge and freezer.
- Things were worse in the bathroom. Simply put, it was filthy. The tub needed a good scrubbing, the rubber mat was mildewed, and dusty soap scum covered everything. And, we aren't convinced the sheets and towels were clean before being put out.
- I found a clump of hair and a stepped-on vitamin/pill beside the bed.

In-betweens:

- While Sheldon furnished lots of toiletries, they were stacked around the bathtub and vanity, leaving no room for our own stuff. Additionally, there were no empty drawers, cabinet or food storage space.
- The closet was spacious but had too few hangers.
- The only mirror was on the medicine cabinet door.
- The living room light bulbs were yellow.
- Laundry facilities consist of one shared coin-op washer and dryer on the second floor.
- The smoke alarm died beeping in the middle of the night.

I know it's an old building—I live in one myself—but many of these things can be addressed cheaply (and for about the $25 'cleaning fee'): plunk down $10 for a door mirror from Target, grab a handful of plastic (not bent wire) hangers, pick up some cutlery, have extra alarm batteries on hand, and (this is important) vacuum and wipe the bathroom and kitchen clean. Others are aesthetic: consolidate single toiletry bottles (or buy a new $3 bottle of Suave every guest stay or two), toss the dead plants on the fire escape, use white/clear bulbs, paint over ceiling stains instead of smearing a dirty cloth over them.

It's clearly a bachelor pad/college-type place, but as for a 'jewel' we expected something a bit more polished."
16820	1773803	8.0	9.0	36216926	In the heart of the university district.totally secure building. No elevator, FYI. And even though there's no air conditioning, the fan was awesome. Sheldon was a gracious and accommodating the host. Great view, including the space needle. Unexpectedly quiet. Would recommend particularly if you want an urban environment. Lots of room in. It's all good particularly for the price
16821	1773803	8.0	9.0	37317773	We enjoyed our time in Seattle and in the apartment.  We found the bed to be comfortable.  If you're looking for a simple and inexpensive place to crash at night and explore the city by day this is a good option.
16822	1773803	8.0	9.0	37569957	My husband and I were greeted by Sheldon almost 15 minutes late after the 3pm check-in time to give us the keys and show us around his apartment.  He was very quick in his initial meet & greet, and the apartment and neighborhood was not what we expected.  We didn't stay the entire time at that location and ended up at another airbnb location in Seattle.
16823	1773803	8.0	9.0	37939025	Sheldon's place was comfortable and suitable for the night we spent there. Sheldon was a bit late for the check-in but furnished us with supplementary linens and supplies when we asked.
16824	1773803	8.0	9.0	38447821	The neighborhood was great, and the host was attentive. But, the unit itself was very dirty and didn't feel like it had been cleaned in a while. We only stayed for 1 night, and I am glad that we did not stay longer in that unit. 
16825	1773803	8.0	9.0	38536922	Great place! Spacious, clean, and unbelievably convenient to the University District. Sheldon was a great host, and check-in / check-out was a piece of cake. Highly recommended!
16826	1773803	8.0	9.0	38859621	The location and the space was described adequately. Sheldon was very responsive to my questions via messages. I would stay there again!
16827	1773803	8.0	9.0	40104040	We had a great time in Seattle. We were unsure of when we would arrive so Sheldon arranged for us to pick up he keys close by our place. Once inside the place was clean and bright. The main complaint  was the noise at night. There were people in the alley behind us as well as the garbage trucks came each morning very very early. The carpet was a little questionable. The area was neat as we had not stayed in this part before.  
16828	1773803	8.0	9.0	40612054	"The location is excellent for food and restaurants and it is around a $15 uber trip to downtown Seattle.  The apartment was a third floor walkup which is OK if you are able to walk up three flights.  This fact should be made more clear by the owner in the description.  

The apartment was pretty clean except for the rug which was fairly beat up.  It was more like a college apartment than an older person's apartment.  In general it was clean but fairly beat up.  It lacked a TV and only had a wifi which worked sporadically.  The furniture and appliances are clean but older.  The bed is very squeaky.  The sheets and towels were adequate.  There are enough amenities for cooking but once again old stuff and there is no dishwasher.  There is very little space to eat a meal.  It only has a little nook in which the table takes up the whole space.  The bathroom was clean and the shower had good pressure.   The bedroom  is incredibly noisy outside because it faces an alley where garbage trucks come at 4 in the morning.  It also has no A/C which was brutal because Seattle was unexpectedly hot when we were there.  We had to leave the windows open which didn't help much and the birds woke us up early along with the garbage trucks.  Installing a few simple box ACs would have made it much more comfortable and killed some of the outside noise.   

In general the apartment was clean but it needs updating to be a more special experience.  If you just need somewhere to crash for a night, this is a good choice. But if you wish to be more comfortable while in the apartment, this may not be the place for you."
16829	1773803	8.0	9.0	40719193	Sheldon was a responsive host and his apartment is in an excellent neighborhood. I appreciated the convenient location, comfortable sleeping spots and nearby food options. Thanks Sheldon! 
16830	1773803	8.0	9.0	42537171	Cool neighbourhood. Great location for eating out, and for public transport. The apartment is bright and spacious and quiet at night.
16831	1773803	8.0	9.0	42726569	It was my boyfriend and I's first time using AirBnb together; I had used it with my family previously. Sheldon had put out extra blankets in case we were cold. Though, there was an issue with the key and getting in; the directions weren't very clear. The first door gets into the building, the second door gets you into the hallway, and the third get you into the apartment. The neighborhood was cute and college town-like. The description of the listing was accurate, except we couldn't find the air-conditioning that was listed- the multiple fans provided kept us cool enough. Not having a tv was strange, but only staying one night worked out great. We didn't even try to use the wifi due to previous reviews of it being spotty. A portable DVD player worked out great.
16832	1773803	8.0	9.0	44096116	"Sheldon was very accommodating.  The apartment was exactly as described.  There was plenty of coffee and tea available, as well as basic pantry items.  The apartment does overlook the skyline, and is right in the center of the U-district.  I was using the apartment for its proximity to the campus, and I was glad I went with this cozy and secure apartment.

Good communication with Sheldon throughout the process, and would stay here again when returning to the area."
16833	1773803	8.0	9.0	44445875	This space is a great spot for visiting the University of Washington.  It's right next to campus and surrounded by good cheap eats. Sheldon told us to use the streets to the west to avoid paying for parking and that was helpful.  It's bright, but really a college apartment.  It's a great value but you have to be ready for beat up and stained carpet, a not especially clean bathroom, a well used couch and so-so towels.  As others mentioned, the alley noise is pretty incredible.  I'm not sure why trash trucks came both mornings we were there, but they came loud and proud.  Pack your earplugs :)
16834	1773803	8.0	9.0	46507045	We had a little trouble getting a hold of Sheldon when we first arrived, but it all worked out in the end.  Great location.
16835	1773803	8.0	9.0	46629898	The neighborhood and location or wonderful and very easy to catch the bus downtown. Sheldon left some info for local restaurants and things to do, which was nice. The apartment didn't feel as clean as I was expecting but the apartment served its purpose.
16836	1773803	8.0	9.0	46848435	Great place if you are looking to stay close to university.  Had everything I needed. 
16837	1773803	8.0	9.0	48007761	"We had a great experience - photos were accurate and host was responsive. He even invited us to an event in the city that we would have otherwise missed! 
The unit is in a vintage building in a college neighborhood, but the age of the unit and the noise of the neighborhood are offset by the host's welcoming attitude and a homey, bright, and comfortable spirit throughout. "
16838	1773803	8.0	9.0	48699676	"Sheldon's place was as described. I always read through the reviews thoroughly before booking a place and both agree and disagree with them. It's true, there is a lot of noise from the alley behind the apartment - both with the trash trucks and dumpsters and generally people just walking back there and talking. But I live in a city in an apartment that backs to an alley so it didn't really bother me. The apartment is very ""woo college!"" and took me back to my undergrad days. It's an old building with old furnishings. But I disagree with the other reviews that the apartment is dirty. Yes, the carpet has stains but I could tell that it had been recently vacuumed. Yes, the linens were old but I could tell they were clean. Yes, the shower is old but when you have an old, iron tub it's impossible to get it looking brand new. If you're looking for a nice, quiet place to spend your time indoors while in Seattle, this might not be the place for you. But I was on a work trip and the conference was at a nearby hotel and I just needed a place to crash and shower and Sheldon's place was great for that. There's no TV but the Wifi worked just fine for me to watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, and check email. I didn't use the kitchen at all so can't speak to that.

The only other ""downsides"" to the apartment were there weren't many three-prong plugs and the bathroom outlet wasn't working so I had to blow-dry my hair in the kitchen. Again, I didn't care but others might. I also had to keep my computer plugged in overnight in the kitchen because I worried the adapter in the bedroom would short my charger out. Also, I have sinus issues and have almost a constant runny nose and there weren't any tissues in the apartment. Not a big deal but I felt bad using paper towels so much. 

The area is definitely a crowded, college strip. There were quite a few homeless people around but again, I come from St. Louis where there are lots of college kids and homeless people so I wasn't shocked. I never felt unsafe. It's not my kind of ""scene"" with all of the young kids and hole-in-the-wall restaurants but again, I wasn't staying in that neighborhood for pleasure. I did eat from the sub shop below the apartment twice and the food was really good and the service was very nice. There's also a Starbucks two doors down which was nice. 

My flight got in late and Sheldon arranged for me to pick up the keys from the sub shop, which was easy enough. 

Overall, this is a great place to crash if you need to stay in the University District and if I have another conference in the area I will definitely stay here again! "
16839	1773803	8.0	9.0	49150563	The location was great to travel from, awesome cheap eats around the general area and only a 15 dollar uber to the market place. Sheldon was a little behind schedule when we met up with him but we were a little bit late on our check out so it was fine. Really the only thing I can complain about was the smell from outside. It was the most intense raw sewage that permeated through out the building that was almost unbearable. So we had to use air freshener to mask the stench. Other than that it was close to amazing gyros and crepes....
16840	1773803	8.0	9.0	49551615	Great little apartment! There was a little mix up with meeting times but it was a great experience over all. I will definitely stay here again 
16841	1773803	8.0	9.0	50456559	This apt's location offers great convenience for everyone who want to explore the beautiful campus of UW by walk, and many downtown attractions within 15 minutes drive. It's equipped with everything you need for a warm and comfort night. 
16842	1773803	8.0	9.0	50818351	The place is located in a great part of Seattle with cool trendy and ethnic restaurants all around. It is Seattle so parking can be rough but there is free parking west of the apartment you can find. Internet at this rental is slow so be advised if you have work you need to do online. Luckily there's great coffee shops all around in case you need to hop onto some faster internet. This is a big rental! You have lots of space, the host Sheldon is kind and happy to help you out. I recommend this rental. Mahalo!
16843	1773803	8.0	9.0	51103162	What a great find in the middle of the University district. With all the amenities of home and ample space, Sheldon has provided travelers with an awesome space to explore Seattle from. 
16844	1773803	8.0	9.0	52077794	Sheldon was extremely helpful and accommodating.  For my first experience using Airbnb, everything was just great.   
16845	1773803	8.0	9.0	53759528	Communication from Sheldon was very good. The location of his property is right on University Ave. so if you have business at UW like I did, it will be perfect location.  The unit is spacious and is quite large for a one bedroom with bonus room and large living area. I was at UW for an interview so I only used the property to sleep and shower.  Unit is in an older walk up so be prepared to climb stairs as there is no elevator.  Sheldon provided plenty of towels, blankets, shampoo, and everything needed for the stay.  If you are looking for a 5 star property then this unit is not for you, but if you are looking for a spacious apartment centrally located by the U at a reasonable price then you will be happy with Sheldon's place.
16846	1773803	8.0	9.0	55861450	Sheldon was very responsive with text/email/phonecalls.  He was very flexible and offered good suggestions for easing my short-notice travel into Seattle.
16878	6705584	8.0	10.0	35160961	Nice place for the money, as hotels in the university district are far more expensive.  Parking was difficult, but not impossible, but you don't really need a car to access all the shops and restaurants nearby.  Melissa was a good host, and just upgraded the wifi, so Internet access was great.  I stayed a week and it was only noisy once on a Saturday night, then perfectly quiet thereafter.  Shower was ocassionally lacking in power, but was always hot.  Would recommend for 1-2 people traveling on a budget.
16879	6705584	8.0	10.0	38146619	The listing is exactly as described.  quiet neighborhood with alot of good restaurants nearby. Melissa is great!  She responds very quickly to text.  Def reccomend.  
17132	293890	8.0	9.0	923285	I love staying in a place with verified photos, because I know I am getting exactly what I am seeing in the pictures. Laura was great she was available to answer any question I had before and during my stay. There was always street parking available and it is really close to the UW area if you are visiting friend or family. The place was spotless, and heaters are placed strategically around the apartment so the temperature was always perfect. In fact Laura set them up for me before I arrived, so I didn't have to do anything to them the entire week I was there. The kitchen is really cute, great use of space hanging the pots up, and anything you need is in the drawers (unless we are talking things to cook, that you will have to bring). I would definitely recommend Laura's place.
17133	293890	8.0	9.0	968796	The whole interaction with the host was easy and Laura was very helpful. Though she was away for work when we arrived, we were able to pick up the key and receive a tour/instructions from housemate Bob. The place is as it appears in the pictures. It's not fancy but perfectly comfortable. It has been freshly painted, was clean and warm (on a cold night). The kitchen was a bonus so we could make breakfast for ourselves before heading out.  On street parking and easy access to public transport is convenient. Thanks Laura and hope your new project goes well for you.
17134	293890	8.0	9.0	968957	Laura was a very gracious host and made everything so easy. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!
17135	293890	8.0	9.0	1043904	"Host was on top of any requests I had.  Space was as described.  However, safety and privacy was a concern during my stay.  The main door has a large open window inserted where anyone can look inside.  There were no drapes for any of the windows, so that anyone may look in at any time.  Walk way to the back a little cluttered and dark.  Tripped a few times coming home.

Otherwise, value for the space was good.  This is my first Airbnb, and I am not sure I will repeat.  Thanks."
17136	293890	8.0	9.0	1339774	Best value for two bedrooms! The place didn't have any window coverings, and not well lit at night time-safety main concern. 
17137	293890	8.0	9.0	1349406	Laura was great!!  The place was perfect.  
17138	293890	8.0	9.0	1427714	"Pluses:  Clean (mostly); quiet; private; location, especially if you're vegan or don't have a car, is perfect

Minuses:  Wireless internet did not function for more than a few seconds so the place really does not have wireless access.
There is a one roll of toilet paper policy that I find a little weird, so be prepared to buy more.  

"
17139	293890	8.0	9.0	1464649	"Pros: Residence is close to the University District; a quiet neighborhood.   Both bedrooms have ample closet space.  We slept in the master bedroom. The extra blankets and pillows made the bed very comfortable.  The nightstand's lamps gave a bright light for reading.  The bathroom is large and towels are provided.  The apartment is heated with space heaters.  They were all set when we arrived and really kept the area warm.   The kitchen has some very nice cookware and cutlery.   Many eateries are within walking distance.  A no frills place - good value for the space.  Laura promptly responded to emails and phone calls. 


Cons:   Low ceilings in some areas of the apartment.  The floor, except in the bathroom, is covered with black foam matting used underneath exercise equipment.   We kept tripping over the ""bubble” where it does not lay flat.  Wear slippers or indoor shoes - I am not sure how the floor is cleaned other than to vacuum over it.
  
The only mirror is located in the bathroom.  The fixtures were clean.  However, the bottom of the shower curtain appeared moldy – needs replaced.   It did not wrap around the entire tub.   Be sure to check the toilet paper on hand, as you will need to supply your own.  We did not find out about the toilet paper until our 2nd day.  Suggestion: post this in the bathroom.     

I asked Laura if an iron and ironing board were available.  She commented, ""People in Seattle don't iron their clothes.""  I was taken aback by her comment.  This may be true of some people in Seattle, but certainly not of all the people in Seattle.  Anyways...Laura did offer the use of her iron and ironing board.  She warned me that her iron had some issues - shutting off (and a scorched faceplate) - but it worked fine for us.  I appreciated her allowing us to use hers as we thought we would have to go out and buy one. 

The kitchen - No coffee pot!    A French press instead.  I had no idea how to use one.  No instructions provided.   I called Laura.  She told me “there are lots of places to buy coffee.”  True…but who wants to go out at 4:30 am and buy a cup of coffee?  Anyways, Laura did come and show me how to assemble the French press.   Learning new ways is a good thing…however; I prefer the coffee pot – because it keeps the coffee hot longer.  This would not have been an issue IF a microwave were available to reheat the coffee. The dishwasher had dishes in it.  This made me think that the housekeeping was not up to par.  I did not remove them and we did not use the dishwasher.  No instructions on where to place composting items, trash, bedding, and towels upon departure. 

The walkway - door – entry.  This is NOT a place for someone with mobility issues.  The walkway is hazardous and obstructed.  No outdoor light.  Laura did give us a flashlight – a small key ring with a light…not an effective solution.  There is an overhead light at the entrance, but it is not operational.  The key and the lock are tricky to work.  Glass wine bottles stand on end to fill a deep hole adjacent to the stairwell.  This is a safety issue.   Yard area - debris covered and overgrown with grass/weeds.  No outdoor seating area.   We did not use the washer and/or dryer. 
"
17140	293890	8.0	9.0	1540798	The path to the basement had bottles placed upsidedown to cover up a hole in the ground.  The basement floor was covered in foam pieces, not carpet or traditional floor. The ceiling was so low we had to duck down.  The beds were OK.  The bathroom needed work and I thought maybe I saw mold above the shower.  There was no soap provided for the bathroom.  The dishes provided in the kitchen were very large and few.  We were a family with kids and this was NOT a good place to stay for our family.
17141	293890	8.0	9.0	1565570	"The price was really great and the space was extremely spacious just like described.  It was nice to have a full kitchen and two separate bedrooms for myself, my partner and our two kids.  The beds were simple and firm but I liked that.  The king bed is huge!  The price is really incredible for being so close to downtown Seattle and being so large.  It was very clean.  My two kids had their own room with two twin beds.  Laura was very nice and gave us a full tour and explained everything.

I wouldn't call the space ""cozy"" though.  It is very sparsely furnished and it isn't really decorated at all per se.  There are no window coverings which isn't really a problem as far as people seeing in but it makes the space look stark and unfinished.  I wasn't particularly found of the rubber mat ""carpet"" throughout.  Again, it makes the space more stark than ""cozy"".   The internet service was spotty at best and many times simply didn't work at all which was frustrating.  I found the $200 cleaning deposit to be a bit extreme considering that the place is so stark and simple.  How much damage could I do to rubber covered concrete floors?

All said, if you are in need of spacious 2 bedroom with a full kitchen accomodations at bargain basement price, this will fit the bill perfectly.  On the other hand, if you like nicely decorated spaces and have a little more money to spend on accomodations that are inviting and truly cozy, you might want to look elsewhere."
17142	293890	8.0	9.0	1605473	"First the good: Plenty of space for our three adults and two preschoolers.  Clear instructions written throughout the place so we knew what was expected (compost & recycling rules, etc).  Location is great, right in the city.

Bad: Floor is uneven, we fell at lease twice.  Very low ceiling in places (don't be over 5'10"" or you'll hit your head).  No window coverings so very light in bedrooms both at night and in the morning (our preschoolers go to be long before dark, and tend to wake up with the sun unless we can darken the room).  The entrance is in the back and the way back there is very narrow, slippery and has quite a bit of broken glass (much of it seems like intentionally placed beach glass but still made us leery with our little ones).  "
17143	293890	8.0	9.0	1620066	Laura was very prompt and available for all questions. We love the neighborhood and her space is perfect for venturing out and about.
17144	293890	8.0	9.0	1673834	Location is very good for us. It close to #66 bus station to downtown. Convenient to supermarket shop. Restaurent nearby. We love this place.
17145	293890	8.0	9.0	2035170	"Laura was a great, thorough, prepared and friendly hostess.  

The place was a basement unit, and was far from luxurious, though it was never advertised as such.  It was very neat, clean and orderly, though.  And, it was a great value and bang for the buck.  Prices in Seattle in the summer can be pretty steep, and this place had 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom and a full kitchen.  It also stays very cool in the summer which is a big plus.  Overall, it was a great value and I'd stay there again.  I wanted to give it 4 stars, but it was lacking a bit of the refinement I'd reserve for 4 stars (like carpet, bright lighting, non-basement/alley entry)..  but she was so nice and we enjoyed our stay overall and it was a very good deal!"
17146	293890	8.0	9.0	2461503	This location was absolutely perfect for me. I was in town for a month-long yoga teacher training program, and this location was about a 5 minute drive from the yoga studio which was perfect. I'm a vegan and my boyfriend is a vegetarian and this location is walking distance to several vegetarian and vegan restaurants which was wonderfully convenient for us. The price for the entire basement apartment and the amount of time we stayed was unbeatable. I would recommend staying here to my friends, and I would stay here again.
17147	293890	8.0	9.0	5173746	Location is the greatest asset and is roomy for four people.  Beds are low as in Europe, nice kitchenette with dishes.  In basement , low ceilings though, tall people must stoop where ceiling is lower for covered ductwork.  Flooring is unusual but functional.  
17148	293890	8.0	9.0	5309449	"Our family would recommend this as a friendly, clean, convenient, economical option for Seattle. 
We had a nice stay in Laura's basement apartment. They have  thoughtfully appointed the apartment with everything you need for a comfortable stay. It is very spacious. For our little family (2 adults 3 kids) it was nice to have room to stretch out. Plenty of room for a port-a-crib in the master bed room. It was also nice to have a separate entrance to come and go without concern. It was not fancy but clean.  

It has great access to the 1-5 which made going down town a breeze. The parking is street parking but we never had a problem finding a convenient spot. 

One observation, it is a basement and the ceiling is low. At 5'9"" I never hit my head but any taller and it would have been a concern. If this isn't an issue for you then I would recommend this place for a pleasant, economical option in Seattle. "
17149	293890	8.0	9.0	6952149	We rented the apartment for 2 months.We found it to be comfortable and accessible to bus routes,grocery ,and restaurants.Laura was available,but not intrusive. The basement apartment was comfortable ,even in the summer heat.I would definitely rent this again.
17150	293890	8.0	9.0	12107435	The reservation was canceled 66 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17152	1589461	8.0	9.0	7125887	Melissa was very helpful in getting us settled. We were able to get parking for the building.  She did ask us to move out of the original place we reserved, but made it up to us by helping with the parking.
17153	1589461	8.0	9.0	14755654	The apartment was exactly as described. Clean, quiet, and close to UW. Plenty of space and a comfortable bed. 
17154	1589461	8.0	9.0	14859387	Melissa is a champ.  This was my first AirBNB encounter and Melissa provides us with all the info needed and a comfortable place to stay.  I look forward to using AirBNB many more times.  Thanks again Melissa!
17155	1589461	8.0	9.0	16361718	The place is as advertised: very clean, simple (to the point of being a bit austere) and in a great location.  Melissa was a very helpful host.  Only downside was the the neighborhood can be noisy any time of night, although the building itself was very quiet.  But that is the price for being very close to a lot of restaurants and bars in a student area.
17156	1589461	8.0	9.0	43219244	My wife and I stayed at this place for one month. The good things about it are its location, only 5 min from the the University of Washington for those visiting there, that it is quite spacious and with plenty of natural light, and that Melissa was very helpful when needed. However, there are many bad things that would make us choose a different place next time. Most importantly, the bedroom is very noisy during the night because it faces the laundry room of a hotel. Even with the windows (double glazing) closed, the only solution for me was to sleep with earplugs every night. The other problem is that it is under equipped, we had to buy many things for the kitchen to function properly. Another thing is that when we arrived the place was not really clean, Melissa had to take out many things from the fridge and bin when we told her about it. Also, remember to ask for proper bed sheets, as the default was to have only one bottom bed sheet between you and the mattress and an electric blanket to cover you (difficult to clean properly). Overall, the place was OK, but too noisy and with below average cleaning standards.
17157	9303530	8.0	10.0	55585099	"Ren & his wife were gracious and helpful before, during, and after the process.

The location was ideal as it was a reasonable walk to UW Medical Center even with a 4 year old kid... and the walk there across beautiful UW campus was unexpected and fantastic.  The unit is clean and the area felt safe staying with a family.

Advise to all Airbnb renters - communicate with your host.  We had a couple of minor issues that Ren would've resolved immediately had we made him aware. 

We recommend working with Ren if you are looking to stay near UW at a reasonable price."
18864	7219838	8.0	9.0	42473773	Alexa was awesome! Communication about key and address were clear, and it was easy to find/get in. The living room where we slept is big with lots of space for 3 of us. Alexa left us fresh towels and made us an air mattress. She also gave us some tips for where to eat/drink. We had privacy even though it was her living room. I'd recommend it for sure!
18865	7219838	8.0	9.0	42642008	Alexa was really easy to coordinate with and made it easy for me to arrive on my own schedule. Her place was a quick cab ride or bus ride from the downtown area. She wasn't home when I arrived, but left a note with where everything is. She was very welcoming but gave me ample privacy, even though i was staying in the living room. Overall my stay was very comfortable.
18866	7219838	8.0	9.0	42770624	It's a night in her living room, nothing fancy, and is just right for us as traveling students.  The host seems to be busy the day we stayed so there wasn't much interaction between us.  The bathroom is a bit messy but the living room, kitchen and dinning room are clean.  Overall it's a pleasant experience.
18867	7219838	8.0	9.0	43468600	Alexa was very accommodating and communicative. The place is exactly as pictured. I loved the air mattress and the great Washington air filtering through the ajar sliding glass door. Older building but looks to be tons of younger, educated recent college grad types. Felt safe and did the trick. Thank you Alexa for hosting us. 
18868	7219838	8.0	9.0	43563611	"Very clean and tidy, close to downtown Seattle which was great! 
Alexa was very kind and allowed us to come and go as we pleased. 
Prefect for a one night stay, thank you! "
18869	7219838	8.0	9.0	44080409	I stayed at Alexa's living room for one night. It was comfortable and I had everything I needed. Alexa is a nice host, we didn't get the chance to talk much, but her home is comfortable, and the instructions she gave to access her home were clear and convenient.
18870	7219838	8.0	9.0	44845867	Alexa picked us up from The train station which was lovely. The apartment is a bit outside of downtown but there is a direct bus just outside the house. The air mattress was quite comfortable but the apartment could have been cleaner. 
18871	7219838	8.0	9.0	45296306	I stayed for two nights at alexa's apartment and it couldn't have been better. She made me feel welcomed and already had the air mattress  out and a clean towel out for me when I arrived, she even had the Wifi password ready for me. She gave me specific instructions on how to get into her house when she was not home which made things much easier. Alexa herself suggested a couple of areas I could go for some food, and even gave me a ride over to where they were. Overall for the two days that I stayed, this could not have been much better.
18872	7219838	8.0	9.0	45730691	The listing was just as described, and Alexa was very accommodating for me and my two friends with me. Neighborhood was good, and solid location for getting to downtown Seattle. Thank you Alexa!
18873	7219838	8.0	9.0	47290458	"Alexa was very responsive and communicative. My friends and I did a Pacific Northwest trip (Portland --> Seattle --> Vancouver) from LA. Her apartment was very lovely and comfortable. She was also dogsitting and he was the sweetest pup ever :)

I absolutely loved the neighborhood. I just had to go for a morning run! We took a lyft to Pike street, which took less than 10 mins. Got off at Pike and Boren, and walked to the Pike Market. About 15-20 min walk!"
18874	7219838	8.0	9.0	48475373	We had à great stay. Good location but the appartement could have been à bit cleaner. Alexa was à great host thouhg! 
18875	7219838	8.0	9.0	50155094	Great  Stay! We booked the room last minute, and Alexa had the place ready (super Clean)  with all the accommodations we could need. She was friendly and gave us advice for things to do. Highly recommend her :)
18876	7219838	8.0	9.0	52201200	Alexa was very flexible with time and let us stay with less than 12 hrs notice. She provided bedding and some toiletries. It was a great first experience with AirBNB!
18877	7219838	8.0	9.0	53426854	Everything was great. Alexa was very helpful.
18878	7219838	8.0	9.0	53868486	"Alexa was very kind and accommodating with my late inquiry about the room. I requested to book the room the day I needed it, and she was able to let us stay on such a short notice. The place is clean and organized and it feels very comfortable. Alexa does a good job of making the place feel cozy. 
Alexa was very kind and helpful and was able to give us a couple tips, as it was our first trip to Seattle in quite some time. 
Even though we didn't spend much time at the apartment, I enjoyed the time that we did and I would definitely stay here again!"
18879	7219838	8.0	9.0	54833188	Alexa was a great host! She took me in last minute  and was super laid back. Her place was clean, bed was comfy and her dog was great. She let me use the shower and even provided me a towel and soap/shampoo. I would definitely recommend her and would stay there again! 
18880	7219838	8.0	9.0	55733443	Alexa was a friendly, responsive host. The apt was comfortable and in a good location. Enjoyed my stay and would recommend.
18881	7219838	8.0	9.0	56699374	"Alexa was a great host! She had everything ready to go when I arrived and her pup gave the sweetest little welcoming. I felt extremely comfortable staying there the few days I did. 
"
20640	6528192	8.0	9.0	36692630	Jennifer was a wonderful host! She is a very nice woman and is willing to chat and help you find your way around.  She gave me excellent advice of which shops to go to and informative on what types of things were in our close vicinity.  The listing was as described and is in a really great location! It's super easy to get downtown and the apartment is close to many other bus stops that make it really easy to get around town! I would highly recommend staying with Jennifer! She is very sweet and super welcoming.  Thank you :) 
20641	6528192	8.0	9.0	38878969	"I stayed at Jen's place in order to familiarize myself with the various Seattle neighborhoods while I started a new job and looked for an apartment of my own. The neighborhood felt quiet and residential but was very convenient to downtown and Capitol Hill on foot and U District one bus away. 

Jen was a great host and very knowledgable about the area. The apartment was cozy and the private room was large enough to accommodate several big suitcases I had stuffed into my car for the move. Plenty of closet space and clothes hangers. 

I couldn't have asked for a better temporary first home in Seattle. Thanks so much Jen! "
20642	6528192	8.0	9.0	45098513	"Jennifer is a super host with cats ;-)
The neighbourhood is very close to the nice Capitol Hill area and public transportation is super (also for your bike). The listing is well described and you are free to use the apartment, kitchen and bathroom. It is al together not very big, but the room is sufficiently big. It was a very nice week in Seattle and I rented a bike nearby. You'll need gear for the hills!"
20643	6528192	8.0	9.0	45659473	Great location very near coffee, shops, small grocery, bus line. Comfortable. Very accomodating host.
20644	6528192	8.0	9.0	46905843	Jenn was a great host.  My room was clean, comfortable, and ready for me when I arrived.  The neighborhood was conveniently located next to lots of restaurants and shopping.  Uber is very prevalent and I felt safe walking around the neighborhood after dark.  She was very knowledgeable about the area and pointed out some great places to grab some local goods and great meals, including a farmers market and a restaurant that her friend started.  Jenn was very friendly and went out of her way to make me feel comfortable in her home.  She has 2 cats, and as a cat person it was one of the reasons I chose her property for my stay in Seattle.  The cats were definitely curious and one of them was very friendly and loved playing and having her chin scratched.  I'd definitely stay with Jenn again in the future. 
20645	6528192	8.0	9.0	47689900	"Jennifer is a friendly lady who loves to cook :} and lives in a small but  very cosy apartment.  Always  responded to messages. My stay was short, all I needed is a bed and was out most of the time. 
Cleanliness is guaranteed."
20646	6528192	8.0	9.0	48268593	"Jennifer is a excellent host. I had great conversations with her, her cats are fun, and if she's making food and offers, take her up on that. Delicious.

The place is cosy and well located. An easy walk down Pike and Pine street, and close to downtown. Just easy all round."
20647	6528192	8.0	9.0	49356628	Jennifer was a welcoming host and the room suited my needs very well. 
20648	6528192	8.0	9.0	49629601	Space was as advertised, great location. Friendly and courteous host, I'd stay here again. 
20649	6528192	8.0	9.0	50087254	"I had a great three-night stay w/ Jen, and her cats. She is very easy-going and interesting. Her kitties are as animated as I've seen.
   Great location for the money. Within a block are two major bus lines. So, getting in from SETAC was easy ($6-8)and an hour...vs $50 taxi. A bus to downtown sights is 15 minutes. Out to UW is ten minutes, etc. Within a few blocks of her flat are two recreational pot stores, a few cafes, an alternative/indie cinema, a beer garden, Ethiopian restaurants and one or two great BBQ rib joints. Within a 20 minute walk are a Trader Joe's. Safeway, an Seattle's Co-op organic store.
  The neighborhood doesn't look tops, per se, nor is her flat glamorous, but it's great value for money. She is a great hostess, and the neighborhood has lots going on if you look."
20650	6528192	8.0	9.0	50684157	Jennifer is a great host. And her apartment is located in a nice area, close to everything!
20651	6528192	8.0	9.0	51935323	"Jen is a lovely host, very welcoming and nice. She's got some naughty cats always trying to get into the room where they are not allowed to.
Her place is at the top floor of a house in a very quiet neighbourhood. Nice stay."
20652	6528192	8.0	9.0	52691186	"My boyfriend and I had an awesome time in Jennifer's space. I was heading down to Seattle to work and was going to be pulling some very later overnight shifts and she was very accommodating with my comings and goings at odd hours. As well at the last minuet when my boyfriend decided to join me she was more than welcoming to the both of us even though she feels the space is too small for 2 people and I had only booked for myself.
He space was gorgeous and the neighborhood was amazing. We live in East Vancouver, Canada and this area and her space felt just like home to us. 
Jennifer was super awesome about giving us our space but also was up for chatting and hanging out.
All and all we had an amazing weekend in a great area of town. "
20653	6528192	8.0	9.0	53681864	This listing was exactly what it described. The neighbourhood was quiet, yet close to bustling Capitol Hill amenities and across the street from a cannabis dispensary (for those interested, as it's legal in the state). Jennifer was incredibly thoughtful, kind and helpful when it came to places to check out for food and exploration. Her cats were delightful and very friendly (which was fun for us, as we had left a cat behind to travel). 
20654	6528192	8.0	9.0	54033862	Thanks, Jen, for the great place: easy parking, friendly cats, good tea, easy access to restaurants, museums, and more. I loved my weekend in Seattle!
20655	6528192	8.0	9.0	54338859	Had a fantastic time staying at Jennifer's Cozy Attic Apartment. Her cats are wonderful, curious, and friendly. The location is great and close to some small boutique coffeeshops, if that's your thing, and also a trader joe's. I really love Seattle and had a cozy stay here. Definitely recommend.
20656	6528192	8.0	9.0	54852825	"Jennifer is a great host, friendly, open, even shared some dinner. She alway responded to messages 
The apartment is cosy and authentic, the house is in a quiet neighbourhood, but not too far away from interesting places and (most of) the cats are friendly, curious and playful.
I had a great stay at the apartment. "
22547	7095802	8.0	8.0	37716607	Everything was as described. Kevin was very good at communicating with us and very nice. Everything was clean and organized. Thanks!
22548	7095802	8.0	8.0	38566581	Really cool and clean place! perfect to stay when u are in Seattle! Thank you for hosting
22549	7095802	8.0	8.0	39685593	Room is as described. Complete kitchen for cooking. Bathroom is shared but we did not have any issues with it. Kevin has excellent response time to questions or concerns. In a nice quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown and nightlife areas.
22550	7095802	8.0	8.0	39996589	"Kevin was a welcoming and understanding host as we were ten minutes late for checkout. This happened because there currently is construction around the area which meant cabs as well as buses had to be rerouted. Our bus broke down on the Sunday morning thus having to switch buses and change route. 
The place was clean (minus the tub in the bathroom) and nice. This place was a good place to stay. However, if you are a light sleeper the doors are stiff and are very loud when opening and shutting. 
If you are just looking for a clean room and a bed to sleep I would recommend this place. 
"
22551	7095802	8.0	8.0	40173927	We had a perfectly pleasant time at this place.  It was quaint and just how it was described. The yard was nice.
22552	7095802	8.0	8.0	40809070	The room was exactly as indicated in photos and description. Sharing the bathroom with other guests never posed any problem. The location was perfect for visiting Seattle and close to bus routes and near downtown. Kevin was helpful and friendly and available to answer any questions we had. Thanks for a pleasant stay! :) 
22553	7095802	8.0	8.0	41668844	Nice, clean, quiet space. Easy to find and gain access to. Did not meet host but he made sure we had all info regarding check in/out/ wifi and city suggestions for us before we arrived. 
22554	7095802	8.0	8.0	41985615	Good place to stay, perfect for what we needed. Quiet and conveniently located. We never met the host but he was very responsive :)
22555	7095802	8.0	8.0	43726548	Kevin was a great host. It was very warm in Seattle while we were there and we checked in it was warm in the room. Kevin hooked us up with a new fan to make sure we were comfy. Bed was very comfy. You are sharing a bathroom with others (like a dorm) and the room is very small. However, we were only there one night and it was super close to downtown and from a bus stop so it was totally worth it.  
22556	7095802	8.0	8.0	44471243	Great first stay in Seattle -- Kevin was accomodating and attentive. Thanks for everything!
22557	7095802	8.0	8.0	44730152	Great stay! Thank u Kevin!
22558	7095802	8.0	8.0	45381589	Kevin was a good host, left clear and easy to follow instructions on how to check in and out, even asked if I wanted a fan for my room since it was a warm night the day of my arrival. The bathroom is shared with other people, but was never a problem. Downtown Seattle was only a quick 8 minute drive away, maybe less. If you're like me and just want a place to sleep/shower and keep your belongings, look no further.
22559	7095802	8.0	8.0	45598494	I stayed at Kevin's place for one night before work meetings in downtown Seattle the next day. Kevin was a very responsive and communicative host. I was concerned about being a bit cold, and when I let Kevin know he brought me an extra blanket. Kevin also provided water bottles and towels. I found street parking easily near the house. The room was a little smaller than I had expected, but it was clean and functional. The bathroom is shared, but I didn't have any issues getting in when I needed to. I would recommend this place for a busy person who has a lot on their plate and needs a simple place to sleep at night. 
22560	7095802	8.0	8.0	46158265	Fantastic stay at Kevin's. Excellent and informative communication from time of booking. Everything as described. We ran into him a couple of times and he was so lovely giving us tips on the best places to check out! Thanks again!
22561	7095802	8.0	8.0	46454411	"I loved the fact that we needed a room immediately with an early check in and we were easily accommodated within just a couple of hours.  This was our very first bnb experience and we were soo happy with our decision to do this we will be visiting more bnbs as we travel quite a bit. Thank you for being so helpful. The room was just as described.Although there wasn't a TV the internet was very strong and very fast, so my wife and I were a ble to watch Netflix from my phone. A bit small but accommodating. Oh and the bed.....aaahhh so comfortable 
:)"
22562	7095802	8.0	8.0	48894721	"Host - Kevin had everything prepared and his messages were concise with lots of good info. He was very responsive.
Room - The room is basic, but comfortable. Shared bathroom was fine. Good for solo travelers.
Location - Great location, close to lots of good stuff. This is my main reason for staying here. I didn't take advantage of the public transit since I had a car but it seems really convenient to use from the house. I had no trouble with street parking during my stay."
22563	7095802	8.0	8.0	49559217	It was nice to have detailed description about directions and restaurants around (please add the ligh trail station name to help others in the future). The room itself was ok. There was water, cup, lotion, towels and even a roll of toilette paper (since the bath was shared).  I am personally allergic to fabric softners of the bedding, so i had to sleep with my own towel covering the pillow so i wouldn't smell it.   The sheets had pilling on it as if it were very old. Then i saw a HUGE crack in the window (behind the pillows) as i left in the morning...that is a safety compromise and i wish that was disclosed in the profile (i wouldnt' have stayed in a room with that).  Kevin himself was friendly and helpful when i accidentally ran into him.  The doors weren't well aligned (both to the room and to the bathroom), so when i had to get ready and leave in the morning, i felt i was waking everyone up with the door making big noises from the jamming.  Last thing- someone was talking loud either outside or upstairs and maybe because of the crack in the window, i could hear almost every word of their conversation. it finally stopped after 11pm. 
22564	7095802	8.0	8.0	49895562	Room was as shown and everything was set up well to accommodate accordingly.
22565	7095802	8.0	8.0	51325188	"The location and price are very convenient.
It was easy to find place using host's guidelines.  
Room is really small. Bath and kitchen are shared with more tenants. Unfortunately,kitchen and bath are not very clean. No desire to cook there. Need to wait if toiled is occupied. "
22566	7095802	8.0	8.0	51517179	The queen size mattress is the most comfortable one I ever experienced on AirBnB. But to be honest, I didn't recommend so much if you seek for a clean living environment. The kitchen is shared with 3 other room guests so it is just a big mess when you entered the kitchen. Lots of dishes are just thrown into the sink. And also the floor is not clean very much.  On that night, i guess there are 3 guests in another room and one more guest in second room. So you can imagine  how long the queue is for the showering.  But the good thing is Kevin is nice, his response is fast as well if you message him.  So if you don't care much about the cleanness and long time waiting for the bathroom, it is not a bad choice.
22567	7095802	8.0	8.0	57364577	Very nice room, a little smaller than I thought but It was perfect for to be honest. Private entrance, so I was able to come home any time and not worry if I was going to be disturbing anyone and Kevin is upstairs in case you need anything. I had a great time!
22568	7095802	8.0	8.0	57735747	Kevin let us in and everything was fine! Bed was comfy and clean. Great location!
23718	9532861	8.0	8.0	55326289	Beautiful loft. Internet did not work, which was unfortunate. Great place if you are looking for minimalism and a convenient location.
24503	7999692	8.0	10.0	46776076	This is a great apartment! Fantastic views on Lake Union and the CBD and easy to get to all the must see places ($8 uber to anywhere). Clean and equipped. Also walking distance to nearby restaurants and deli. We loved just sitting on the balcony and watching the sunset! 
25116	7401671	8.0	9.0	39134928	Thanks Rebecca for welcoming us into your cozy home. It felt like being in a family home , especially with Paddington your kitty. Paddington is such a cuddler.. we wanted to adopt him :) We loved all the awesome collections and funky pictures.. If we are ever in the Eastlake area and need a place, we will definitely hit you up.. and thanks for the cat tree!! xxoo Amy and Jonny
25117	7401671	8.0	9.0	39453933	Rebecca and paddington are wonderfully gracious hosts, the little studio was perfect for one night with my closest friend. We had a great time walking around the neighborhood and watching the sunset from the lake. Very friendly neighbors, wonderful views of the lake, had a great time! Thank you!!
25118	7401671	8.0	9.0	40025004	"Rebecca was quick to respond, apologetic for our experience and kindly refunded us for our stay. She was the highlight to this experience.  
When we got there we stepped in cat throw up on the floor, no food or water in the cat bowls. The cat is ricdulously needy and will not leave you alone or stop meowing. He also scratched me when I tried to move him off of me. He is relentless and we were not able to get any rest after driving all day. I have to say this was less than ideal and I don't believe I'm exaggerating our experience.  Besides the issues with the cat keeping us up all night we were woken up twice by people coming by, I understand maybe a friend stops by early in the morning but 3am is slightly an inconvenience. Both people seemed friendly enough but on top of everything else it was very irritating. My boyfriend and I are both covered in cat hair and were exhausted for our wedding plans the next day. Also the bathroom toliet handle was broken and we found a dead mouse. This experience was less than convenient."
25119	7401671	8.0	9.0	41133834	Rebecca and Paddington were wonderful hosts! She had loads of recommendations for things to see and places to eat in Seattle. Her place was small but very comfortable, clean and decorated so nicely. Paddington woke me up a couple times at night but he was very nice and super cuddly! I will definitely try to look up Rebecca next time I am in Seattle!
25120	7401671	8.0	9.0	41657839	Had a great time and relived my youth living in this cozy funky little urban retreat.  Wish I had Rebecca's talent for DIY decorating and efficient use of space.  Super responsive, she anticipated all my questions and answered right away when new ones arose.  Easy to park the car for the week and just catch the bus to the UW or street car downtown (or uber in a pinch).  Enjoyed glorious strolls along the working waterfront every single evening - I lucked out on a string of sunny days and gorgeous sunsets.  After all that walking, I promptly refilled my calorie deficit at a value priced local eateries and splurged one night on steak and sushi in the harbor. Paddington the Cat is extra friendly - his antics were a big hit with my daughter during daily Skype calls back home.  Many thanks for the warm welcome and use of your quirky studio!
25121	7401671	8.0	9.0	42012044	Thank you for opening your space to us!  Great vibes, quiet, nice walking, love Grand Central!! Paddington was snuggly and entertaining! Thanks again! 
25122	7401671	8.0	9.0	43113493	We had a great time. Rebecca lets us know about local live music and was willing to offer any suggestions. Paddington was entertaining and loved to cuddle. 
25123	7401671	8.0	9.0	44202685	"Great little place in a great neighborhood.  Lots of cool restaurants and pubs around and nice and close to downtown.

We enjoyed hanging out with Paddington and having lots of cuddles with him!"
25124	7401671	8.0	9.0	45232066	The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
25125	7401671	8.0	9.0	45285657	Small studio with handy location in Eastlake – walking distance to cafes and shops, Lake Union Park, plus easy access to public transportation if you need it.
25126	7401671	8.0	9.0	45761650	The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
25127	7401671	8.0	9.0	48474796	"Rebecca was a very nice host. The appartment is in a very good neighbourhood. You can reach downtown easily by foot. The appartment has a really nice and fancy decoration but it is very very small.
Paddington... the cat...  he is adorable and likes to cuddel all the time. The problem was that he was alone the whole day, since we were sightseeing in Seattle. And so he needed a loooot of attention during the night. No problem when you don't need to sleep. He throws everything on the ground he can find, jumps all oder the place and rests on your head and everywhere,when he is finally tired. You can let him out, but he will comeback within three hours and wakes you up again with lots of ""meow"". The bed makes a lots of noise if you move and the shower is not in the best condition any more. 
But all together it is a nice place to stay and Paddington is a hell of a cat."
25128	7401671	8.0	9.0	49703481	Rebecca was a great host!  She was there when we arrived and had a lot of recommendations for while we were in Seattle.  As previously mentioned her cat, Paddington, was staying with us.  He was a really loving cat but had a lot of energy that seemed to only come out when you wanted to go to sleep.  However if you let him outside before you wanted to sleep and let him unwind he was fine.  Overall it was a great experience and we had a great weekend!
25129	7401671	8.0	9.0	49927305	"Really nice place to stay at Seattle, really close to downtown, easy access to transports, easy to park.
Rebecca is nice and available to answer any question!
We highly recommend it."
25130	7401671	8.0	9.0	50715022	If your staying in Seattle for a few days Rebecca's place is great. Easy access, easy/free parking around back, & private entrance up the back stairs. Rebecca is very easy going and gave us some good places to check out in the city.
25134	6852288	8.0	10.0	38033340	Helena has a lovely space, with a beautiful view of Seattle from her living room. We had most of the basics available, although we didn't get much information from our host about amenities we could access. It was a little strange that we never got to meet Helena during our three days there, but that's the nature of how Airbnb can work.
25135	6852288	8.0	10.0	38524054	The apartment's Capitol Hill location and view of downtown Seattle cannot be beat. The bedroom was a good size and the bed comfortable, though the bathroom was just a little dingy (the hazard of an older building, I think). Helena was super responsive prior to our arrival and was friendly when we met her briefly the first night. Unfortunately, we kept different hours and were awoken a few of the nights by people coming into the apartment. That said, if you are planning on being out and about during much of the day (and later into the night than we were) it's a fine spot for the price. 
25136	6852288	8.0	10.0	39104066	The location — right in the Capitol Hill neighborhood across from delicious Top Pot donuts, two great bars and bike share station— was perfect. Epic view of the Space Needle and dramatic sunsets. Very comfortable bed. While Seattle can be pretty hot in the summer (and the apartment does not have AC) the room has a window that adds a nice breeze and keeps the room cool. We did not get to meet Helena; however, she was very responsive to our messages and we had no problem accessing the apartment. 
25137	6852288	8.0	10.0	39569596	Helena was a perfect hostess. She made sure I had a desk to work at. Everything was provided. Even in the middle of a heat wave, her place was comfortable. Thanks so much!
25138	6852288	8.0	10.0	40123997	My friend and I stayed at Helena's apartment while we were in town for a music festival. Helena was not actually there, but her friend was staying at the apartment during our stay. The area was super convenient to everything we needed (there's a couple of bars, a restaurant, and a Top Pot donut across the street. Using public transportation was also very easy. The apartment is charming and the bed is extremely comfortable after spending a day exploring by foot. Helena gave great instructions before I arrived and was very helpful!
25139	6852288	8.0	10.0	41150267	Helenas place was in a brilliant location in quiet spot, but close to all the action in Capitol Hill. The check in was smooth and the place was clean. Thanks! 
25140	6852288	8.0	10.0	41966774	Great place!  Clean and comfortable and Helena was welcoming and friendly.
25141	6852288	8.0	10.0	46129741	Helena was a great host. Very attentive and communicative! I'd definitely stay with her again. The location was great for me; an easy walk downtown and plenty of access to public transit and nightlife. 
25142	6852288	8.0	10.0	46964473	For the location, the price simply can't be beat.  An easy walk to downtown Seattle, or a cheap Uber/Lyft/cab ride, Capital Hill is a great place to be, for both tourism and nightlife.  The host didn't  hover over us, was very flexible with our arrival and departure times, and allowed us privacy.  The room itself is small but clean, with room in the closet for storage.  The shared bathroom could use a scrubbing, but at this price point and location, its hard to complain.
25143	6852288	8.0	10.0	48763270	Helena's place is super well located, I was able to walk to literally everything I wanted to get to in Seattle. Check in and check out was flexible and convenient. The building is very very quiet, comfortable and clean.
25144	6852288	8.0	10.0	49189612	Good communication. Nice place with an amazing view. Great location with neighborhood market, bar, coffee shop all a few steps away. Great neighborhood to capture the character of Seattle. Also there's a bike share pod on the street, which is a great option for cruising around the city. The price reflects the quality of the place. I would stay here again. Only thing that was inconvenient was that my flight left in the evening and I could not leave my bags there on the day of check out. I guess it's ok because this is not a hotel, but it's definitely something to be aware of.

Helena was very helpful on my stay in Seattle. Her apartment is very comfortable, with a great view of the city. Location is fantastic, so easy to get anywhere in the city, and a great place to stay locally. "
25146	6852288	8.0	10.0	51368072	Helena had everything arranged to make my check in easy.  She kept in contact to make sure everything went as planned
25147	6852288	8.0	10.0	55600988	The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
25394	3528627	8.0	9.0	15735172	Lyn was a great hostess!  Very kind and not too into our business.  The room is very close to Discovery Park where we spent a 1/2 day exploring.  We could also get into downtown or Ballard very quickly and easily from this location.
25395	3528627	8.0	9.0	16578887	"Great, quiet neighbourhood. Lyn did everything to make me comfortable, and Charlie her golden retriever was a sweetheart.
I had a very peaceful stay - which was all I needed."
25396	3528627	8.0	9.0	18546517	"Lyn Coffin has been much more than a marvelous host -- she has become a friend!  She not only made me feel at home, but welcomed my family and puppy to stay at her home as well.  She let me use her car while she was away, and even drove us to places we needed to be on a couple of occasions.  I couldn't recommend her place more highly.

The apartment was very comfortable, overlooked the Kiwanis Ravine, and was only a block away from Discovery Park!  The neighborhood is a pleasure to walk around in and the Magnolia farmer's market on Saturdays had great food and organic produce.  The Metropolitan Market on 34th has everything we needed for food; otherwise we'd take a (car or long walking) trip down to McGraw to eat at Nikos Gyros or some of the other restaurants in that area."
25397	3528627	8.0	9.0	18776449	Lyn and her adorable dog Charlie were wonderful hosts and made us feel right at home! Lovely neighborhood and beautiful park just a block away. Overall, great experience.
25398	3528627	8.0	9.0	18866189	One night stay. Lyn was friendly and respectful.  Room was clean and walking distance to a busline.  She has a dog named Charlie who was also nice and well behaved. Quiet safe neighborhood with easy parking. 20-30 min bus ride to downtown Seattle.  Would recommend to friends/stay here again. Thanks Lyn!
25399	3528627	8.0	9.0	23353495	"This is my second stay at Lyn's place. I have spent over a month at her place when moving to Seattle. Lynn was very welcoming and uncomplicated and made my stay very comforting. Lyn is a Poet, which makes conversation even more interesting. The room is neat, it has of course bed, but also a closet, bedside table, bookshelf, reading chair and a desk. When it was still warm the balcony was a great plus. Its beautiful especially when it's raining, you can hear the rain on the leaves;-). Wonderful was also the location close by the discovery park, certainly a place to check out.
There was always street parking close by and there are two buses that go to downtown directly. Well all in all I had a great time and would like to thank Lyn agin for having me!"
25400	3528627	8.0	9.0	35373295	"If you want to get disturbed everyday, have no privacy, get insulted and bothered even after moving out. BOOK this room!

Here is our story.
My girlfriend and I stayed in Lyn’s place for a month. We had a terrible experience as she kept insulting us from the beginning to the end. I have never wrote a single review to any website, and I also understand the review philosophy here is ""If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”  But I have to write this one thanks to the enough disrespect we received during our stay.
 
1. **No** lock on our room and Lyn **entered** our room without permission for more than once by taking the excuse of checking out our cat.
 
2.  Lyn **yelled** and **heavily knocked** on the bathroom door while my girlfriend was taking her shower just because she didn't come out of the bathroom immediately while there were soap all over her, and that was not more than 5 minutes.
 
3. Poor Wifi: Even with the new router, signal was still too weak so that we had to use our phones’ cellular data for Skype meeting.
 
If what is stated above made us angry, what happened after we moved out was totally disgusting. Lyn accused us of “stealing” her door key, and router. Later she realized we had **nothing** to do with these stuff, and apologized. Still, we are thinking about taking legal action to defend.
 
Door Key-- Lyn gave us only one key to the door at the first day and it’s a copy. But one day after we left, she said she gave us the original key and we gave her back a copy. We had never made a copy and it was she that gave us the copy. Nevertheless, we took no fight back but just a simple clarification message because my grandma, the same age as she, is also forgetful.

Router--Three days later, Lyn requested us $90 through airbnb because she “discovered that the new router had been removed, and the old one reinstalled” and she thought we did that and took the new router with us. This is basically an **accusation of theft** because no one can “accidentally” remove/reinstall the routers. We were still using the new router during our last minute's stay. How come she found out the new router had been removed and the old one had been reinstalled *several days* after we left?  Later she cancelled the request, and apologized to us “I now know what happened to the router and it was nothing to do with you or her.”

Her dog was nice though.
 
Just think about it!"
25401	3528627	8.0	9.0	35528874	Lyn is a very nice, welcoming, and helpful woman, and her room is great. The balcony in the room offers a beautiful view, and the room itself is very tidy and comfortable. She has many books about the city and recommended some places for me to visit. Overall a very positive experience!
25402	3528627	8.0	9.0	35740181	Lyn made us feel very comfortable and welcome in her home. The space was just what we needed as a base camp for exploring Seattle! 
25403	3528627	8.0	9.0	35991582	"My overall experience is not really good.
Pros:
-Good location, close to the bus stop
-Lyn was nice and her dog is nice too
Cons:
-The bathroom was nasty. I stay a lot at the campsites and I've never seen such a dirty bathroom even there
-The flat wasn't very clean too
-No wifi"
25404	3528627	8.0	9.0	36230746	Lyn was nice and helpful with information for the Magnolia and downtown area. Her place is in a quiet neighborhood with reasonable access/parking. We didn't get much time to visit but in those moments, we found that she is very nice and is easy to share conversation with. Thanks for hosting us Lyn.
25405	3528627	8.0	9.0	36460832	"The host was very nice and give us advices about things to see in town, that otherwise are not well known. 
We feel like home in her house, also her dog was very friendly.
Magnolia is a quite quiet neighborhood , not too far from downtown , downtown it's also easy to reach by bus , there is a bus stop near the apartment. "
25406	3528627	8.0	9.0	36992622	"Lyn was a great hostess and very knowledgable about Seattle and surrounding sites to see. She is kind and accommodating, we had a lovely week staying with her while searching for permanent housing.

Also, her golden retriever Charlie is the cutest!!"
25407	3528627	8.0	9.0	37090864	Lyn was very nice, welcoming, and flexible about check-in. The apartment was in a walkable area to most points of interest in Seattle for us. The bathroom was not the cleanest - not dirty at all but there is a big (sweet) dog who seems to have pretty full reign of the apartment. He sleeps in the bathroom so it smells a bit of wet dog in there, but otherwise the place was fine. The balcony is beautiful, great light especially in the morning. While the room is private, Lyn sleeps in the living room and the apartment is quite small so it doesn't feel super private. Overall, I think for the location and price, it's a nice place to stay.
25408	3528627	8.0	9.0	37519567	"Lyn was a nice and welcoming host. She also gave some good recommendations. The room was good and had a balcony with an awesome view. The apartment was quiet and cozy
My cons are that the apartment could be cleaner and the mattress for the futon is not comfortable. There are a couple of buses that go downtown but to go other places, a car/uber is recommended "
25409	3528627	8.0	9.0	38606434	 I can't say enough good things about our stay with Lyn. This listing is a total win. The visit was fantastic. Lyn made us feel at home with a clean , comfortable room, and privacy. She was even kind enough to let us bring our toddler, which isn't as common on Airbnb as I would have hoped. She welcomed us to the kitchen area and the main balcony area. Our room had a balcony with a really cool view of greenery. We really enjoyed ending our evenings at Lyns. From the cleanliness of the bathroom, you wouldn't be able to tell another person was there. The ad was accurate to the T. Being in the Magnolia Area, one block from discovery park, I really don't think you could get a better deal than this listing. The value was tremendous. Lyn gave us plenty of space with just enough interaction to give us tips on the city and gift us treats to snack on. The apartment is cozy and on a dead end which is really nice. It was  quiet and felt very safe.
25410	3528627	8.0	9.0	39303166	Lynn is very friendly and interesting with a super-cute 11 year old dog that brought me his favorite rabbit! The room is basic, simple, but adequate with an awesome deck overlooking an overgrown ravine - excellent for the soul. Even better, it's right next to Discovery Park, the best/biggest in central Seattle. There's a 2.5 mile jogging loop and some of the best views of the Sound.
25411	3528627	8.0	9.0	39927490	"Lyn was the perfect host. Engaging when I wanted intelligent conversation and almost invisible the rest of the time.  It was as if I had the entire place to myself. 
My room turned out to be perfect with a balcony that put me into the tree tops, filtered light gave it a quiet peaceful feeling.   It was like living in a tree house.  It was very comfortable and  felt at home immediately. Best BnB I've been to."
25412	3528627	8.0	9.0	48163382	"Lyn exceeded every standard of an Airbnb host. My girlfriend and I planned on staying in Seattle for a month, but unfortunately a last-minute injury derailed our plans. Lyn was exceptionally gracious and accommodating, and I'm glad I got to spend at least a few days at her cozy home. The room, balcony, and location were all fantastic. I loved taking the bus downtown and walking to the Ballard locks.

Lyn, thank you for your overwhelming kindness and warm welcome to Seattle!"
25413	3528627	8.0	9.0	52570048	"Lyn is a wonderful and caring host. I immediately felt welcome. The room is very neatly decorated - you actually do feel like in a tree house. With discovery park being just five minutes away, this is a perfect location for people who enjoy nature.

I am incredibly thankful, that Lyn (and her dog Charlie) made my first few weeks in Seattle very special."
25845	1831338	8.0	9.0	14108848	Reena was so friendly and accommodating, really lovely woman to be around. The space was great, comfortable and clean. We felt very welcome and at home. Discovery Park is a 5 minute walk too, and it's a quiet and safe area. 
25846	1831338	8.0	9.0	15070622	What a fantastic location in a fantastic neighborhood.  So quite all the time.  I slept so well every night on the perfectly firm futon.  Reena is such a sweet, sweet lady.  She did everything to make me feel at home.  A week into my stay I came home one night to find fresh flowers in my room.  Thanks so much for a wonderful place to call home for a week.
25847	1831338	8.0	9.0	15287470	"Reena was very nice and hospitable! It felt much more like staying with a relative than a stranger. She was very patient even though we ended up having to check in way later than anticipated. She gave plenty of recommendations of places to eat and things to see. 

The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. It was a fifteen minute commute into downtown. The house is five minutes away from Discovery Park and the neighborhood is loaded with amazing lookout points. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking  for a homey place to stay that isn't disturbed by the hustle and bustle of the city."
25848	1831338	8.0	9.0	15974744	Reena was very welcoming and made us feel comfortable upon arrival. She lives in a quiet neighbourhood a 30 minute bus ride away from downtown. The room was very clean and looked exactly like it did in the picture. Our first time using air b n b and it was a good experience. 
25849	1831338	8.0	9.0	16190151	Reena is sweet, quirky and very talkative. We only stayed for one night but the room was great. The neighborhood is very safe and calm, and the beautiful Discovery Park is only a couple blocks away. There's a pizzeria with late-night delivery over in Magnolia (a 30 minute walk), next to a sports bar which is also open relatively late. We arrived late and needed both a walk and a bite to eat so we got a drink at the Magnolia bar and had our food delivered there.
25850	1831338	8.0	9.0	16945014	The host was very friendly and engaging and knew the area well suggesting many fine eateries in the neighborhood. The room was exactly as pictured, bright and airy with plenty of free safe street parking. We had a very good time and some wonderful conversations.
25851	1831338	8.0	9.0	17719092	Thank you Reena for the hospitality.  
25852	1831338	8.0	9.0	18839814	"This is hard to write, Reena seems like a nice person. There were big problems with this booking.
Biggest problem was bugs.  When we got back Saturday night there were lots of bugs in the bedding, on the bed and on the floor. Reena saw the bugs. I had to ask for clean sheets.  Reena said she would spray the room the next day. I don’t know if she did. On Sunday night when we got back we still had bugs and I woke up on Monday morning with two bugs crawling on me.  I don’t think Reena understood bugs are a big deal. If I am paying $150 per night I expect it to be bug free.
We were offered no discount or compensation for the bugs; we were even charged a “cleaning fee.”  
You can hear the voices from the basement room that is rented out – holes in wall where moulding not completed. 
You must have a car to stay here. The bus is far away, 10 blocks up a very steep hill during the evening, its better during the day.
On a positive note, there is good water pressure and lots of hot water in the shower. 
We have stayed in lots of Airbnb places in Seattle and Hawaii as well as been host to hundreds of people over the last 4 years in our home, so we are not newbies with staying in other people’s houses.  
"
25853	1831338	8.0	9.0	34387131	"Reena was exceptionally welcoming and stayed up late to welcome us into her home. We made delicious pizza before turning in for the night and she maintained her generosity throughout her stay. The room was lovely and sunny and the rest of the house was clean. The location is amazing if you want to get out of the downtown area, only minutes to the amazing Discovery Park. 

Reena herself is exceptionally open and is eager to interact and connect with her guests (whether that works for you or not). "
25854	1831338	8.0	9.0	35342570	nice place, and Reena is awesome !
25855	1831338	8.0	9.0	38087516	Reena was exceedingly generous and welcoming.  She made me feel like I was coming home to see an old relative.  The room is exactly as the picture displays, and the bathroom is more than adequate.  The local neighborhood is quiet and scenic.
25856	1831338	8.0	9.0	38684387	Reena's a wonderful host. The room was comfortable and clean. My husband and I had a peaceful night's rest. We went on a relaxing walk with Reena, views of Mount Rainier and the bay. Tried home grown veggies - great tastes. Overall fantastic experience. 
25857	1831338	8.0	9.0	38806786	Reena is a very kind person. However, that being said, I did have some issues during my stay with her that I felt compromised my personal safety and the safety of my belongings. Upon my arrival Reena informed me that she did not have a key for me, which can be problematic when you're a guest in someone's house for obvious reasons. She said that the neighborhood was safe and that it was okay to leave the doors unlocked, which isn't exactly solution that made much sense to me. She also said it was likely the last people who stayed with her (the night before) took the key with them because they liked the way it looked. When I asked if she would call the previous guests to see if they had the key, and/or try to retrieve it, she said no because she didn't want to blame them for anything. This made me very uncomfortable. As a woman, traveling alone, I wanted to feel safe in the house where I was staying. Knowing that strangers who very possibly could still be in the area had a key to the house made me feel unsafe. I also didn't feel comfortable leaving my belongings in an unlocked house. Reena eventually made me an extra key that evening, but it didn't make me feel any more safe knowing the other key was still somewhere out there, and at that point the key was of no use to me since it was late and I had no plans to leave the house that night. The next morning I left at 5 AM, sleepless, and with a bad taste in my mouth form the whole experience. I felt like it was more important to her to get the $100 for the room than to take a few hours to change the locks/look into the issue of the missing key. I especially felt more like a dollar sign than a person when I asked for a partial refund through AirB&B and Reena declined to give it to me. A partial refund would have been fair, and the right thing to do, in my opinion. I'm sorry to say that although Reena is a nice person, due to the issues described above the overall experience wasn't great, and certainly wasn't worth $100.
25858	1831338	8.0	9.0	39684783	Reena was exceedingly kind. The bed was comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. There was an unmade mattress in the living room and no way to secure our things, so unknown guests was a concern that affected our view of the value. Her conversation and sharing were appreciated. 
25859	1831338	8.0	9.0	39844274	Reena is a wonderfully warm person, she greeted us at the door with a big hug and a warm smile. The house is very nice, clean and tidy, with a nice little garden plot out front. It was very easy to find, one bus from downtown. The neighbourhood is beautiful, lots of big old houses, gorgeous gardens and great views of the water. It is a bit far from downtown but we were only there one night so it was OK by us. If staying longer, then get a day pass on the transit system, I think it would be worth it.
25860	1831338	8.0	9.0	40287311	Reena was a great host. She was extremely welcoming upon first arrival, greeting me with a big hug and a great conversation. I was not able to take her up on her offer for a tour of Discovery Park, but should I be in the area again I would definitely go! I suggest Reena's place for anyone looking for a nice, quaint stay in Seattle.  
25861	1831338	8.0	9.0	41822554	Can't be better
25862	1840671	8.0	10.0	15663166	Reena is the perfect host and welcomed us with open arms. Her house is in a beautiful location and well connected to Seattle downtown by public transport. We spent an amazing evening and took a gorgeous moonlit walk along the coast at night and were almost reluctant to leave the next morning. Thanks Reena for a really great time in Seattle.
25863	1840671	8.0	10.0	15731533	"Reena is an absolutely amazing and most welcoming host! She made us feel at home immediately - and was even kind enough to accommodate our later than expected arrival after midnight. Upon arriving I was greeted with a warm smile and a hug from Reena. 

The room is very large, nice and private for two people. It is located in the basement of the home, so stays quite dark if you like to sleep in, but also has plenty of pretty and well-placed lighting to brighten up the space when you need. There is a bathroom downstairs, as well. It isn't attached to the room, but is right outside and a short walk to the bathroom. 

The home is in a beautiful neighborhood and is a short walk from Discovery Park and a bluff overlooking the Puget Sound with stunning views of the water, across to Bainbridge Island, mountains in the distance, etc. The views from that park are unrivaled. 

But overall the very best part of our stay with the interactions with Reena. Though they were brief, as we were only there one night, she is an amazing person, full of positive energy and love. We had such fun looking at all of the treasures in her garden in the front yard. I would definitely come back again for a stay in Seattle. And this is a very reasonable price for the location and space. Thank you Reena!"
25864	1840671	8.0	10.0	16224666	Was located in a very nice neighborhood and was a very nice room. Reena was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the whole trip.
25865	1840671	8.0	10.0	16947377	We had a wonderful experience staying at Reena's.  My 4 year old son and I had a 5 night stay in Seattle and Reena helped make it an awesome stay.  The room itself was clean and comfortable, and it was a little cool the first night but Reena provided a nice thick quilt that made the rest of the nights even better.  Reena truly made our first AirBnB experience a great one.  She helped us figure out how to get around the town and even provided a bus pass that we just had to reimburse for the rides we took.  The bus stop is only a block or two away to get to downtown, so even though I had a car I tried the bus a couple times and it was kind of fun.  Discovery park is also very close by and was lots of fun for my son.  I honestly have nothing but good things to say about our visit to Seattle and Reena was a great host!
25866	1840671	8.0	10.0	17598153	Reena was a wonderful host.  The room was as advertised - a nice simple room in the basement of her house which offered lots of additional private space in the rest of the basement with a private bathroom.  Reena was welcoming, warm, and entertaining!  I most enjoyed our walks through the neighborhood.  Reena brought me on a few 3-5 mile walks through Discovery Park and along Magnolia Blvd.   I would stay with her again next time I'm in town!
25867	1840671	8.0	10.0	18752240	"Everything people have said about Reena is true. She is a delight.

However, this basement room she rents left a lot to be desired for the price. First of all, the basement is an unfinished space. What the pictures don't show you is that the ceiling beams/insulation/electrical wires are completely exposed. This meant that each morning we were awoken by any footsteps or movement upstairs. The downstairs ""living room"" she references in the listing is actually just another bed. When we asked if anyone would be staying there, she replied: ""Not as of yet, but who knows two hours from now."" Which meant that we could have potentially been walking through another person's sleeping quarters every time we came, went, or used the bathroom. I should also mention that the areas weren't dirty, per se, but the bathroom had (water?) stained linoleum and there were several spider webs throughout. Again, this basement room is an unfinished space."
25868	1840671	8.0	10.0	39710765	Reena was great! Very warm and welcoming, and interesting conversation, and she even made us a great breakfast! The place was clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood was beautiful, with large houses and nice landscaping, and right next to a Discovery Park with trails etc. It's about a 30 minute bus ride to downtown.
25869	1840671	8.0	10.0	40689557	Reena's place was located in a lovely area. Short walk to the park with a wonderful view and a minutes drive to the downtown Seattle area. She was very friendly and made us feel at home. 
25870	1840671	8.0	10.0	43338759	reena is a lovely and welcoming person.  the space was comfortable and private since the basement is isolated from the rest of the house.  the neighborhood is very quiet and nice, just a few minutes walk to discovery park.

While the bedroom we used is in the basement, it is very comfortable and we slept well there (in spite of the unfinished ceiling in the room).  Quiet.  The bathroom was a convenient to the bedroom.  The finished basement through which one walks to get to the bedroom is beautiful. We were pleased to have a strong cell signal in the room.  And, her garden tomatoes were a delicious taste of summer.
Our only regret is that Reena was feeling less than well during our stay.  Would like to visit again under better circumstances.  "
29166	8517235	8.0	10.0	54751128	Kevin's apartment is located in a very convenient area for walking around downtown! Just a few blocks to Pike Place, Link Transit, and tons of shopping, restaurants and bars all around. The apartment was very clean, and he even had a bottle of wine set out for us to enjoy!  I'd definitely recommend staying in this apartment, especially if you will be walking around town. 
29610	5459895	8.0	10.0	37463067	There was no welcome feeling as the apartment is owned by what appears to be a large property management company.   You need to pick up the keys at another property about 4 blocks away.    Which is fine just a heads ups with more detail would be nice.. The apartment was very nice and the location was excellent.   Only complaint which would not of been an issue if not for the record heat in seattle.    The profile lists the apartment has A/C  but there is none.    
29622	8843162	8.0	10.0	57331180	"Max is a really nice host! He is easygoing and really flexible with time. All the things in the house have been taken care of so you don't have to worry about them. The room is pretty spacious and cozy too. 
The house's location is also really great. It is close to the bay, the Seattle Center park, and it is in the walking distance to Pike Place Market and Light Rail station. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and peaceful too. Definitely check it out when you visit Seattle!"
29623	8843162	8.0	10.0	57814114	"Room was very convenient to go from Pier 69 and there were a lot of shops and restaurants nearby. Did not really get a chance to interact much with Max as he had to leave for a flight the next day but the check-in was pretty easy. 

Absolutely loved the location as it is easy to walk everywhere. 
"
29669	4264056	8.0	10.0	23916017	Check-in was simple and quick! The room was pretty sparse but the essentials were all there which was great. The kitchen sink was filthy and was on the checklist so I cleaned it so the owner wouldn't think that I did it. The kitchen and fridge were great but I didn't use either. The location was perfect for walking to the major sites around Seattle like the space needle, pacific science center, and pikes market. 
29670	4264056	8.0	10.0	24196854	The room was fine for the two of us for one night. The kitchen sink was clogged up, so we didn't end up getting to do any cooking - but Lori warned us that morning before check in.
29671	4264056	8.0	10.0	24309134	The location is quite ideal nestled between 4 star hotels and only about 4 blocks from Pikes Place. Check in and check out went swimmingly. Though the building is quite old which offer the good and bad of that. On the Airbnb spectrum of hotel to homey I would say it falls more firmly into the hotel slot.
29672	4264056	8.0	10.0	24430101	Loved this small downtown studio. The location is perfect if you want to explore downtown Seattle. Pike Place Market is just a few block away. Although we didn't get to meet Lori, everything was setup perfectly on our arrival. We had absolutely no problems checking in and out.
29673	4264056	8.0	10.0	24855907	My fiancee and I could not have asked for a better location to stay in Seattle! We were right in the heart of the Seattle hustle and bustle, there is a grocery/deli across the street which was incredibly handy! Minutes walk to fabulous restaurants in Belltown, the Monorail, Pikes Place Market and downtown  We parked our car and didn't need to use it till we left! Lori our host was very helpful letting us know about parking and check-in was very easy! The apartment itself added to our amazing stay in Seattle, it was old school but very homey and romantic! I would happily stay there again if Lori would have us! I will recommend this apartment to anyone and everyone! 
29674	4264056	8.0	10.0	25394638	Great location.  Easy to get around and a lot to do in the surrounding area.  The apartment was pretty sparse but it had the essentials. There is no Wi-Fi or TV but that made me explore more.  We coudlnt figure it out how to get the heat to work but stayed warm anyways.  The only thing that was wrong that it was a little bit dusty. 
29675	4264056	8.0	10.0	25502486	"The location was PERFECT. We took the Link in from the airport and it was only a 5 min walk to the apartment. All the touristy things were within a 15 min walking distance of the apartment. We decided to rent a car our second day there to explore the rest of Seattle (the car rental place was only a 5 min walk!)

Lori was an amazing host. She promptly answered all my questions before arriving and she continued to be available for us throughout our entire stay. "
29676	4264056	8.0	10.0	25631404	Lori made our whole experience of finding and staying in a place in downtown Seattle super simple. Very clear listing, very flexible and willing to communicate, and simple procedure for picking up and dropping off the keys. The location along with the price tag attached cannot be matched. This will likely be the best bang for your buck that you will find downtown!
29677	4264056	8.0	10.0	25717438	The apartment was great, and Lori is so awesome, helpful, and friendly.  It was just steps from the tram, so getting to and from the airport was easy.  The location is right downtown and close to lots of fun things (museums, library, food,pubs....) I felt safe and slept well. I will be back.
29678	4264056	8.0	10.0	25845580	The description pictures were accurate. The instructions given for check-in and check-out were clear and straight-forward. The host was also able to reply back promptly on her phone. You might want to bring slippers for the cold floor tiles. There was no cleaning fee so the place had to be tidied up afterwards. 
29679	4264056	8.0	10.0	26104052	The location is fantastic! I had never been to Seattle before, so I wasn't sure exactly where to stay, but I really lucked out with this place. Bars, restaurants, Pike Place market, the Space Needle, and Seattle Center are all in walking distance. The space itself was pretty cool because it's in a restored historic building, but I think I might have enjoyed it more on a shorter stay. The original Murphy bed was not so comfortable by the fourth night! Overall, the price was right and the location was unbeatable so I'm really happy I stayed here.
29680	4264056	8.0	10.0	26684242	"Location and Price are a hit, everything else is  a miss. 
Location: The location of this apartment is ideal.  It is within walking distance to several restaurants, Pike’s Market, and, if you are in shape, the Space Needle.  There is a Metro bus just around the corner (download the app to figure how to get around) but there are plenty of restaurants and movie theaters within walking distance.  
The Room: We chose this place because of the age (pre-war) and expected features characteristic to it.  We were not disappointed, this room has high ceilings with beautiful molding, unique closets and a charming claw foot tub.  However, this is not a home but an empty apartment (perhaps awaiting rental?).  The space is sparce and provides the barest basic needs.  If you are looking for a place that is cozy with the comforts of home (typical of an AirBnB or a Bed and Breakfast), this is not it.  This place lacks a couch, coffee maker, or even a throw rug. The room has NO ambiance.   Despite the urban/downtown location, it is a quiet room.  However, the pipes in the corner of EACH room transport hot water (radiators?) and crackle and pop every hour on the hour, loud enough to wake you EVERY HOUR.    Unfortunately, to sum it up this room was grimy.  The baseboards and floor edges were soiled/dusty, the dish drainer was dirty and the tub and toilet were unclean and required scrubbing (by me).    
The Host:  We never met Nick the host, but he promptly provided extra towels and cleaning supplies upon request.  He left us a bottle of wine.
"
29681	4264056	8.0	10.0	26827971	"This was a great first time with AIRBNB.
The whole process from booking to checking out was awesome. 
A great value, a perfect location.
Nick was great. He was there when we checked in and was helpful with communication throughout the process."
29682	4264056	8.0	10.0	27054248	"Nick was prompt at getting our room heated up- it was freezing when we arrived but the heating in the building had went out.  The building is clean but very old with steam/heat radiator which I have only seen in the movies.  The pipes made all kinds of awful noise during the night which resulted in a huge lack of sleep.  Parking was an issue, before arriving I asked about parking and was told it was $4 an hour on the street or discounted daily rate across the street.  We were not told street parking was free on the weekends - which we were staying Sat-Mon, until after was paid for a garage.  The garage was better anyway since the location was shady once we walked around.  There also isn't a coffee pot, BUT Moore Coffee down the street is amazing and they make cute animals in the foam.
"
29683	4264056	8.0	10.0	27334784	Great location. Across the street from a delicious bakery and only a 5-10 minute walk to Pike's Place. Safe area, well-lit at night. The building itself leaves a little bit to be desired. It was small, which we didn't mind, but it was very old. The bed and floorboards were creaky, walls were paper thin (we could hear our neighbors talking) and whenever water moved through the pipes (ie. someone showering), it sounded like banging pots / pans near our head. Hard to sleep. But... can't complain too much given the price. And more importantly, the towels were clean. 
29684	4264056	8.0	10.0	27444970	The location couldn't be better – especially for the price!  Very close to the water and the market, great food, and nightlife!  The building was safe and fairly quiet, and the apartment had everything we needed for the weekend.  One word of warning is that the apartment is creaky and squeaky.  If you’re a light sleeper, you might want to bring along a little fan or noise machine.  Otherwise, it was great!
29685	4264056	8.0	10.0	27500180	"The best thing about this listing is the location. It is quite close to the Waterfront and Pike's Place market as well as many restaurants. It is also only a few blocks from the public transport including monorail to the Space Needle. The apartment itself is on the smaller side but it was perfect for our two day stay. It was clean and well-stocked. The maps and other information about Seattle were a nice touch.
Overall it was a great experience. "
29686	4264056	8.0	10.0	27639747	"My husband and I enjoyed a marvelously sunny weekend in Seattle. Nick was a great host-- he was always timely in communicating, provided clear instructions regarding how to pick up the keys, and was very accomodating as my husband and I arrived after 11pm. 

Pros: Location! Perfect downtown location with easy walking distance to all of Seattle's great sites (space needle, museums, pike market place, restaurants, etc.). Price-- affordable. 

Cons: The apartment is very old.-- the building is very old and charming, however, all of the appliances/amenities are very old/rusty. The pictures listed make the apartment appear larger and nicer than it was.  The bed was only a full size and very lumpy/little support/squeaky, with the head of the bed in a closet. For this reason, you could hear everything. We would go to sleep and be woken up very early by banging and clanging. In addition, at least for Verizon users, little to no reception.

"
29687	4264056	8.0	10.0	27897769	Great location downtown!  Historic charm and a comfortable Murphy bed to boot.  Nick was a pleasant host who was nice enough to accommodated our late arrival
29688	4264056	8.0	10.0	28083997	Great location. Clean and cozy apartment. Nick was very helpful. 
29689	4264056	8.0	10.0	28385855	I would definitely recommend the apartment if you're in Seattle for a few days and looking for a cheap place to stay. Great downtown location, only a few steps away from pike place market and the waterfront but it's quite noisy at night and could have been cleaner. Nick was quite helpful and always answered promptly.
29690	4264056	8.0	10.0	28524065	Nick was easy to communicate with, had an easy time of getting in and out on my timeline. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the building and heating itself are old and loud with the usual, but notable, banging and squeaking. It is indeed a basic, and well-located, apt.
29691	4264056	8.0	10.0	28776996	Great communication with Nick and his assistant prior to and during the stay. Very easy check-in process. The apartment was clean, and is also a bit more spacious than in looks in the pictures. Great experience overall!
29692	4264056	8.0	10.0	29037499	Nick was a good host, quick to answer and kind enough to let us be a little bit late. I agree with the other reviews that the apartment is a bit creaky and loud pipes, but that's what comes with an old building. Maybe bring a small blanket next time since the space heater doesn't work that great. Other than that, I loved my stay. Its really close to Pike's and a lot of small bars. I would definitely stay here again.
29693	4264056	8.0	10.0	29912247	our stay was wonderful. Amy was very quick to respond and was even nice enough to let us check in early. The place itself is in a great location central to to pretty much everything I was interested in. The apartment is older but  very clean. I would stay here again.
29694	4264056	8.0	10.0	30441573	Great, basic apartment in a good downtown location. Agree with other reviewers that it's a bit loud (old building/creaky pipes), so bring ear plugs! I was in town for a conference, so I wasn't around in the daytime too much and it was nice to have an affordable place to crash. Good communication with Amy and super easy checking in/out, which I appreciated. 
29695	4264056	8.0	10.0	30754720	Everything about this airbnb experience was fantastic from start to finish.  Amy wrote ahead of time with clear instructions about how to pick up the keys.  Since our flight arrived earlier than the check-in time, Amy was wonderful and met us early/held onto our bags until the apartment was ready so that we could begin exploring early.  The location is perfect, near the space needle, pike place market, ferry terminal, airport Link train, great wheel and stadiums.  We took the Link from the airport to the apartment and walked everywhere else on our trip, no taxis or car are needed at this apartment.  The neighborhood felt very safe and we were comfortable.  The apartment was stocked with what we needed, and definitely felt more homey than a hotel room, and at a much better price point than area hotels.  The entire place was clean when we arrived, and the building is quiet.  The apartment rocks, the location rocks and Amy rocks as a host.  We would definitely stay again and recommend to friends or family visiting Seattle.
29696	4264056	8.0	10.0	30974820	This is an awesome little apartment with a location you can't beat. Amy was quick to respond and very accommodating! I'd definitely stay here again.
29697	4264056	8.0	10.0	31795270	"Great location downtown Seattle in walking distance from everything! I recommend not bringing a car if at all avoidable because parking is crazy, but I was able to figure out that meters on the street in front of the building are free from 8pm-8am if you must.  

The apartment was clean and appeared as pictured.  Very old building so as expected the walls were pretty thin.  Only complaint was the noise from the water pipes at night.  Again, it is an old apartment building so I would recommend bringing some cheap ear plugs if you are at all bothered by noise.  

Other than that Amy was super nice and easy to get in touch with.  Check in and out were quick and easy and I would recommend staying here to those looking for a great deal on an apartment in the heart of downtown."
29698	4264056	8.0	10.0	31988127	"Nice apartment really well situated, I didn't even have to take the bus ! A bit old but not a real problem. Amy answered quickly and seemed nice although I didn't meet her. Maybe a wi-fi could be an improvement  idea for the apartment.
Would definitely recommend it if you're in Seattle for few days and need an ordinary place downtown."
29699	4264056	8.0	10.0	32169768	The overall experience was good. The apartment is very well located within walking distance of downtowns shopping areas, Pike Place, and the Space Needle. Lots of amenities which I never used but good to have the option. Wish the bed wasn't as uncomfortable as it was but I'm not one to let something like that ruin my time. 
29700	4264056	8.0	10.0	32764432	Amy's place was perfect! The location was right in the middle of everything you'd want to see or do in downtown Seattle. Even our local friend said we scored a sweet spot with the location. If you're looking for an affordable place to crash after a day of exploring Seattle, this is the place! The apartment included all the basic things you would need for a quick stay. Great location and price. The needle, pike place, emp, chihuly, top pot doughnuts, & the shopping district are all within walking distance. 
29701	4264056	8.0	10.0	33069680	My boyfriend and I had a good experience at Amy's place in Seattle. The place was a perfect size and true to the pictures. We didn't hang in the apartment very much but the space was clean and ready upon arrival. Entry/ departure procedures were very easy to follow. The location was perfect for us!
29702	4264056	8.0	10.0	34623954	The apartment is in a good location. We were able to walk many places, and catch public transport easily. There is no Internet, so be prepared to use data. The walls are very thin, so don't say anything you don't want others to hear. Overall, the apartment is a good price for the location. 
29703	4264056	8.0	10.0	34776877	This apartment is in a great location and is quite roomy, but we would've benefited from having wifi, since we were international travellers and didn't have an American SIM for our phones. We knew this when booking but didn't realise how reliant we were on having it once we got to the States. The building is old and a little creaky, but we only stayed 2 nights, so it was ok. Easy to check in and out and Amy was great with communication. Definitely recommend based on location.
29704	4264056	8.0	10.0	35197573	"This is a fantastic location and a great space to stay for 2!  The apartment was very clean and VERY quiet.  It's in perfect walking distance to ANYTHING you want to do in Seattle.

The instructions for getting in to the apartment were clear.  Amy was tough to get a hold of in the weeks prior to our reservation which left us a little anxious.  Luckily, everything worked out and we were very pleased with the space!"
29705	4264056	8.0	10.0	36515964	"""Fantastic downtown location!"" - as the title says, the only thing this place has going for it is the location. 

- Floors were horribly sticky as though someone dropped goo all over, every step we took a step our flip flops would unstick off the floor - messaged Amy to re-clean but she was out/busy/unresponsive. She claimed that at 130pm it was fine, we entered at 2pm and it was impossible to walk barefoot anywhere. This lasted both days.  -1 star

- Amy was not quick to respond to our requests/concerns/messages and never picked up her phone. She also did not meet us upon check-in while we waited at the restaurant outside.  -1 star

- The weather was very hot and there was no fan provided in the apartment. Amy offered to provide one but did not inform us when she would drop by and missed us. -1 star

You get what you pay for but for $100 a night, least we expected was a clean apartment. Would not stay again."
29706	4264056	8.0	10.0	38108711	The stay work out really great for us. The location is fantastic close to everything you'd want to see. Post was extraordinarily responsive even getting us into the apartment early which helped us out after a long train ride. Would definitely stay here again.
29707	4264056	8.0	10.0	38581373	We spent three nights here and it was perfect! The location was great, close enough to walk to the space needle and train stations, and in a nice downtown area. It was a lovely space with a rustic feel, we felt very comfortable in that cozy place. Would love to stay here again! 
29708	4264056	8.0	10.0	38984316	As stated before, prime location, low cost. 
29709	4264056	8.0	10.0	41058933	"The location of this appartment is great: it is a five minute walk from Pike Place Market, and at walking distance from the Space Needle, downtown and Pioneer Square. 
Communication with Amy was efficient - everything went well. 
The appartment was clean, nicely decorated, convenient and spacious enough to put all your baggage. It is located in an impressive old building and definetely has a certain charm. However, we do feel that it needs a new mattress on the bed (the bed itself is beautiful, built-in) and a new bath (nothing charming about a very old bath).
Other than that, we had a wonderful stay in Seattle!"
29710	4264056	8.0	10.0	41313156	exactly what we wanted - basic apartment in a great location. pike place market, the space needle and seattle art museum all within walking distance. perfect for a short stay in seattle!
29711	4264056	8.0	10.0	41919298	"The apartment is true to description and the location is prime! It's in an old building, a bit outdated, but clean. The flat felt a bit stuffy when I checked in but opening the windows solved the problem almost immediately. Overall a good value!!!

I didn't get to meet Amy in person but communication via texting worked well. Thanks Amy, for a pleasant stay!"
29712	4264056	8.0	10.0	43684003	It was a pleasant stay and the apartment was very well located within a 10min walk to the Space Needle. The communication with Amy was easy and everything was taken care of when we arrived. Wifi will be offered in the near future - that would have made it perfect. We can recomment it. Thanks again for having us.
29713	4264056	8.0	10.0	43935813	"This was a great location! Check in and check out were a breeze. Accommodations were clean and simple, but definitely ""vintage"". It's a fair price, but you are mostly posting for the location, which was more than worth it to us."
29714	4264056	8.0	10.0	44410897	It was cheap accommodation, it was in a good location a few blocks from the market, space needle and downtown. It was a bit grubby, but you can't really expect much more with the money you pay for it. It did the job!
29715	4264056	8.0	10.0	45239117	We loved our stay!  The location could not have been better.  It was a great basecamp for our time in seattle;  easy access to pike place, space needle,  belltown and downtown!
29716	4264056	8.0	10.0	45484991	Amy was absolutely fabulous! She was incredibly accommodating and  very understating. Check in was very easy and the location is great!  I was in town for a wedding and was able to check in a little bit early and had to leave a little early as well. I left my necklace in the room so she will be mailing it back to me. 
29717	4264056	8.0	10.0	46387474	Listing was accurate- very convenient location. Easy check-in, easy check-out. Amy was available for questions, etc. 
29718	4264056	8.0	10.0	47154256	The location of this place was the selling factor.  A bit grubby but it served all our basic needs as we weren't in the apartment much. Good for a weekend of exploring Seattle.
29719	4264056	8.0	10.0	47623307	This is a very convenient apartment which is very near to Pike's market and a lot of restaurants around the corner as well.  The apartment though small is good for a couple with a kitchen and bathroom. Recommended
29720	4264056	8.0	10.0	47963222	I was getting uncomfortable at first since I hadn't heard back from Amy via Airbnb and finally called her.  Check in and Check Out were a snap.  I loved the place.  It is older as others have said, but I would stay there again in a heartbeat.  The location was central and you couldn't have asked for a cleaner place.    The brochures on the table of everything going on in Seattle was a great idea.  Somebody staying here should be aware that there is no TV and no coffee pot.   I almost went out to Target and bought a cheap coffee pot and would have left it.  I really didn't need the TV, but could see where it would have been nice on a really nasty night or to watch the news since there was no internet.   There is a great bakery and a grocery store across the street and a couple of restaurants in the same block.  Once I discovered them, the lack of coffee pot became a non issue.    The apartment is also an easy walk to Pike Place Market (5 or 6 blocks)...  
29721	4264056	8.0	10.0	49324304	"Excellent location. Apartment offers everything, but note that there is no Wi-Fi at the current moment. 
I found that there is a good Wi-Fi connection in the adjacent restaurant (which is quite expensive), and also a free, very stable, Wi-Fi in the Macey's branch which is only 2 minutes walk away."
29722	4264056	8.0	10.0	49875677	Right in the heart of down town, we literally could walk anywhere! The value for this place is fabulous any hotel in this location would easily be 3x now. 
29723	4264056	8.0	10.0	50087859	"Great location! Walking distance from the market which was very convenient.
The place itself was a bit gloomy and it would be really nice if there was wifi provided.
Amy was a bit tough to get a hold of sometimes but she'd pick up every time you tried calling her directly."
29724	4264056	8.0	10.0	51010678	Excellent location right in the heart of downtown Seattle. It was perfect if you're looking to walk around and explore the city and just need a place to crash at night, which is exactly what we did. Very cool, old school, historic building. 
29725	4264056	8.0	10.0	53449725	The apartment was easy to find and as described. It did need a bit of airing out as most old buildings do. I was in town for a conference and, having been a former Seattleite, was planning to spend much of the days out and about so only needed a place to sleep. This was definitely a great value for the location - easy walk to the Convention Center, light rail, buses, and Pike Place Market. Check in and check out was very easy.
29726	4264056	8.0	10.0	53882133	Amy was a good host, check in was easy. The room was nothing fancy, bed was very squeaky, but a good place to sleep otherwise. The location was amazing. I would stay here again. 
29727	4264056	8.0	10.0	54229029	Amy was extremely hard to get a hold of. She basically ignored us until the day of our reservation. I messaged her on Airbnb a week prior. I called and texted the day before with no response what so ever. We had never been to Seattle, and we had experienced a last minute cancellation with Airbnb previously, so it made us apprehensive. The location was great once we made it in.  
29728	4264056	8.0	10.0	54517910	Everything worked out perfectly during our air b&b trip.  When we arrived we called Amy as instructed, she immediately buzzed us in and we picked up the key in the designated pick up spot.  When we walked into our unit, everything was as expected.  The heater was turned on so the apartment was nice and warm.  We bought an umbrella at the airport but noticed one was provided along with miscellaneous toiletries.  We did not see Amy at all during our trip, but it was not necessary as we had everything we needed.  The location was great as it was walking distance from Pike Place Market, the waterfront, and other various bars in surrounding neighborhoods.  Check out was simple as the check out policy and procedures were clearly listed on the door.  Location is walking distance from the light rail to head back to the airport.  Awesome location and perfect for a couple exploring Downtown Seattle.
29729	4264056	8.0	10.0	55678322	Amy was very easy to get a hold of and everything was as described in the unit. It was very clean and location couldn't be beat! 5 minute walk to the market and 15 minute walk to the space needle.  As others mentioned, no Wifi or TV so beware if you need to be connected! Only other thing missing was body wash or soap! Plenty of shampoos/conditioners, though.
29730	4264056	8.0	10.0	56585864	Good location, easy communication with Amy. Thank you.
31874	1709737	8.0	9.0	8142527	I attended a conference at the Washington State convention center Seattle and had a last minute cancellation by another airbnb place. I booked Riani's apartment and had an amazing stay. She was an excellent host, going out of her way to buy breakfast foods including special goodies for my dietary-restricted buddy. I felt right at home in her apartment, which was just plain cool--from the original hardwood floors, to the wainscoting, to the vintage bathtub, as well as the interesting personal effects from a well-traveled life. This is a home that you want to lounge around on a Sunday. The area itself is downtown and next to a public hospital. Probably would not walk there at night, but I felt fine walking to the conference each day, which took about 15 minutes each way. We also ubered around town for about $6 per trip. Overall, highly recommend, I would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
31875	1709737	8.0	9.0	8906541	Riani and her place in Seattle were great. The flat comfortably accommodated six of us and it was nice being so close to everything. 
31876	1709737	8.0	9.0	9413524	My family came to visit for Christmas so we rented out Riani's place.  It was clean and beautiful as expected. She even left us a Christmas tree! I had a few extra questions and needed to get ahold of her and she responded promptly whenever I needed anything ON CHRISTMAS!  She was awesome. I would recommend her to anyone coming to visit: especially if they have a well behaved furry friend like I did: my dog was welcomed with a bowl of water . Thanks again !
31877	1709737	8.0	9.0	11799836	My friends and I had a great stay at Riani's- was as described, v spacious, two bedroom apartment, two baths with large living and dining area. Great location on First Hill close to Capitol Hill's restaurants and fun neighborhood/nightlife. Easy check in and check out. Riani was v attentive via phone/texting. The parking pass is a huge convenience as well, we would stay here again.
31878	1709737	8.0	9.0	12335265	"Riani was extremely helpful and communicative. The place was set up and ready for us when we got there and was easily left to be reset. Check in was a breeze and she even offered to come replenish towels if we needed. A quick 15 minute walk from the convention center made this perfect for me and my colleagues. 
"
31879	1709737	8.0	9.0	14391526	Great apartment and location for our daughter's graduation from Seattle University! Walking distance to most everything we needed. It is a very spacious apartment which accommodated our large group for celebrating. Riani is a great host and easy to reach if needed. Our dog loved her place and loved borrowing her dogs toys (especially the alligator). A lot of good memories were made here! 
31880	1709737	8.0	9.0	14678596	Riani’s Cosy Vintage Home on Capitol Hill is cozy, charming and comfortable. The house was great for 3 friends and within a 1.5 mile walk of everything we needed in Seattle- light rail stop, monorail, downtown tourist stops. We experienced some disappointing issues upon arrival: the apartment was not cleaned, there was not enough toilet paper and no instructions of how to get both hot and cold water out of the showers (luckily a member of our group knew to check the water shut-off valves at the wall). Riani was quick to respond to my email and explained this was the first occasion she had not turned over the apartment for guests, and was readily agreeable to compensate for the issues. Based on her responses and the great apartment, I would stay here again (with the assurance of a thorough cleaning).
31881	1709737	8.0	9.0	15630651	"Riani is very nice, her home is close to down town and shopping. If we were to stay in the Seattle area we would want to stay in her home.

Jeff, Danielle and guests."
31882	1709737	8.0	9.0	15989947	Riani Townshend was prompt in answering any questions we had and was very accommodating to our arrivals as they were staggered through the first day.
31883	1709737	8.0	9.0	16079029	Nice cosy place, excellently situated near downtown Seattle within walking distance. We really enjoyed our stay at Riani's and she was a gracious host. 
31884	1709737	8.0	9.0	16766946	"Riani's place is extremely well located in Seattle and her place is very nice. Riani herself is a great host, communications were simple and easy.
Unlike any other airbnb places i have visited though, you can tell the place is inhabited. The trash had not been emptied. There was hair in the bedroom and the bathrooms. The fridge was packed with food. "
31885	1709737	8.0	9.0	17211286	We really felt at home in Riani's appartment, that is really cosy and so well vintage decorated ! The beds are so comfortable and the place is so quiet and very well located : close to the bus station, in a charming street with an organic grocery nearby. Highly recommended for a stay in Seattle.
31886	1709737	8.0	9.0	18792533	The description of the apartment is accurate. Riani's place is a wonderful first floor apartment that is beautifully furnished. The photos don't do the justice the how comfortable it is to be there. The apartment instantly felt familiar. The location is perfect for walking downtown and the parking situation at the apartment was easy enough with two cars for 5 days though street parking can take a bit of patience. Riani was superb too. She gave clear instructions and overall was a very pleasant host.
31887	1709737	8.0	9.0	19433479	Staying at Riani's Cosy Vintage Home, was my first Airbnb experience. And it did not disappoint. Usually, when I travel, domestically or internationally, I stay in expensive hotels in the middle of the city. This time I didn't and I am not sure that I will again. Coming back to Riani's apartment from a long day of meetings really felt like coming home. Warm, comfortable, charming and clean all with a super fast internet connection. Thank you Riani. I look forward to staying again. 
31888	1709737	8.0	9.0	21227702	Enjoyed our stay for 2 weeks at Riani's place and would very much recommend to our friends! X
31889	1709737	8.0	9.0	23506229	Riani made us feel very welcome. The apt was indeed cozy, and the beds very comfortable. All in all, It was as described. Having a parking place was really a great benefit. The location was central enough for our needs. We would return. Thank you.
31890	1709737	8.0	9.0	28028441	Good neighborhood. Riani communicated clearly and was quite helpful.
31891	1709737	8.0	9.0	28674538	The description is very accurate: the house is very beautiful and very well situated. I insisted in renting despite the fact that she had little time to clean up after the previous guests, and because of that we found minor cleaning issues. But overall, a great experience, I would repeat.
31892	1709737	8.0	9.0	29763631	Me and my three other friends went to Seattle for our first time, and stayed at Riani's place. The location is perfect, everywhere we wanted to go are within 1,2 miles, and the place is just lovely, cozy, warm, and we felt like at home. Riani is always there to help you, giving great suggestions, and we had our own privacy the whole time too. Will definitely stay there again the next time!
31893	1709737	8.0	9.0	33687593	Riani was awesome. It was easy to communicate and get in touch with her. The place was just as described and beautiful. The area was nice and I was surprised I didn't hear more sirens at night since it was right next to the hospital. Would definately stay there again. 
31894	1709737	8.0	9.0	39939622	Riani was  a fantastic hostess.  She was VERY responsive with all my questions, usually responding within 15 minutes, which is amazing.  The place itself matches the pictures.  It's super cute and cozy, but with plenty of space.  I stayed there with my husband and son and we had more than enough room.  The on-site parking is truly a blessing in a neighborhood where street parking can be scarce.  Nice neighbors and lots of restaurants, cafes etc. in the area make this a great choice when visiting Seattle!
31895	1709737	8.0	9.0	40260269	Riani has a wonderful home. Beautifully decorated, comfortable beds, and a great location. We'd definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle.
31896	1709737	8.0	9.0	40915837	"flat at walking distance to mid town, convenient for everything, also for the parking!
the flat is quite big but unfortunately too full of things... impossible to use space for our wardrobe and after a long trip... it is needed
Nevertheless Riani was helpful and nice"
31897	1709737	8.0	9.0	41642031	We stayed at Riani's apartment on the First Hill neighborhood of Seattle and found the location ideal. Her place is a first floor corner apartment. It's very spacious and tastefully and creatively appointed. Even though it is on a first floor and had the windows open there was hardly any noise.  The kitchen is fully equipped and functional though we only cooked breakfast while there.  The dining and living rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and great places to just hang around. There is no doubt that the next time we're in Seattle it will be at Riani's. 
34237	1724849	8.0	10.0	9018795	"Brittany's apartment is in a fantastic location and was very comfortable for our stay. It was quite clean and looks very nice. 

Brittany was a great host in terms of telling us everything we need to know about how to access the building/apartment and where to find towels, laundry, etc. The building concierge is 24 hours and was very friendly to us as guests - they were happy to give directions to different things in the building. The amenities in the building may be the best in the city.

The one thing I would highlight to pay attention to is that the apartment is listed as ""pet friendly"". If you have animal allergies, the traces of pet hair may trigger a few sniffles. 

Would stay here again on another trip to Seattle. :)"
34238	1724849	8.0	10.0	9080801	Great location for many Seattle events! Nice building and apartment. Brittany  is very responsive to any problems and willing to fix.
34239	1724849	8.0	10.0	9114348	Brittany's place is awesome. The layout is great and it's bigger than it looks in the pictures. Brittany was very responsive and made it very easy and carefree from key pick up to drop off. The apartment is right downtown near public transit, the market, the waterfront, and the museum. It's impossible to be without something to do in this area! I highly recommend Brittany's place.
34240	1724849	8.0	10.0	9191089	"Brittany's place was great. Definitely a comfortable space for 2 and you could squeeze in a third person if necessary. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! This place is literally in the middle of all the happening places in Seattle, Pike's Public Market, transportation, Ferris Wheel, a 25 minute walk to the space needle. Across the street from Seattle Art Museum. It was perfect. Check in/out was super easy. The apartment is well appointed and I would definitely stay again. 

The only thing I would highlight (as another reviewer has said) this is a pet friendly place, meaning the owner has a cat. Even though the cat was not there, inevitably there was cat hair - so if you're allergic this is not the place for you. That was not a problem for us thankfully.  "
34241	1724849	8.0	10.0	9346614	Excellent apartment, all as described.  Would not hesitate to book again on a future visit to Seattle.
34242	1724849	8.0	10.0	9967432	My fiance and I visited Seattle for the long weekend and this place was absolutely perfect for us. It was my first time using Airbnb and Brittany was very helpful in helping me learn how it all works.  It was our first time in Seattle and this place was close to everything including all the touristy stuff and tons of restaurants/bars. Pickup and drop off was easy and the flexible check in/checkout time was helpful.  I would most definitely stay at Brittany's apartment again.
34243	1724849	8.0	10.0	12852123	Seriously, prime location! I used to live in Seattle and my boyfriend and I were visiting for a weekend and couldn't have asked for a better spot. The apartment is right across from SAM (art museum) that's a must see and a few blocks from pike place market. Highly recommended.
34244	1724849	8.0	10.0	12954938	Brittany's apt is in a great location in downtown Seattle! Main local attractions are all in minuts walk! The apt is very clean and quiet, you wont be worried about any distraction or disturbance by the traffic. Me and my wife had really enjoyed our stay in Brittany's place!
34245	1724849	8.0	10.0	13041818	"We really hit the jackpot with this apartment. Prior to arriving, Brittany sent me a detailed message with instructions that answered any questions we might have had. Brittany provided us with a beautiful and more importantly clean space.The location is ideal if you're sight-seeing with all the majors spots within walking distance. 

In terms of the apartment, the security of the building is great. When we arrived there was a small hiccup with getting the key but Brittany was responsive and we got the key within 10 minutes of arriving.The laundry was a huge plus as we could wash out clothes mid-trip.

This place is a great value! We would definitely stay again."
34246	1724849	8.0	10.0	22220611	Brittany's place was great! Couldn't ask for a better location or more fun place to launch your adventures into Seattle from. Her apt was very clean and had a great view! Thanks Brittany, hope to be back soon!
34442	8553556	8.0	10.0	49284625	We had a great stay at Kevin's apartment! It's very conveniently located to downtown, public transit, and the major attractions. The apartment itself is nice, with a great kitchen and comfy bed. Kevin was really flexible with our arrival and departure, and quick to respond to messages if we had any questions. We will definitely stay there again if we ever return to Seattle!
34443	8553556	8.0	10.0	49850818	We really enjoyed our stay at Kevin's. The location is perfect for when you want to get out in the city everyday, which is what we did. The place has everything you need and the bed is super comfy! Kevin stayed in touch, got us in late, and gave us tips on how to get from the airport to his place. 
34444	8553556	8.0	10.0	50557891	This was a great airbnb experience, once again. Kevin was awesome, he took us up and gave us a tour and the keys before he left for his flight. The location was fantastic, just up the street from Pikes place and the fact that parking was included was the cherry on top. The place was great, spacious for a one bedroom city center condo. All of the amenities I could have asked for were provided. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Seattle, thank you again!!
34445	8553556	8.0	10.0	51191901	Kevin made us feel welcomed and kept in touch with us frequently. He showed us around and let us occupy his parking space. The neighborhood was safe and close to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. The apartment was spacious and was in the perfect location. 
34446	8553556	8.0	10.0	51950787	Kevin's place was awesome.  He got us into the place as soon as we arrived and we had everything we needed.  Location was perfect too - walking distance to the market as well as several places to eat & drink.
34447	8553556	8.0	10.0	52305831	The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
34448	8553556	8.0	10.0	52543549	Kevin's place worked out great for me, it was very close to where I needed to be for the week.  The place was exactly what I expected and Kevin was very accommodating with my late night arrival and parking needs. 
34449	8553556	8.0	10.0	53353282	"Kevin showed us around once we arrived, arrival and departure schedule was flexible so we really enjoyed that. 
The place is great, large living room couch and bed were very comfortable.
The location! This was hands down the best part. A short walk to lots of downtown attractions and restaurants!

"
34450	8553556	8.0	10.0	53998548	"Great AirBNB Experience. Kevin was friendly, enthusiastic and very accommodating. His place was clean & comfortable. Not to mention, very close to all the hot spots in Seattle! 

We arrived early morning and he was flexible with check-in which was amazing. He also gave us helpful tips regarding airport transportion which immediately saved us a few bucks. 

Overall, fantastic experience and would recommend's Kevin's place to anyone!"
34451	8553556	8.0	10.0	54868699	Very very easy visit to Kevin's nice place. Great location, perfect for our purposes on our one-night stay.  Unit is pretty much exactly as pictured and described in the listing, very comfortable, convenient, and parking passes just make it that much better. Kevin himself easy to work with and get in touch with, very responsive and helpful. We would love to stay there again.
34452	8553556	8.0	10.0	55141901	Great place overall. Kevin was very attentive and explained everything to us when we got in. Everything was as described in the listing, the only confusion being that the WiFi is an open network, not private, so we did not feel comfortable using it. Overall great spot in the perfect downtown location. Thanks~!
34453	8553556	8.0	10.0	57342235	Location was great. Place was smaller than I realized. Linens rumpled, generally less clean than expected, parking was slightly inconvenient, but Kevin was nice and helpful. 
34785	1815304	8.0	10.0	8619936	"Just looking for a quick overnight in Seattle and this spot was perfect! Steps away from everything on Capitol Hill. We absolutely lucked out on this location. 
Michael is awesome. He's an extraordinarily welcoming and genuine host who opens up his unique home to you. The accommodations are in a second floor loft and while an air mattress is not the most immensely comfortable arrangement, the location, space, and value made up for this aspect. 
Thanks Michael! Good luck in Seattle."
34786	1815304	8.0	10.0	8650470	I had an incredible experience staying with this host family.  Such great, loving people who are very hospitable and recommend the best restaurants and attractions around town.  The condo is situated perfectly in downtown Seattle, which was great for walking and site seeing. The room provided is a loft which is cozy (provided with privacy curtain) and has a luxurious queen sized air mattress to sleep on. Getting in and out of the condo was easy and we were provided with a set of keys. There are two dogs named Zero and Frida. They are very cute fluffy buddies that you can never give enough hugs. They are fairly quiet and mild tempered dogs, which is a plus. Michael and Lily are incredibly giving and easy going, and make for super interesting conversations! Overall, I give this 100% A+, and if I were in the area again I would definitely stay here again, no questions asked. 
34787	1815304	8.0	10.0	8826617	Awesome couple, awesome location, super friendly and hospitable and willing to do more than most. Very glad I chose their place. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!! 
34788	1815304	8.0	10.0	8986980	It was a great experience!  They provide family atmosphere.  I highly recommand it! 
34789	1815304	8.0	10.0	9035702	"Michael and Lily were both wonderful hosts! We needed a place downtown and close to the action. Pike's Place was walkable and so was Capitol Hill. We used Lyft to get to Fremont neighborhood and see the attractions there.

Michael and Lily's place was comfortable and they made us feel at home (though we weren't there too much, since there was so much to see around their place!) They provided breakfast stuffs and coffee, and had a computer set up with a slideshow of things they'd done so far. We got locked out once because their the door to their apartment complex was busted for everyone, and they left what they were doing down the street to come let us in. Lovely.

Only small downsides: The air mattress would deflate (as air mattresses do) which would make the sleeping uncomfortable towards the morning. Not a huge issue if you're just staying a couple of nights. Also, they have small dogs, which would occasionally yip during the night. It only got to be a problem one night when Frida ostensibly needed to use the doggy bathroom. But Michael and Lily came back shortly after I texted them to let her out.

Michael and Lily were wonderful hosts, you can't really beat the location / price as far as we could see, and would recommend staying with them again. Cheers guys!"
34790	1815304	8.0	10.0	9187037	Michael and Lily are the perfect hosts for your stay in Seattle. They really like to host people and show them their neighborhood. We just stayed with them for one night and had a very good and fun time. The appartement is in the middle of everything. You can walk to the best places in town and it is just 5 blocks from the lightrail station. We would stay again.
34791	1815304	8.0	10.0	9203411	Super friendly hosts, very clean place, plenty of privacy, friendly dogs, central location--you can't go wrong!
34792	1815304	8.0	10.0	9271140	Amazing and fun times at this great place in a wonderful location! 
34793	1815304	8.0	10.0	9334983	"Great airbnb. Michael, Lili and the doggies were extremely welcoming and friendly. They were more like friends I have not seen for ages rather than strangers. 
The space is conveniently located. 10 minute walk to the shopping zones and 15 minute walk to the Pike Market. The space is also well-equipped with WiFi, computer and Netflix. The only down side was the air bed, but it would not matter for just a few days. Overall, highly recommended!"
34794	1815304	8.0	10.0	9450985	Michael and Lili were awesome, generous hosts. I arrived on Christmas Day when most places were closed. Michael brought me around Seattle and even found places for dinner. They were both very friendly and great to talk to and had great tips for sightseeing and food. The apartment was very tidy and the loft was just amazing. They provide so many facilities that you won't be bored even if you decide to just stay in and chill. Definitely a place I would love to stay at again if I return to Seattle.
34795	1815304	8.0	10.0	9710334	"I was in Seattle for a decently long 8 days and my stay with Michael and Lily was an amazing experience. They are very friendly and accommodating to me. They had lots of advice for different hotspots to visit while I was in Seattle and helped me a lot in getting to explore the entire town at large. We even went out together at times and they know how to have a great time in such a large city. Michael and Lily are excellent hosts.

The location of their apartment could not be in a more convenient place, situated in the middle of Downtown Seattle close by to virtually everything you would ever need. Bars up the street, Pike Market down the street, and a whole motley of other shopping centers and wonderful eateries in between.

The loft inside their apartment is spacious and comfortable. They provide a computer, printer, and scanner all by the desk which was incredibly convenient for me, meaning I didn't have to use my laptop for any of my work. Their dogs Freida and Zero are adorable bundles of energy, although they sometimes bark at night. The air mattress is a little odd to sleep on at first and you have to refill it each night, but you get used to it.

All in all they were wonderful people, the loft is well equipped for most of your needs, and the apartment is in a fantastic location. You can not go wrong staying here."
34796	1815304	8.0	10.0	9751652	It was an awesome stay at Michaels place. Although we stayed only for one night we were made to feel completely at home. Michael is a very good host and we had a wonderful time with him going to bars and having the best possible hot dog so far in my life. Thanks Michael!!
34797	1815304	8.0	10.0	9767069	I would strongly recommend MIchael's place to anybody. The hosts were incredibly gracious and hospitable. It's a beautiful apt in a central location. I couldnt have asked for much else, I had a lovely stay. I wish I had more time to hang out with them. 
34798	1815304	8.0	10.0	9813262	"Michael, Lily, Freida and Zero are nice host.
They gave us a lot of advice about Seattle.
Their apartment is very cozy, providing we have a wonderful time in Seattle
"
34799	1815304	8.0	10.0	9856820	Michael and Lily were super nice! We checked in fairly easily, the location was very central in a decent building. We only stayed one night as we were just flying out of Seattle the next day, but it worked well for us. I would not recommend it for a long-term stay because of the lack of privacy in the loft area, but great for a couple days. Their dogs were really cute, but if you are picky about dog hair/smells then they might bug you. It was awesome having use to the desktop computer in the loft space with Netflix so we could watch our favourite shows in bed. The bed was inflatable, but you could adjust it quite easily to make it firmer/softer and it was fairly comfortable. It was nice having a kitchen there with complimentary coffee/tea and bagels. Lily even made us a delicious breakfast! Great hosts, and overall a great stay. 
34800	1815304	8.0	10.0	9886796	It was a great stay! Michael was extremely accommodating. His partner in crime gave some great recommendations for restaurants in the area and ideas for what to do. The air bed was not a problem much. If only one person was staying, the air bed would actually be perfect. For two people I think it's still ok to some extent. It did get really really hot during the night though. So DO pull the air bed away from the wall. Their dogs are quite well behaved and adorable. I would say that staying here made traveling in Seattle so much more fun and affordable than staying in a hotel that was equally as close to downtown. Plus it's great having a refrigerator and computer to use!
34801	1815304	8.0	10.0	9952670	"Great place to stay in downtown Seattle, the Location was really the key factor. Their perfect 100 walk score is crazy awesome.

Michael, Lily and their two little dogs were great hosts and really helped making my stay in Seattle a truly fantastic one!

I fully recommend anyone staying in Seattle to consider staying here as they will definitely be glad they did."
34802	1815304	8.0	10.0	10006413	My wife and I recently spent a week in Seattle to scout out the various neighborhoods for a planned relocation later this year. Two of those nights were at this downtown location with Michael and Lily, who were fantastic hosts. The location was amazing! You couldn't ask to be more central. Parking can be a bit tricky, so if you are planning to drive make sure to speak with Michael ahead of time. There were lots of amenities and public transport links within walking distance, so you really wouldn't need a car if staying here. Michael and Lily were kind enough to show us some of the great bars and restaurants in the First and Capitol Hill districts. They also provide some great advice for those thinking about relocating to Seattle (they were in our shoes 6-months ago). Great hosts, awesome location, comfortable bed, clean bathroom and friendly dogs! Highly recommended!
34803	1815304	8.0	10.0	10123125	I absolutely enjoyed my stay with Mike and Lilly. The doors and the building were easy to find and get into. Mike was super friendly, super hospitable, and helpful. As soon as we walked in he handed us the key to the place. The place is comfortable, clean & welcoming. They have two small dogs but when Lilly and Mike go to bed the dogs go with them. The place is very central and can walk, bus or lyft it anywhere. They offered us bath towels, orange juice & bagels (even though we could not find any cups in their kitchen). I cannot say enough of how helpful they were with recommendations on itinerary and places to eat. Their place was central to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and shopping! There was a bit of confusion on booking so we had to book another Seattle location the same day we left our home city, but Mike was kind enough and gave us a ride the next day to our second airbandb in Seattle. If you do not mind sleeping on air mattress I would highly recommend staying here. I would definitely come back to stay with them again if I am ever in town again!
34804	1815304	8.0	10.0	10155252	Michael and Lillie were phenomenal hosts! This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have found a better home to start our adventure. From the moment we got there, we felt right at home and very welcomed. They had such a fun energy and were extremely helpful recommending the best bars, restaurants and things to do around town. I wish we would have had more time to spend with them! The view from their place was beautiful and the location truly is ideal: safe and literally a hop and skip from just about anywhere. I never thought that the hosts would be such a highlight of our trip of exploring Seattle. Thank you for everything Michael and Lillie! :)
34805	1815304	8.0	10.0	10195748	Micheal and Lilly were awesome hosts! Their place is clean and in an awesome location. They took me out the night I got there and showed me a great time. They know a lot about the city and really helped me get to know the area. I highly recommend them to other travelers headed to Seattle. 
34806	1815304	8.0	10.0	10418061	"Michael and Lili were exceptional hosts, they provided not only space - they invested their time and energy to show us the city personally. And we can assure you there is a lot to see! 
Apartment is in walking distance to the centre and many little (and inexpensive) restaurants and bars. It is warm and welcoming place with everyhing what you need for your stay. There's only one drawback - the air mattress doesn't provide high comfort... 
Overall, we've been very satisfied."
34807	1815304	8.0	10.0	10528679	My friend and I stayed with Michael and Lili while we were in town for a conference. They were very nice and helpful (great restaurant recommendations) during or stay. Their place was perfect for us and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Even though we are all busy, it was great to hang out with them and get to know them at the end of the day. Plus, their two dogs are absolutely adorable and very sweet. I would recommend them to anyone wanting to stay in/near downtown.
34808	1815304	8.0	10.0	10569892	Michael and Lili were great!  Unfortunately, we were only there for one night, but a great night it was. Lili greeted us and immediately showed us around the place. Also offered us a lot of information about the sites to see and how to get around. At night, they suggested really great bars that quickly became my Seattle favorites. Their dogs are SO adorable and well behaved. Michael and Lili are so friendly, informative, helpful and always made sure we knew that if we ever needed anything they were there. It was because of them our stay was easy, nice, enjoyable and especially memorable.
34809	1815304	8.0	10.0	10674460	I had a very nice time with Michael and Lili. They were both friendly and open with their home. The location of the apartment was wonderful and everything was just as they had described it. 
34810	1815304	8.0	10.0	10762497	"The location of Michael and Lili's apartment couldn't be better; we walked everywhere in the city, and the neighborhood is surrounded by cool places to eat and drink. Their apartment is lovely and comfortable. If you've never slept on an air mattress, it might be awkward at first, but it's a good night sleep anyway. They are very friendly people, willing to give directions and advice on the places to visit. The dogs are lovely, too! We only stayed for two nights, but we totally recommend their place. //
El departamento de Michael y Lili no podría estar mejor ubicado: fuimos a todos lados caminando y el barrio está lleno de lugares interesantes donde comer y tomar. Su casa es linda y cómoda. Si nunca durmieron en un colchón de aire, quizás les tome un rato acostumbrarse, pero igual se duerme bien. Ellos son gente muy amigable, siempre dispuestos a darnos indicaciones y consejos sobre qué lugares visitar. Sus perros también son adorables. Solo nos quedamos dos noches, pero recomendamos este lugar sin ninguna duda."
34811	1815304	8.0	10.0	10794612	Great location, very friendly hosts. The space is not very private, but the photos are accurate. It worked out very well for me. 
34812	1815304	8.0	10.0	10839428	They are really nice. They introduced us many good places in Seattle. Wish we can stay in their house more days. 
34813	1815304	8.0	10.0	10924290	Mike and Lili’s main mantra was to make their guests feel comfortable and at home - and they did exactly that for me. They welcomed me to Seattle with open arms and I became enamored with the city on my first day. They are flexible, easygoing, and very accommodating to needs if you ask for help. Also, I am allergic to dogs with fur but I didn’t have a hard time when I stayed at their place. The dogs were so well-behaved, joyful and rarely went up to the area I was sleeping. 
34814	1815304	8.0	10.0	11271288	"We really enjoyed our stay at Michael and Lili's apartment and felt very comfortable throughout our time in Seattle. Unfortunately Lili was out of town during our stay, but Michael was extremely knowledgable on things to do and had great suggestions during our stay. The location couldn't have been better and there was a myriad of things to see and do. We found it easy to come and go as we pleased and always felt welcomed on our return by Frieda and Zero. We would definitely stay at this location again and would recommend it to anyone.

Thanks! 

Mike and Josh"
34815	1815304	8.0	10.0	11395130	I had an excellent time staying with Michael! He was a great host. His knowledge of the Seattle area was extensive and he pointed out a lot of fun things to do in my down time when I wasn't at my convention. I'd definitely stay at this location again and recommend it to anyone!
34816	1815304	8.0	10.0	11651274	This was my first experience with Airbnb and I had a great time staying at Michael and Lili's apartment. This location is ideal because it is centrally located to everything you want to do while in Seattle. It's an easy walk to downtown Seattle, local bars and restaurants. Micheal and Lili are warm, extremely friendly, and offered great ideas of where to eat and even took some time one evening to show me some of the local bars in the neighborhood for a good drink. Also, what made the stay all the more enjoyable were Frieda and Zero who greeted me with over-the-top enthusiam and they are well behaved, adorable, dogs. I felt like I was at home while visiting and I definitely recommend this spot and plan to book again with them on my next visit to Seatte.
34817	1815304	8.0	10.0	11679415	"Very central and easy walk to downtown Seattle. Perfect if you want to stay in Central Seattle.

34818	1815304	8.0	10.0	11850688	We had a great time staying at Lili and Michaels apartment. It was our first airbnb experience and we were really happy to had such nice hosts like Lili and Michael are. They helped us to find a parking lot for our car and gave us some good recommendations for bars, restaurants and sightseeing! We were welcomed to use the kitchen, balcony, bathroom and living room! The location of their Home was perfect. It was a great experience! We highly recommend them!
34819	1815304	8.0	10.0	12144496	We stayed at Micheal and Lily's on our first ever trip to Seattle, and we have to say that one of the reasons we adored Seattle so much was due to these amazing hosts. As soon as we arrived we were welcomed like old friends - they introduced us to the best burgers in all of the US - Li'l Woody's, took us out to explore some of Capitol Hill's most incredible bars - with pinball all night, and gave us so much insight into a city they obviously love. Had a blast, thanks guys! 
34820	1815304	8.0	10.0	12223094	Michael and Lili were very friendly and easy to coordinate with. The location is perfect and although I was visiting for work so I didn't have much time to chat with the hosts, they were great about letting me get my work done upstairs! 
34821	1815304	8.0	10.0	12329811	First time using airbnb and I’m satisfied with everything. Michael & Lili are a great hosts and their apartment is real cozy and very very close to The Washington Convention Center which makes it quick to get to all tourist locations. He even prepared good guide books ready for us. We had great chat with them and enjoyed the whole stay. 
34822	1815304	8.0	10.0	13207656	The location was great- if you're in town for a conference, you can't ask for a better spot. Close by restaurants, shopping, convention center, etc. Groceries are a bit of a hike if you need heavy shopping, but there's a convenience store on the corner if you just need basics. I arrived right after the host's standard mattress died and before the futon frame arrived, so I slept on the mattress on the floor, which was fine for me. I also love animals, so the dogs didn't bother me, however if you're anti-dog or allergic, you may want to look at another listing (they live there, we don't). I was attending conference stuff from 9-7, so I didn't get to spend tons of time with my hosts, but overall, my first Air B&B was good! 
34823	1815304	8.0	10.0	13571546	Good place, well located. We didn't see Michael, but Lili was friendly and gave us good advices.
34824	1815304	8.0	10.0	13935152	Mike and Lily were great hosts! They were so flexible with my check in/check out time which I really appreciated. Their room upstairs is great and perfect for travelers. I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a place in downtown Seattle! 
34825	1815304	8.0	10.0	14857663	Great hosts, great location what more could ask for!  I stayed with Michael & Lilly for 8 nights whilst I was attending a conference and it worked really well.  This was my first AirBnB experience and I'll certainly be doing it again.
34826	1815304	8.0	10.0	15137313	I really enjoyed my stay at Mike and Lilly's apartment.  They are very friendly and nice hosts to talk to and stay with.  I had a great experience and I recommend it to everyone, specially if you are looking for a place close to downtown, restaurants and shops.  You would also enjoy the view of the town from the balcony. 
34827	1815304	8.0	10.0	15523850	Michael and Lili were great hosts, very hospitable and they gave us some excellent recommendations. The location was perfect and we managed to get everywhere we wanted to without a car. We stayed for 8 nights and the bed was very comfortable. We would definitely recommend staying with Michael and Lili.
34828	1815304	8.0	10.0	15811804	Loved staying at the loft.  The crash course on the neighborhood pubs was incredible.   Great location, right downtown. We will be looking you up next time in Seattle!
34829	1815304	8.0	10.0	16564562	Very convenient location,very cute dogs and very nice hosts
34830	1815304	8.0	10.0	16714180	Michael and Lily were very friendly, and their place was superb! Definitely will recommend this place for my friends who want to visit Seattle. 
34831	1815304	8.0	10.0	17044838	We had a great time with Michael and Lily in Seattle. We would recommend this place for the location and particularly the welcoming hosts. We were able to walk everywhere we needed and Michael and Lily even showed us around some of the amazing nearby bars. They made us feel very welcome in Seattle and gave us loads of great recommendations.
34832	1815304	8.0	10.0	17500008	Staying at Michaels was great. The hosts were really nice and helped us with every kind of questions. The place is located in downtown, just perfect. We really loved our stay there and would always come back :)
34833	1815304	8.0	10.0	17931769	"Lili was great. She was helpful in telling us about the local hotspots. She made us feel very welcome.

The location within the city is excellent... actually it couldn't be any better. We were just a few blocks from anything anyone would want to do in the city.

If I had to nitpick it would be the smallish bedroom... which is an office in the loft area, with a convertible couch in it. Being that it was mid-August it got a little hot up there with no AC. That said, we didn't travel to Seattle to be locked up in an hotel room or apt... so we didn't really mind at all.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind sleeping on a couch-bed."
34834	1815304	8.0	10.0	18497802	"Very welcoming. Michael and Lili make you feel at home. 

Fantastic neighborhood. Blocks away from Pike's Place Market, easy access to the lake, ferry's on the bay, tons of fresh eats. "
34835	1815304	8.0	10.0	18679667	I arrived in Seattle with a couple days to check out the area. I didn't have much of a gameplan, and Lili and Mike were both extremely helpful. They told me about must see places and referred some great restaurants. Later on Mike showed me some local bars which made for a great time. The place was nice and tidy, and the dogs were uber friendly. A++ 
34836	1815304	8.0	10.0	19464418	"The absolute best things about this place are:  1) The location, and 2) Lili!  The location is absolutely amazing - just steps from the convention center, easy walk to the market, and other downtown destinations.  In the other direction,  hole in the wall bars, restaurants and just all around kool places to hang.  We didn't get to meet Michael, but my advice to you is - whatever Lili tells you to do, drink or eat - Do it, Drink it, or Eat it!!  Her recommendations allowed us to have some of THE best food and drinks, hands down, that I have ever had.  Must trys include Kedai (hole in the wall Malaysian) and PieBar (Pietini's!!).  She is a wonderful and sweet host. We felt completely at home.  

When we first arrived I was a bit worried about the small space upstairs (it pretty much fits the bed and the desk and that's it), the open aspect of the lost (its got a curtain for privacy), as well as the shared bath (although it was clearly stated), and thought I might have made a mistake.  However, Lili made us feel so at home that in the end none of that mattered, and I was just SOOO happy about the location and her company!  The apartment is small so 4 people would really fill it up, and if you need real alone time there are probably better options - but we had a truly wonderful stay.  Thank you so much Lili!!  You are the best!  Mwah!!!"
34837	1815304	8.0	10.0	19684121	This was my first time using Airbnb and I must say that Michael and Lili were great hosts. They also have two friendly dogs. Lili gave us recomendations of what to do and where to eat. There place is in a excellent location and everything is in walking distance. I would recommend this place to anyone that plans on staying a couple nights in Seattle. 
34838	1815304	8.0	10.0	19892126	The pic is accurate - the room is a loft at the top of the very cool spiral staircase on the left. Very comfortable even during warm weather for Seattle - nice Dyson fan keeps it great. Two little dogs - a pug and a long-haired terrier named Frieda, easy to make friends with. The place is close to good eating and the Paramount Theater - Neil deGrasse Tyson was there for a few nights as well as Brian Regan. Good cinema nearby as well. I flew in and needed no rental car. I used Lyft and foot travel to get where I needed to be (I was here for a week of work). Michael and Lili are great people and experienced with Airbnb. Yup, no doubt I'd do it again.
34839	1815304	8.0	10.0	20283301	Apartment very well located. Lili has been very welcoming. Might stay there again in the future.
34840	1815304	8.0	10.0	20428569	"Michael and Lili were great hosts. Very warm and welcoming. They really made our stay at Seattle a great experience, especially with all their really good suggestions (the map they provided with landmarks as well as places to eat/drink at, was also quite helpful). Their home was very lovely and my friend and I thought that the decor was very tasteful. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here when they come to Seattle. 

bonus: Their pups are also the nicest ever, so fun and loving."
34841	1815304	8.0	10.0	20675354	The listing was accurate, Michael and Lily were super welcoming and utterly keen to see me well-fed during my stay, and this was my first airbnb experience, so they left a great impression and made me want to try it again.  The neighborhood is just unfairly awesome.  Delicious food at adorable places everywhere I looked, and access to everything downtown.  I want to move in.
34842	1815304	8.0	10.0	20818828	This was such a great stay! I felt so welcome and could have not asked for a better downtown accommodation. That said, it IS still downtown with all its noise, dust, air, and sketchiness - only a block away. I am happy i stayed right there, i walked to all the places i needed to be.
34843	1815304	8.0	10.0	21102166	The location is great. Lili is very nice and welcoming. I had a great experience.
34844	1815304	8.0	10.0	21441087	"Lili offered great suggestions and a lot info about exploring Seattle. The loft is a private area with shared bathroom. It was the perfect place to explore Westlake / Downtown Seattle.   Make sure you get the CityPASS and if you like to walk there's a lot of stuff nearby including the light rail and monorail a few blocks west that leads to to the space needle.  I spent the evenings exploring Capitol Hill which is conveniently within walking distance heading east.  Day time you can head west and you can do all the tourist stuff.

Lili and Michael also have two sweet and friendly dogs but they are trained to stay out of the loft area."
34845	1815304	8.0	10.0	21825134	I had a great time with Lily and Michael. Unfortunately this was a business trip, so there was not much time on my side. But whenever I could get a few hours off, Michael and Lily had several great tips handy. Whenever I can make it to get back to Seattle, I will make sure I can stay with them again. Thank you so much for such a great Airbnb-first-timer experience.
34846	1815304	8.0	10.0	22182425	"Home away from Home. Michael and Lili made me feel totally at home for the 4 days I was there. They invited me to join them for dinner or drinks on a couple of occasions. they are also have lots of knowledge of   whats going on in the city. Comfortable bed, with all the amenities you need.

I will definitely be staying here should I ever be back in Seattle, and recommend everyone to stay with Michael and Lili  "
34847	1815304	8.0	10.0	22524867	"Staying with Michael and Lily was fun and exactly what I needed. I only slept there and we went out together a couple of nights, which is a really cool way to find out the cool bars in Seattle. Michael is a Yelp guru who knows all the best places. Not to forget: their apartment is really close to the convention center, that was the main reason I picked them! 
Thanks again!

Johan"
34848	1815304	8.0	10.0	22674868	Great location- the walk to Pike Place and downtown was easy. The Space Needle wasn't too far either... The apartment is nice- nice little loft for your bedroom! Honestly, it was everything it was advertised. And Michael and Lili were great too- very friendly and hospitable. Cute dogs as well! We only had a short stay there but would recommend it.
34849	1815304	8.0	10.0	23307507	Have a rest time in Michael and Lily's house! They are so nice, give me much help and make me feel so safe in my personal trip. It is a very great location in downtown to get good restaurant and buy everything.

34851	1815304	8.0	10.0	23876977	Lili was an incredibly enthusiastic and welcoming host. I was comfortable in their loft room and found their apartment to be very quiet. The location within walking distance to downtown, Pill Hill, and the light rail is superb.
34852	1815304	8.0	10.0	25202610	Really awesome location. Just a block from the convention center. Michael was a great and friendly host. 
34853	1815304	8.0	10.0	25625803	The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
34854	1815304	8.0	10.0	25660524	Staying at Michael's and Lily's was a good choice for three reasons - its location, Michael's and Lily's insight of their city, and their adorable canine companions Zero and Freida. We visited Seattle for the first time, arriving from China at the Westlake light rail Station with our luggage. Before checkin, we had three hours to kill, so we ate our first meal in a Japanese restaurant upon Michael's recommendation. Excellent Sushi! Many yummy meals followed afterwards in endless quality restaurants within walking distance. Zero and Freida kept us company when we rested in the apt. Zero loved to play and both of them (especially Freida) snuggled with us on the sofa. We heartily recommend Michael & Lily's place for Seattle first timers! 
34855	1815304	8.0	10.0	26023357	Great space in an excellent location. Michael and Lili were both very welcoming and offered their expertise on surrounding areas of town (which I needed as a first-time visitor).

We felt very welcomed and home. 
The flat is located in the middle of the town and the street surrounding it are full of adventures. Both of them had very nice suggestions for different locations and things to do downtown.
Their Dogs Zero and Frieda have been a lot of fun while we stayed.
We would recommend them warmly as hosts for Seattle to everyone."
34857	1815304	8.0	10.0	26436913	Michael and Lili were fantastic hosts. Room is great with comfy sofa bed and good bedding provided. They took me out and showed me local bars and restaurants in the capitol hill area which is a really cool place. Its an excellent location where there is a solid nightlife any night of week. If you want to see the best of Seattle and have a blast while your there then these are the hosts for you.
34858	1815304	8.0	10.0	26804077	Great location, super friendly hosts! Great doggies that are a lot of fun! The room is spacious and welcoming. There is a little bit too much noise coming from the cars on the street, but nothing that will keep you up.
34859	1815304	8.0	10.0	27401391	My boyfriend and I enjoyed our weekend visit to Seattle. Michael and Lilli had lots of places to recommend that we check out. And the recommendations were great! The location was very central. We were able to walk to most places from Michael and Lilli's. They were very warm and friendly. The space was clean and comfortable. The dogs were cute, too! :)

34862	1815304	8.0	10.0	27889918	Me and my friend visited seattle for two days and michael and lili's place were very close to everything. We had our own room and the dogs were great. Michael and Lili were very friendly and so easy to get along with. Although we weren't home for most of the day, we enjoyed our stay. They are great people, and are very flexible with check in and check outs. I hope to see them the next time I visit . 
34863	1815304	8.0	10.0	28172031	Lilli and Michael made me feel extremely welcomed and made sure that i was comfortable with my surroundings as well as help direct me to great places in Seattle.

I would definitely recommend staying with them. Plus, their dogs are adorable! :) 
34865	1815304	8.0	10.0	28519488	Michael and Lilli are such great hosts! They were extremely welcoming upon arrival and their dogs, Freida and Zero, are the cutest! The location is far away enough from the nearby shopping/food areas so that it is a calm space but close enough that everything is an extremely short walk. Several locations, including Pike Place, Space Needle, and much more are definitely accessible on foot should you want to save on a few bucks but Ubering anywhere is pretty cheap. Transportation to/from the airport was a breeze too!
34866	1815304	8.0	10.0	29192925	My partner and I visited Seattle and this place was ideal because of the location! Lilli was really nice and welcoming.

34867	1815304	8.0	10.0	29512245	The location was perfect, only a block from the convention center. Michael was flexible with our check in and helpful with recommendations of places to visit. We would definitely stay again!

They made us feel at home in their apartment and took time out of their days to show us a good time around Seattle. We couldn't have asked for better hosts. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone looking to experience Seattle at its best.
34872	1815304	8.0	10.0	31881597	"I visited Seattle for a conference at the Washington Conversion Center. The location of the apartment was the top priority in my search at Airbnb. After leaving Seattle I can say that it was the excellent tips for F&B and sights and the help from Michael and Lilly that made my stay in town memorable. 
I can highly recommend this hosts/room and will definitely come back in my next trip to Seattle."
34873	1815304	8.0	10.0	32282747	"The location couldn't be better: near to sights, bars and restaurants. Walking distance to Peak Place market. They are nice and the communication was easy. 
They even provided us with some food and coffee :)
The pets are friendly. 
The house is small but you have everything you need. The room for guests is also small once the sofa-bed is extended. "
34874	1815304	8.0	10.0	32745330	As international students traveling from Kansas to Seattle, we carried a lot of luggage with us when we arrived in Seattle. It was so nice that Michael met us and helped us with the luggage on the check-in day. During the five-day stay in Seattle, both my friend and I felt home when we lived at Michael & Lily's house. Michael provided us with a lot of good recommendations about the places to pay a visit, try foods or have a drink. We loved the time talking with Lily who is pretty interesting and friendly (we also got breakfast made by Lily in the morning that we left). This is probably the best location in Seattle to live if you would like to enjoy this city: you can walk to Pike Market, Starbucks, good restaurants, shopping malls, bars of different themes, Capitol Hill; you can take buses, or light rails, or taxis to travel around in case you're tired of walking (though not much walking) and want to explore something new of the city's system. It is really convenient to reach all of the interesting places in downtown Seattle, which is also one aspect that makes us fall in love with this city. This stay was pretty enjoyable and we highly recommend friends to choose Michael & Lily's place if they get an opportunity to visit Seattle, and fall in love with it like we did :).
34875	1815304	8.0	10.0	33117088	Great location. Michael made really great recommendations on places to see. Very friendly and welcoming. 
34876	1815304	8.0	10.0	33372943	Michael is awesome! The moment we stepped in, he made us feel at home and made us feel like family.  He gave a lot of good recommendations for food and places to go for fun and was very very accommodating.  His place is clean and your room is in the loft upstairs for your own privacy. Michael was super hospitable, making our stay in Seattle all that much more enjoyable. Also, his dogs Zero and Frida are super friendly and the cutest dogs you'll ever meet!
34877	1815304	8.0	10.0	33571550	I stayed at Michael's apartment for 3 nights and he was an excellent host. He had a ton of great suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood, and when we told him some of the activities we had planned he suggested other places to eat or things to see nearby. We had a late flight out on our last day and he was very accommodating and let us keep our luggage in the apartment after we checked out. The two dogs are also a plus, they are adorable and very friendly!  
34878	1815304	8.0	10.0	34116690	Michael and Lillie were excellent hosts. They instantly made me feel at home, really knew their city and showed me the local highlights. If I'm back in town, I'll definitely be looking to stay there again.
34879	1815304	8.0	10.0	34293557	This location is perfect! Easy walk to sights, downtown and nightlife. Michael  and Lili had tons of suggestions for places to go and were accommodating. Comfortable and easy place to stay and at a good price!
34880	1815304	8.0	10.0	34857734	"My fiancè and I were in Seattle for 2days. This was our first airbnb experience and we were very pleased. Michael was a great help. He had loads of recommendations. The location is perfect walking distance to everything. We felt comfortable and had our own space. The dogs are super cute. We didn't get to see Lilli much but she was very warm and welcoming also. 
Thank you again for a great stay in Seattle"
34881	1815304	8.0	10.0	35103874	Michael and Lilli were the most awesome hosts! They had a ton of great suggestions for things to do in Seattle. They instantly made me feel at home; not to mention the location is perfect, very close to everything.  If I'm back in town, I'll definitely be looking to stay there again.  In addition, their pets Zero and Frieda are just the most adorable and friendly dogs. I would highly recommend Michael's location to anyone!
34882	1815304	8.0	10.0	35380083	Great place to stay close to everything downtown. Michael was great with many recommendations of awesome things to do in Seattle and really made sure you felt like home. They are both awesome hosts and I would both recommend it to others and stay here again. 
34883	1815304	8.0	10.0	35569787	"Michaël & Lily make us feel at home. Both were very nice, and took some time to give us some advice about nice stuff to do in Seattle.

There were available to respond to all our questions. Their place totally fits with the description they provide on the website. It is really well located, and we were very quickly downtown by feet.

We really enjoyed our stay, thanks again to both of you !"
34884	1815304	8.0	10.0	35906371	My wife and I had a phenomenal time staying with Michael and Lili in Seattle for our 30th birthdays. Their living space/amenities were exactly as expected and they were excellent hosts to us.  They were very welcoming and quick to give us any advice we wanted on local fare, coffee and other must-go's all over Seattle.  We highly recommend them and look forward to staying with them again!
34885	1815304	8.0	10.0	36466644	This was my first AirBnB and it was a great experience! They have a beautiful apartment in a great area. It was so easy to get anywhere I wanted. I was in town for a conference, so I loved the easy access to the convention center. It was super close to Pike Place and other downtown destinations or a short ride on public transit to anything else! They were very welcoming and offered great suggestions for good eats nearby. I came to Seattle a lot as a kid, so I already had my own list of things I wanted to do to relive my childhood, but they know the area so well that they would be an excellent resource for anyone less familiar with Seattle. I felt fortunate they had an opening for the dates I visited! Very sweet dogs too.
34886	1815304	8.0	10.0	36772274	Michael and Lilli were good and friendly hosts. Lilli graciously waited up when we first arrived as our plans changed and we didn't get in until nearly 1am; even then she was very welcoming and kind. However, we were a little deceived by the pictures of our space (the loft area) online. We pictured a nice bed, but in reality it was a fold out futon. The bathroom was not the cleanest either (but I have high standards) and underwear was left on the floor both mornings I went in to take a shower. If those things don't bother you, this will be a great fit for you. The location was prime for walking to almost anything downtown or to the metro, but parking was a hassle and obviously not cheap in Seattle. If you need any tips or recommendations Lilli is  a good resource!
34887	1815304	8.0	10.0	37139008	Great location! Walking distance to just about everything you want to see! Smooth check in and check out! Michael and Lily are very friendly and helpful and will take you out to introduce you to the city if you'd like!
34888	1815304	8.0	10.0	37453372	"Very nice experience staying in Michael and Lily's apartment. The location of the apt is very nice, closed to everything. Even though we have a car, we choose to walk when we visit the city. Michael and Lily are very friendly. We checked in very late in the evening (12.45 am) because we came from Olympics national park, which is super far away from the city but Michael was still waiting for us. 
Although we haven't had the chance to talk too much, as we were out all day and went back very late, but Michael and Lily are very good hosts. It was a very good experience staying in their home. "
34889	1815304	8.0	10.0	37832071	Michael and Lili have a really excellent place in Seattle that is at the heart of everything in the city. Best of all they had some really great suggestions for things to explore and we had a great dinner together discussing the town. I would love to stay again with them!
34890	1815304	8.0	10.0	38372283	My experience at Michael and Lilli's apartment was great! It was a perfect location to explore the city and they made me feel very comfortable in their home! They gave me a run down of the different suburbs, restaurants and things to do in the city! :) I would definitely recommend staying with them! 
34891	1815304	8.0	10.0	38599799	"""Best Location in Downtown Seattle"" is exactly right! I couldn't have asked for a better base of operations for my exploration and adventures. I never got a chance to meet Michael (simply because my comings and goings didn't coincide with his), but Lilli and the adorable pups welcomed me warmly and provided awesome suggestions for things to do and food to most certainly not miss. Since I visited solo and didn't have much time and thus packed light, the loft was the perfect space for me and very comfy. "
34892	1815304	8.0	10.0	38861378	"The location was awesome, and the hosts were super knowledgeable about the area. Their dogs are so cute! 

Lili and Michael were also flexible given our schedule—much appreciated!

The smoke was a little strong at times but manageable since it's only on the patio."
34893	1815304	8.0	10.0	39797418	Michael and Lili were very accommodating to our unpredictable arrival time. They were friendly and welcoming. We felt comfortable in their space. 
34894	1815304	8.0	10.0	40918272	Michael and Lili's place was in a great location. We were walking distance to everything we wanted to see. They gave us great suggestions!
34895	1815304	8.0	10.0	41730083	I had a great time staying here for a week. The space was quite comfortable and it was close to plenty of places to eat and hang out. Micheal was a great host and made me feel very accommodated, and I'd totally stay here again if I were to come back.
34896	1815304	8.0	10.0	42387415	"First, I should say I didn't spend much time in the apartment because I was attending a conference and had activities from 8am-10pm every day I was there.  The futon was comfortable, though the apartment got very hot at times. (I stayed there in August.) There was a fan in the room, which helped a good deal with the heat. The bathroom is small, but it was very tidy and the water pressure in the shower is awesome! I had to wait a couple of times for the bathroom in the morning, but that's understandable when 3 people are using the same bathroom and trying to get out at around the same time in the morning! I didn't see them much because I got back most nights after they went to bed, but they were very nice when we did get a chance to talk! They recommended some activities for me, but I didn't have any time to do them! :(  Thanks for a great and easy stay! 

If you're going to need to go to the convention center, I highly recommend this place! It's a five minute walk to the center, and I suggest you walk through the park to get there! Very pretty. "
34897	1815304	8.0	10.0	42667128	Lili and Michael's place is excellent!  It is close to many attractions and great restaurants.  The room is nice and clean.  The hosts are very friendly.  They are accommodating to my arrival schedule and they give really good advice!  The dogs are cute and sweet!
34898	1815304	8.0	10.0	43359234	"My boyfriend and realized last minute this was a shared space reservation (our first time using airbnb) but lily and Michael were great hosts. They took us out the first night to come local bars in capital hill. A great karaoke spot as well (Michael is a fan :)
They were very welcoming and suggested many spots to spend time in Seattle as well as bainbridge. Try out shiros for sure... Amazing! There is smoking at this apartment on the balcony but with the doors open all the time it allows the smoke inside so just a warning. The futon was comfortable... Clean sheets and pillows. The shared bathroom was clean but could be a tad bit cleaner in the shower. The dogs.. Frita and zero are soooooo cute! Great hosts overall! "
34899	1815304	8.0	10.0	43784432	Great location, close to everything. Really nice hosts and everything went smoothly.
34900	1815304	8.0	10.0	44286607	Great hosts who were very friendly/ helpful. Great location and apartment was very nice. Can be cramped at times, but great for a short stay.
34901	1815304	8.0	10.0	44645131	Super convenient location. Lily is very friendly. We enjoyed our trip very much.
34902	1815304	8.0	10.0	45363664	Michael and Lily were both wonderful hosts. I mostly saw Lily while I was staying but it wasn't a problem because she made me feel right at home by showing me all these great places to eat and by being very kind and informative. I would love to stay again. Seattle is an amazing city and I hope I can come back soon.
34903	1815304	8.0	10.0	46577677	Our hosts were very nice and welcoming. We didn't get much time to talk as we were seeing Seattle most of the day and our trip was during the week. The place is centered really well around everything so you'll usually walk or take a short Lyft/Uber or bus/rail ride.  For the short stay we had, its proximity to everything, and the price, it really is worth it. 
34904	1815304	8.0	10.0	46975323	We enjoyed our stay with Michael and Lily, the location was excellent and the room was as described. Very friendly dogs that were fun and did not bother us at all. Everything went very smoothly thanks to our experienced hosts.
34905	1815304	8.0	10.0	47963321	Michael and Lily were wonderful and made us feel very welcome. We used the kitchen and the tv a couple times after spending the day at the market. They were very nice and let us drop off our luggage early so we didn't have to haul around all of our stuff for the entire day.
34906	1815304	8.0	10.0	48173686	Chris and I had a nice stay :) we were only there a couple of days and didn't spend much time at home. The bedroom and apartment was just as described and everything was ready for us when we arrived :) the internet connexion wasn't great, but again, we didn't stay at the flat so much so it didn't really matter. Michael and lily were nice hosts! 
34907	1815304	8.0	10.0	48691990	Michael & Lily are amazing hosts and their two dogs are friendly and sweet. I absolutely had the best time staying at their apartment. Perfect location, great little balcony and private loft space. If you are interested or in need of any guidance when it comes to things to do in Seattle, restaurants to try, bars worth visiting, and a little history of the city itself, Michael and Lily are well-versed and more than happy to help. I fell in love with Seattle and it was partially their fault! :) I highly recommend booking this Airbnb for your next trip. 
34908	1815304	8.0	10.0	49003913	The house is very convenient to any places in Seattle downtown . Lily is very nice . She give us many suggestions . It's a nice place .
34909	1815304	8.0	10.0	49268034	"Lily is really nice and made us feel comfy right away ! The 2 dogs are cute and discreet, as Michael and Lily !

A little bit of noise at night because of the open window, but everything else was fine. Great for short stays, as it is near everything interesting in Seattle =)"
34910	1815304	8.0	10.0	49666590	"Wow! What can I say? Mike and Lily's location was as described. Maybe even a bit better than I anticipated. I traveled solo, but the room could definitely accommodate a couple. Wifi and iron were provided.

Steps in any direction outside of their apartment will lead you to whatever brought you to Seattle. Nightlife/entertainment, amazing food, quick access to public transportation.

Mike and Lily were great as hosts. Actually, you can't really ask for too much better than those two. When I checked in, Lily took some time out to give me the run down on Seattle neighborhoods and where I should go based on my interests. Michael invited me out for a quick drink with his crew before I went off to a catch show downtown. I was having so much fun that I lost track of time and almost missed my show!

Review summed up in two words: Stay here"
34911	1815304	8.0	10.0	50147393	Loved the central location, nestled on a hill close to downtown. My hosts were very accommodating. 
34912	1815304	8.0	10.0	50439883	Excellent location in Seattle, plenty of privacy, great balcony. Hosts had a lot of great recommendations. Had an amazing trip!!!
34913	1815304	8.0	10.0	51152048	It's comfortable and convenient there.Also have two lovely dogs:)
34914	1815304	8.0	10.0	51669144	You won't find a better location. If you are looking to explore downtown, you are walking distance to everything. Give up the search and just stay here, well worth it.
34915	1815304	8.0	10.0	52852645	"Perfect location in Seattle Whatever you want to have a great meal, buy something in grocery store, go to famous scenery e.g Pike Market, Pioneer Square, Downtown waterfront
Michael and Lily are very nice , invited us to bar and gave us a lot of advice for trip (and we really liked Bainbridge! Really beautiful island! )
This is our first time to America and find accommodation by airbnb, and we really glad to meet Michael, Lily and have a wonderful trip


"
34916	1815304	8.0	10.0	53488610	Micheal's family really welcomed me and let me have a comfortable night during my stay. Since this apartment is located in very convenient place, close to the Starbucks Roasting and Convention Center, I was able to walk down to the city center even very late night. Although I couldn't have a chance to hangout with them due to bad condition, in spite of their kind offer at Friday night, other visitors will be very satisfied with their hospitality as well. 
34917	1815304	8.0	10.0	53984020	Great hosts! The apt is close to Seattle downtown and there is lots of great good food nearby. They are really friendly gave me many advices. The two dogs are so cute, I like this place very much.
34918	1815304	8.0	10.0	54342291	Location, location, location! This place is walking distance to everywhere! Michael and Lily are very nice people. They are a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the best restaurants in town. Despite the fact that the loft is blocked off with curtains, there is plenty of privacy. If you're looking to explore Seattle, stop your search and book here.
34919	1815304	8.0	10.0	55382696	PERFECT location! Walking distance to everything. Clean rooms and friendly hosts, including super cute dogs! 
34920	1815304	8.0	10.0	57372801	the hosters are very kind. and the puppies are really cute its a nice experience

34922	1815304	8.0	10.0	58027310	They had fantastic suggestions for food, night life, and fun. They knew it all! Good time staying here, and their dogs were the cutest:) great people! Thanks for everything!
35492	1107845	8.0	10.0	5926365	Owen's place was in a charming building that was incredibly convenient.  The bed was very comfy, and the place was tidy.  If you're looking for a spot in Capitol Hill that's convenient to lots of entertainment, dining and tourist options, this is it! 
35493	1107845	8.0	10.0	6015444	Great stay-- apartment as advertised. Easy walking distance to downtown. Owen sent keys to me in advance. Very accommodating. 
35494	1107845	8.0	10.0	6142800	Owen was an excellent host. He was easy to work with and has a great place with an awesome location. It is within easy walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and downtown. I would definitely stay at his place again. 
35495	1107845	8.0	10.0	6406142	We had a great stay here! The apartment has an amazing view of the Space Needle! We were able to walk to all the major attractions, Space Needle, Safeco Field for a game, Pike Place Market, and the ferry station to Bainbridge Island. Owen was a great host and very responsive to all of our questions. The neighborhood has a bunch of great restaurants and you are super close to the convention center as well. 
35496	1107845	8.0	10.0	6472667	Location. Location. Location. It was SUPER easy to get to the trains, buses and ferries from Owen's place. We easily found Car2Go in the area and they were usually available. It was great to stay in Capitol Hill, since there are no reasonable rate hotels in the area. Close to all the bars/restaurants/shops and walkable to Pike Place Market. Apartment is all you needed: bed, bathroom and a small kitchen. Worked perfectly. 
35497	1107845	8.0	10.0	6699398	Great location and Owen was really helpful with suggestions for paces to eat, where to get great coffee and running routes. Loved Seattle and the experience was so much better being in a cool little place that was easy walking distance to Pike Market, downtown, and all the other touristy spots.
35498	1107845	8.0	10.0	6767418	I wouldn't ask for any more from this place. It was clean, super comfortable, nicely furnished with great views in an unbeatable location. I recommend it. 
35499	1107845	8.0	10.0	6829113	"It was a great apartment in a very good location. It was a short walk to downtown and it had a neighborhood feel since it was in Capitol Hill. Best of both worlds. Owen was a great guest who laid out clear instructions on retrieval of keys and amenities, and he also always responded quickly to e-mails.

Oh, and a great view!"
35500	1107845	8.0	10.0	6949400	Owens place was great! Centrally located in Capitol Hill, near great coffee shops and great restaurants. I'd certainly stay again :)
35501	1107845	8.0	10.0	7731684	Owens place was awesome and was in the perfect location. It was within walking distance to downtown and to all fun places for the drinking and dinner. I would book his place anytime.
35502	1107845	8.0	10.0	10553286	A great easy place right where I needed to be. Thanks Owen!
35503	1107845	8.0	10.0	10683587	This was our first time using airbnb and we were nervous. But Owen was kind and helpful and very generous, and his Capital Hill apt was beautiful, airy, and incredibly centrally located. We were just a few blocks from downtown and Pike Place Market, and his building was surrounded by awesome restaurants, bars, and coffeeshops (not to mention Elliott Bay Book Company). We had a great stay, and would definitely rent from Owen again.
35504	1107845	8.0	10.0	11195730	"Owen's apartment is perfectly situated between Pine and Pike, making it an ideal location if you're looking to check out the culture (bars, restaurants, bookstores, records shops, clothing boutiques, etc, etc, etc,) of Capitol Hill. And you can also stroll along Pike directly to the market and other downtown destinations — an easy 20-minute walk. 

Owen's place is a studio apartment with a bed, a couch, a loveseat, and kitchen. It's cozy and has all the essentials you need. Owen has blankets, towels, soap, etc. laid out for us. There's a TV (no cable, though), wifi, and even a little desk if you want to get some work done. That said, if you're looking for a modern apartment to rent, this probably isn't your place — it's outdated, small, and feels a little like a studio apartment you'd rent in college. But a great place to lay your head and get easily out into the city.  

Owen himself was remarkably helpful from start to finish. The keys were easy to retrieve; he offered great advice on places to grab a beer and rent a bike, etc.; he was quick to answer questions about the apartment; and while he was available, he also disappeared, letting us feel like the apartment was our own. 

I'll definitely give Owen a call again next time I'm in Seattle. "
35505	1107845	8.0	10.0	11364233	We were in town for an event at the convention center, and we couldn't have found a better location than Owen's apartment. It was walking distance from everything we needed, and an easy transit ride from the airport. Owen was very helpful and accommodating, and made our first airbnb experience a breeze. We would definitely rent here again. Thanks Owen!!
35506	1107845	8.0	10.0	12105176	Owens place is in the perfect location if you're looking for a good fun night in Seattle. Walking distance to numerous bars and restaurants. Went to The Honey Hole a couple times for an awesome meal. Owen is a really cool, laid back guy. I would definitely recommend it to anybody visiting Seattle  
35507	1107845	8.0	10.0	13043471	This apartment is all about location - a great place to experience Capital Hill from. Comfortable bed and sofas - but make no mistake, this is like staying in a student's studio flat. Same level of cleanliness (or lack thereof) and particularly grungy and ill-equipped kitchen. This is a place for a single person or a couple - maximum. Owen was very pleasant, but didn't exactly rush over to correct the situation when I mentioned the cleanliness issue 
35508	1107845	8.0	10.0	13250243	"Owen and his brother were very responsive hosts.  Josh was at the apartment when we arrived and got us everything we needed.  During the stay, Owen texted and checked-in to see if we needed anything.

The location was ideal for the conference center.  It was just a few blocks downhill in the mornings, and by the walk back in the evenings, the bars and restaurants were open and were nice motivation to make it back uphill.  
The neighborhood is very hip and there were lots of young people out all over (in the afternoons and evenings).  It wasn't a problem finding a spot for a happy hour or dinner.  If you are touring Seattle, it was a little bit more of a walk, or an easy transit /taxi tide to the major tourist locations.  I did have a rental car for the first 2 days for visiting Tacoma.  It was great that Owen provided a visitor parking pass to park in the neighborhood, although hard to find a spot on Saturday night (but not surprising).  

The apartment was as advertised - the view of Seattle was very nice, and it had what I needed for my work travel purposes.  I used the living area and the desk (and wifi) for working.  The full-size fridge in the kitchen was convenient, although, the kitchen was rather small if you intend to cook.   The bathroom had toiletries, but I brought my own.  There was a nice TV that you can hook up your computer to for watching videos (I didn't try seeing if there was actually TV signal available).   

The only downsides, which I suspect Owen would take care of if I cared enough about these factors to text him, were the lack of a hand towel in the bathroom, the sink in the kitchen needed a scrubbing, and there were a few dust bunnies all around (if you have allergies).  Again, I suspect that if it bothered me enough to ask, the host probably would have been very responsive about it.  The little things didn't overshadow the broader picture that the apartment was in a great location, had all the amenities I needed, and the view of the city was a nice plus.  Overall, I was very comfortable and pleased with the place.  "
35509	1107845	8.0	10.0	13520513	Owen's place was fantastic, with a gorgeous view. The location was close to everything in downtown Seattle and had everything we needed around it. Owen was super helpful and checked in on us during our stay...he even left us a bottle of wine!! Would definitely stay again.
35510	1107845	8.0	10.0	13788907	"Owen's place was exactly what we were looking for, and met the expectations set by the listing. The entire stay we really felt the place was ""ours."" And if you're looking for a great, sweeping view of downtown, including the Space Needle, this is the place for you. Great location in Capitol Hill, too: right near tons of restaurants, coffee shops, nightlife, and, if you're a book lover, the Elliott Bay Book Company. Easily walkable to downtown. Lots of car2gos as well.

Coming from Texas, we were somewhat worried about the unit not having A/C during June, but the mornings and nights were very cool and pleasant, and Owen's blackout shades easily kept out the late afternoon sun, and the fan helped too. "
35511	1107845	8.0	10.0	13935412	Can't beat this location.  Easy to book and check-in.  Great place for restful sleep and short breaks between sightseeing and activities.  Owen made sure we had a contact if we needed anything--which we never had to use.  Would definitely stay again.  Thanks!
35512	1107845	8.0	10.0	14165195	"Owen's place is located in a fantastic spot.  It was a short walk to downtown while also being surrounded by several great restaurants and bars.  We took the train in and it was only about a $10 Uber ride away and only a ~15 minute walk to the light rail to take us to the airport.

If you are there on a Monday night and have time, check out the basement bar at The Cider House as they have an open music night on the stage where the crowd swaps in and out with singers and several different instruments and was a great time.

Owen and his brother were very responsive to any questions we had and had everything ready when we arrived; hand towels and blankets set out and even left us a bottle of wine.

The apartment is a decent size, but could have used a little bit more cleaning; nothing terrible, but some relatively minor things that could be taken care of pretty easily.  

Also, we were asked to tell neighbors that we were friends of Owen's if anyone in the building asked; no one asked us and I guess that is pretty common request on Airbnb.  It didn't seem to be a problem as we did come across several people in the building who didn't ask us anything, but just a heads up in case anyone feels uncomfortable in that position."
35513	1107845	8.0	10.0	14311990	Wonderful experience! Owen gave very clear, concise directions and we were never confused about anything.
35514	1107845	8.0	10.0	15602820	Great experience! Owen was really responsive and helpful. The apartment is charming and very comfortable. The view is fantastic. It's walking distance to so much great stuff too. I'd love to stay again. 
35515	1107845	8.0	10.0	15769345	Owen's place was awesome! Great view and in a great, central neighborhood.  It was great that organizing the apartment was so easy for our trip.  He provided all of the information we could've possibly needed and was very responsive for the few questions I did have for him.  I'd definitely stay there again!
35516	1107845	8.0	10.0	16067839	Awesome place, great location, with easy access to the train and walkable to most of the places we wanted to go to. Beautiful view and extremely easy check in- check out process. Owen explained where to find everything very well and we loved staying at his place!
35517	1107845	8.0	10.0	16226716	I had some minor issues getting the key (my fault) and Owen was quick to call to make sure that everything was okay.  This apartment is perfect for someone looking to stay in a fun part of the city to have access to downtown or the Fremont area.  The apartment was clean, and the view was perfect as I sat at the desk getting last minute work finished.  
35518	1107845	8.0	10.0	16682304	Owen was wonderful. Very responsive, attentive, and helpful. We had a wonderful time staying at his place. It is a perfect location and has everything you need while in Seattle. A stones throw from great restaurants, coffee and fun...and a nice safe & secure building. 
35519	1107845	8.0	10.0	16815230	"Owen was very accommodating in arranging for the apartment to be available same day when I arrived in Seattle and checked for availability. The apartment is in a very characteristic building with an awesome Parisien elevator. The apartment had all amenities I required for my stay which was largely out and about in the cool hipster neighborhood with plenty of coffee places, bars and restaurants. The view over the city and especially with the sunset is unbeatable. 
It can get a bit warm inside with the sun shining in, but that's really a luxury in Seattle... :-)
I would have preferred if the construction site opposite the street wouldn't start at 7am, but I was there during the week so don't know if that's also in the weekend.
Also great was the guest parking card which Owen provided!"
35520	1107845	8.0	10.0	17519147	"This was my first time using AirBnB. Owen's place was great, and in a really good location that was central to everything.  He answered his phone readily with a question that we had upon arrival. Overall, I would definitely recommend his place to anyone coming to Seattle- as it is located in the ""hip"" capitol hill, yet also pretty close to downtown. We didn't have to rent a car or take any cabs while we were there- we walked to everything. 
Thanks Owen! "
35521	1107845	8.0	10.0	18418587	Loved staying in Owens place. A perfect setting between downtown for work ( near to convention centre) and Capitol Hill for fun. Everything I needed was on hand. A great stay all in all
35522	1107845	8.0	10.0	18826953	Owen's space was great and perfectly located for Convention Center activities. The apartment was clean well maintained. It was my first time staying in a secured building so remember to always take your building key with you!  Temporary parking permit was great. Overall was very pleased with the location and price, and Owen was very communicative.
35523	1107845	8.0	10.0	19160394	Owen has very helpful. Place was good, clean and location wise convenient.
35524	1107845	8.0	10.0	19715408	The picture of the view from this apartment does not do it justice, it really is spectacular.  Owen was great, he accommodated my boyfriend and I last minute after our previous host had cancelled.  Two hours after I initially requested to book the apartment, we were comfortably checked in with a bottle of wine waiting for us, which, after the last minute snafu with our other place was much appreciated.  The apartment is exactly as pictured and the neighborhood is great, plenty of restaurants, bars and coffee shops within walking distance.  We visited some of the national parks outside Seattle and loved coming back to watch the sunset over Seattle from the very comfortable living area.  Would definitely stay here again!
35525	1107845	8.0	10.0	20054181	"We stayed at Owen's place for 4 nights, and it was great. He was very communicative and flexible with check-in/out times to accommodate our flights. It was our first time in Seattle, and Owen's place is in a convenient location. Within a 10-minute walk in any direction, you can get to Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill restaurants and bars. The convention center and retail core of downtown is only a few blocks away.

Photos are accurate to the apartment. Just one tip: The apartment is on the 6th floor, and the elevator is an old-timey one where you have to open the door and ""cage"" yourself vs. the doors opening automatically when you push the button. This was fine for us, as we didn't take it all the time (took the stairs), but a heads-up for less agile guests."
35526	1107845	8.0	10.0	20393599	Everything was so fine, especially the location was the best. I was staying there for the Decibel Festival, and most venues were so close that I could walk all the time. Near restaurants and shops were also great experience. 
35527	1107845	8.0	10.0	22388520	Neat apartment in a great location. Would repeat!
35528	1107845	8.0	10.0	22556436	"Bad news first, good news second. Owen's place is in an older, but nice, building right in the heart of things. When I arrived I had to fiddle with the lockbox in an odd place, and the elevator was one of those clumsy push-the-door open deals from yestercentury. A bottle of wine greeted my arrival, which was quite nice. Unlike most Airbnb ""whole apartments"" I've stayed in previously, this one is clearly someone's primary residence. The closets have that someone's stuff in them, the fridge has that someone's food. It was a touch shabby, but maybe more ""comfortable"" would be a better way to put it. Still, the place was adequate for my needs. Great wifi speed too.

The location is where Owen's place is awesome. You wouldn't know it by looking at the map, but this place is smack dab in the middle of a great area. I kept opening Yelp to look for coffee, or lunch, or even dance clubs, and the best options were just a few blocks away. Lots of transit options within a block, though the waterfront and Pike's Place were walkable for me.

All in all, while I was a bit underwhelmed by the apartment itself, I would totally stay here again."
35529	1107845	8.0	10.0	25313130	Funky vintage apartment building located in the perfect spot for checking out Capital Hill and downtown. Owen was totally on the ball and easy to work with. 
35530	1107845	8.0	10.0	26032129	Very satisfied with host and apartment. Everything is the same as on the pictures. Host is very flexible to work for late check-out to accommodate my travel schedule. 
35531	1107845	8.0	10.0	26676444	Owen's apartment is just what we were hoping for. The location is perfect for exploring the whole of Seattle, and the views are amazing! The apartment itself is nice, comfortable, and well equipped for everything you would need to be able to cook, live and sleep. Would recommend to anyone. 
35532	1107845	8.0	10.0	28447655	Owen, thanks so much for having me in your home! It was a great convenient location to get to downtown and still be stepping distance from all the fun restaurants/coffee shops on cap hill! Super cool view of the skyline and removed enough from the noise of the city. Also, Victrola and the Starbucks Roastery were right next door! :-)
35533	1107845	8.0	10.0	28711623	The apartment is cozy and clean. I was attending a conference at the Sheraton and had to be there at 8:30 every morning, and it was just a quick walk. Nice café right around the corner, convenience store, etc. No reason not to stay here. 
35534	1107845	8.0	10.0	33394424	My boyfriend and I were visiting Seattle, and Owen's apartment was located in Capitol Hill, where it was walkable to most (touristy) places. Ot was absolutely perfect for us. The apartment is as described in the pictures.  Owen was easy to get in touch/communicate! We had a great time, thanks Owen! 
35535	1107845	8.0	10.0	33817879	Owen was quick to respond to our initial request and continued to be very helpful when we had questions/requests/asked for recommendations. He did a great job making sure that we had all necessary information about his apartment and how to get in, etc. prior to our arrival. From reading previous reviews we knew pretty well what to expect of the apartment and building. The location is great, it was nice to stay in a neighborhood and be able to easily walk to and from downtown during our stay. Capitol Hill is an awesome neighborhood - my roommate and I loved Owen's recommendations and found plenty of other great spots on our own. 
35536	1107845	8.0	10.0	35124562	Apt was exactly as described and the view of downtown was great. The location was the best part with all kinds of great places to eat and see within walking distance. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to the market that wasn't bad at all since its straight down the street. Would recommend to anyone, especially if you don't want to rent a car for your visit.
35537	1107845	8.0	10.0	35684315	Great first Airbnb experience with Owen! Comfy apartment in a great location. Owen was easy to get in touch with and was quick to answer any questions I had. 
35538	1107845	8.0	10.0	36420382	The stay was great. The apartment is right in the heart of Capitol Hill and only a couple blocks from the Pikes Place Market. It's also easy to get to from the highway. The apartment itself is good. Nice amenities with TV, bed, and full kitchen. But with this one the location is best!
35539	1107845	8.0	10.0	39297105	This apartment is in an excellent location in the busiest part of the city, great for walking. On Capitol Hill near downtown, it is a short walk to excellent restaurants on the hill, coffee shops (including the new Starbucks Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room), and music venues. It's just a 15 minute walk across downtown to Pike Place Market.  Everything is within reach on foot.  Also easy airport access, taking the Light Rail from the airport to the end of the line, Westlake Center station, and walking from there. It was our first visit to Seattle and this was a great base.  Owen has an expresso maker as well, so buy some beans and make your own in the morning!
35540	1107845	8.0	10.0	54949114	Studio was spot on with the description. A short walk to downtown. Has a heater that is turned on at night (by the super?), and an additional plug-in heater. There are also a couple small convenience stores, a great cafe (Victrola), the Starbucks roasting room all within a block.
35541	1107845	8.0	10.0	55647762	The ap was perfectly located for us and Owen made the key transition really easy! The heater kinda had its own schedule, but Owen has an additional electronic heater.
35542	1107845	8.0	10.0	55841953	The place was exactly as described. Perfect location and very accommodating host. Comfortably fit 3 of us. Overall great experience!
35543	1107845	8.0	10.0	56407434	Owen was an amazing host.  He was easy to get a hold of and always responded quickly.  Getting into his place was no hassle with straightforward instructions.  The apartment was so charming and comfortable.  There were no surprises about his place from what was posted.  The place is centrally located in a very lively neighborhood.  There are a lot of great restaurants and shops just around the corner.  He is also just a short walk or Uber to Seattle's major attractions.  I highly recommend staying here if you want to vacation in Seattle.  Thank you Owen!  
35544	1107845	8.0	10.0	56685364	I really enjoyed three days here. Different kind of room in my life haha
35545	1107845	8.0	10.0	57274932	Owen' place was amazing! Very clean, great location, walking to downtown, and simply pleasant to hang out in. Only wish I had stayed here longer. Cannot recommend this place enough!
36923	8355276	8.0	9.0	49866270	Rilwan was a great host. He provided a clean private space for me. Everything was clean and orderly, he was on time and very friendly. I would definitely stay at his place again. 
36924	8355276	8.0	9.0	50369828	Have to admit my first experience was a great one. Rilwan was very accommodating to my girlfriend and I. Very flexible with the check in/out time. Never felt any pressure to leave at the end of our stay. The apartment was clean and tidy and was in a great location centralized to all of the things we wanted to do in Seattle. Hope all of my future experiences with airBnB are this pleasant. 
36925	8355276	8.0	9.0	51478501	Rilwan was a great host. Very punctual with check-in and check-out and was available during my stay if I needed anything. The apartment itself is really centrally located if you are spending time downtown or near the waterfront. It is also very near public transit (I went up to Edmonds one of the days I was in town, and it was very easy to get to the bus from the apartment). The neighborhood is great with a wonderful grocery store just around the corner and restaurants just a 5 minute walk from the place (Sushi Kanpai is highly recommended). I would definitely recommend this apartment if you are looking for an affordable place to stay in a great area of Seattle!
36926	8355276	8.0	9.0	51778560	Rilwan is so accomodating! We had last minute changes on our flight but he stil managed to meet with us to give us the key. Everything was perfect. We loved the place! The neighborhood is quiet and nice. Walking distance to Downtown. We love Rilwan's place! We will definitely stay here again when we go back to Seattle! We enjoyed Seattle and this place made us feel at home. 
36927	8355276	8.0	9.0	52439477	All was well. Place could have been cleaner.
36928	8355276	8.0	9.0	52872365	The place was great and location was good! Rilwan was an excellent host.
36929	8355276	8.0	9.0	53358199	Great at communication, especially with emailing or texting. Readily available if questions or needs. Great location, walking distance to pike place market and downtown. Relatively private location.
36930	8355276	8.0	9.0	53729128	Wonderful experience with Rilwan. He was super easy to get in contact with, and amendable to me changing the departure time when I left. Such a great host. The place was so clean and tidy. Will definitely book again if coming though Seattle.
36931	8355276	8.0	9.0	54124787	Rilwan greeted us with a smile and was quick to help us get all set up.    The neighborhood was relatively quiet and only about a 10-15 minute walk to pioneer square and around 20-25 from pike place market.  Overall we had a great weekend and will certainly consider Rilwan's studio as an option next time we visit beautiful Seattle. 
36932	8355276	8.0	9.0	54295741	Rilwan was very easy to work with - nice coordination and communication regarding key pick-up.  The apartment is a good location for access to I-5 and downtown Seattle.  Several cafes, restaurants and a small neighborhood grocery store are within walking distance.  It is a block away from Harborview Medical Center, so the siren quotient from ambulances is high.  Apartment was not clean and lacked some basics such as soap, water glasses, kitchen towels, an iron and back-up bathroom towels.  
36933	8355276	8.0	9.0	54515829	Our stay at Rilwan's was lovely. He was super responsive and the key handoff and departure went smoothly. The place is centrally located and was very close to the Paramount theatre, where we went to see a concert. If you're looking for a cheaper place to stay without any crazy bells and whistles, this is your place! 
36934	8355276	8.0	9.0	56654269	The host canceled this reservation 64 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36935	8355276	8.0	9.0	57429700	We loved our time in Seattle! Rilwan was very flexible with the key drop off and pick up. The apartment was clean and located in a very convenient place. There were many cafes, restaurants, sights, and neighborhoods within a few blocks. Highly recommended!
39340	6436772	8.0	9.0	35957696	Very nice house in a very nice neighborhood.   Everything was easy.
39341	6436772	8.0	9.0	37674223	"The house was incredible and absolutely perfect for our family!  We really liked the layout of the house and the separation between the living area and the rooms of the house. The neighborhood was awesome!  Very family friendly and quiet. Great bars, eateries, shops etc.. close by.  And of course the beach! Minutes from Alki, which we enjoyed several times.  
 Their communication with us during our stay was A+. Fast, attentive and effective.  
We were very happy with the house and the surroundings. Thanks!"
40381	5487653	8.0	9.0	30505480	good for the price
40382	5487653	8.0	9.0	38106300	Staying at Aaron's place was a treat. It's in a fantastic neighborhood (Crown Hill) and you're within minutes of Ballard, Old Ballard, and Wallingford, not to mention the Bay. Good bars and restaurants all around and pretty easy access to downtown Seattle as well. The place itself was immaculate. We had all the information we needed for our stay (key location and wifi, etc.). Communication with Aaron was great. Highly recommend staying here!
41039	8631419	8.0	10.0	55206925	Beautiful house! Great location in a gorgeous location with a view of Mt. Rainer in the distance. Ian met us and gave us a tour of the house.  He stayed in an apartment with a separate entrance to the house, but was so respectful of us being there. We specifically looked for something that could accommodate us cooking a Thanksgiving dinner for family there and it didn't disappoint us. Awesome kitchen to cook in and Ian was great in answering questions with short turn around time between guests staying there. Would love to rent it again in the summer! Thank you Ian for letting us stay in your beautiful home!
41040	8631419	8.0	10.0	56323224	Ian was great and his house was perfect for our family when we needed to be out of our house for a week long remodel. It is a well appointed home in a great location. Minutes drive to the West Seattle Bridge and minutes walk to shops and restaurants in the Alaska Junction. Ian was very easy to work with, communicative and available whenever I had questions. It is an older home so sometimes was a bit drafty on those colder nights, but there were plenty of blankets to keep us warm and when necessary we just turned up the heat. Definitely a great experience overall!
41041	8631419	8.0	10.0	57977473	The location and home were perfect in terms of location, view and as described.  It was well appointed, and the host made us feel welcome by having it decorated for Christmas, with the lights on as we arrived.  It provided ample space, and slept 6 snuggly - 3 queen/full beds. 
42530	5931372	8.0	8.0	30169706	This is a great house and for a great deal. Tahoma hosted my family, visiting me from Iceland. They had a nice experience and enjoyed their stay very much. Tahoma responded quickly to my very late request and everything was nice and clean when they arrived. Thanks Tahoma, I will definitely recommend this North Seattle Home for guests.
42531	5931372	8.0	8.0	31023241	We loved our stay in the Townhouse. It was clean, cosy and welcoming. Thanks for everything.
42532	5931372	8.0	8.0	35297657	Really good price for 5-day stay in Seattle. Nice townhouse with garage. As long as you have a car, it is pretty convenient.
42533	5931372	8.0	8.0	37063108	Wonderful clean home, close to great coffee shops, restaurants. Would definitely recommend and rent again!
42534	5931372	8.0	8.0	37318513	It is nice and lovely house. The host kindly provide everything we need. We had a good time there. Thank you very much
42535	5931372	8.0	8.0	37709434	"Nice house -  modern, comfortable and, on the whole, clean. A pleasant place to stay. 

BUT the downside: if you aren't familiar with Seattle, then do be aware. This house is barely a block from Aurora, which is essentially Seattle's red light district. Streetwalkers tout for business just a few meters away from the house. It is located just behind a sex shop too! There is also a lot of noise at night both from Aurora and people hanging around on the dirt track outside the house. Because of the type of activity going on in the neighborhood, police presence is pretty high. There was a cop stationed outside the house when we were there keeping an eye on prostitutes and drug dealers. 

None of this bothered us as we know the area well and if you are sensible, you won't run into trouble. But some people may well have issues with all this.    "
42536	5931372	8.0	8.0	39741347	"This is a great little home!  My husband and I took 4 teens and had ample space with everything we needed. The owner provided a queen air mattress which was VERY helpful with the teen boys who wanted to sleep separately. :-) Be aware that the bathroom is shared with doors to the 2 bedrooms upstairs. Anyone wanting to get in to the shower would be walking through one of the bedrooms.

 I got the pleasure of meeting the owner and she is so helpful to answer any questions I had. She was thoughtful to bring me grocery bags as Seattle is plastic free and she knew we would need to do grocery shopping Thanks for that!  The area of town is older, but we didn't feel unsafe. It is noisy with traffic, which was noticeable because we slept with windows open...but the description tells you that. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks! "
42537	5931372	8.0	8.0	40894199	"The Good: My mother, husband, and 2-yr old, stayed at this house at the end of July 2015. It's located right off Aurora avenue and close to i-5, which made it very convenient to get downtown to Capitol Hill, downtown, lake Washington, and very easy to go any place west of the highways such as Fremont, Ballard, etc. The house has kitchen tools and dishes perfect for cooking easy meals. Even the knives were good. I loved that there was an electric kettle. We didn't use them but there was a coffee maker, French press, and rice maker too. The beds, sheets, and blankets were very comfortable. Lots of towels too. The sheets, bedrooms, and bathrooms were clean (other than the bathroom drain, see below). One reviewer said that aurora is the ""red light district"" this is not accurate. We were totally safe and although there were some people drinking during the day and one woman who seemed high this felt very normal for a city. Aurora had some great things on it like the drive-in burger place, a yoga studio, and the pcc natural market a five minute drive away. The Sex toy shop is no longer there.

The not-so-good: we arrived to a dirty house. Not unbearable but not up to par with what you'd expect for the price. There wasa layer of grease over the oven and microwave. The toaster and refrigerator had crumbs and food grime in them. The floor and stairs had dirt and dust in them. There were small cobwebs on the lights in the bathroom and the bathroom drain was clogged with a ton of hair. I actually pulled it out myself because I was so disgusted. We had Mary Ann come back the next day to clean the floors and kitchen again. She cleaned the second floor, toaster, and fridge but the microwave and oven were still greasy and the stairs still had dirt on them. It seemed like the house hadn't had a thorough cleaning in a long time. We would've been happy to pay a higher cleaning fee for a hotel quality clean.  We are from NYC so were used to street noise but definitely being off aurora was noisy and it was too hot to sleep with windows closed. There is no AC so you put the fan on at night and it cools down a lot. It also was a particularly hot summer for Seattle. 

Overall we had a great stay at this location and would return of we knew it would be cleaner next time. "
42538	5931372	8.0	8.0	43617525	House was just as it is listed! True, it is somewhat close to a noisy road and some non-family businesses, it is also close to a public transit stop - and we never felt unsafe. The house was clean and just the right size for our larger family. You can even see portions of downtown Seattle and Mt. Rainier from the upper floor!

43916	6425537	8.0	9.0	34468185	Kylie made communication easy, arranged a meeting place to get the key to the apartment to us, and provdied written instructions of how to find and access her apartment. The apartment was located right by the light rail so was perfect both for getting to downtown or to the airport. It was quiet, and although small, had everything that we needed. It could have been cleaner however as both the ktichen and bathroom were quite dirty. We are easy going so we didn't mind, but this might turn other people off.
43917	6425537	8.0	9.0	36404074	"We stayed at Kylie's for a couple weeks, and we had a great experience.  Very conveniently located on the light rail, it's a short ride in to the city.  Nice building too with everything you could want.  We had a small internet issue that she was very responsive about and helped us take care of extremely quickly.  It's a bit more ""lived in"" than most places I've stayed, so I wouldn't recommend it for a neat freak, but other than that it's a great place to stay, and I would happily do so again."
43918	6425537	8.0	9.0	36625707	Kylie was very helpful and prompt with communication. She was friendly and accommodating. Her place is conveniently located across the street from the light rail station to put visitors minutes away from downtown- this worked great on our visit. It is perfect little place for a couple on a weekend getaway.
43919	6425537	8.0	9.0	37586419	This is my very first experience with Airbnb.  My host Kylie was very nice and responsive with my questions before arrival. She greeted me when I arrived the apartment.  Although the apartment is only about 500 sq ft but it's clean and I only need a place to sleep. Unfortunately the days I stayed there was the record hottest days of the year.  The apartment is on the top floor without air conditioning, it was too hot for me to sleep on the first night but the following few nights seem to be fine.  The best part was I have a car and Kylie let me use the private gated garage just step from the door entrance.  Kylie had provided everything I needed in the apartment, it's like living in your own apartment.  My first Airbnb experience was indeed a good one. 
43920	6425537	8.0	9.0	38055405	Kylie is friendly and attentive, she made sure me and my wife were comfortable and answered all our questions and concerns. The studio was spotless and very inviting. It's located near the bus line and you can travel to downtown Seattle by foot.

44504	278192	8.0	8.0	1025259	This room is also clean and quiet. The host is really really nice. Recommend!
44505	278192	8.0	8.0	1168970	Keith & Cherie are great hosts. Great communication from booking to our arrival! Keith even stopped by to check on us and show us around and he even took the time to drive us to the Light Rail station so that we could catch a Mariners game in time, thanks!!
44506	278192	8.0	8.0	1269261	I was travelling around the US with a friend and we had a really nice stay in Seattle for a couple of nights. The place was simple, comfy and located in a very nice and calm neighbourhood. Keith and Cherie were extremely welcoming and easy going. I would highly recommend the place and the hosts.
44507	278192	8.0	8.0	1522908	Keith was a great host and made my trip a memorable one. Great location, short walk to transportation to the city. Keith even took me to see Jimi Hendrix's grave which would have been a long trip on the buses so I am thankful for that also. Overall a great host and I recommend him highly
44508	278192	8.0	8.0	1644241	When you travel to a place that you are unfamiliar with, one of the best feelings is having a friend there. That is exactly how Keith & Cherie made us feel. We loved our stay with them and their family made us feel right at home over the fourth of July holiday.
44509	278192	8.0	8.0	1725063	"This was exactly the weekend my girlfriend and I needed. Keith met us at the ferry and took us to his home. Nice quiet neighbourhood which was located close to the Lightrail system, a fresh market and liqour store. 

When we orginally contacted Keith and Cherie about our plans for Seattle we told them a little about ourselves and what we were looking for and then they filled in all the blanks. We had such a great time with the party bus, Keiths love for Seattle was apparent. He took us to a few hot spots & seemingly knew someone everywhere we went which only added to our experience! 

Cherie was really sweet and made sure we had everything we needed as if we were at home. They really made us feel welcome and we would definitly be back! 

Sarah and I couldn't stop giggling about our night and kept saying that had we not stayed with them we may not have had the fun and experiences we did! Thanks Guys! I'm sure we will see you again!

Melissa & Sarah"
44510	278192	8.0	8.0	1798953	My girlfriends & I LOVED staying at Keith & Cherie's!  They are super fun hosts... if you chose to stay with them, get ready to have a blast!  Their house is neat & clean, and feels very safe. Furthermore, both Keith & Cherie know all the fun spots in Seattle, and they gave us lots of great suggestions. PLUS they gave us rides to those places via their transportation business, which was great because we didn't have a car.  Overall, a wonderful experience!
44511	278192	8.0	8.0	1815319	I really enjoyed staying at Keith &Cherie's place! Cherie was nice, and Keith was SO HELPFUL!! The rooms are clean and so was the bathroom. We stayed in the upstairs bedroom with the bunk beds. I thought it was plenty for us. His Daughter was super sweet! loved seeing how they both are so proud of their city! And they know so much! The neighborhood is calm and its about a 5-10  min walk to the sound transit rail! Super easy to get into DT. Next time I go back I'd definitely try and stay here. The Asphy family is a great Host!
44512	278192	8.0	8.0	1833591	Keith & Cherie accommodated us last minute.  They were friendly and informative in regards to telling us what areas to go check out even though we were rushed.  Thanks Keith & Cherie!
44513	278192	8.0	8.0	7150305	"Prez and Cherie were very kind. I needed a place to stay at the last minute. They were prompt in their response and I felt accommodated through my whole experience. 

I stayed in the lower level of the house which was nice and cool during the hot summer week I was visiting Seattle. The kitchen and bathroom were both clean and nice. It was great to have a place to cook!
"
44514	278192	8.0	8.0	7571198	My sister and I stayed at Prez and Cherie's home while celebrating my birthday. They were great hosts and very sweet! Their home is located close to all the sights and they recommend places to go which was really nice! We'd love to stay with them again!
44515	278192	8.0	8.0	9844083	Prez and Cherie were great, extremely helpful in showing us around the house. They even offered us a ride to our destination to save us the hassle of travelling!
44516	278192	8.0	8.0	9947316	Our stay was really express (only one night) we were 4 people total and for what we wanted it was perfect! The place was really clean and in good conditions, it seemed really nice even for a longer stay. I will recommend it if you are looking for something more affordable!
44517	278192	8.0	8.0	16193833	We booked last minute and they responded right away. Prez met us in person and showed us the apartment. The bed was very comfortable and we were able to use the washer/dryer. Thanks for making our stay in Seattle pleasurable.
44710	606297	8.0	8.0	1944452	"Keith is a wonderful host! Stayed with my brothers and there girlfriends along with my boyfriend. Only thing I'd say is there were a few spiders ;) 
But, other than that... It is a nice, warm and welcoming home! Thank you again Keith! "
44711	606297	8.0	8.0	2249005	Very spacious house. A great place to stay for a large party (we had nine). Keith was way cool. He allowed us check in early, gave us a lift to dinner and arranged for a party bus to take us all to an event on Friday night. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again the next time I'm in the Seattle area with a large group. Thanks again Keith for a being such a gracious host!
44712	606297	8.0	8.0	2387577	Keith is a very friendly owner I have ever met!!!
44713	606297	8.0	8.0	2432664	Keith  was and excellent host!  The house was perfect for our group of 9 people, and we really appreciated Keith's hospitality.  He was great with communication and even allowed our group a later checkout time!  We'd stay again in a heartbeat! 
44714	606297	8.0	8.0	2542383	Great, friendly service.  Offered up some discounted party bus fun.  Tons of space, very clean inside - would recommend. Thanks, Keith! 
44715	606297	8.0	8.0	3754851	I had the opportunity to stay at Keith and Cherie's earlier this month. The house definitely accommodated 10 people in the party. Besides the two parking spaces at the house there was also parking right across the street for all of my out of town guests. Keith was very kind, accommodating and helped us arrange party bus service for out night out!
44716	606297	8.0	8.0	3820796	Keith and Cherie were easy to deal with.  Seamless transaction, location was easy to get to and the hosts were super accommodating.  I would have no problems booking with them the next time we visit Seattle.  
44717	606297	8.0	8.0	4090603	Keith met us at the house and was a great host - the rooms were fantastic for what we needed (there were six of us and a baby) and we had absolutely no problems at all.
44718	606297	8.0	8.0	4168122	Keith and Cherie were really helpful and welcoming. They provided everything stated on their profile and communicated very well from the beginning to the end of our visit. We appreciated their concern on our travel by always checking up on us to make sure we are doing well. The house was less then 5 minutes away from Downtown Seattle and right next to the freeway, which made it easy to navigate. I would recommend this place to anyone who is traveling to Seattle. Great hospitality!  
44719	606297	8.0	8.0	4364809	We (a group of 6) recently stayed at this house for the weekend. Keith was a very welcoming and helpful host. He was very helpful with providing suggestions of things to do, quickly answering any questions we had, and giving us rides to and from downtown Seattle. He was available 24/7, and really made our stay as comfortable as possible! If it weren't for him, we wouldn't have been able to attend a great comedy show, and an after party at the See Sound Lounge, all on Sunday night. The house was spacious, very clean and definitely catered to our needs. The location is also ideal - everything is a short trip away. For those thinking about staying in Seattle, consider this place highly recommended.
44720	606297	8.0	8.0	4594087	We love our stay at Keith and Cherie's apartment! They are both very gracious and helpful hosts, their large apartment was perfect for our needs while we visited Seattle for a family wedding. Keith was quick to respond to any texts and would drop by to say 'hi' from time to time.When our flight was delayed, he graciously allowed us to stay past our checkout time. Their apartment was very well stocked, from large crockpots to board games and books for the little ones.  We highly recommend Keith and Cherie's apartment and will not hesitate to return the next time we are in Seattle!
44721	606297	8.0	8.0	5290977	Our group had an excellent time! Easy walking distance to grocery store and light rail station. Keith and Cherie were extremely welcoming and accommodating.
44722	606297	8.0	8.0	5342106	"Seriously!  We literally could not have had a better place to stay than with Prez and Cherie.  Everything was so perfect for us.  The house was in the perfect location for us to get there from Portland and really convenient to get around town.  Stocked with everything we needed to cook and have a nice time. Clean and comfortable.
We rented the entire space out for a bachelorette extravaganza fiesta weekend!  We are all mostly in our 30's and work in the service industry.  Keith (Prez) was so quick to respond and very accommodating while I was in a frenzy trying to plan out all the logistics for our weekend.  We really had the best time possible.   
Day 1:Our first night there we planned on a nice dinner in Capitol Hill and then drinks in the hood.  I had called us a few cabs (there were 12 of us then with 2 more joining (email hidden)e cab companies were ridiculous and I spent a half hour on the phone, only to find out they had dispatched to the wrong neighborhood.  Prez's dad Ali was out front chatting with some of my friends.  He was on his way to pick up some people in  a Party bus and he let us hop a ride with to dinner for a small fee.  We had a great time at dinner and out drinking and then we decided to call Prez and see if the party bus could possibly take us home. They came right by on their way home and let us dance the whole way home. We stayed up for a bit at the house and we had invited Prez to come by if he wanted.  He showed up with lovely Cherie and we had a nice time chatting with them on the balcony.  
Day 2: We were all pretty tired and hungry and as my friends were making breakfast Prez stopped by and offered to run to the store to get anything we needed.  He went and got us fixings for bloody mary's which i had completely forgotten to bring!  He saved the day!   We hung out all day at the house and felt very comfy and welcome.  
Day 3: we were packing up and getting ready to leave.  It was extremely convenient to clean up, do all our dishes, and put our towels in the hamper.  Everyone was so happy with our weekend.  Prez stopped by and chatted and we all exchanged numbers and now we have a new friend who we hope will come visit us in Portland.  This was one of the best experiences vacationing I have ever had.  They were so friendly and accommodating and made us feel at home.  Anytime I'm back in Seattle I hope that I can stay with them.  I wish that all people could be like them!"
44723	606297	8.0	8.0	5537839	We had 3 generations staying at the home. Prez and Cherie were awesome hosts. They were so accommodating with our last minuted requests for transportation. I would highly recommend staying at any of their properties. When we got back from the baseball game they had a feast of BBQ chicken and ribs, macaroni salad and all the fixins waiting for us! Super friendly people!
44724	606297	8.0	8.0	5905382	This is our 2nd time staying at this house and it has always been a good experience. Prez and Cherie have done some upgrades to the place and its a lot better! The deck is nice, has a spacious backyard and 5 bedrooms to accommodate a large group of people.  Prez was so accommodating and he made sure we were ok by checking up on us at night.  We stayed here during the Bite of Seattle and hopefully we will be staying here again whenever we are in town.  
44725	606297	8.0	8.0	5988086	Good location!  Easy access to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods!  The house has great community space for 10 adults to sit comfortably and hang out.  Thanks Prez & Cherie for being responsible, understanding and welcoming hosts!
44726	606297	8.0	8.0	6031261	We had a great stay in Seattle. Wish we could have stayed longer! Cherie was very helpful and the house was great for our large group.
44727	606297	8.0	8.0	6104621	Location, location, location! This house is located very close to a light rail station which got us downtown for special events such as a Mariners game, the Space Needle, and the big concert we went to Seattle for in the first place. It only took us 2 or 3 stops to get us to where we wanted to go. I spoke with Cherie on the phone and she was so amiable. The house is basic by design and was perfect for our large group of 11. The kids were able to entertain themselves for hours with the Wii and with the poker table provided. All in all, if you want a great location, this is the place for you.
44728	606297	8.0	8.0	6239284	"We spent a long weekend in Seattle and rented the house for an informal college reunion with a group of 10.  We certainly enjoyed our stay and Prez and Cherie were gracious hosts.  Prez was out of town but was responsive via text anytime we needed to reach him.  Cherie showed us the place when we arrived and was very interested throughout our stay in how our time in Seattle was going.  It was nice to have that personal touch, and made us feel welcome.  Also, we accidentally got locked out at 2am on our last night and both Prez and Cherie responded to our text messages within a few minutes!

There was plenty of room in the house for all 10 of us (we had both the lower and upper units) and the number of bathrooms and kitchen space meant that we didn't have any conflicts about taking showers or finding space in the fridge for our adult beverages.  

The location is nice because it is short 10 minute drive from downtown, and the house is very close to the light rail station, which you can take directly downtown in 15 minutes or to the airport.  The Beacon Hill area is a pretty typical Seattle neighborhood--nothing swanky but perfectly nice.  Similarly, the house was clean and definitely met all of our needs, but was not swanky.  For our group it worked very well because it was a very economical option near downtown with plenty of space, and the fact that Prez and Cherie were so responsive and interested in making sure we had a good time was a nice perk.  

We had a great weekend with our college friends in Seattle, everyone in our group was pleased with the accommodations, and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a good value in a location but who does not need a nice (but not fancy) place.  Thanks Prez and Cherie!"
44729	606297	8.0	8.0	6339216	We had such a great time in Seattle and a big part of it was because of Prez and Cherie, you won't find more better hosts then these two! We did a pub crawl with the party bus the first night we where there and Prez took us to the hottest spots to party in Seattle and boy did we have a blast! Best pub crawl ever! Prez was so much fun and fit into our group perfectly. The house was very clean and fit our needs, it was located close to the Train station so heading downtown was a sinch and very quick. Prez and Cherie always made sure we had everything we needed and they always answered all our questions quickly, communication was easy. When we head back to Seattle I would def stay in their home again! I highly recommend this house you won't be disapointed I promise. Thank you so much Prez and Cherie! 
44730	606297	8.0	8.0	6611345	Prez and Cherie provided a nice experience in their home, and were very accommodating and personal in that they were always in contact and made sure everything was all good to go! We didn't get to meet in person since I was too busy with my brother's wedding nearby in SODO and was occupied by our visiting relatives, but it felt like I knew them already based on their hospitality and contacting through texting. House is pretty spacious upstairs and just right downstairs. Would definitely stay again if the need arises! Thanks Prez and Cherie!
44731	606297	8.0	8.0	7004850	A great host. Would highly recommend 
44732	606297	8.0	8.0	7693205	"Prez and Cheri we kind enough to accommodate our huge group of 11 visiting from Los Angeles. We had an upstairs and downstairs unit. The place was so big it didn't even feel like there were that many of us staying there!  They house was fully stocked with everything we could need. On our first night there Prez stopped by to welcome us and offered our giant group a ride in his amazing party bus to Elysian Brewery. 

I would totally stay with them again, big or small group. "
44733	606297	8.0	8.0	8078723	I booked this house as a place for my family to be together while in town for a wedding.  The house is spacious and for our purposes well situated.  We had several cars so getting to the grocery three very steep blocks away was easy.  Public transit is also down the steep hill.  Walking in the neighborhood is pleasant with a nearby golf course and park.  The house itself has seen many parties and is showing the signs of wear.  The kitchen is stocked with necessities though the table ware is in short supply for such a big house.  A guest information book would be helpful as I did not meet our hosts at all during the four days and there are unexplained locks on some of the interior doors that caused some unnecessary frustration.
44734	606297	8.0	8.0	8524819	A group of us came down from Canada for the weekend, and this house was easily big enough for all of us. The upstairs kitchen is nice and big, although doesn't really have seating but we managed just fine. And there is tons of fridge space, which is great with big groups. Prez & Cherie were always available via phone, and responded right away.
44735	606297	8.0	8.0	8814245	Fantastic location for those wanting explore all of Seattle.  Light rail makes the trip from the airport a snap.  It is a short walk from both light rail stations to the house.  When wanting to go the city, it is only 20min or so on the light rail to get there.  We went to the market, the Seahawks game, the space needle, etc. all without a cab fare.
44736	606297	8.0	8.0	9439193	We rented the house for a family reunion/Christmas vacation and were disappointed with the condition of the house. From the pictures and reviews we thought it would be a good option for all of us (9 adults and 3 kids), but the house was much more worn and deteriorating than is portrayed in the pictures.  While the rest of the house was cleaned up okay, the kitchen was not clean and everything had a layer of grease on it (dishes, cupboards, oven).  We had to wash everything before we used it. While Prez was gracious in his response to some of our requests/issues (fixing the sink handle that had broken off), I think the experience would have been more positive if it had been professionally cleaned. I think the house needs some serious work/upgrades to accurately reflect what is portrayed online.
44737	606297	8.0	8.0	9890971	If you're a large group that needs a budget place to crash after a night of partying, this is the place for you. The hosts were warm and friendly. However, if you do not fall in that category, you would want to look elsewhere.  The condition of the house was very disappointing as it did not reflect the photos.  It is much older and run down than appears in the bright flash lit photos.  The basement has been converted into bedrooms, but it feels dark and dank. It has as much charm as an old motel. I've stayed a numerous AirBnBs over the years and this was the most disappointing. 
44738	606297	8.0	8.0	10048503	The place was extremely roomy and accommodating. We had a group of 9. Each couple had their own private bedroom and there were plenty of extra beds to spare. Clean sheets and bathrooms is all I really ask for and this place fit our budget nicely! Location is pretty close to downtown, just an uber ride away. The place could use some remodeling here and there but overall it was perfectly fine. 
44739	606297	8.0	8.0	10490789	The reservation was canceled 56 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
44740	606297	8.0	8.0	10547885	Prez & Cherie were wonderful, easy going hosts.  They did not hesitate to help us work around our large group of 18, and were extremely accommodating in all our requests!  The house was cozy and in fair condition, with enough common areas to bring the group closer together.  We had a great time here :)
44741	606297	8.0	8.0	10990452	"Our stay in Prez & Cherie's beautiful house couldn't have been better! 

First let me start off with how easy, quick and professional Prez was to deal with during the whole process of renting out his place. He was very straight forward about everything and there was no confusion whatsoever. He also accommodated our last minute reservation and even allowed our large group of 16 to stay on top of this.  

As far as the house goes…The place is amazing! My favorite feature of the home was how it was conveniently located a short, 6 minute drive from the heart of the city. So whether you're going to Pike Place, Fremont, C-link/Safeco, or wherever this wonderful city may take you.. it is just a hop, skip and a jump away! Besides the location, the condition of the house was immaculate and the property was very large (even with 16 people, there was a ton of space!). 

It's the little things that count, and i have to thank Prez for going above and beyond to make sure we had the best time possible. There were maps, locations of popular attractions in the city, restaurants for you or the family to visit…and if you didn't want to go out, there were numbers Prez had set out for 3 different places that would deliver food right to you. He made sure there were the extra beds available for our large group, there was food in the fridge, and the bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens were in tip-top shape. 

A+ Customer Service & Hospitality!!!!


P.S. We had the luxury of using Prez's transportation service. Since we had a big group, we took the large party bus into the city! This was great for our group and everyone had an awesome time. I would look into this if you are considering booking the rental space, as there were plenty of options besides the party bus like a limo, town-car, or even a van if you needed it.


-We will definitely be staying here again next time we are out in Seattle, and i would recommend this home to anyone thinking about doing the same, you won't regret it!!!  


-Ryan"
44742	606297	8.0	8.0	11130552	Friendly, helpful and accommodating!
44743	606297	8.0	8.0	12848225	Had a great stay at this 5-bedroom house. We had a large party in town for a birthday and Cherie and Prez were very accommodating, sending restaurant recommendations and even offered complimentary party bus service! The place is in a residential area - 10 minute drive from downtown, and is a bit on the older side, but looks like the photos and was very clean and had everything we needed. The hosts were thorough and communication was very clear. Would definitely stay here again if we had a big group!
44744	606297	8.0	8.0	13953974	Great place!  Didn't really chat too much with Prez or Cherie but they seemed nice for the little we did talk.  Would visit again!
44745	606297	8.0	8.0	14148929	"- appreciate that the host had been very helpful & accomodating.
- love the speed of the washer n dryer
removing the carpet may be a good idea"
44746	606297	8.0	8.0	14872779	Prez and Cherie were very welcoming hosts, and the place was large enough to accommodate our party as well as two dogs. Prez was also very flexible, and refunded us for the additional guest fee when some of our party couldn't make it at the last minute. 
44747	606297	8.0	8.0	15386517	"

We rented Prez and Cherie's house for a group of 12 attending my sister's wedding. It was a great setup - we were able to comfortably accommodate 2 couples and one mother and baby in the 3 larger bedrooms (2 upstairs and one downstairs), and single guests stayed in the bunk beds and the downstairs rooms. It was nice to have several bathrooms and 2 kitchens so we could prep food for meals or picnics. 

We enjoyed hanging out on the deck or in the living room during downtime, and when we wanted privacy we could retreat to our room.  The location was great as all of our festivities took place in Beacon Hill or Mt. Baker neighborhoods. 

The hosts were good communicators and responsive when we had questions, even dropping off a package that came after I had checked out.

44748	606297	8.0	8.0	15673149	"Great experience. Prez and family are great hosts/Made us feel welcome.
There 14 of us - Grandparents, children, grandchildren - the house was laid
out as great place to bond. Centrally located, we we had access to all the local attractions, sleeping accommodations were great, parking was abundant to handle 4 cars. This house is not brand new but if you are a large family, a large bunch of college kids or similar I cannot think of a better place to stay. This was a family reunion, in 10 years we will be back!!
"
44749	606297	8.0	8.0	16619296	Our hosts Prez & Cherie were very welcoming and friendly as was our communication via email and airbnb. Their home was perfect fit for our family vacay with our big group of 13. :) The home itself is a little on the older side from what we expected in the photos, but everything works well and we had everything we needed--from full kitchen to laundry machines. We came in the summer so there were plenty of fans and windows that kept it relatively cool. We heard in the Winter it gets pretty chilly at night, so the heater is available around the home. It was really convenient distance to downtown Seattle - Pike's Market, Space Needle, Gum Wall, etc. We really were fascinated and impressed by the unique LED lights around the house (front door, door knobs, kitchen water faucet, etc.) and the programmable, digital door knobs. Loved the private spacious parking in front of the home to fit our 2 minivans and having two entrance doors both downstairs and upstairs.
44750	606297	8.0	8.0	17038764	"Our group of 5 women ranging from 40- to 60-something had a great weekend at Prez’ place.  I read the last 2 reviews, especially the very negative one.  We must have stayed at a different house & neighborhood because our experience was totally different. The house is older, so the furniture is not top of the line & the floors are scuffed, but everything was clean, not at all dingy & very serviceable. The patio was great & sturdy enough for 5 of us to sit up there every morning & evening. We never felt in danger from the structure. The blinds in the master bedroom have been replaced & are just fine. The kitchen is stocked with every cooking utensil you would need. There are cleaning utensils underneath the sink & in the room off the kitchen where the washer & dryer are stored.  The bathrooms are clean & signs are clearly posted where to put the dirty towels. There were numerous small bottles of shampoo under the sink in the master bedroom. The beds are comfortable.  The downstairs is a converted basement but nicely so.  It is 5 – 7 degrees cooler than the upper unit – a nice trade-off when the weather got hot during our stay.  There is no A/C, but plenty of fans, so sleeping was no problem.

The neighborhood is middle-class.  It was VERY quiet.  The house is located about 1 ½ - 2 miles from a major hospital in a major city, so hearing sirens would be understandable.  But we heard none.  I woke up at 2am one morning and it was dead quiet (the window was open).  No people went in & out because of the party bus. Use of the party bus is great.  Rates for the 2 times we used it (airport pick-up & a ride downtown) were extremely reasonable.  

Here are the negatives:  1) The master bathroom is small.  The door to the bathroom doesn’t open all the way.  The toilet blocks it.  So you have to open it ¾, go in and close the door to reach the shower.  2) At times, Prez did not respond to a text for several hours, but he did check in with us twice during our stay and prepared the fire pit for our use.  Unfortunately, we didn’t have any matches and there were none anywhere in the house, so be sure to bring some if you want to use the fire pit.  3) The stairs leading to the lower unit are steep and don’t have a banister, though you can hold on to the wall.  Not recommended for older people who are not steady on their feet.  However, there is easier access if they simply go outside and walk around.  None of these negatives was a deal-killer.  We had a good time, the house was a great value and we’d stay there again.
"
44751	606297	8.0	8.0	17616235	"We had a great time at this rental. The ad was correct. It was easy to find and a ten minute walk to the train station. The carpets were very clean which we liked. A few of the beds were either too hard or too soft and we would bring our own pillows next time.

It was nice to have a functioning kitchen as we were traveling with two babies. ThEre was eight of us and we had plenty of room."
44752	606297	8.0	8.0	17822999	"Prez & Ali were exceptional hosts. I cannot possibly emphasize how wonderful they were throughout our stay. If you are considering booking this house, stop now- just book it. Prez will ensure you will NOT be disappointed.

I booked this house for a bachelor party with 15 guys, and Prez made sure we were looked after the entire time. Without their help, I am doubtful the party would have gone half as well as it did. From transportation to recommendations about what to do, they were extremely helpful. The house is well stocked with everything you might need, and there are ample beds, couches, and even air mattresses if you are concerned about the capacity of this house.

The house is close to downtown and has a strip mall within walking distance so you can be sure that anything you need is nearby. As well, Prez owns and operates a transportation company so this is the airBNB equivalent of one stop shopping. This is the future of airBNB...fully integrated services, from accommodation to transportation."
44753	606297	8.0	8.0	18109410	I recently visited with a group of underprivileged teenagers to visit colleges in Seattle. Prez was impressed with our mission and gave our group a really good deal so that we could afford to stay in the house. He was attentive during our stay and even came over one night to fix the DVD player. Overall the house is comfortable, the kitchen is well-stocked and has spices, condiments, and a few staples, and it was an easy walk to the light rail. 
44754	606297	8.0	8.0	18409225	"My friends and I were lucky enough to rent this home for our trip to Seattle. It was easy to find, conveniently located and offered up plenty of space for all of us. Prez was a gracious host and helped make this trip fun and easy. 
"
44755	606297	8.0	8.0	18597016	Prez & Cherie were very prompt with communication and made sure we were able to get help when needed. The check in process was easy and convenient as they had keyless entry and we had the whole house. The detailed instructions on their posting made everything easy to find and get. The rooms by the street can get a bit noisy at night as it is not inner streets. Overall good stay.
44756	606297	8.0	8.0	19117377	Host, not responsive to text's asking for early check-in, claimed phone problems. Not likely.  The photos on the Airbnb site depict this home beautifully however, not so beautiful in person.  Be careful with expectations.  This house has seen better days, e.g. drawers in kitchen with no bottoms, no hand railing going down some fairly steep stairs to the bottom level, no indoor table that seats more the 5 people, digital door looks did not work on arrival had to get a universal code from the host.  This host apparently also owns a transportation busiu grass and parking area of the house.  Cleaning of these vehicles will occur during your stay so don't be surprised, as we were.  The good thing is the house is centrally located with easy access to grocery, gas etc. as well as downtown seattle, westside and other common destinations
44757	606297	8.0	8.0	19430893	They were nice, flexible, and the place was clean. Would suggest it to anyone with a large group. 
44758	606297	8.0	8.0	20760996	location was good, easy access on and off freeways, not far from grocery and a couple of cute restaurants.  I have to agree with Greg on some things- kitchen not particularly clean ( I had to clean up a spill and the rag was black when I was finished, not from our water spill), there are only a few eating utensils, the dishes felt greasy so we rewashed them.  I think it would be great to put in a dishwasher so all dishes could be equally clean.  Though there is a refrigerator for guests, the door was full of condiments of who knows what age.  I think it would be helpful to have the cleaning crew make new ice trays each time, some were so old there was barely a cube in the container.  I agree the access to the basement needs a rail, it is steep and circular.  While we were told the access to the house would be the last digits of the phone, it did not turn out to be so.  Luckily someone was there and could recode it for what we thought the code was, then it worked fine.  Parking not easy for more than one or two cars and when we left on sunday the Party Bus was so close to our car, access had to be across the passenger seat.   We did enjoy the limo ride to and from our destination- prompt service and nice to have.
44759	606297	8.0	8.0	20976394	Great time at Prez's place.  Great host and good vibes there.  
44760	606297	8.0	8.0	21156422	The house was great! The hosts were very accomodating and even let us check in early because no one was staying there the night before. Towels were provided for us so it was very convenient. We occupied the whole house so we were able to hang out without worrying about noise. There was plenty of space for lounging and the hosts made our stay very enjoyable. The neighborhood felt a little sketchy but location was easy to get around from. We rented one car and the hosts gave us one of their parking spots to park. We also used uber to get around to the city which isn't too bad.
44761	606297	8.0	8.0	21519461	This place was perfect for our needs.  We were a group of 13 people attending a friend's wedding, and this house had enough space for everybody.  It also had some nice central hang-out spaces so that we could all sit around and play games.  It is also not far from the light rail and a supermarket, which was nice.  Prez and his father were there to show us how things worked, and, leading up to it, Prez and Cherie were very responsive.  Overall, this booking was very successful, and I would recommend it.
44762	606297	8.0	8.0	21883697	"Prez and Cheri's place was very nice, and was exactly as described / pictured.  The house is nice and spacious, and is well-suited for a large group visiting Seattle.  It is a bit further south, and so not in the heart of the action, but a really great home base, and everything of interest is easily accessible.

Prez and Cheri were very communicative, and were easy to get ahold of.  They responded to my inquiry about booking the place within hours, and responded very quickly while my group was at the listing when we had questions.  Check-in was seamless, and the apartment was very clean.

Prez and Cheri have a lot of rules about staying in their place, which are visible on the listing's description.  I think they are all reasonable rules and totally understand why they would be laid out up front as they are - in fact, its definitely better for the guest and host to have clear expectations of each other before booking.  However, some of the penalties (e.g., for broken glassware or moved furniture) seemed a bit harsh, and made it a bit difficult for us to really relax and feel comfortable in the listing.

One last thing worth noting is that the 'registration' required of all guests before staying at the listing seemed a bit overreaching - for example, at the time of our stay guests were required to provide information such as home address and pictures of themselves.  There are somewhat reasonable motivations for asking for this information, but it seems like it could be achieved in a less intrusive way that has less friction by just asking for everyone's Airbnb profile or something.

Overall, I'd recommend Prez and Cheri's - especially if you have a big group.  We had a great time while staying there, and would recommend it to any friends traveling to Seattle in the future."
44763	606297	8.0	8.0	22227395	Great place and fantastic hosts. Thanks for being super accommodating and friendly!
44764	606297	8.0	8.0	22863537	This place was AWESOME. They were such friendly and welcoming hosts and made themselves available for all of our needs. The house had everything we needed and was perfect for our large group. This place could easily accommodate a large family or group of people. The location was awesome, clean neighborhood with stores right down the street. I would highly recommend this house for any group heading to Seattle. Easy access to freeways (I-5 and I-90) and downtown. They even have sufficient parking for a large group, which can be hard to do in Seattle! We are already looking forward to our next retreat :-)
44765	606297	8.0	8.0	25181375	Prez and Cherie were great hosts. Great communication and super easy check in!
44766	606297	8.0	8.0	26222615	It was a great experience staying here. Generous hosts, great house and amazing times!
44767	606297	8.0	8.0	26603483	Prez and Cherie's house was perfect in accommodating our large group of 11 people. We had a nice welcome on our first night when Prez popped in to say hello and an even nicer bon voyage as they threw us a little going away party. Prez was easy to get a hold of, helped answer our questions, and made our stay very pleasant and worry free!
44768	606297	8.0	8.0	27921992	Great stay! Great choice for large group who want access to downtown. House was very clean and towels/bedding/kitchen were all well supplied. Layout and kitchen worked well for our group of 12. Mattresses were in nice shape too. Nice neighborhood, house on quiet dead end street, close to shops and easy to get anywhere. Plenty of street parking. Also rented a bus which was super fun and a great price. Can’t say enough nice things about Prez – he was kind, generous, and very laid back. Will definitely rent from him again for Seattle gathering. Thanks Prez and Cherie!
44769	606297	8.0	8.0	28298824	"Prez was great with communication and allowed us to check in early, and was there to greet us upon arrival. The check in process was easy and convenient as they had keyless entry and we had the whole house. The detailed instructions on their posting made all expectations straight forward. The house was big enough to accommodate our large group and at an affordable price. It was located near the highway for short travel to/from airport, and also close to downtown. Off street parking available. Prez also gave us a comfortable and enjoyable ride to/from our wedding venue via his transportation service. 

Some things to note: the apartment basement was a bit musty and carpet damp, probably due to the rainy weather. I was concerned with some wear/stains on carpet and in kitchen as far as it impacting our security deposit but that wasn't a problem. I also wasn't 100% comfortable with the registration of all guests via their website; I felt like one person would be enough."
44770	606297	8.0	8.0	28575158	Large and clean house. Near downtown and pretty convenient.
44771	606297	8.0	8.0	31013426	"I booked this reservation on behalf of some Australian friends of mine who were going camping on the Olympic Peninsula. They had never been to Seattle and wanted to see the city before they explored the wilderness... so I put them up at Prez & Cherie's.

Prez & Cherie's Airbnb is in such a great location, just as promised. Everything was incredibly comfortable and convenient. What was especially nice was P&C's willingness to accommodate a one-night stay. They guys had a great time and enjoyed their hospitality. :)"
44772	606297	8.0	8.0	31761589	Prez was VERY reachable and went to great lengths to make sure that we were satisfied during our trip. The listing looked exactly like it was shown online and the neighborhood it was in was very nice!
44773	606297	8.0	8.0	34281097	"First the positive:
We only dealt with Prez during our stay and he was very nice. There was a case of water with our check in and what seemed to be a ""pay it forward"" pantry stocked with some basic essentials from previous guests such as pancake mix, syrup, butter etc. There were plenty of plates and utensils in the kitchen. Prez also runs a transportation company, so it was wonderful to be able to hire him from pier to door service for our cruise. The house was overall clean and comfortable. They also let us do an early check in which was great because we had a LOT of luggage, very laid back host.
Neutrals:
It didn't bother me, but the house is on a semi busy street and some folks in my party aren't used to street noise so they were unable to sleep. And while Cheri & Prez require guests to clean up after themselves, a few previous guests hid the fact that they didn't do the best job of cleaning pots, so just be sensible about giving things a rinse. To note, I don't hold the hosts AT ALL responsible for the last 2, just a word for future guests.
Critique:
The house needs a number of small repairs. Holes in window screens, a cracked toilet seat, things like that. Nothing to seriously affect the enjoyment of the stay, or that we felt the need to have fixed right away, especially since we were only there for 2 nights. I should note that Prez was clearly making some repairs so these may just be things that he hadn't gotten around to yet.
**It is important to note that any issues we had were relatively minor. Having a place close to the light rail that was affordable and accommodated our large group was the main goal and this place fit the bill. I want to thank Prez & Cheri for hosting us!**"
44774	606297	8.0	8.0	35202645	"Thank you
Our family of 13 enjoyed our stay in your home "
44775	606297	8.0	8.0	36191498	"The house is in a very convenient neighborhood, central and quiet. It is is good condition.  Prez met our group at the door, walked us through and showed us how everything worked. The home had good WiFi, an excellent covered deck, and plenty of extra linens and towels.

Communication with the hosts was mixed. There were times when they got back to us immediately, and other times when our texts were not returned.  The house can easily sleep 7 or 8, and the condo 1 or 2. More than that is pretty tight."
44776	606297	8.0	8.0	36361752	We had a group of 10 stay at this house over a weekend.  From the beginning, it was easy to get in touch with Prez.  There was no guess work as everything was laid out in detail.  The whole stay, Prez was a available at all times to answer any questions or concerns.  He just made it easy.  The house was plenty spacious for our group, and never did anyone feel crowded.  It was an overall great stay!  We would definitely look Prez up for another stay!
44777	606297	8.0	8.0	36712093	We had a great, relaxing stay. Prez had ample space for our party of 8, all the amenities you could need, and a great space to hang out and chill. We would definitely stay again when next in Seattle. 
44778	606297	8.0	8.0	41600387	"The beacon hill house was a comfortable place to stay for our large group of people coming in for a conference. 
"
44779	606297	8.0	8.0	41916676	Our stay in Seattle was wonderful.  Prez and Cherie were very helpful and accommodating.  Plenty of room for all 9 of us.  We enjoyed having dinner outdoors on the warm summer evening.  We cooked dinner both evenings and the kitchen was well supplied.  It was easy and convenient to walk to the Light Rail.  Thank you for giving us the hint about taking the Beacon Hill station.
44780	606297	8.0	8.0	43210251	Prez and Cherie could not have been better hosts. They were easy to work with and very accommodating. The apartment was convenient for our wedding venues but might not be as close to Seattle tourist spots. However, the house is darker and older than the photos suggest. Its set up is suitable for younger adults such as college kids but might not be appropriate for families and older adults. Renters should also know that, besides listing the names of each guest, a detailed registration form is required from every guest.
44781	606297	8.0	8.0	44529786	"Prez was really accommodating and very responsive for our needs.
We had a wonderful stay. "
44782	606297	8.0	8.0	45056280	"Prez was very responsive to our requests for changes and assistance with using the facility.  The location is close to Seattle downtown which made visiting sites easy.

We were expecting the property to be more upgraded. The carpeting was stained, in our opinion not clean, and the wood floor in another room in disrepair.  Prez said the carpets are regularly professionally cleaned. There were some other minor Improvements that Prez was willing to take under advisement. Prez indicated to us that they didn't represent the house as five star. The price reflects the quality of the home. If it was more upgraded, it would have cost more.

"
44783	606297	8.0	8.0	45661654	"Prez met us at the house when we arrived, we had an early flight and since we were hours earlier than our check in time Prez & Cherie made it possible for us to drop by and leave our luggage which was quite extensive, as we had 11 in our party.  The house was great and so conveniently located to everything we needed.  The spacious upstairs kitchen was perfect for a group our size and included everything we needed.  We couldn't have asked for a better home to share for our pre-cruise visit to Seattle.  Thank you for your hospitality, Prez & Cherie!
~ Julie, Jeff, Melinda, Rick, Karen, Pat, Tricia, Ken, Scott, Pam & Bill
ps - highly recommend Prez & Cherie and this property!"
44784	606297	8.0	8.0	50457810	Prez houses good location, right next to the city center. Drive to the Space Needle need only 15 minutes. It is not big. It has five rooms, two downstairs, three upstairs. Perhaps it is because the house is too old, it does not quiet. If any one to use the bathroom, then all the people will hear the sound of water.
44785	606297	8.0	8.0	51278992	Had a great experience. The house was in a good location, it was a quick Uber to the stadiums or downtown. There was plenty of room and sleeping space for our large group. We felt the price was very fair for the home. Prez was very responsive and friendly throughout the whole process. I would highly recommend this home for a Seattle stay.
44786	606297	8.0	8.0	56331192	Prez and Cherie were great hosts. The house was perfect for a large group of our size (12). There were plenty of comfortable places to sleep and house was very spacious and well kept. It's 1o minute location from downtown Seattle and Capital Hill was prime. Cherie and Prez were great communicators and made sure we had everything we would need to make our stay the best, as well as providing us with any information they could and answered any questions we had. We had a great evening there and would recommend their services to anyone looking for a great weekend in Seattle.
44787	606297	8.0	8.0	57418339	Prez and Cherie helped our family out last minute due to snow and not being able to get over the pass for Christmas. They had the place ready for us within a few hours and let us check out a little later than normal because they were so accommodating. I would recommend to anyone that needed a big place in the area. 
45061	264829	8.0	8.0	779355	"Keith's place was great. He was very responsive and only one phone call or text away if I needed anything. The place is really close to downtown and in a very central location. There is a parking spot right in front of the location and if you take public transit the bus and light rail stations are close. Keith also operates car & shuttle services so he can pick you up and drop you off at the airport and many other locations. The listing is exactly as it looks like in the photos and def could fit 5 + people comfortably. You can even save money by cooking at home and utilizing the many utensils that Keith provides. I definitely recommend this place. 
"
45062	264829	8.0	8.0	799030	Keith was a gracious host who left me to my privacy after showing me around and passing off the keys. This is a nice private apartment on the downstairs level of his house with it's own private access. The living room is cozy with a comfortable couch and chair. I got great sleep on the full bed and waking up to a kitchen to make breakfast was really great. Nice neighborhood to walk my dog around and it's close to any amenity you may need. I would stay at Keith's place again and recommend it to a friend. 
45063	264829	8.0	8.0	813336	This was a nice place quiet and Keith was very friendly and helpful lots of room off street parking and great pressure in the shower. Thank you Keith.
45064	264829	8.0	8.0	848200	keith went out of his way to make sure we were set up in advance of the stay as well as during.  his place was clean and comfortable with all amenities provided.  we couldn't have asked for more.  you won't be disappointed with his place.   thanks again keith!
45065	264829	8.0	8.0	853544	"The place is really nice, loved the place.
I went there for weekend travel for my friends birthday party.
Since i had separate access, I didn't have to bother Keith at all when i came back at 2 in the morning.
His place is little off from the downtown, where touring area is, but it cost me only $15 including the tip for the drivier to get to the downtown where SAM is.:)"
45066	264829	8.0	8.0	865708	The place was great, clean and comfy. By far the best part of our stay was Keith. He offered great advice on the city and even gave us a ride downtown. I would recommend this place to anyone.
45067	264829	8.0	8.0	926191	Keith and Cherie's place is wonderful and so spacious!  I enjoyed it very much, and Keith was a very warm and hospitable host.  Much appreciated, and I will certainly be requesting to stay at their place aqain, the next time I am in Seattle.  Highly recommended.  
45068	264829	8.0	8.0	933169	Keith is a great host!  He is always available by phone whenever you need him.  His place is not far from downtown and pretty easy access to I-5 and 90.  My husband and I stayed there 3 nights with my parents and 2 babies.  For the cost and awesome service from Keith (who also has a transportation company that you can also use, btw...my parents LOVED!), it's a good deal and place!  I would definitely use again when needing more space while in Seattle!
45069	264829	8.0	8.0	975705	"The apartment was nice and very roomy with 2 bedrooms, a full kitched, a full bath and even a washer/dryer.  The cable TV was extensive and there was a strong wifi signal.  It also had a great location,  It was easy to get to downtown, capital hill,,the U district and to the eastside,  yet it was in a nice, quiet and safe neighborhood.  Keith and Cherie were great to deal with and responsive to our request.  
"
45070	264829	8.0	8.0	994590	The location was great and I hope to stay again. Keith was so friendly and we hope to take the bus tour with his party bus company next time, although we got a feel for it when he showed us around the inside :) They even supply a mini bar of sorts and toiletries to use. My girlfriend had a great time with the face masks and girlie stuff, thanks so much
45071	264829	8.0	8.0	1044792	"Went here for the weekend and took some of our friends with us as well.  Keith was such a great host.  Communication was awesome, you can text the guy anything and he will respond quickly.  Need more paper towels or TP?  Just shoot a text while your out and about and when you come back, everything is restocked!  He even had many suggestions on places to go and seemed to be tied in with many Seattle businesses that that know him and his party bus company.  While we were there we also took advantage of the party bus service.  It was awesome to cruise around Seattle DT in a decked out shuttle bus, the driver was totally a cool guy; even took us to 7-11 for a ""refill.""  We told Keith what nightclub we wanted to go to and he arranged EVERYTHING.  Pick up/drop off time/spot, getting us on the list at the club, etc.  Fully TURNKEY service.  Will def. use the party bus again if we are ever in Seattle, not to mention a return stay in the suite.  All of my friends had a blast, thanks so much Keith"
45072	264829	8.0	8.0	1346182	Great place to stay...Keith is really cool.  Very close to downtown.
45073	264829	8.0	8.0	1364270	My friends and I went to Seattle to watch the Mariner's Game and found this place. The place was nice and cozy.  Also, the neighborhood was quiet. Driving to downtown was not far at all. Keith & Cherie also offered us rides to downtown and to the mariner's game as well. Overall, great place to stay and wonderful hosts. I will definitely stay here again if its available next time we're in Seattle. 
45074	264829	8.0	8.0	1453933	The hosts were nice and the place was clean. The noise in the night from upstairs, particularly in the master bedroom, was horrendous. If you plan to be up for most of the night or if you are a heavy sleeper it would be fine. The kitchen was not well outfitted  so if you plan to cook anything you will need to ask ahead for specific equipment or make do with what is there. 
45075	264829	8.0	8.0	1720984	Keith and Cherie are great!  They were both so friendly and accomodating.  Keith kept checking up on us to make sure we had everything we needed and that we were having a good time.   Keith and Cherie's place is in a very convenient location too since it is only a short drive away from downtown.  The Mount Baker Link rail station was only a 8 minute walk away  which is nice for when we didn't have a car.  I would definitely recommend staying with Keith and Cherie if you're going to visit Seattle.  The place is very cozy and has everything you would need to feel at home during your visit.
45076	264829	8.0	8.0	1739492	"The apartment was basic and nice, and enough for all our needs (family with 4 kids).
Keith and Cherie were lovely - they picked us up from the airport, and helped us get to the city center.
The only point to keep in mind is that it is far from the center - about half an hour each way.
Thank you for a lovely Seattle experience!"
45077	264829	8.0	8.0	1778198	We stayed in Keith and Cherie basement suite for 4 days and 3 nights and had a wonderful time! We fit seven people comfortably and were easily accommodated for any amenities that were not first available in the space. I would definitely recommend staying here! Also, it is quite close to the downtown core and is a really nice area of Seattle to stay (website hidden). They have scrabble. Who doesn't love scrabble?
45078	264829	8.0	8.0	1836037	I hosted a bachelorette party for 6 ladies and Keith and Cherie's basement suite was well euipped for our large group!  I loved that they had a sound system, computer, games and books!  It was really great to have a kitchen with knives/cups/all-the-things-we-didnt-think-about-bringing.  Keith kept in great contact with me and I got to meet he and Cherie.  They were so nice.  We also took advantage of their party bus which was SO FUN!  If you ever need a place or a party bus in Seattle, this is the place to stay!
45079	264829	8.0	8.0	1916619	Needs a very good cleaning and an upgrade to the falling apart furniture. The dresser in the master bedroom was falling to the side, the bunk bed in the 2nd bedroom swayed in the breeze, the shower curtain was full of mold, the kitchen and entire place needs an extensive scrubbing. It looks like someone lives there when its not being rented due to the amount of personal hygene items in the bathroom. The cleaning lady was there the day we checked in and if it was me she would be fired on the spot....what a horrible clean. We also had no cable which would have been nice to watch after long days with our kids taking in the sites and sounds of Seattle. After making a complaint Keith came down and tried to reset the cable box and then left saying he would come back down in a little bit to check, to which he did not. I sent a text the following morning after we had left stating it was disappointing. To his credit he did phone the cable company who was unable to fix the issue so he set up his computer and we were able to watch netflix when we came back that night. He also came down with a card and some cheesecake to appologize.  Now if that was the only issue with the place I could have accepted it, however it was just the icing on the cake. He asked if there was anything he could do and I said that I'd like to know what happens on Big brother that night, he said sure no problem. Needless to say I didnt hear anything from him. The pictures on the site need to be updated as the place looks different then the pictures on this site. There is no entertainment unit, there is no chair at what would appear to be a table. The yard was also littered in garbage and junk. We never did meet Cherie.  Keith was a very nice guy though and very personable. 
45080	264829	8.0	8.0	1968699	Keith & Cherie were very kind hosts - provided extra pillows when we requested them, arranged travel service for a night out and were very courteous of our privacy. The apartment itself was not quite the fully private experience I imagined - you definitely are living below a household and can hear it and the pictures are a bit deceiving as to the apartment's size & quality of furnishing - but it was a great value and in a convenient location for getting downtown. 
45081	264829	8.0	8.0	2190345	Great location (close to light rail), quiet neighborhood.
45082	264829	8.0	8.0	2639763	"Convenient location, nice quiet neighborhood. My first stay at an AirBnB so I wasn't sure what to expect. Not the 'Hotel experience"" if that's what you are looking for. The place is sort of a basement apartment, it's nice enough but still needs a little bit of work to be called a Suite. Great if you're going out on the town with a few friends but wasn't perfect for my six day stay with family. Would've liked the porch cleared of stored clutter so we could've possibly had a backyard BBQ. Just my personal preference I guess. Overall the hosts were accommodating and friendly."
45083	264829	8.0	8.0	2694777	The So Journ Sistas enjoyed our stay at the Asphy Inner City Suite.  The location is perfect it allowed us to drive wherever we desired easily.  The  host were very kind and helped us navigate Seattle.  The accomodations were clean and well stocked.  We recommend the Inner City Suite highly!!
45084	264829	8.0	8.0	2882205	We had an excellent time staying at the Private Inner City Suite. The space was clean and quiet. Keith and Cherie were very helpful, always ready with a recommendation of a place to eat and things to do while we were in town. It was about a 10 minute drive to downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill from the suite. We would definitely stay here again!
45085	264829	8.0	8.0	2917293	I and several friends stayed for the weekend. A great place to stay, quiet and clean, close to where we needed or wanted to be, kind and informative hosts. 
45086	264829	8.0	8.0	3162794	"Spent a week with the family in December - 2 parents, 2 adult children. Apartment was serviceable, and hosts were very friendly and accommodating. The only thing preventing a more favorable rating is the unit itself. 

The unit is the remodeled basement of a small house. The walls and ceilings are thin and poorly insulated, so privacy is an issue. The beds (especially the upper bunk bed) are uncomfortable. The thermostat is controlled by the upstairs unit, so any adjustments require a call to the hosts.

The unit is located in the Beacon Hill area, which is south of the city center. The nearest light rail station is a pretty good hike away, so plan on renting a car (and paying the outrageous Seattle parking rates).

With cable, wireless internet, plenty of hot water, a full kitchen, and separate bedrooms, this unit is a lot better than camping, but it's not the Ritz either."
45087	264829	8.0	8.0	3523537	Really cool couple, great place super close to the heart of Seattle and a good time! you feel private in your own space and if you need anything its just a text away. They are nice and welcoming, and very considerate and communicative. Thanks for all that! 
45088	264829	8.0	8.0	5105412	Prez and Cherie were great hosts and easily reachable. They even gave us a few beers on the house. The apartment is clean and comfortable and an easy drive into downtown Seattle.
45089	264829	8.0	8.0	5630548	"Prez & Cherie were very accommodating on such short notice.  Prez got back to me the same day and communicated with us throughout our stay. He even gave us some helpful tips to help us get around Seattle.  The place was spacious and clean with lots of great natural light! We'll def contact them when we visit Seattle again and hope they come stay at our place!
"
45090	264829	8.0	8.0	5806327	Prez was extremely accommodating and helpful.  He kept in touch with us throughout our visit.  The condo worked perfectly for our family of 5.  We enjoyed the walk through Beacon Hill to the light rail station.  Our favorite morning stop was the Station coffee shop.  Wish we could have stayed longer!
45091	264829	8.0	8.0	5873346	Great hosts, a perfect stay.
45092	264829	8.0	8.0	6141187	Cherie was a great host, very very helpful and prompt. Even helped us to arrange for transportation the next day as we needed to get somewhere. The apartment was good for a night's stay, clean and probably what you need for a comfortable sleep. Could use with an bigger fan though as it was an abnormally hotter summer than usual in Seattle (well, at least that was what i was told) Its about a 10 minute walk to the nearby train to town. That was a plus. Its a pretty quiet neighborhood and the paths aren't really well done, so its not somewhere to take walks and etc. But besides that, it was a good stay. 
45093	264829	8.0	8.0	6165176	Great place!  Pretty basic, but clean and comfortable, which is exactly what we were looking for.  Thanks so much
45094	264829	8.0	8.0	6926043	Prez and Cherie were awesome host! They definitely inspired us to step up our Airbnb hosting. Their place was comfortable and exactly what we expected. They were very responsive. We can tell they take great pride in their space. 
45095	264829	8.0	8.0	8177875	"Prez and Cherie were very gracious and friendly. The place is really nice and a short walk to the lite rail and convenient to buses. Prez is very generous in the apartment with accouterments. The drive into town isn't bad either. When we were in a pinch on having to wait six hours between his check out time and the check in time of our next location, he graciously gave us more time.
Our snafu was that we contracted for a different unit (3000 23rd)  for nine days through Airbnb, and Prez said that he had to put us in a different place on Stevens and that the unit was already rented for the weekend in the midst of our stay. He put us up in a motel (and a substandard one at that) for the weekend. My wife is receiving chemo, is blind and diabetic, and we came from out of town with our car loaded for a three-month stay. It was very hard on us to move so many times when we contracted one place for the duration of nine days. Prez was remorseful and refunded $100 dollars, helped us move in the second time, but it didn't seem to be worth the inconvenience. I don't understand how airbnb and the housing owner could not be on the same page. It was all last minute for us, so we felt we had no recourse but to go along with it."
45096	264829	8.0	8.0	14841811	Good location since it is close to the train. Everything was as expected.
45097	264829	8.0	8.0	15995325	Prez is a great host. The place was comfortable.
45098	264829	8.0	8.0	16276164	"Properties were as described. Prez had very clear communication and very thorough ""getting to know you"" process including filling out a guest registration for each guest. Very smart as an owner/manager but an extra step in the reservation process. Prez was timely, accommodating and completely professional. The lower level unit really can hear any tenants in the floors above (this is disclosed by Prez prior to rental). Did not bother me as I can sleep through anything but one of our guests had issue with being woken up. Prez, thank you for your hospitality."
45099	264829	8.0	8.0	19653777	The house was ready when arrived. The host was flexible with our arrival time and one we arrived there the check-in process was easy and straight forward. The neighborhood was convenient and comfortable for my family to stay in. The house was accurately described in the pictures available online.
45100	264829	8.0	8.0	19863316	Great host. This was a last minute trip, and they let me in very fast and were very accommodating. I would recommend.
45910	7634011	8.0	9.0	41692007	This was a quiet, peaceful neighborhood one block and a half from the Mountains-to-Sound trail which was great for running in the mornings.  It was also within walking distance from Capitol Hill and the restaurants and other attractions in the area.  Jeremy was a great host, providing amenities and asking if anything else could be done or provided.  Jeremy respected our privacy, but made himself available when needed.  This made our first trip to the Pacific Northwest most enjoyable.
45911	7634011	8.0	9.0	42625488	The house was very nice and well equipped, we really liked the neighborhood with a lovely park just down the block and a short walk to a bridge with a great view of the bay and the city
45912	7634011	8.0	9.0	43145330	The place was very clean with fresh paint and not too far from the main downtown area. Enjoyed my stay in Seattle!
45913	7634011	8.0	9.0	45398675	"The house was roomier than we expected, it was very convenient to downtown and the light rail.
The neighborhood is tucked away and very private and quiet.
We had everything we needed in the house, extra towels, blankets, etc!
"
45914	7634011	8.0	9.0	45611857	Great place and great host
45915	7634011	8.0	9.0	46920473	The home rests in a quiet, safe neighborhood that is also conveniently close to downtown Seattle, hiking trails, good food and the city.
45916	7634011	8.0	9.0	47333698	Was able to accommodate on extremely short notice. The location was a trip saver. The house was comfortable and clean. The host was a quick communicator as well. Very recommended.
45917	7634011	8.0	9.0	47438463	The house was not clean when I arrived, the beds were not made, and it smelled like Marijuana. Jeremy did not answer when I called. My group made the best of the situation, and Jeremy offered a refund, but this was not the best of airbnb experiences for me.
45918	7634011	8.0	9.0	47942686	House was very clean and instructions were easy.  Thanks Jeremy!
45919	7634011	8.0	9.0	48484980	"The house was dirty every where when we arrived. The owner promised let me get a refund, but he didn't do that at last. 
"
45920	7634011	8.0	9.0	48601717	It was very welcoming. The neighborhood was a little shady though. I would definitely stay there again, the price was good :) 
45921	7634011	8.0	9.0	49827735	Easy instructions, great location,  and an all around great place to stay if passing through with a family or small group. We really enjoyed our stay at Jeremy's!  Thanks for the hospitality.
45922	7634011	8.0	9.0	50422438	Nice place. Jeremy gave me all the information I needed and just let me and my family do our thing. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Everything I needed was there. Thank you and would recommend :)
45923	7634011	8.0	9.0	51187436	"Definitely an awesome place to stay at, used uber and the train system to get around.
I would definitely consider this place again when I come back to visit Seattle."
45924	7634011	8.0	9.0	52314369	Jeremy was easy to communicate, and the place was nice and clean when we arrived. Nice cozy place to stay, every thing in the listed discription was prepared. I would stay here again !
45925	7634011	8.0	9.0	52563467	This place was great. Got in on really short notice and everything was very clean and hospitable. Easy access to getting around town and very quiet. 
45926	7634011	8.0	9.0	52648807	Jeremy made us feel very welcomed and comfortable. He made himself available for any questions we had. The home is amazing and very comfortable. Shower nice and hot at a great pressure. Rooms are very cozy and the design of the home is really unique and fun. Great attic. Equipped with everything you could need. 
45927	7634011	8.0	9.0	53788152	Very cozy place, chill neighbourhood. Excellent place if you do not mind walking to the trendier areas of Seattle. Jeremy is quick to respond to questions and provided easy instructions. My friends and I all felt at home, would definitely recommend this spot.
45928	7634011	8.0	9.0	54303341	My friends and I needed a place to crash after a work meeting in SODO and Jeremy's place was super convenient. Jeremy was easy to communicate with and everything went swimmingly!
45929	7634011	8.0	9.0	55107566	"Booking this property was very easy, and Jeremy was great for accommodating our family's situation/needs! The house was simple and spacious, had a lot of character, and was great for 6 folks.  Location is great, too!

Unfortunately, we we very dissatisfied with the condition of the house; it was under-stocked and unclean. Specifically:

-  Only two windows had shades, so a general lack of privacy and light blocking. 
-  One of the beds lacked a comforter (it had a couch throw/small blanket), so we had to borrow bedding from friends in town in order for two adults to have enough cover for sleeping in the double bed
-  We had to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels (there was one partial roll of each, for 6 adults over 4 nights)
-  There were wadded up hairballs in the corners of the bathroom, by the tub
-  The tub had not been scrubbed, and was covered in a dull coating of soap scum
-  The dishwasher had clearly been run with dish soap (instead of detergent), and was filled with sudsy water. We drained and toweled it out about 10 times, then ran the rinse cycle several more (it took most of a day to get it cleaned). This would have been noticed had the cleaning team opened it before we arrived.
-  We even tried to clean a bit, and found no vacuum for the area rug in the front room (rugs need to be vacuumed, not just swept).

Finally, there was no contact with Jeremy when we were there, even when I inquired about the internet password. We would have appreciated a response to solicited help. 

I really hate to leave bad reviews; I am usually very flexible and happy to stay in places of varying conditions, but this one was just too much."
45930	7634011	8.0	9.0	56651862	"The house was simply amazing. Everything inside was beautiful, I would consider buying the house I liked it so much. Everyone who entered said he same, ""wow where did you find this!"". I'm very thankful Jeremy were able to renting for us so quickly and easily. He was pleasant the whole time, a wonderful experience for my friends birthday! Thank you Jeremy."
45931	7634011	8.0	9.0	56988165	Nice house. enjoyable and comfortable
45932	7634011	8.0	9.0	57470079	The house was just what we expected, charming and easy. However, we never actually stayed there as my son's friends made us comfortable at their home. 
45933	7634011	8.0	9.0	57786792	Absolutely perfect location. House was still being developed but had all the necessary comforts.
48218	4384000	8.0	10.0	57810604	The house is beautiful and in a nice neighborhood. There is a great view from the living room and from the master upstairs. The listing states that there are 4 beds and that it accommodates 5 people, but we only found 3 beds(a king and two twin beds). Micheal was friendly and walked me through using the tv/cable set up and thermostat use, though for future guests it would be nice to have written notes for things like that.
50889	8391954	8.0	9.0	54175828	Kaitlyn's house was perfect for a weekend in Seattle!  The view was great and it was only a $10 Uber ride to and from downtown.  The house was clean, the heater heated up the house quickly, and the living room was comfortable.  
50890	8391954	8.0	9.0	55017353	"This house is comfortable and gorgeous. Lovely decor and an incredible view. Recommend it. 

Working with the hosts was a breeze and we'd stay again. "
50891	8391954	8.0	9.0	55236654	Nice place, great views.  We had a great time hanging out there, it was very comfortable.  Kaitlyn was quick in response when we had questions.    
52009	4716486	8.0	9.0	45754729	This was my first time using Airbnb. I was not disappointed. Being it that Judd has no previous reviews, I'm under the assumption that this is his first time hosting. Regardless, Judd provided great service. He picked up my phone calls and was punctual on responses/replies. Left us notes for any concerns that we might have about the home. Would recommend using Judd and his home to book a stay. Very flexible, lenient and down to Earth. 
52010	4716486	8.0	9.0	50355197	Cute quirky house - near the beautiful Seward Park. 
52011	4716486	8.0	9.0	51864424	"Judd was an amazing host! He really cares about the people that stay at the house and it felt very welcoming. The house was charming and it did feel like ""home"". I would stay again if in Seattle, what a gem! "
52012	4716486	8.0	9.0	53237614	The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
52013	4716486	8.0	9.0	55249722	My husband and I were in town from Portland for the weekend to run the marathon at Seward Park. This little house served our needs perfectly. It is definitely funky and quirky, but it is warm and cozy and a close walk to the lake. Judd was a great host and his instructions for the house were easy to follow. 
52014	4716486	8.0	9.0	56463064	We had a great stay here! It is definitely a bit like house sitting for a friend who happens to have an older house (right down to the bathroom door that sometimes locks itself and the interesting tilted floors), and it's a fun space to spend time in. We had fun watching netflix and playing with one of the guitars hanging on the walls (picks provided in a dish on the coffee table) while nibbling on thoughtfully provided candy and watching the dogs snore by our feet. Fun little space!
52015	7386675	8.0	10.0	41002456	This house was a prefect fit for my family!  Todd has a beautiful small (although felt much bigger than it was due to the layout) house near a dead end street overlooking Lake Washington and Seward Park.  The windows from the dining room had a fantastic view!  Todd has 3 young kids (so do we), and there were lots of toys in the kid's room (3 small beds) along with a train table, which made my kids feel right at home.  Outside there is a wooden play house/fort on the side yard, chicken coop with swing attached, and vegetable planters.  The highlight for our kids was probably the ramp that rolled a ride on top car down the hill in the back yard.  They probably did that 100 times each.  :)  There is no TV, but none of us really realized it, we were too busy planning our next outing, and the kids were too busy playing.  We were there over SeaFair weekend, and the location couldn't have been much better.  We could see the airshow going on out the front window, and hear the hydroplanes.  We took a quick 5 minute walk down the stairs at the end of the street and ended up at the bike path along Lake Washington.  We didn't even get a chance to explore Seward Park, but it is right there.  All the amenities you would really need, in a nice, clean, comfortable house with great views and a safe, semi-ritzy neighborhood.  We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights!  Thank you Todd for letting us borrow your house! 
54851	9157232	8.0	6.0	54285007	Tania and her father a veer accommodating. Tania father is very knowledgable about the area and gave me some great advice. The hostess quickly responded to my text. Very kind and honest host. Room is comfortable and the full kitchen is a nice addition.  I would recommend a stay with Tania anytime. 
55148	1541705	8.0	9.0	6999744	"This place might be ideal for guys who doesn't care cleanness of the house and who are JUST looking for a place to sleep in the night. For me it was okay as I was out most of the day and came back late to sleep and also 24 hour Macdonald is 10-15 mins walk distance.

Basic facilities to live like a human are working fine. You could cook in the kitchen as they had many kitchen utensils. But to ladies it might not be ideal as you will be sharing the house with other 3 + guests mostly, if not all, guys in the house and some of them stayed there for more than a month. Also as I could not lock bathroom door, I had to put chairs behind the door when I had showers. Bathroom basin was a bit weird. It seems it was not completely blocked. But didn't go down until some level and that level was quite high so it looked like blocked...but I don't know maybe it was block. Anyway I used a kitchen basin to brush my teeth.

The room itself is better than other common places in the house. You will have a separate outdoor entrance door. So you will have two keys so you could lock both entrance door and door to the inside of the house. It is really spacious. 2 people can stay without any problem. Internet speed was okay. I was able to stream videos without difficulties. "
55149	1541705	8.0	9.0	7805528	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
55150	1541705	8.0	9.0	9724672	Melissa was a very accommodating host.  She went above and beyond what a typical airbnb host would do.  The location was a little out of the way for me, but the room was good and very quiet considering other members of the house. 
55151	1541705	8.0	9.0	9969719	Melissa met all of my expectations. The room was quiet and comfortable. It was close to shopping, bus stops. No complaints.
55152	1541705	8.0	9.0	11147057	"Melissa Yao is not a host, in my experience.  She wrote a couple of days before my trip to ask what time I would arrive.  I wrote back a detailed message with arrival date which ended with the statement  ""According to the trip planner I should be at the airBnb by about 9:30 pm. Will that be OK?""   Her response was ""Good to know"".  I arrived in the rain at the time I predicted, knocked on the locked front door, found no host, called Melissa and received no answer.  Finally I went to the back of the house, found an unlocked door, and wandered around knocking on closed doors till I found a resident who was willing to help me.  He also was unable to text or call Melissa but took me around the house to find an empty room ( the one I was knocking on before) and suggested that it seemed available.  Two hours later (around midnight) Melissa responded with a text message ""is this Sid?""  after I was settled in, no thanks to her.

A simple message ""Come to the back, your room is number 3, and the keys are in a specified place.  We'll get together later during your stay""  would have saved me a lot of anxiety.  "" Good to know"" is not the response of a host.

The stay was otherwise uneventful.  An electrician and a plumber was called to the house to fix problems during my stay.  The room is as described, the other tenants are somewhat quiet.

Sid Coon"
55153	1541705	8.0	9.0	11379870	I had a fun time staying at Melissa's and meeting the other guests. Thanks!

I strongly recommend this room. Melissa is very kindly and open. Check in and out were easy."
55155	1541705	8.0	9.0	17221120	"Melissa was an awesome host! She helped with everything I needed, including finding an iron and an ironing board. One day she even brought apples from her tree at home!

The room is as described, clean with a bed and private entry. Facilities are clean and kitchen is equipped with most basic utensils. Checking in was a breeze (Recommend following check-in procedure to the letter). Neighborhood is quiet, and centrally located.

The room is not well isolated from the sounds in the rest of the house. The roommates are not necessarily quiet (loud TV, creaky floors). They are NOT partiers, and don't play loud music or otherwise cause a ruckus. These noises can typically fade into the background, or be ignored with earplugs/headphones. 

Would highly recommend this listing. I had a fantastic stay!"
55156	1541705	8.0	9.0	18899474	The room was good for the price. Convenient location. House was a little noisy during the night on the weekend but overall very quiet. 
55157	1541705	8.0	9.0	21203089	"Pros: Private entry/porch. This is especially nice if you receive a lot of packages in the mail like I do. Nice hardwood floors, large room. Plenty of storage. Free washer and dryer and the dryer is a VERY nice one! 

Cons: Where do I start? I guess my biggest issue was that it says on AirBNB "" We have cleaning people to clean the kitchen and bathroom biweekly. We always keep it clean."" I thought this meant it would be cleaned twice a week, but when I asked Melissa she said that meant every two weeks. A house full of men only being cleaned every two weeks - I don't need to spell it out. After a few days the bathroom would get VERY DIRTY to the point I just started using the one downstairs which tended to be slightly cleaner. Cannot stress enough how gross the bathroom was - urine and hair all over the toilet. So you can either clean up after other grown ass men who should know better, or deal with the nastiness. 

The kitchen never seemed to be cleaned either - the trash was taken out yes but that seemed to be the extent of it. Again I had to go and clean up after the other tenants who would leave their dishes piled in the dish rack and never put them back in their place. There seemed to be a layer of grime covering everything in the kitchen. Definitely didn't use any forks or bowls unless I washed them first. Moths and spiders in the cabinets. 

People left the lights on at night which is not only wasteful but it attracted moths and all kinds of bugs and I was always bombarded by them in the mornings when I was making my breakfast and lunch. The tenant beside me would play the tv/computer super loud at night so I got hardly any sleep during my stay. I could hear every word even with ear plugs in. After putting up with it a couple nights I asked him to turn it down and he didn't - I had to contact the owner and get her to ask him and finally he did, but only for a few days and it started again. 

Room #3 has one large wall that doesn't go all the way up to the ceiling. There is some foam padding stuffed up there but I still feel like it was not very private. It didn't provide a very good noise barrier and there were cracks where bugs would get through from the kitchen. 

Also I'm pretty sure my bed sheets had not been washed before I arrived. The floor was also dirty and had not been vacuumed before my arrival. "
55158	1541705	8.0	9.0	25645220	I love the room that feels like home with the porch outside.  Melissa came over to help me get settled.  The location is so convenient! I will definitely return again!
55159	1541705	8.0	9.0	28270574	great place！nice landlord！thank u
55160	1541705	8.0	9.0	28894298	This house was off the main arterials, so very little car traffic, yet it was an easy walk to the University of Washington campus.  The other students who live there were very nice and helpful.  I plan on using this venue again soon.
55161	1541705	8.0	9.0	31113577	"This is a beautiful room in a nice house. The room was much bigger than it looked, very comfortable for me and my stuff. The housemates were very respectful and the house was quiet most of the time. I will say that there was some construction/maintenance going on both next  door and in the house. While not totally under the host's control, this did make for some loud mornings.

There is something of a dearth of space in the kitchen, but it was never super problematic.

Melissa was very easy to communicate with, responded very quickly and was very respectful and pleasant. We didn't run into each other very often but I never had any issues that went unresolved. I had a problem with an electrical outlet in my room and it was fixed the next day! Thanks!"
56348	1950446	8.0	9.0	9351766	This loft was spacious and has a homey feel to it...very comfortable Loved the place!
56349	1950446	8.0	9.0	9505266	Although I did not get the chance to meet Anie, the place we stayed at was just as advertised. It was a great space for 7 people with ample space for sleep. We enjoyed our stay here!
56350	1950446	8.0	9.0	10139666	The apartment was very bare-bones and didn't have any kitchenware which made it impossible to do anything at the apartment, such as heat water.  The heat in the apartment was not intuitive and there weren't any instructions (or very many blankets), so it was VERY cold.  There were beds for 4 people, which was nice. The parking was very useful and Gavin was quick to respond to texts and emails. This was my first airbnb experience and it was just okay. I don't think I would rent this apartment again unless it was summer time.
56351	1950446	8.0	9.0	10213638	"This is apartment is adorable! There were 4 of us and it was a great size and very comfortable. Plus, Gavin was able to get it ready for us on just a few hours notice which was wonderful.

Pros: 
- lots of character 
- very clean
- GORGEOUS view 
- easy access to the freeway
- lock box for getting/depositing keys (quick and simple!)

Cons:
- no internet
- designated parking spot is difficult to get into
- on a very busy street
- no cooking utensils to heat water or anything on the stove 

Overall, it was perfect for a quick stay and gave me a chance to see a part of Seattle other than the usual tourist stops."
56352	1950446	8.0	9.0	10328155	Gavin is very responsive and will work with you to make sure you have a great stay!
56353	1950446	8.0	9.0	10868184	"The place was convenient for us to go into Downtown Seattle and not costly. 

Had a good time and place to stay. "
56354	1950446	8.0	9.0	10910933	This apartment was perfect!  Its located close to everything, the location definitely cannot be beat.  It was exactly as pictured and described.  Wifi worked great and kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook/eat with.  We slept so well in the dark bedrooms with blackout curtains.  We would definitely stay here again!
56355	1950446	8.0	9.0	10987871	The place was exactly what we had expected when looking for places to stay in Seattle.  We had a party of 6 and there was plenty of space for everyone.  The view from the patio was just astounding and a great introduction to the city.  The location was perfect, we were close to restaurants and the waterfront, as well as a short drive to downtown and other parts of Seattle.  The keyless entry and the fully stocked kitchen were great additions for our group to get settled in.  Definite recommended place to stay in Seattle.  Great host who was easy to communicate with, great location to explore all parts of Seattle, and the place felt like a home away from home.
56356	1950446	8.0	9.0	11034679	We absolutely loved staying at Gavin's property. It was the perfect size for the 4 of us, loved the porch, and great location. Thank you, Gavin! 
56357	1950446	8.0	9.0	11361482	Great location in the Eastlake area. A native of Seattle myself I was happy to see the place was up the street from my favorite spots (Zoo Bar and Vox Coffee). Front room gets a bit chilly, but rest of house is warm. Perfect place for Spring vacations. Great view from the patio. Front of house faces freeway, but sound is more soothing than anything. Make sure you have a compact car if you plan to use the parking spot, bit of a squeeze!
56358	1950446	8.0	9.0	11621880	The rooms are very spacious! The location is just so great. Though not a walkable distant to pike place, it's a great location to explore Seattle city area by your own car since it's just next to Lake Union with free parking lot in front of the house. Very quiet. Gavin didn't show up but it was great in a sense that v could get in and get out of the accommodation freely without feeling guilty to interrupt the owner or other guests in the middle of the night or in the early morning. Kitchenware is all equipped. Highly recommend for all young travelers whose bio-clock is uncommon or elderly who want to stay in quiet place and easy access to the city for just a few minutes drive.
56359	1950446	8.0	9.0	11663726	"We found the apartment to be bright and airy but smaller than it appeared and not very clean. The kitchen floor was sticky (spilled juice from previous guests didn't get mopped). Living room floor was not vacuumed. Bathroom had no toilet paper (luckily there was a box of Kleenex around). We found a note by the door saying towels were in the dryer in the basement. A glass vase on the high table was cracked with sharp, jagged rims. Kitchen was well stocked for eating take-out food, but not for cooking. We planned to make pasta for 8 people (apt's max occupancy) but only found a tiny pot (less than 6 inches wide) with no lid. 

It's located right next to I-5 -- be prepared for traffic background noise. Navigating our mini-van around a low brick wall to get into the parking space was also quite tricky.  

I'm not sure if we'd go back unless housekeeping improved significantly.  "
56360	1950446	8.0	9.0	11998087	Perfect apartment for our stay in Seattle. Very easy to get around by bus, taxi or Uber. There are some cute little bars/restaurants right down the road as well. I would definitely recommend staying here! 
56361	1950446	8.0	9.0	12563196	This home is located in a great proximity to the city and is only a short cab ride downtown.  Parking is quite easy to find in addition to the driveway parking.  Bring ear plugs as this house is very close to the highway and can be quite noisy (especially if you are used to sleeping in a quiet room)  Kitchen does not have any staples - so if you plan on cooking, bring your own supplies.
56362	1950446	8.0	9.0	12844368	Great place to crash after a day of exploring the city. Note that it is literally right next to the highway but the view from the balcony looks out the other way toward the lakes. Really enjoyed our stay!
56363	1950446	8.0	9.0	12999511	"We were a group of 8 who stayed in the apartment for 2 nights. Overall, the place wasn't too bad but compared to other places I've stayed at through airbnb, this wasn't the best. 

Pros: 
-easy keyless check in and check out
-location (Eastlake, just north of Capitol hill): near a lake and near lots of public transportation and coffee shops. 
-back porch: amazing view of lake union
Cons:
-location: front of house faces the highway which makes for traffic noise at night. 
-parking spot: good for a compact car but we had difficulty maneuvering our SUV around the low brick wall. Only the smaller SUV would fit. The other bigger SUV would not. In the description, it said there was ample street parking for a 2nd car, but all the street parking that I saw required a residential permit. I finally got in contact with Gavin's cleaning lady Pushpa, who offered a parking spot at a church parking alot across the highway near one of her properties. It was great that they were able to solve our parking dilemma but it was also inconvenient to have to walk 10 min. across a highway to get to one of the cars. 
-cleanliness: 3 stars. It wasn't overtly dirty, but there was mold in the shower and cheerios under one of the mattresses of the bed and the sofa. 
-communication: strangely enough, I could never get a hold of Gavin when we had an issue (1. parking when we checked in, 2. when we planned to stay there a few days later and it was double-booked). I mostly communicated with Pushpa, who was very willing to help but didn't seem to be in communication with Gavin. 

We also had the dilemma that we tried to book another night there a few days later which was difficult to do through airbnb. When I talked to Gavin about it, he said not to worry about it and that it would be okay and he would hold the place for us. By the time we were there, he had booked other people to stay the night we werent there and had double-booked us for the other night. Then they wanted to offer us another place that was double the cost. The whole exchange was very shady and we finally just opted to get a hotel instead. 

This place is nice and probably okay if you don't mind noise and don't have a huge car with you. But if anything goes wrong, it might be difficult to get it sorted out with the owners. "
56364	1950446	8.0	9.0	13195778	"房东的回复很迅速，房间干净，床舒服，虽然紧靠5号高速公路，但房间隔音很好，晚上睡觉很安静。
有一个大阳台，在厨房和阳台上可以看湖景，视野极好。
厨房很方便，但烧开水只能用咖啡机，我自己带了热水壶。

The landlord replies very quickly, the rooms are clean and comfortable. Although the house is beside the highway, it is still quiet at night and we slept well. There is a big balcony with a great view outside. There is only free parking for an hour near the house, if  you want to park over night I'd recommend parking at 2244 Eastlake Ave E Seattle, WA 98102."
56365	1950446	8.0	9.0	13238229	I would of liked to have known there was issues with certain things. The internet was shotty and the dryer didn't work. I had communicated with Gavin asking about where the dryer was located. He informed me that it might not be working. I would of liked to have known these things prior to arrival so I could better accommodate my needs. Other than those things Gavin was prompt to getting back to me and helpful with my questions and the house was a nice place to stay. I'd stay again. 
56366	1950446	8.0	9.0	13351580	The listing was as expected and Gavin was totally and quickly responsive to our questions.  The location, while it can be noisy with the freeway (though it quickly became white noise so did not interfere with sleeping), was terrific; two short blocks from Eastlake's lovely restaurants and coffee (Voxx).  We had a car and  driving around the city was very convenient from Boylston, and though we didn't use it the bus service downtown on Eastlake would be very convenient as well.  We were a group of 4 adults and felt the apartment was roomy and comfortable.
56367	1950446	8.0	9.0	13813346	the house is (website hidden) the eastlake,and.great view.the kitchen is ok,the bedroom r much better,the.traffic is.nice,near to downtown
56368	1950446	8.0	9.0	14092961	Great location with access to key points in and around Seattle. Gavin was responsive to us through text. The parking space was very difficult to get into, even with a smaller car. The bathroom is filled with mold, and the shower is very awkward to use The place was clean on the surface, but dust bunnies and dirt lurked in all corners and under furniture. Overall we would stay here again, but only if the place received a thorough cleaning. 
56369	1950446	8.0	9.0	15138189	"Since we arrived in the US we have stayed in several AirBNB places. I always thought maybe we’d get a dud and this place is it!
Gavin was pretty hard to reach but was accommodating once we got ahold of him and Pushpa was easy to reach but needed 24 hours notice..

I will list the top problems ( there are more);
1)      Dirty sheets (That’s just unprofessional and unhygenic).Stains…hair. 
2)      No toilet paper on arrival
3)      1 x tiny pot that you can probably cook an egg in
4)      No kettle to boil water
5)      Dirty Fridge ( all iced up and bits of food)
6)      No microwave
8)      Dirty bath - black scum marks
9)      The entrance way and hall way was caked on dirt (probably from the freeway).
10)   When I rang the manager to tell her we had no toilet paper she said she would drop some around tomorrow. We found a supermarket and bought our own.

Its a  shame as the actual apartment / location is fine ( location OK, Space OK, view OK)…its just really really dirty and has no basic essentials. ( Kettle, Loo paper...a couple of pots..clean sheets!!)

Outdoor furniture on the balcony would also be really great so we could sit and enjoy the view!

"
56370	1950446	8.0	9.0	15526249	This place is close to the bus lines, so transportation was easy.  We watched the fireworks from our balcony, which was excellent.  It was a pretty easy stay.  Everything worked okay, and Pushpa, the girl who took care of any questions we had was attentive.
56371	1950446	8.0	9.0	15908902	"The house is nicely situated by Lake Union. The transit was close to home making all parts of Seattle very accessible for us. The house itself is a nice older craftsman style home that has great charm at first look. 

I enjoyed the city of Seattle very much. However, our short stay was met with abnormally hot weather. While I can usually tolerate mid-nineties weather, we were fairly uncomfortable throughout our stay due to the lack of air-conditioning within the home. When the weather dropped to cooler temperatures, we could open the windows but could not sleep due to the proximity of the home to the freeway (in front of the house). Even with the windows closed, we could hear the roars of every car as it zoomed by on the expressway. To compensate, we slept in the living room (the room furthest away from the noise source) until the traffic and the temperature were compromising (~3am).

The home would be fine during cooler months. I did like how the home looks and the beds were fairly comfy. However, the home needs new windows to dampen the sound at the very least and a portable swamp cooler when the summer temps get above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. "
56372	1950446	8.0	9.0	16075721	The pictures on the website far exceed the interior condition of this unit.  The floors were filthy, the tub was dirty, there were no screens on the windows except for one bedroom and no a/c.  Some windows were painted shut and could not be lifted.  The unit needed airing out! My daughter had to wrap her pillows with sheets since there weren't any pillow cases on them.  The closets had dust balls and garbage from previous renters.  5 towels were provided for 3 nights- no washcloths or hand towels were provided.  The sleeper sofa was in very poor condition and the upholstery of both sofas was filthy.  There were no privacy curtains or shades on the bathroom window and there were houses with views right next door.  We were charged a cleaning fee, but it was quite apparent that the unit had not been thoroughly cleaned prior to our arrival.  We had just come from a VRBO rental for 3 days and this unit paled in comparison.  Mr. Walker has a lot to learn about how to make guests feel comfortable and welcome in this unit.  We couldn't wait to leave each day.  That is not how a vacation should make people feel.
56373	1950446	8.0	9.0	16540524	The apartment was exactly as described. Totally worth the price and the location is great! Great view from the deck. Right off Hwy 5, easy to find and close to downtown and Lake Union. We slept 5 adults comfortably. I'd recommend this place. Thanks Gavin! 
56374	1950446	8.0	9.0	16651212	"Gavin was quick to respond to any questions that we had.  He made it easy to get into the property with detailed instructions.  
The property was in a good location for what we wanted to see and do.  We were able to walk a few blocks to catch a bus to Pike Place.  There were a few restaurants that we were also able to walk to and two grocery stores.
The only warning I would share with potential guests as that the property is located on a busy street and right next to the interstate.  We found it very loud.
We were disappointed that there wasn't any patio furniture as we were looking forward to sharing a drink on the deck after our children went to bed."
56375	1950446	8.0	9.0	17142465	"The best part about this place is the location. The neighborhood was great to walk around in & it was easy enough to get in/out with our (small) car, with quick access to anywhere in the city. The inside of the house itself was OK, but certainly not the best or cleanest. We stayed during one of the hottest weeks of the year & we could only find one fan, so it was a bit difficult to fall asleep each night.

Gavin & Pushpa were both very nice & easy to get a hold of, and while it wasn't the best place I've ever stayed, it suited our needs just fine."
56376	1950446	8.0	9.0	17243778	Awesome location, and we really loved the balcony with views over the lake. Great place, thanks Gavin!
56377	1950446	8.0	9.0	17399521	"House was as described and fit our needs perfectly for a quick overnight stay. We actually didn't meet Gavin but he was very easy to deal with through messaging always responding very quickly. Nice area of town, couple of cool coffee shops down the hill to the water.  Only $12 taxi ride to downtown, so pretty close.
Thanks"

As we did have a car the apartment was conveniently located off the freeway with a parking space and SO SO close to where we wanted to be. 
Upon arriving we took a stroll in the area and found a great playground for the kids to play and closer to the apartment a great pizza restaurant and convenience store for snacks. 
Gavin was quick to respond with all and any questions.
Cleanliness was 3 out of 5 which is a bummer since we are charged for cleaning service. :-/

56379	1950446	8.0	9.0	18396009	Our stay was a pleasant one in this very spacious and conveniently located unit. When we had questions and concerns, the host answered us immediately and completely.

We found the place very clean and elegant, the only issue was the lack of chairs and a dining table to sit around and eat. There weren't many wine glasses or cooking implements either, but on the whole we would definitely stay there again.
56381	1950446	8.0	9.0	18864955	This place was great! Having a view of the water, and watching the pontoon planes take off and land, was fun for all of our guests.  The neighborhood was beautiful and the home is easy to find and return to after a night out. House was clean and quiet. I would definitely come back
56382	1950446	8.0	9.0	18977448	Fastest response ever which worked out perfect t since it was a last minute idea and getting a little late. The location was perfect, almost could see downtown from the front. The beds were very comfortable, which was about all I cared about after my drive in from Portland. I was surprised there was no TV, which didn't bother me since I do not watch TV . My only complaint was after seeing the photo of the tub, I had in in my head to take a hot bath. There was no stopper so I used a pillow case, worked for me but I did have to fill the tub up with the shower since it wasn't even set up for a bath. So my 2 recommendations would be 1. Buy a tub stopper and 2. maybe invest in a nice set of towels since people could go pay 200 for a luxury hotel with nice towels. Other then that I loved the place, great view, great location and comfy beds. Thanks again. 
56383	1950446	8.0	9.0	19354223	"A last minute trip to Seattle left me not worrying about hotel rooms until arrival - mistake, as everything was booked. Prices by the airport were $500+ a night. 

Luckily, Gavin was there with instant booking. Basically a suite that I would have been paying $2k for. Place was clean, centrally located, with parking with very comfy beds. 

Some freeway noise, but the price you pay for easy access. Water pressure was good, wifi excellent and view of the Lake/balcony was a plus. "
56384	1950446	8.0	9.0	19909069	"We arrived only for one night & found the place easily. Great location, as long as you are comfortable with the sound of the freeway. Close to lake union and very accessible to many areas of Seattle. 
Gavin was very nice and responded to all questions, as did the house cleaner, Pushpa. 
The internet didn't work. There isn't a TV, which was perfectly fine for us, we don't watch it--but to do any kind of work on our commuter was not possible. 
Overall, the place was dirty. The oven had foil with remains of food from the last person staying there. The couches, walls, and floors all seemed like they needed a good cleaning. The place could be rad, but needs a serious makeover. The screens on the windows were old, and some of the windows stick and are hard to open for fresh air. 
There was only enough hot water for one shower, which was a bummer.
There wasn't any hand soap in the bathroom--or any soap for that matter. The top two towels had a smell of cologne, which was a big turn off. 
My husband and I felt a little ripped off and would have paid more for a cleaner place. We pay the cleaning fee, so I am confused what this charge is actually for. I guess peoples standard of ""clean"" varies from the next...

56385	1950446	8.0	9.0	20636585	It was great to book instantly with prompt communication.  This is a super cute older 2 bedroom apartment.  Very very basic amenities.  No tv, radio, ipod dock, soaps, kitchen supplies or anything.  It's a great location that's easily accessible on and off freeway.  The back porch has a nice view.  Highly recommend Sarafina's happy hour just around the corner.  Superb Italian food = hand made pasta dishes for just $7!!  It's nice to have several stores, bars & restaurants within a couple minute walk.  Free parking onsite is excellent :)

Even though it was situated next to a highway, the noise was barely noticeable. The neighborhood is great and it was surprisingly easy to walk to bars and restaurants. My favorites were Voxx Coffee Shop and Little Water Cantina. Gavin was a gracious host and I highly recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a place in Seattle/East Lake area.

It's very relaxing, warm, and has great views (even while on the toilet:) The entry situation was super easy and the host was very accommodating. The decor is welcoming but not cluttered. Thanks!
56396	1950446	8.0	9.0	24078874	I had booked this for 3 guests from out of town. They very much enjoyed their stay. The apartment was clean and cozy, exactly what we were hoping for. Gavin was prompt to address all our questions. I would book it again for sure.
56397	1950446	8.0	9.0	24217250	We had a really great stay here. The location is really central, and was a short distance to Capital Hill and downtown, which is where we spent most of our time. Gavin was sure to check in with me as soon as we arrived, which was nice considering that this stay has key less entry which eliminates the need to coordinate meet up ( which is also awesome). The neighborhood is really cute with a few convenience stores, bars, and restaurants, and there are pamphlets and other info available to you inside the foyer of the building.
56398	1950446	8.0	9.0	24230556	This place is sweet. Definitely built with a great deal of care. The back porch has a sweet view and check in was very easy. Know that the parking space he's referring to is a sideways spot right in front of the brick porch. We were confused about that at first. Lots of natural light. Overall an awesome stay, I wish we had had more time here.
56399	1950446	8.0	9.0	24402909	The house was easy to find and the entry lock system worked well. Gavin was very responsive when we had questions regarding the apartment. Great little neighborhood.
56400	1950446	8.0	9.0	24861752	We had this wonderful spacious place all to ourselves which felt like a cozy urban cabin. It was so well situated, with great Italian and sandwich and coffee shops nearby (plus a market!) and easy access to the highway. Gavin was excellent about reaching out. 
56401	1950446	8.0	9.0	25118823	Gavin's apartment was perfect for us. The neighborhood is safe and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance but having a car is a plus. There is a parking space provided which is a plus for us. In better weather there is a great porch with views of of Seattle. There is no microwave or TV but the internet worked great. There was an electric heater for some extra warmth. We also noticed a pack and play in the closet. Don't worry about being near 5 we hardly heard anything from street noise. It is especially nice to have key pad entry. Thanks Gavin
56402	1950446	8.0	9.0	25211898	Gavin was great at communicating quickly.  His place is in a convenient location central to downtown Seattle, freeways, restaurants.  It is a large unit with lots of space for multiple people, plus a deck.  If you're sensitive to noise, it's a close to a freeway, but inside the living area is just fine.  This is not an owner-inhabited unit, so there are no knick-knacks or clutter.  If Gavin's cleaning people did a good job, this unit is a good value for inner-city living and has it's own parking spot, which is a plus.  This is a super-convenient place for a stay in Seattle.  Thank you Gavin.
56403	1950446	8.0	9.0	25315671	Loved this place! The flat was cozy and quaint with lots of light. There were plenty of essentials and didn't feel that anything was lacking. The place is centrally located with easy access to highway. The parking spot was a plus. Thanks for having us Gavin, we had a great time in Seattle!
56404	1950446	8.0	9.0	25412285	Gavin has a great house, and was very accommodating. His house was clean and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Gavin! 
56405	1950446	8.0	9.0	25912994	"Definitely an amazing space to be! Awesome location. We will definitely be back
"
56406	1950446	8.0	9.0	26011488	Great place! 
56407	1950446	8.0	9.0	26070545	This cozy apartment was perfect for our little weekend getaway! Gavin was excellent at communicating and his recommendation for a great place to watch the Super Bowl was spot on! It was so relaxing to  walk into a clean and well presented home. I wish we could have stayed longer. 
56408	1950446	8.0	9.0	26137013	A family emergency came up and I was unable to make the reservation work. Unfortunately, there was a strict policy so couldn't cancel, but Gavin was helpful and communicative regardless. 
56409	1950446	8.0	9.0	26302604	Our visit was great in Seattle. The location of this stay worked really well for us to explore many different areas of the city. It was near bus lines and close to a few useful spots (food/convenient store/coffee). The patio was nice as well. Thanks for the stay!
56410	1950446	8.0	9.0	26456023	Loved our place, location is great, free parking was a bonus, tons of sleeping space, there was a large deck attached to the unit we rented and it was fantastic! 
56411	1950446	8.0	9.0	26601512	The host was very good.  Gavin and Airbnb were prompt and professional.  The neighborhood was OK.  The location was good in terms of proximity to things important to us but looks out on I5.  The other side, however, had view of Lake Union.
56412	1950446	8.0	9.0	26745480	Nice and fit the description - great to have your own parking spot.
56413	1950446	8.0	9.0	27076497	My flight was unfortunately overbooked so I was unable to stay at the place but my friend who I originally was traveling with did stay and said that the place was great, everything was as expected. Sad I wasn't able to make it. 
56414	1950446	8.0	9.0	27119837	It was a great place to stay last min!  Good location!  Cute unit with great features!
56415	1950446	8.0	9.0	27318759	Gavin's space is clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced. We enjoyed our stay. The front bedroom does have a fair amount of traffic noise, but the other bedroom is well sheltered from this. The apartment does have a pack and play crib. If you're traveling with an infant like we were this is very helpful!
56416	1950446	8.0	9.0	27852097	The place was decently priced. Great location close to downtown area. 
56417	1950446	8.0	9.0	28213507	Gavin was quick to respond to any question by phone and by email. Very easy to work with. Great stay and we have future area already booked with him. 
56418	1950446	8.0	9.0	28304502	"Lovely old house. Close to highway so very easy to find and great that it has a parking spot. We discovered the neighborhood by foot and
took the bus to downtown (bus 66)
Also some great restaurants close by. 
A welcome guide with tips about neighborhood and bus routes etc would be helpful. I'm glad I brought my computer so we could google all that we needed. 
"
56419	1950446	8.0	9.0	28612067	Nice place to stay....fairly close to all the attractions LOL
56420	1950446	8.0	9.0	28698584	Our stay was wonderful! Gavin's place is beautiful. It slept 6 adults comfortably and we loved being able to make breakfast for ourselves in the morning. There is a great convenience store just down the hill. The linens were nice and check in/check out process was a breeze. The one suggestion we have is to improve the toilet function. We had to wait long periods of time for the bowl to refill. We think it had something to do with water pressure but aren't sure. Not a huge problem though! We enjoyed our stay so much :)
56421	1950446	8.0	9.0	28989735	We were so happy and satisfying for this house. We got just what we expected. The house in a great location close to downtown. The house was clean. The most important thing that the sound insulation is very good.
56422	1950446	8.0	9.0	29387579	The apartment was in a great location and had a beautiful view of the city. Plenty of space for 4 people, but I could see it feeling a bit crowded with more. We didn't communicate with Gavin while we were there because we had a friend in the area who helped us navigate the city, so that wasn't a problem for us. The plumbing/water pressure in the bathroom wasn't great and made showering and toilet flushing difficult. It wasn't as clean as we expected, the floor was pretty dusty and the shower curtain wasn't great. Other than those issues we were happy with the stay. 
56423	1950446	8.0	9.0	29597221	House was clean, getting in and out was easy, everything was exactly as advertised.
56424	1950446	8.0	9.0	29919501	The location of this place is awesome. Despite its close proximity with I-5, we didn't hear any noise as long as we didn't open any window or the balcony door. Gavin provided some coffees and teas for us and few amenities in the pantry. Wi-Fi connection was fast. The beds were comfortable. There was no TV, but we didn't need one since we only use the place to sleep. It would be nice to have washing & drying machine though. Check in/out was easy. This is an upper level area and we love how it has a lot of windows (thus lots of natural lights) and the view of the lake is great. The water pressure in the bathroom wasn't great in terms of taking shower and flushing the toilet. It took a while for the toilet bowl to fill up. The bath tub can be deep cleaned since there were some lime build up on the side. Other than those issues, we were happy with our stay.
56425	1950446	8.0	9.0	30442829	Gavin was easy to deal with and the place way perfect for our group of 5. Very cosy and had everything we needed, would definitely stay here again. 
56426	1950446	8.0	9.0	30875977	This place was perfect! A great space for my 2 friends and I to use as home base. Close to Eastlake to walk down and grab a coffee and close to public transportation. Capitol Hill is only a 5 min drive if you have a car or a $6 uber. Gavin was super nice, I met him the day I arrived the space was quaint and clean. I would definitely use this bnb again.  
56427	1950446	8.0	9.0	31050048	We were 5 adults passing thru Seattle looking for a place to stay close to the downtown area for one night. Gavin's place is a nice heritage home close to town and bus routes. The apartment is nice and comfortable and worked out well for us. The bathroom shower was a bit limited and it's close to the highway so it's a bit noisy but expected as its close to town. We would still recommend it for its convenience and it was clean; it's also a much better option than boring expensive big chain hotels! Thanks for the stay Gavin.
56428	1950446	8.0	9.0	31195723	Our entire experience was wonderful. Gavin gave us all the information we needed, and the apartment was adorable. 
56429	1950446	8.0	9.0	31831422	For the price it was expected. The smell was a little musty in the apartment and the hallway smelled like hot garbage. The shower was full of character. It was great having parking and the neighborhood was really awesome. Gavin was very attentive via email.
56430	1950446	8.0	9.0	32138669	Gavin's place was exactly as advertised. We had no problems while we are staying and everything was clean and cozy. The location was great too- central to everything and easy access to the freeway! Parking was convenient and we loved the back porch with a view of the city! Gavin was easy to communicate with and responsive via phone and text. 
56431	1950446	8.0	9.0	32314363	The space was wonderful. Our group had an easy time getting into the unit with Gavin's clear instructions. Everything was clean and tidy with charming details of an older well-loved home. Really enjoyable stay!
56432	1950446	8.0	9.0	32677828	We had a great time at Gavin's place. Everything was clean and well prepared. Great location as well! Would definitely stay here again.
56433	1950446	8.0	9.0	32895044	Definitely a cute little place conveniently located right next to the i5. Parking right next to the house made it easy to park our rental car. The bathroom was a little cramped and could use some updating, but the spacious rooms and the cozy living room made up for that. Could get a little noisy since it's right by the freeway, but as long as you keep the windows closed it should be fine. Overall a nice place to stay!
56434	1950446	8.0	9.0	33662823	The three day stay there is great. We pretty enjoy seeing the beautiful sunset while sitting at the balcony, feeling the cool wind. And the host offers a complete set of cookers, so mom can make delicious home made food. But during the day, it can be kinda hot without air conditioner. So I do suggest the host can offer a fan. That would be much better :]
56435	1950446	8.0	9.0	33824611	Gavin's space was great for our brief stay - spacious and comfortable, not to mention the view off to the side on the patio. It's also near a bus line, which was ideal for us in a pinch. Thanks for everything!
56436	1950446	8.0	9.0	34043852	As usual since I've stayed at Gavin place before the check in was very easy and check out was very smooth allowing me extra time to pack and get ready. the place was very clean and had all the extra amenities in the bathroom and kitchen.
56437	1950446	8.0	9.0	34146413	Great place and location! Great view of Seattle, parking spot and good access to highway. The shower is the one moot point and could definitely use an upgrade. Overall, great experience 
56438	1950446	8.0	9.0	34766815	Just as described, it was a great stay and the lake view cannot be beat.
56439	1950446	8.0	9.0	35349370	Check in so easy, and parking spot very useful. Shower leaves a little to be desired!  Great proximity to walk to shops, restaurants and the harbour.
56440	1950446	8.0	9.0	35466839	The host was prompt with communication and answered all of our questions. The apartment is in a great location for both walking and other transportation (right near the I-5 on ramp and the buses and transit in Eastlake). The entry keypad is very convenient, especially if you arrive in Seattle very early or late. The apartment was clean and spacious. The shower leaves a bit to be desired but otherwise I have no complaints about the apartment.
56441	1950446	8.0	9.0	36011494	Appreciated the coffee and found the listing exactly as stated.
56442	1950446	8.0	9.0	36172183	The place was great, very clean and in a good location. Very soft bed sheets! And the place is very easy access due to the code lock doors. Thank you!
56443	1950446	8.0	9.0	36757501	Everything was as it was mentioned in the description. 
56444	1950446	8.0	9.0	37601989	Josh's place is well represented on the site. His itinerary communications provide all you need for easy entrance and exit. Josh is highly responsive to  questions and offers helpful tips about the surrounding area. The area is safe with easy access to downtown. Two moms traveling with two boys felt safe. Easy walking to coffee and restaurants. The bathroom tub could use a resurface for aesthetics. All in all great place in convenient location.
56445	1950446	8.0	9.0	37759627	"Our AirBnB experience with Joshua's apartment was mediocre at best.  Let me start of first by saying that Joshua was a great host. He responded to all my inquires promptly and even let us check in a little early. The location of the apartment was amazing. It was so convenient to get to everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle, and it was wonderful to have a parking spot since street parking is pretty tricky. 
What we were disappointed with was the actual apartment. The apartment was spacious, however, the photos we felt were a little misleading. The bathroom was growing mold all over the ceiling, and there was no curtain for the window so anyone could see right in. It also looked like there was water damage on the ceiling in the bedroom with two beds because the paint was bubbling quite a bit over one of the beds. The ""patio furniture"" on the deck only included two chairs and a small table. Not really what I was expecting. It had been unseasonaly hot in Seattle, and the apartment did not have any air conditioning. I knew this from the listing, so I requested some fans to help with the heat. We only got one, so that meant that only one room got to take advantage of it at night. 

Overall, we had a great time visiting Seattle, but the apartment needs some help. We understand that it an older place, and it has character, but I would prefer no mold on the bathroom ceiling and a ceiling that doesn't look like it is going to fall on you. "
56446	1950446	8.0	9.0	38460847	"Josh was great - answered phone when I accidentally called him and was very pleasant.

Likewise, place was fantastic.  A great location and very spacious and well maintained.  Probably the only downside was I couldn't figure out the hot water on the bathtub so had a few brisk constitutionals during my stay. :)

Would absolutely go back if I was in Seattle.  Fantastic BnB."
56447	1950446	8.0	9.0	38598530	"Entry/exit really easy.  Apartment was clean, comfortable and spacious, just as advertised.  Good ventilation.  Nice beds and towels.  Kitchen had what we needed.  A little noisy, being so close to US 5, but it's the city.  I recommend this place.
Sam"
56448	1950446	8.0	9.0	38750369	Thanks Joshua for the amazing place to stay! :) it was just as described in the listing... I had texted Joshua a few times during our stay with questions and he replied back promptly and was very kind. The place has a great view and www the perfect place for my family and I to stay. Thanks again Joshua big we ever need a place in Seattle again we will look you up! 
56449	1950446	8.0	9.0	39045326	This was a great loacation. We were able to walk to the water, coffeeshop and market.  Easy drive to everywhere else we went.  House was clean, beds were comfortable. Everything you minimalistically needed was provided.  The shower really needs to be fixed/improved.  This was a great spot to stay.  
56450	1950446	8.0	9.0	39557093	Quick response, nice host, but The property is on the busy street, too much noises 
56451	1950446	8.0	9.0	39734877	Overall our group had a nice stay. The general consensus was the location & amenities served their purpose. Since our group rented both sides of the duplex we were able to have double the room to roam and relax which was excellent. Our only problem unfortunately was the cleanliness of the floors. Our feet were black from the soot/dirt. We found this problem in both units sadly. There were also misc items in the fridge (roast beef, ice cream, half container of juice etc) from previous guests. We did find everything to be accurate from the photos and enjoyed the central location. The house has it's charm and we very much appreciated having a comfortable bed to sleep in. The linens that were provided were great as well. The door key pad was a great feature and had no problem accessing either unit or the front door. Parking was also a plus.
56452	1950446	8.0	9.0	40019738	My friend and I stayed upstairs in the 2 bedroom for one night to attend a wedding in Seattle.   We enjoyed the vintage modern feel and look of the place.  It was a nice pleasant stay and a great deal for the area with parking.   I will definitely consider staying here again.
56453	1950446	8.0	9.0	40090910	I came to Seattle with my parents, my aunt and two cousins so the six of us stayed in the apartment. The apartment was great and served our needs. It was clean but the place did have character. I received the wrong code to get into the front door but Joshua picked up my call and that was rectified quickly. 
56454	1950446	8.0	9.0	40321499	Communication with the host and checkin was seamless. We loved the location and the place was very comfortable. The bathroom is a little small for 4 people to share, but all else great.
56455	1950446	8.0	9.0	40611573	Everything was provided as advertised in the listing.  The condo is in a great location and the space worked great for the bride and her bridesmaids as a location for getting ready for the big day!
56456	1950446	8.0	9.0	43331291	Big enough for four of us to sleep comfortably. Easy to find. 
56457	1950446	8.0	9.0	43468817	As expected. Clean, quiet, and a nice view. 
56458	1950446	8.0	9.0	43570296	Joshua's place was nice. Had some character and was in a cool neighborhood.  Definitely would recommend staying there.
56459	1950446	8.0	9.0	44452309	Nice apartment.  Walking distance to Union Lake, good restaurants as well as nice coffee shops.  I stayed with my wife and three children. We all enjoyed our stay here.   It is close to busy freeway but we closed the windows at night so the noise was not disturbing. 
56460	1950446	8.0	9.0	45283556	"Apartment was overall good. Good localization, very comfortable beds. Wi fi worked great. We also loved the speakers for music being available. Easy access, no Problem with door codes. Nice toiletry and blow dryer. Very close to small restaurants, very good mini market and coffee shops. Tranquil area and convenient 15min cab to downtown. Cute apartment with nice decor. 

Cleaning was alright but not amazing, specially some stained bed sheets. General state of apartment was good. Would also appreciate if there was more towels available for a longer period.

56461	1950446	8.0	9.0	45624470	Place was great and josh was very helpful to all our needs
56462	1950446	8.0	9.0	46675795	We had such a nice time at Joshua's apartment. It was clean and the view of the sunset was amazing! The traffic is a little noisy but in a white noise kind of way. Communication with Joshua was easy and It was easy for us to grab an uber and see the city. Would definitely recommend Joshua's place!
56463	1950446	8.0	9.0	46947878	Great Location and view of the Lake, couldn't have picked a better spot! Close to the nightlife and restaurants of Capital Hill and close proximity to some great parks! 
56464	1950446	8.0	9.0	48113280	Joshua's place was inviting and very easy to get to. Joshua was a fantastic host. He was welcoming and responded quickly to messages. The location was ideal - centrally located and easy to get to. 
56465	1950446	8.0	9.0	48404408	"Joshua was a great host. Very quick on response, and the property was acurated as what described on the site. 

We had total 5 people eventually stay at the property. It was a family vacation, with two seniors. The property was nice and comfy. Clean, and had a fully functioning kitchen.

Location was great for guests who drive. 5-10 minutes drive to DT Seattle, super convenience. 

Only disadvantage of this property will be too close to I-5 so there is a noisy level there. It was fine with me, but two seniors did complain a little. 

Overall, highly recommend, especially for group who has car!!

"
56466	1950446	8.0	9.0	48590145	The place was nice and pretty cute - great for a group of 4 in Seattle for the weekend. Joshua was good at communicating with me about any questions I had. it was well located to get to downtown and many other neighborhoods in Seattle. 
56467	1950446	8.0	9.0	49280803	A real nice nook for writers. My first time using Airbnb. Checking in and leaving was a real breeze, the house and units are beautiful. I can't remember now why I used to do hotels. I feel like I was asleep.
56468	1950446	8.0	9.0	49687088	Me and a few friends (4 people total, one couple) shared Joshua's place for a weekend and it turned out to be the perfect option.  Great location, clean apt and easy check-in/out.   
56469	1950446	8.0	9.0	50070986	This house was perfect! It housed me and my 4 friends with plenty of space. It was in a great location and the parking space was definitely a plus! The view on the deck was amazing. 
56470	1950446	8.0	9.0	50530914	The place was bright and welcoming, exactly as described.  Easy access via car.  Great view from a large balcony.  Nice quiet area.  We walked a few short blocks to find good coffee on a street a couple with small shops, markets and restaurants.
56471	1950446	8.0	9.0	51158173	"We arrived in Seattle for one night and found the house easily! (Just off the highway),  we and 4 friends stayed on the top floor of the house and we all found it very spacious and well kept for a quick overnight visit to the city. 

The neighbourhood was great, lots of great restaurants and an amazing bar (Eastlake Tavern Zoo) . Close to downtown and transit was the easiest way to get around! 

Good house for a quick trip to Seattle! "
56472	1950446	8.0	9.0	51516982	"So I needed a very last minute booking for two nights somewhere that was close to where I needed to be (for work) and had internet and a parking space. With those requirements this rental unit was perfect. Read the other reviews (as most are spot on regarding the current condition of the unit) for more detailed descriptions of the place but if you just need a place to rest your head at night it's perfect. Little to no water pressure if both units are using the sink/toilet/showers , no tv, located on a busy street (which can be noisy if windows are open), some windows are permanently open (see my last point) and it could use a good mopping (floor is a bit dirty but the rest of the place was pretty clean). Take the photos with a grain of photoshop as nothing in that place is that white. It's a cute little two story house in a great neighborhood, walking distance from not only a small market but some good places to eat. The units both come with a parking place and thanks to keyless entry you don't need to meet with Joshua for check-in/check-out.  
the tldr: If you're looking for a cheap, clean unit in a great neighborhood that you're only going to be using for sleep then this is your spot (especially if you have a car), if you're looking for a full hotel experience you should weigh your options. This might sound like an overly bad review but honestly for the price I paid it was a great choice. I would have no problems staying there again the next time i'm in town. Great view from the upstairs deck btw.
~Brent"
56473	1950446	8.0	9.0	51924525	"Pros:
The apartment is spacious, the location has easy and convenient access to highway and city. The check-in was straightforward with the door codes. Nice view, good natural light, appreciated having a parking spot. Joshua was easy to contact and quickly responsive.

Cons:
Overall feeling of cleanliness was not great. Stains on bed coverings. Towels were older. Pans were very used/old. The bathroom floor in particular was grimy/dirty around all the edges. Bathroom cabinets completely full of leftover random toiletries, which we re-organized to make room for our own. Fridge also contained a few half-used items. The only radiator that seemed to work was the one in the living room - the others (bathroom and both bedrooms) stayed cold the entire stay.

In bedrooms at night, we used white noise apps on our phone to soften the murmur of the highway, and the occasional loud truck/motorcycle... and that worked fine. Other than that, the apartment was calm and quiet in the living areas."
56474	1950446	8.0	9.0	52447512	"This unit is as described reasonably accurately by Joshua and the other reviews. For me it was unpleasant because 1) the heat didn't work in the upper unit I rented. 2) The shower pressure is incredibly poor and the hardware of the shower fairly antique making good control difficult as well as the shower curtain being hung somewhat askew keeping it in touch with your body basically at all times. 3) The downstairs unit tenants disrupted my evening trying to access the upstairs unit I was renting ""just checking the house out."" 4) The road noise was pretty bad.

I reported the heat issue almost immediately and Joshua was fairly dismissive of my concern until my 2nd request for assistance when he offered to come over when convenient for him after work, and then didn't come by at all. This was an underwhelming reaction to what I feel is a very serious issue in the unit during the cold of night."
56475	1950446	8.0	9.0	52667191	This upper unit was a nice option at the last minute for us in Seattle. Just minutes from downtown and there is a cafe around the corner and down the hill a couple of blocks. It's not fancy, but it is a good option if you want to be close to the city. Security locks at main entrance and also into the unit. Parking is very tight for an Suv in the front of the home but manageable. Thanks!
56476	1950446	8.0	9.0	53150456	Joshua's place great, clean, nice and cozy. Location was convenient because it was near the highway and close to downtown. I enjoyed my stay here.
56477	1950446	8.0	9.0	53426591	Joshua's place was a great space for my family and I to spend a couple days in Seattle. The apartment was warm and cozy. The beds were super comfortable and we were close enough to all the sites we wanted to see. Proximity to the highway noise was noticeable but quickly turned to white noise, which was actually quite pleasant. The parking space was used and appreciated!
56478	1950446	8.0	9.0	54385313	Great location and communication. Great view from the deck. Only negative is that the shower is pretty awful. Would make a huge difference with a new shower. Otherwise, great place and will definitely stay there again inmost next visit to Seattle.
56479	1950446	8.0	9.0	54569782	It was a pleasure staying there very spacious and very close to most attractions and very clean. 
56480	1950446	8.0	9.0	55088390	Gavin made us feel very welcome. The home was beautiful and was very spacious. It was located very close to downtown which made it very easy for us to get to places that we wanted to visit. We would love to stay in it again the next time we are in Seattle. 
56481	1950446	8.0	9.0	56161733	Absolutely beautiful, tasteful upgrades to a classic house. Immaculate.  The host lives in a building behind the house. He basically checked us in, saw us out and left us to our own devices otherwise.
57522	258571	8.0	9.0	756506	The apartment was exactly what we had expected - a nice little apartment right in the heart of Capitol Hill, just off Broadway.  Nick was prompt and very friendly, reachable even when I got stuck in traffic and couldn't make the agreed check-in time.  The apartment was clean and quiet.  I would certainly stay here again.  One thing to remember: there is only free, two-hour parking (8am-7pm, unrestricted after that) in that area due to its proximity to downtown, so if you've got a car, be prepared to move it around.  I was always able to find parking within a block of the apartment.
57523	258571	8.0	9.0	765798	Great host, comfy, clean room with all you need in the most buzzing part of Seattle.  
57524	258571	8.0	9.0	777606	Nick is super sweet and nice! His place was so convenient and GREAT value for money! We really enjoyed our stay here.. Smack bang in Capitol Hill, which was a great place to be in Seattle.. Walking distance to to cool bars, Downtown, the fish market, Belltown (another cool area, try Shorty's a pinball bar and go to Roq La Rue Gallery) and Broadway which has a lot of cheaper food places. We went out for a curry to Annapurna on Broadway which had great atmosphere, service, food & wine! Nick lent us a copy of Seattle Lonely Planet and a map and was really helpful through our whole trip. If your into amazing art books, comics and records, check out Fantagraphics Books and Georgetown Records in Georgetown (South Seattle art district), well worth the bus ride/drive from Nick's. Overall Nick's place was perfect for us, there were 3 of us staying for a few days and even though it was very cold in Seattle the apartment warmed up super quick. All the appliances are brand new, it was comfortable and Nick is great!
57525	258571	8.0	9.0	788300	Nick was a fabulous host and his apartment is just as great. It's in an ideal location and well-equipped with anything you might need during a short stay. Nick was very communicative and gracious enough to transport me to and from the light rail upon my arrival and departure, and went the extra mile by leaving me maps, recommendations, and even printed out a bus route based on where I'd told him I planned on going. 
57526	258571	8.0	9.0	796008	I really enjoyed staying at Nick's place. It's within walking distance of all things that might be of interest and not even far from the station that takes you to the airport. I particularily liked that there was organic tea and coffee available in the apartment. Nick's also a really nice guy and was easy to get in touch with anytime.
57527	258571	8.0	9.0	803874	"We had a fantastic stay in Seattle at Nick's apartment. Nick went out of his way to accommodate us and make us feel welcome--even going so far as to pick us up and drop us off at the train station, help us orient ourselves in the city/neighbourhood and accommodate our confusing travel schedule. Nick is a great host, and we will definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle!
The apartment itself is exactly as advertised. It's cozy and fully equipped. There's a powerful space heater for when it gets chilly, and guide books, maps of the city, even a tv with lots of dvds. The bed is very comfortable. The place is surprisingly quiet... we slept really soundly here. 
The neighbourhood is fantastic: there are all the bars, restaurants and cafes you could ever want around the corner or within short walking distance. It's a funky, pedestrian-friendly area, still within walking distance from downtown and Pike Place market. 
Overall, incredibly good value and highly recommended!!"
57528	258571	8.0	9.0	813614	"The apartment was clean and really nice.  Comfortable and plenty of room.  All the rooms were in order.  Nick was very accommodating, met me at the apartment the night I got in.  He also helped me out the following morning when I couldn't understand how to open the front door of the building.

Highly recommended.  A nice place in a great location.

Also, while he says that there's no WIFI in the apartment, if you put your laptop on top of the TV stand by the door you can usually get WIFI from upstairs."
57529	258571	8.0	9.0	856530	Great location. Shopping, restaurants, grocery store, coffee shops,  everything nearby. Sweet little place. small but comfortable and well furnished. Safe and secure.  Excellent value. Beautiful city.  The parking does suck but that's my fault for driving there. You don't need a car. We walked everywhere to everything. Charming host. Nick is a great guy who left us alone but did check in to see if we needed anything and was always available for any information we needed about the apartment, the area, or the city.  I'll be going back for sure.  
57530	258571	8.0	9.0	870790	"Nick was very accommodating and the space was wonderful. Great location. He was readily available if I needed anything- but I didn't. Would definitely recommend staying with him in his great place!

"
57531	258571	8.0	9.0	872894	Nick was great.  We were trapped in Seattle by the snow and ice and Nick went out of his way to make sure we had what we needed.  Apartment was cute and exactly what we needed for our stay in Seattle. Nick is easy going and takes good care of the apartment and his guests.  We hope to stay there again in the future.  The coffee and organic products were nice touches and show that Nick pays attention.  The location on Capital Hill was perfect, close to lots of great shops and restaurants and Virginia Mason Hospital.  
57532	258571	8.0	9.0	902113	Nick is awesome!  We couldn't have asked for a better host.  He was very friendly and quick to offer advice on places to visit and where to eat.  He checked in on us every couple of days to make sure everything was going ok and was readily available regardless of our needs or questions. We got really lucky to have a host as generous as him being that it was our first venture with AirBnB. We would definitely, without a doubt, recommend Nick to anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks Nick!!!!
57533	258571	8.0	9.0	908555	Nick was awesome-- very helpful and accommodating. This was our first experience on AirBnB and I'm definitely a convert. Thanks!
57534	258571	8.0	9.0	917593	Nick does his best to provide the things you would need for a comfortable stay (clean sheets, towels, plates, wifi!!). My husband wanted to make dungeness crab (bought from international district uwajimaya) and Nick was nice enough to let us borrow his big pot to cook them in. The apartment is in a convenient location and we ended up walking/taking the bus everywhere. Nick was kind enough to give us directions to his place using the bus. He was a pretty accommodating host. Overall, it is the best value in Seattle!
57535	258571	8.0	9.0	927239	. the location is great. nick is really attentive and helpful - a great host.
57536	258571	8.0	9.0	960362	"I never met Nick, as he was out of town, but he was in very close contact with me over email/phone so I never felt neglected.  He seems like a very nice guy and I look forward to meeting him someday.  

The place is great!  The location alone is straight BRILLIANT.  The neighborhood around is very hip, great to hang out in, and for business people working downtown it is a short walk over the highway (very easy)  into the highrise area.  I was working at the Paramount Theater for the week and it was about a 7 minute walk for me.  Couldn't have been better.  The apartment is really wonderful.  Even though its at the back of the building and the giant living room windows look out onto an odd stone alley, the alley is clean and there is something very zen about the view from the living room.  Great for writers/creative types.  I got a lot of work done.  The living room is large and has a desk and a small table for meals.  Kitchen is all you could need and all cooking supplies/utensils provided.  He even provided coffee/tea.  Bed is large and comfortable but takes up most of the bedroom.  Very comfortable linens/comforter.  Shower- pressure is good and water is hot! Nick provides a large space heater to supplement wall heating units.  Windows in living room do have a small draft but visiting in February I had no trouble staying warm.  Could see apartment having a nice cross breeze in the summer. 

I would definitely stay here again.

All around great apartment in an awesome location, with an attentive host!
"
57537	258571	8.0	9.0	968988	Great location and Nick was a great communicator throughout the experience. The apartment had everything I needed to do some cooking and feel at home. Great location for Downtown meetings and Cap Hill fun.
57538	258571	8.0	9.0	980102	Great apartment in a great neighborhood!  In walking distance to pretty much everywhere (plus if you're going toward anything touristy, it's downhill).  We had a really lovely time.  Thanks Nick!
57539	258571	8.0	9.0	1002845	"First the positives - the apartment is in a terrific spot on Capitol Hill.  Could not have been better for walking the city.  Secondly Nick is super responsive and helpful. 

The down side.  The apartment is cold and dark (although not damp).  The bathroom and to a lesser extent the kitchen needed a good scrubbing - it was dirty.  The bed seemed to be broken and was uncomfortable.    

The neighbor above would clatter around in hard soled shoes at 3am while the next door neighbor had loud 4am parties 2 of the 4 nights we were there (obviously not the host's fault).

The price seems a bargain, but you really do get what you pay for.  Would not stay again, despit the positives."
57540	258571	8.0	9.0	1026624	Great little apartment - the perfect place for going downtown and catching all the sights - we walked everywhere (maybe a 10-15minute walk to the famous pike place market) - Nick constantly checked with us to make sure we had everything we needed, and was quick with recommendations for the area, including bus schedules etc.  A quick tidbit - take the light rail from the airport to the last stop (Westlake) - you'll be about 10 blocks from the place and will save yourself about 30 dollars in cab fair.
57541	258571	8.0	9.0	1057414	Great location, easy walk to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. Neighbors can be loud at night, but it's a great place to stay and meets your needs. The host is very friendly and accommodating, always willing to help with any problems or questions.
57542	258571	8.0	9.0	1081408	I'd recommend anyone looking to enhance their stay in Seattle book Nick's apartment; it's within walking distance of most anything in downtown, and sports one of the most comfortable beds upon which I've been able to sleep while on vacation. And Nick, Nick was a superb host! Responsive to our communication, helpful, kind, and efficient, it's impossible for me to say too many good things about him.
57543	258571	8.0	9.0	1090992	Nick was an outstanding host -- welcoming, accommodating, and easy to communicate with. His place is an excelnt value in a fantastic location. A great overall experience!
57544	258571	8.0	9.0	1101104	Nick was an outstanding host who went out of his way to be accommodating to our requests during and prior to the trip. Check-in and out was flexible and easy. The apartment was very comfortable and the location was amazing and perfect for our needs during this stay. The provided tea and snacks was very much appreciated, we definitely drank a lot of tea! 
57545	258571	8.0	9.0	1128303	We really enjoyed our stay at Nick's apartment. Nick is the perfect host - we didn't get a chance to meet him but he was a great communicator and made sure we had everything we needed. Cute apartment in a brilliant location. Super comfy bed too! Thanks, Nick.
57546	258571	8.0	9.0	1138906	"Nick was a great host. He helped with issues beyond his control in a timely manner. He has also been flexible with arrival/departure making it a no hassle stay.

The apartment is also nice and in an excellent location next to great restaurants, bars just in walking distance. It comes with anything you need.

I would definitely consider staying here in the future! "
57547	258571	8.0	9.0	1155847	"Nick was a fantastic host, very warm and accommodating. I felt like I could contact him for any issues, though we didn't run into any hiccups. The apartment was lovely, filled with nice touches like the DVD collection and all the utensils and cookware that we needed. Comfortable bed. We actually found two burned CDs in the stereo that are all-time favourite albums of mine, which was a nice surprise! The location was perfect: only a short walk to the waterfront, really close to a grocery store and a stone's throw from Bauhaus, (coffee shop) where we spent quite a bit of time. Coming from Vancouver, it was perfect that the apartment was right off the freeway, and parking wasn't that big of an ordeal at all.

I can't wait to come back and stay here again!"
57548	258571	8.0	9.0	1176968	Nick was a fantastic host in every way - prompt with responses, super nice, and provided all necessary information on Seattle and the apartment (wifi password, emergency call numbers, how to wrangle the remotes for the television and DVD players - the works). The apartment is in a great location - close proximity to Capitol Hill goodies and walkable to downtown. My parents had a blast and really enjoyed having a central place to crash that was more than just a bedroom. Views aren't necessary when you have a comfy bed and access to an amazing city, so the first floor location feels cozy at night and is quieter than we expected. Cheers all around.
57549	258571	8.0	9.0	1186306	This apartment had everything we needed for a 1 night stay and in a great location, walking distance to everything in Capitol Hill and right near the freeway. Parking wasn't even too bad. Nick was friendly and even was able to let us check in early. 
57550	258571	8.0	9.0	1202023	"Albeit our stay at Nick's was short, Nick was attentive and a sweet host.

He provided great feedback on tourist spots (Columbia Tower, Bruce Lee's cemetery, etc.).  Nick went out of his way to find us directions and bus numbers to specific spots.  Most of all, my boyfriend and I are big foodies, so we were delighted when Nick suggested a few restaurants.

The 1 bedroom apartment is in Capitol Hill which is relatively close to Downtown and central to a lot of delicious eateries.  We had no trouble finding the apartment and was able to travel freely just by catching a bus a block away or walking.
"
57551	258571	8.0	9.0	1224130	My wife's parents and brother stayed here while visiting Seattle. It was a very last minute request and Nick was very quick to respond. He made the rental process super easy and was very accomodating. The apartment was a little on the small side - so probably better for just 2 people - but it was clean and in a great neighborhood. Thanks Nick!
57552	258571	8.0	9.0	1233609	We had a nice, 3-night stay in Nick's apartment.  The place is located within easy walking distance to the waterfront.  The host was very responsive and checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Recommend.
57553	258571	8.0	9.0	1250281	Great place! Super clean and convenient. I was able to walk just about everywhere I wanted to go :).
57554	258571	8.0	9.0	1257522	Fantastic location! Easy walk to restaurants, bars, waterfront, etc. Close to Amtrak station. Nick was wonderful, he accommodated us, and was really friendly. Would love to be back
57555	258571	8.0	9.0	1282932	I stayed at Nick's  during my daughter's graduation. Great location on Capitol Hill with all it has to offer, and a 10 minute walk to the downtown area.  Nick is a great host, friendly and responsive to your requests. Nick offers good value for the money and I would stay there again.
57556	258571	8.0	9.0	1297271	Nick accommodated us at the last minute as we had an unexpected layover in Seattle.  The Apartment is a great value and is in a very accessible are of Capitol Hill.  Close to several bars and restaurants.
57557	258571	8.0	9.0	1308543	Great place and price. The location is great and Nick is very nice and helpfull. Highly reccommended!
57558	258571	8.0	9.0	1324638	Nick was very helpful and made every effort to communicate and to be sure I was comfortable. It's a nice place in a part of Seattle that I really appreciate. I would not hesitate to stay again.
57559	258571	8.0	9.0	1334233	We had a great stay. Nick was a great host and the place was perfect. Great location and sweet DVD collection.
57560	258571	8.0	9.0	1343621	"Nick was great to work with and the accommodations perfect for a getaway to Seattle.  Located near all the great places in Capital Hill and in easy walking distance to downtown, this location was EASY to get to and ample street parking.

Comfortable, clean and quiet the apartment had just about everything you could ask for.  Nick even provided an extra sleeping bag for our 3rd friend to sleep on the couch. Would definitely stay again."
57561	258571	8.0	9.0	1361187	The apartment was clean and comfortable, and you absolutely cannot beat the location! There's tons of places to check out in the neighborhood (including a grocery store & drug store), and it's easy to walk downtown and to all kinds of interesting places around Seattle. As he says, Nick is just upstairs and while I didn't need assistance with anything during my stay, he did check in with me and I was confident that he'd be on top of it if I ran into any problems or had any questions. I'd stay here again!
57562	258571	8.0	9.0	1404980	Nicks place was perfect! It was in a fun area with everything you could ask for within walking distance. We were visiting friends so we didn't get to explore as much of Capital Hill as I wanted to. The apartment is wonderful and has all the amenities you would need. The bed is super comfortable as others have stated. Nick was very attentive and a wonderful host. We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to town.  
57563	258571	8.0	9.0	1427744	"I'm a photographer, weddings mainly, then portraits and people.
For all of these types of photography, from time to time, travel is needed.
When travel is needed, then you can simply put me down as an ECSTATIC photographer! Love that more than anything.
Running, exploring, and meeting all kinds of new people and trying as much of the food as I can get my hands on.

Nick's place makes it simple for all of those things. Easy to get to from the train or bus, close to really great coffee shops, and not typical restaurants. 
Nick is there and always ready for a suggestion for you to try something or available if there's any kind of problem. HUGE comfortable real bed, and it's so quiet you wouldn't believe it.  Next trip out to Seattle, I'm definitely contacting Nick first thing."
57564	258571	8.0	9.0	1471696	Nick is an excellent host and has a great place centrally located on Capitol Hill.  A 2 minute walk to The Pine Box, Bauhaus Coffee, Little Woody's, Baltic Room, Saley, Knee High Stocking Company, and Living Room.  Can't beat that!  The wifi was solid and the bed was comfy.  What more can you ask for!
57565	258571	8.0	9.0	1472266	We enjoyed our stay in Nick's apartment in Capitol Hill. Nick is a very good host and was very helpful and accommodating. The apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to the market and many shops and restaurants. 
57566	258571	8.0	9.0	1485226	The location cannot be better. Everything was almost walking distance. Nick was very polite and helpful. We didn't need any help but he was eager to help us. It's not a fancy hotel but it was absolutely fine for us. The price was unbeatable for the location.
57567	258571	8.0	9.0	1518538	"Nick was very willing to be flexible with our schedule, and make the visit fit within our travel plans, which we really appreciated. He offered to hold on to our bags while we explored the city, and made every accommodation possible for us. 
The apartment was clean, well furnished and more than enough for what we needed. Also, the sheets were really soft, which was great too! "
57568	258571	8.0	9.0	1618806	"Our stay in Seattle was well worth the money and flying thanks to Nick's hospitality.  Although we weren't able to meet him in person, we were still able to keep in touch with him through messaging and e-mail.  His apartment was very cozy, tidy, and space efficient since it was only the two of us staying there.  It's a good thing Nick provides cups, plates, bowls, pots and pans,  or we wouldn't have been able to cook the seafood bought at Pike Place Market.  The apartment is conveniently found close to Pine St. which is basically the street we frequented everyday.  Westlake Shopping Center, Pike Place Market, and the Seattle Center were all accessible from the apartment through walking down Pine St., monorail, bus, and light rail.  There is also a small grocery mart around the corner just in case you need to buy snacks or ingredients to cook with.  Make sure you visit Saley's Crepes around the corner if you do decide to stay here!

-Melissa and Rosie"
57569	258571	8.0	9.0	1647834	A great place to stay. The apartment is not luxury accommodation but it is cheap and very well located within walking distance to some of the best parts of Seattle. Nick was great too!
57570	258571	8.0	9.0	1766767	Great place, great location, great host. Wish we hadn't had a rental car from the rest out our adventure but parking was easy enough. Nick made some great suggestions for things to do - even texted to let us know that Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis were at the Pike Place Market. 
57571	258571	8.0	9.0	1808126	The apartment was great and Nick was super nice. I wish we had more time in Seattle since we only had a day. Nick helped us pick out some sights to see. Everything meet my expectations and I would recommend staying there. 
57572	258571	8.0	9.0	1838406	My first time using airbnb and it was a excellent experience. Nick met me at his apt to give the keys. He has guidebooks/maps and wifi ready to go. Kitchenette and living room with sofa let's you have 2-3 friends over comfortably. Bedroom is good size with dresser with bathroom connected to the bedroom. Great stay and I would recommend since it is walkable in 10-15 mins to downtown. easy to get to freeway also.
57573	258571	8.0	9.0	1848113	My husband stayed a night at Nick's apartment and said it was perfect. It had everything he needed and was conveniently located to get back to the airport. Nick was easy to get in touch with and very flexible. I'm so glad we got a chance to meet him. 
57574	258571	8.0	9.0	1867073	Stayed to two nights in Nick's apartment. Nick was a great host, very friendly and easy to communicate with. Apartment was tidy and had everything we needed. This is a great location and we will definitely stay there again.
57575	258571	8.0	9.0	1899125	This place is very comfortable and in a great location! It was easy to walk downtown or get a bus elsewhere.  Nick was great about staying in touch and being available for anything that was needed.  
57576	258571	8.0	9.0	1923821	"Nick and the apartment were great! The location is fantastic - right off Pine and Pike and near many great restaurants and bars. The apartment itself had all the essentials, including a small but functional kitchen. 

There where two small issues; the apartment is right off a busy street so there is a little road noise and the bed is softer than I prefer.  But the first should be expected due to the amazing location and some people really like soft beds.

But for the price, this place is unbeatable and Nick was super flexible and great!"
57577	258571	8.0	9.0	1948965	"Nick was a very delightful host. Knowing we were driving into town from Portland, he was flexible with our check in time. When we arrived he greeted us warmly, provided walking directions to downtown (extremely walkable!) and recommendations for nightlife (asking what vibe we were looking for). 

The location, apartment, and host will not disappoint. You will surely enjoy your stay, as we did! One note of caution (which Nick was very forthcoming and helpful with) - parking is a bit tricky. Other than that, it was a great experience."
57578	258571	8.0	9.0	1981107	The apartment was as advertised and very convenient to downtown Seattle. The building was quiet and there were lots of great little places to check out nearby. Nick was helpful and checked in to make sure everything was going well during my stay.
57579	258571	8.0	9.0	2002811	The place was just as expected and advertised. No, this is not a fancy condo or hotel with valet service, but it gave us what we needed - a place to stay and rest after a week-long non-stop trip from Austin to Seattle to Vancouver to Squamish that included running a half marathon and climbing! Nick was very courteous and helpful. The location is great with wonderful places to eat and drink right around the corner (the crepes place is outstanding). It is right next to the interstate but noise was not an issue for me.
57580	258571	8.0	9.0	2023352	Nick's place was perfect. The location is insanely central. Easy easy walking distance from some of my favorite spots on Capitol Hill: Bar Ferd'nand, Taylor Shellfish, and a new fave The Pine Box (three doors down from Nick's apartment). The apartment was clean, private, a perfect home away from home. Nick was super helpful with check-in. I texted and  he met me at the door. So simple! I will definitely stay again.
57581	258571	8.0	9.0	2062957	"This apartment is in a great location; really cute neighborhood with lots of dining options/laid back vibe and in close walking distance to anything downtown.

In addition, Nick was a really great host and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed / made sure our stay was comfortable."
57582	258571	8.0	9.0	2130687	Nick's place was great! It was very clean and comfortable, and located within easy walking distance of the Capital Hill bar scene. I would definitely stay here again.
57583	258571	8.0	9.0	2147884	Just as advertised! This was a sweet place in a great location and Nick was super nice.
57584	258571	8.0	9.0	2175951	Awesome location, within walking distance to EVERYTHING!  Nick is really accommodating.  This apartment is definitely best suited for only two people as the listing states.  We tried to squeeze a third person in on the couch (Nick doesn't charge extra for this) and it didn't work out too well as the place is pretty small.   My only complaint and reason for rating this apartment three stars is that it needs to be thoroughly cleaned.  The bathroom was very dirty with dust and hair in the tub and on the floor.   That being said, this is a good value for what you pay!  
57585	258571	8.0	9.0	2204923	Nick was an excellent host! Although he was away for the weekend, the key exchange went perfectly, and he left lots of detailed information for us on how to get around and what amenities are in the area. The place was perfect for what we needed, and was very close walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and bars in Capitol Hill. We will definitely be staying again!
57586	258571	8.0	9.0	2247024	"Conveniently located between downtown and the heart of Capitol Hill (5-10 mins walking distance each). 

The appartment was spacious but a bit more on the simple side. Don't expect anything fancy. But for the price it is just a great deal!!! Especially considering the loaction. Safe and friendly environment with tons of stores an cafés / restaurants just round the corner.

Unfortunately the fridge did not work during our three days stay, which was a bit of a let-down. Though I communicated that to Elena (Nick was not there during our stay), nothing really happened. But I'll guess, this will be taken care of by now."
57587	258571	8.0	9.0	2273995	Very convenient location for most things. Easy access from the airport by public transport.
57588	258571	8.0	9.0	2330674	The apartment is great, it has everything you need, it's very comfy and really affordable. It's located in a great neighborhood and it's also close to downtown, plus there are plenty of public transit options around. Nick is always ready to answer any questions, he's also very friendly and helpful. I would definitely like to stay there next time I'm in town.
57589	258571	8.0	9.0	2388553	It was a cosy apartment in a very strategic location. Walking to downtown is no problem. The surrounding area is pretty safe during the night. There are quite a number of good cafes, hang-out place, eateries within walking distance. The Wi-fi was fast. Nick is very helpful in providing information & suggestions on where to go, places of interest and how to get there.Thumbs up.  He is also very accomodating with our much earlier check-in. He tried to assist us whenever possible and frequently check with us if everything was ok. 
57590	258571	8.0	9.0	2433284	Nick communicates very well and he even recommended some local restaurants.  Went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed.  Took a tour of the apartment but actually ended up staying with a friend.  The apartment is perfect for anyone looking for a reasonable place to stay in downtown Seattle!
57591	258571	8.0	9.0	2442704	This apartment is in a really great location and is easy to get to by public transport.  There are lots of nice bars and places to eat just a short walk away and it's very easy to walk into downtown - we walked to Pike Place within 20 minutes.  The apartment is in a quiet block and was very well equipped.  We didn't use the kitchen as we ate out but there was everything you would need to cook if you wanted to eat in. Nick was really helpful and friendly in his communications and although we didn't get to meet I felt that he would have given any help or information if I needed it.  If you want a good location and good value then this apartment is the perfect place.
57592	258571	8.0	9.0	2482320	This place was awesome! It was close to airport transit, in a great neighborhood and very comfortable. Nick was an excellent host-- prompt on all my inquiries and very accommodating. 
57593	258571	8.0	9.0	2555889	Great location. Nick was very friendly and helpful! Thanks again!
57594	258571	8.0	9.0	2581319	The apartment was clean, cozy, well-stocked, and most importantly, very close to the downtown area! Nick was extremely accommodating. I will definitely recommend anyone coming to Seattle to check out his place! 
57595	258571	8.0	9.0	2612837	Great location in Capital Hill. An easy walk to coffee shops and downtown. Apartment is cozy and clean. Only difficult part is finding parking, but that's a given for the area. Overall, had a wonderful time. Nick is very flexible and was a great host. Thanks!
57596	258571	8.0	9.0	2646756	Great apartment in Seattle, close and convenient to everything. A fabulous Italian restaurant just up the street. Nick was a very accommodating host and gave us great advice on what to see and do. Would definitely stay there again on future trips to Seattle.
57597	258571	8.0	9.0	2664869	I can't say enough good things about nick.  He was quick to respond to every communication, incredibly accommodating, and the apartment was exactly what we needed.  The place was clean and comfortable, and the location is ideal for those wanting to get around on foot, and Bauhaus Coffee (where you can get a cuppa and a Top Pot donut) is at the end of the block! 
57598	258571	8.0	9.0	2714574	Nice apartment in a very good location. Close to downtown (10 minute walk) and a lot of great coffee shops, bars, restaurants are nearby. The place is quiet and clean. Good wi-fi. Nick is a perfect host, very accommodating, always helpful and usually replies to every question within minutes. I would definitely stay there again next time.
57599	258571	8.0	9.0	2744334	I stayed in Seattle at at the apartment in October. The apartment was clean and exactly what I was looking for. Nick was very friendly and helpful. He left travel guides in the apartment for reference and was always available with any questions or concerns. I highly recommend staying at this apartment if you are hoping to stay in Seattle for an affordable price in a great location. I was able to walk to the Space Needle as well as to Pike Place and the Paramount with ease.
57600	258571	8.0	9.0	2783170	Clean and wonderful place to stay! Very close to the All the great places in Capitol hill which is a cozy area comparing to downtown Seattle. Just love it! Though we are not able to meet Nick in person, his clear instruction makes the stay non sweat at all!
57601	258571	8.0	9.0	2901472	The place was perfectly located for me and Nick was very helpful. I can truly recommend his place. Next time I'm in Seattle, I will first check if his place is available.
57602	258571	8.0	9.0	2911082	Nick was a great host.  The apartment was just as described. Great location for a quick overnight trip to Seattle.  Thanks Nick!
57603	258571	8.0	9.0	2956223	Nick's place was perfect for our needs. We wanted a place that was walking distance to the center of the city, near public transport, and in a neighborhood with a grocery store and coffee shops. We came to visit our daughter who was in college in Seattle, so having a couch where she could spend the night when she wanted to enabled us to spend a lot more time with her. Nick was prompt and reliable. Only one drawback: the bed was on the soft side for us. 
57604	258571	8.0	9.0	2992322	The apartment was conveniently located, walking distance to downtown. Close to all the greatness of the Capitol Hill area.  Apartment was clean and as advertised. Nick was so incredibly helpful and attentive. Rock star host. 
57605	258571	8.0	9.0	3046679	Nick was quick to respond to the booking request. He left the keys in a lock box and clear instructions on how to get them and get to the unit. He came to greet us and to say goodbye and even hooked me up with laundry detergent! would totally stay there again. 
57606	258571	8.0	9.0	3109851	"Stayed here for a weekend and the experience went pretty well. Nick was very nice and the communication before/during/after the stay was great. The place itself isn't too fancy but it was good for what was charged and for the convenient location directly in downtown Seattle. Everything was clean for the most part and the place was quiet/warm enough during our stay (December). We booked on very short notice and Nick was more than happy to have us right away which was perfect. Parking is very hard to find (as it is in most of downtown Seattle) so be prepared to either spend a bit of time looking for street parking or paying for a parking lot/garage. Checking in and out went very smoothly and we were even allowed to stay a little later than usual since nobody was booked for the day we were checking out. Nick is a fantastic host! 

if you are looking for an inexpensive stay on short notice in Seattle, I would definitely recommend staying here. Thanks again Nick!"
57607	258571	8.0	9.0	3123852	Nick was very accommodating and very friendly. The location of the place is amazing. A mere block away from Melrose Market where you can eat at Sitka & Spruce and Taylor Shellfish Co. Victrola Coffee is a block further away. I enjoyed my stay here!
57608	258571	8.0	9.0	3161894	"Location is fantastic; right in the middle of Capitol Hill, and within walking distance of Downtown Seattle.  Living room is spacious, kitchen is convenient, bed is comfortable, and Nick (the host) is very helpful.
"
57609	258571	8.0	9.0	3264071	The apartment is quiet and convenient. We stayed a week in Nick's apartment without a car but it wasn't difficult to walk or to find a bus to take wherever we needed to go. Nick was out of town during our stay but was still attentive through email. Checking in and out was easy.
57610	258571	8.0	9.0	3355771	My friend and I only stayed in Seattle for one night (a mistake) on our way to Portland. Although we never met Nick, his place was easy to find, close to everything and in such a beautiful neighbourhood. Would definitely take advantage of it again. 
57611	258571	8.0	9.0	3393315	We stayed at the apartment for a three day weekend and had a lovely time on our trip. The apartment is in a fantastic location. Victrola around the corner, lots of great restaurants along Pine and Pike. We walked everywhere and all the sights we wanted to see were within walking distance from the apartment. It was also really nice to have wifi and Roku at the apartment. Nick was also super great around communication. 
57612	258571	8.0	9.0	3435326	Great location and privacy.  Great communication with Nick throughout planning and travel.  Checkin and checkout quite easy.  Very comfortable and convenient accommodations, just as described.  A great part of a very fun visit to Seattle--highly recommend it!
57613	258571	8.0	9.0	3449449	Fantastic experience, Nick was very hospitable and the apartment was in a central location, easy to walk to downtown! Would definitely stay here again!
57614	258571	8.0	9.0	3470649	All as described. Nick was excelleent in communicating and answering questions. Appartment was perfct for our stay; c;lose to restaurants, grocery and bus.  Some stuff in the pantry was appreciated :coffee, team peanut butter... made life easier.  Parking is a problem but can  be managed creatively. Nick mailed stuff we forgot..much apapreciated.. did not even want us to reimburse for postage.. Will be there again when visitng Sattle
57615	258571	8.0	9.0	3718266	Good location and value for money. 
57616	258571	8.0	9.0	3793872	"I was so grateful that Nick could accommodate me on short notice!   
...HE'S MY FIRST!  ... First AirBnB host!
  And Nichole was a welcoming beauty to my first time to Seattle! Wish I could have stayed longer 
Thanks guys!  "
57617	258571	8.0	9.0	3814587	I had a great experience at Melrose Court Apartment. The place was nice, clean, and well-kept, but the best thing about it was the location. It was centrally located in Capitol Hill within walking distance to Downtown and very close to public transportation routes for adventures a bit further out. The host was professional, communicative, and accommodating. I would recommend Nick and Melrose Court Apartment to my friends and family. 
57618	258571	8.0	9.0	3905637	"I highly recommend staying here to anyone.  The apartment was clean and cozy and in a great location.  If you want to be able to walk to anything, this is the place.  Nick and Nicole were both very responsive to all of my emails and phone calls.  We were able to find and get into the apartment with no problem.  Since we arrived rather late at night, a lockbox containing the keys was left outside the building and we were given the code to open it.  Using this as a check-in process couldn't have been easier.  We loved having a kitchen and being able to cook our own breakfasts - saved us a bunch over the course of a week.  

We very likely will be back in Seattle soon and I will almost definitely stay here again.  Thanks guys!"
57619	258571	8.0	9.0	3937771	It's good value and a great location (we walked everywhere) and the host was very helpful in allowing us to check in early, but the place was not clean (perhaps this was due to our early check in, though much of the dirt had been there for some time). I suppose you get what you pay for!
57620	258571	8.0	9.0	3954910	"Had a great stay!
Good location close to everything on Capitol Hill."
57621	258571	8.0	9.0	3976145	Very nicely located and super easy to checkin and use the apt. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle! 
57622	258571	8.0	9.0	4044316	Our stay in Nick's unit in Seattle was great.  The unit was pretty good, position excellent.  Nick was very obliging when we wanted to move in one day earlier than we had booked. Nicole was very helpful with information and trouble-shooting.  One downside, however, was that i found the unit not clean enough.  It needed a good scrub around the edges, surfaces, blinds and bed valance and carpet. We liked the TV subscription service, much better than usual cable. 
57623	258571	8.0	9.0	4068884	This apartment was well-thought out and in a perfect location. We wanted to stay longer after only being there one night. Nicole was so nice, and we will probably be back! 
57624	258571	8.0	9.0	4098417	Nick (and his friend Nicole) run a well oiled AirBnB Machine.  Everything was ready to go and setup.  For the price, his Melrose Court apartments can't be beat.  They aren't anything fancy, but for the location and cost, it's great.  Free Wifi is a plus. Parking in the area is tough as Nick mentions, so be warned if you do have a car.  
57625	258571	8.0	9.0	4182450	Really Easy to work with.  Great Location between Capital Hill and Downtown.
57626	258571	8.0	9.0	4242976	"Great location! Sandwiched between the hip and locally flavoured Capitol Hill, and the downtown core, you can see a lot of seattle from here. Check-in was smooth even though we were terribly inaccurate with our arrival time. Nicole (who helps Nick) was friendly and warm. 
Kitchen has basic amenities that should allow you to make your own breakfasts or snack and thus avoid at least a few expensive meals out.
The apartment itself is pretty cold so bring slippers and sweaters.  The bed is extremely noisy with even the slightest movement so light sleepers beware. 
We have stayed in a few Airbnb accommodations in the last year and in general this place was not as clean as we have come to expect from Airbnb. Some maintenance issues and a degree of run-downness likely due to the building age and quality (outside of Nick's hands) may have contributed to this perception, though some of these problems should be easy fixes (such as some general cleanliness, fixing the bed and shower head).
For international travellers, take note that there is no landline phone, so you will not be able to call taxis or have them call you unless you have some cell phone arrangement worked out. We were not aware of any method to have guests or taxi drivers buzz the apartment from outside either, so plan accordingly.

To summarize, this is an affordable place that gets the job done if you plan to spend most of your time out. It is a great location, but it is not an immensely comfortable place, so you will be keen to get out and explore. 
"
57627	258571	8.0	9.0	4297646	"Nick's apartment has a really great location just at the bottom of the great neighbourhood of Capitol Hill and really near from Downtown.
We did everything by walk.
I recommend this apartment for 2 people only. 
We were 3 people, and the couch for the third person wasn't so good."
57628	258571	8.0	9.0	4341982	Location Location Location. There are so many good bars and good eats in walking distance. A 5 dollar cab ride to Pike Place Market!  Nicole was a very lovely host and very accommodating! Would definitely stay with them again! Thanks so much!
57629	258571	8.0	9.0	4463929	"This was my first airbnb stay and I was very pleasantly surprised. As many reviews already say, Nicole and Nick run a really smooth operation. Everything was ready when I got there -- Nicole was even available for an early check-in -- and the place was as described.

The location is really solid -- close to lots of coffee shops, right near some fun spots close to downtown, and walking distance to anywhere in the city. As some of the reviews already have stated the place is small and is more like a bachelor pad, but it certainly does the trick and you can't be the price and location.

Nick was super responsive prior to the trip in helping me coordinate my stay and Nicole was very accessible and I would highly recommend them to anyone who's considering renting this place."
57630	258571	8.0	9.0	4490594	I stayed here for 2 nights and found it clean, comfortable and location fantastic. Nicole was fantastic in meeting us for an early check in that I requested. Fantastc value for money for afew days exploring Seattle.
57631	258571	8.0	9.0	4549294	was a perfect place to call home while I looked for apartments around capitol hill and south lake union. great location, cozy, clean, and comfortable. 
57632	258571	8.0	9.0	4614139	"This Capitol Hill apartment is very close to a number of great restaurants and cute neighborhood shops.  However, it's not the most scenic location - there are quite a few homeless people around the neighborhood and some not-so-cute bars.  

The apartment itself is fairly spacious.  Here are the few problems we noticed:  the couch is very old and threadbare, there was no handtowel in the bathroom (only papertowels in the kitchen), there was no potholder in the kitchen.  "
57633	258571	8.0	9.0	4631968	Great location.  Private apartment with 1 bed and 1 bath.  The complex and apartment were a little old and worn, but clean and in a great area.  Host reaction was immediate and communication was great.  If you're just looking for a place to crash then this is a great place, but if your looking for comfort and lounging around then try something else.
57634	258571	8.0	9.0	4661028	This place is great, nick and Nicole is a fantastic host and very helpful. The place is at a good location near bars n pubs n restaurant, good for a quick get away definately recommend it. 
57635	258571	8.0	9.0	4702803	Nick was a great host. The apartment was perfect for our short stay and in a great location.
57636	258571	8.0	9.0	4757821	The good bit is the flat is very clean and in a convenient location to walk everywhere. But the building and the flat are shabby. Flat is gloomy as there is a high wall only feet from the windows. Wouldn't take much to bring it up to scratch - matching china, matching towels, a hand towel and drying up (website hidden) was hopeless but we watched a couple of good DVDs. Flat is quiet and laundry was good. Dealings with Nicole also good.
57637	258571	8.0	9.0	4790119	Great location and Nick's manager Nicole was a delight - flexible about early check-in and incredibly helpful.  In terms of  the  lodging itself, the bathroom mat and sofa could use a little freshening up, Nothing the average grad student couldn't deal with. Otherwise the place was clean, safe and conveniently located.  I would happily stay here again.
57638	258571	8.0	9.0	4872495	The apartment was all we needed. Really easy access to downtown Seattle (walking distance), great to have basics supplied to make life easier, surprisingly little traffic noise. A great place to stay when visiting Seattle
57639	258571	8.0	9.0	5006953	"We were in Seattle for a week after a great week in Vancouver- we arrived early and Nicole did everything she could to prepare apartment on time in order to make it work for us. Apartment was clean and not cluttered. It is amazingly located for Capitol Hill and downtown. Pine and Pike are lovely areas to sit and drink coffee and people watch. There is a supermarket (QFC) on Broadway (few blocks away) and a convenience store around the corner (City).
The apartment is as it looks in the photos. Fully equipped kitchen and a very comfortable bed. There is high speed wifi that works, and IPTV with netflix etc. This is a ground floor apartment, facing a large concrete wall so if you're looking for an amazing view from your place this isn't for you (they don't claim to have one from the description). The laundry room downstairs is ideal with washer and dryers.

We would happily stay here again. A great stay. Thanks!"
57640	258571	8.0	9.0	5023639	I was in town for a web convention and wanted to stay in an area that I could get around easily since I did not rent a car. Nick's place totally worked! I had a great time and would stay there again!
57641	258571	8.0	9.0	5100930	"I did not meet Nicole in person, but the instructions that she left allow me to put my luggage in storage before I checked into later on in the afternoon.  Thanks!

The place itself worked out fine.  I found myself not needing all the space or amenities, mainly because I was out exploring and visiting restaurants  / watering holes right around the corner.  Maybe if I would have stayed a couple more days, I would use more of the space.

I was a bit concerned that it was near the freeway, but it was not an issue.  No street noise at all.  The location was the biggest selling point for me.

Overall this was my first airbnb experience and I was happy with the experience.


 

"
57642	258571	8.0	9.0	5224776	The apartment was nice and roomy, clean and well supplied. Great location too.
57643	258571	8.0	9.0	5506837	"We had a great experience in large part due to Nicole. Our flight was delayed, but she made sure to be there to greet us, and she was always pleasant. She was quick to respond to our requests, such as needing hand towels and wash cloths, a rubber mat for the shower and installing a converter box so that we could watch local television channels.  
The apartment was convenient to EVERYTHING, such as cafes restaurants, bars and stores, as well as Queen Anne and Downtown. I highly recommend staying in Capitol Hill. We walked everywhere or took a short bus ride. 
As for some suggestions: The sofa is quite worn out, and could use a replacement. The apartment could use a deep cleaning. On the surface it was fine, but then we noticed cobwebs and dusty areas below the surfaces. The bathroom could use a nightlight. The bedroom/bathroom area is a tight squeeze, so we sometimes bumped into the nightstand. A small light would help to avoid disturbing the person you're sleeping with. Yes, it's true, the bed is very noisy and will keep you awake. Any slight movement creates noise. We made sure to wear ear plugs the remainder of the week, and we slept much better. 
The apartment is surrounded by concrete walls, thus reducing the amount of natural light coming in. However, during the heatwave that occurred during our visit, this came in handy, as the apartment was always cool and comfortable. 
We will definitely stay in Capitol Hill again. Perhaps the same apartment. My only slight hesitancy is wanting more natural light in the apartment, but I noticed that there are two other apartments in the same building on higher floors that offer more light. I will check those out the next time we come up. 
Thanks Nicole for being such a great manager. We really appreciated your pleasant attitude and quick response."
57644	258571	8.0	9.0	5556719	This apartment was a convenient place to stay in Seattle, within walking distance of lots of attractions (definitely check out Bauhaus Coffee and Homegrown in the Melrose Market for breakfast!). It was definitely not the nicest place we stayed on our vacation, but the bed was comfortable. My biggest complaint would be the apartment smelled musty and the dark colors made it feel like staying in a cave. We didn't end up using the kitchen or living room much, because we spent our days out exploring. It was a decent place to come back to, to sleep. The photos are accurate, though I thought it would be a little bigger. Nicole was accommodating and helpful. 
57645	258571	8.0	9.0	5614638	It was perfectly fine for the price. I would stay here if you are looking for something very low maintenance and affordable. 
57646	258571	8.0	9.0	5683838	You can't beat the location: right in the heart of Capitol Hill, and steps away from great bars, cafes and shops. Pretty spacious place, though not a lot of natural light, but it has everything you need plus some extras, like a TV with plenty of DVDs, playing cards and local maps/travel books. The bed was a bit squeaky; also important to note the bedroom doesn't have a door. Overall, I'd recommend this place for people looking more for a place to sleep, less to hang out. Nick and Nicole were very communicative, friendly and accommodating with our checkout time. 
57647	258571	8.0	9.0	5822617	Husband and I were looking for an apartment on Capitol Hill near are daughter. This was the perfect place! Right down the street. Nicole was unavailable in person but was in constant contact via text and email. The place was very quaint and comfortable. Great people living there also. Always willing to give you information as to places to see. Amazingly quiet for location. The apartment was perfect for 2 people. First time we used AirBnb and we weren't sure what we would find. Thank you again Nicole and Nick for making our first experience with AirBnb a delightful one. Apt 107 Melrose Court Apartments. 
57648	258571	8.0	9.0	5853464	Nick and Nicole were great hosts, we did not get the chance to meet them but check in/check out went smoothly and they made sure we got in with no problems. The apartment is located in the perfect spot, great restaurants and shopping is within walking distance. While we were only in town for a night it was perfect for crashing after a long day of exploring. If you like sushi we highly recommend trying Shiros, best sushi we have ever eaten.
57649	258571	8.0	9.0	6139611	Comfortable stay in a great location.
57650	258571	8.0	9.0	6173433	Excellent apartment, fantastic location to explore Capitol Hill, and only 15 mins walk from downtown. 
57651	258571	8.0	9.0	6458824	"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! The Melrose Court is located in the base of Capitol Hill.  Many great places within effortless walking distance:  the Pie Bar (around the corner), the Pine  Box, one block away.  A couple blocks away: Bauhouse Coffee, Melrose Market, Wall of Sound record store, Oaxacan food, Baltic Room. An easy downhill 15-20 minute walk to Pike Place Public Market.

Nicole was a good host.  Check in and check out was easy and she responded to questions promptly before and during the stay.

The apartment is cozy and quiet, despite being in a busy area. The furniture and decor are simple and unpretentious.  It has a feeling of being the home of a busy college student. If sleek is important to you, this place might not be a good fit for you, but it is comfortable and in an excellent location.

The apartment is not spotless clean but it's clean enough - for instance, there was some food in the fridge from the prior tenants.  Again, it was perfect for us, just giving a few tips for those with other expectations.

If you are interested in exploring Seattle by foot and transit (which are the best ways to see the city), I definitely recommend staying at the Melrose Court for your next Seattle visit!"
57652	258571	8.0	9.0	6553818	Nick was a wonderful host. Cozy bedroom, clean bathroom, good price and perfect location. I enjoyed a vacation in Seattle. I would like to stay at his house again. Many thanks.
57653	258571	8.0	9.0	6624591	"Great price if you plan on being out and about!

Accommodations are perfect for the road-warrior type. 

 I rented a car while I was in town for a wedding and there is a parking lot located 1 block north of the complex.  It is reasonably priced if you don't plan on returning your car multiple times a day.  

Public transport is readily available as well. "
57654	258571	8.0	9.0	7032620	Nichole was absolutely wonderful! She was more than accommodating. Our week long stay was enriched greatly by her hospitality. 
57655	258571	8.0	9.0	7158051	Great location-only ten mins walk to seattle centre but our fave bars and cafes were actually a block away. brilliant kraft beer pub right there. Everything we needed in apartment and comfortable enough. Low prices considering proximity to city centre. 
57656	258571	8.0	9.0	7364086	Nicole was very flexible and helpful. Apartment is ok, but pretty noisy. We stayed here with a young child and at times didn't feel extremely safe. However, I spoke to locals and they assured me the neighbourhood was fine. Very close to awesome coffee, food and shopping. 
57657	258571	8.0	9.0	7432016	Comfortable apartment, not too far away from the city centre. Surrounded by some pretty cool bars and restaurants in nearby Capitol Hill.  Just don't expect a luxury stay and you won't go far wrong. 
57658	258571	8.0	9.0	7550569	"Great place in a great location!! Would stay there again!! Would have liked an extra blanket, but I didn't ask for one so not his fault......
"
57659	258571	8.0	9.0	7689291	The perfect location! We walked all around beautiful Seattle and never had to take the bus or a taxi. The apartment is...homely. Totally fine for a few day visit, but not somewhere I'd like to live. Regardless, we were very happy with our stay here. Nicole was very friendly and helpful and made sure our experience was a good one. 
57660	258571	8.0	9.0	7805359	Great location, luckily I found parking super close but it made it stressful worrying about a ticket.  The view from the windows is a little depressing but we only stayed one night so I wasn't too worried. 
57661	258571	8.0	9.0	7940998	Nick's place was very centrally located to downtown. It was clean, neat and comfortable. During our stay we needed some extra blankets and our host was there immediately to help us out, as well as with issues connecting to the wi-fi. We were properly warned about how hard the parking situation is especially on weekends. The host was very explicit about this during the time of the reservation. All in all, a great place to stay and a great host. 
57662	258571	8.0	9.0	7987602	The place was really nice and clean..Better than the pix! Thank you!
57663	258571	8.0	9.0	8017103	It was great! 
57664	258571	8.0	9.0	8111741	"Nicole and her fiancé were super nice and they did nothing wrong...as far as the apartment review here it is:
-great location, close to downtown, you can walk anywhere, but as far as Capitol Hill it truly was the rudest place I've ever been. The people totally sucked...google ""Seattle freeze"" it's a thing.
-I wanted some light in this dim lighted apartment and the blinds are all broken so you can't really open them. When you do the view is seriously depressing. 
-the apartment was freezing cold, I turned on the heaters and it didn't make the slightest difference I was shivering in my sleep
-I'm pretty sure the sheets weren't clean which is the worst, we both slept in our clothes every night
-the bed in insanely uncomfortable, bring your own pillow cuz the ones there provide zero support. 

. It's an affordable apartment in a good location but certainly not luxurious by any means. Didn't think it would be but I was at least hoping the bed would be clean and not rock hard...."
57665	258571	8.0	9.0	8145834	I needed a place to stay for one night for a concert at the Paramount Theater. Nick's apartment was perfectly located for my needs. The apartment was very clean and Nick was very accomodating!
57666	258571	8.0	9.0	8203160	The location is excellent and the apartment provides all the things you look for in a safe shelter.
57667	258571	8.0	9.0	8245699	Easy checkin. Nice location near downtown.  Great price for the location. The apartment was clean and the bed and pillows were comfortable. We liked that the listing was pet free due to my wife's allergies. Parking did take a bit of time at night but in the end we ended up just a few blocks away. This is a basement apartment so the view is of two cement walls but we only used the location to sleep so it didn't affect our stay which was only for one night.
57668	258571	8.0	9.0	8311368	Location was great in Capitol Hill.  Nicole was very responsive and helpful.  The apartment was clean and everything worked.  An iron was provided upon request.  No complaints.  Definitely a better deal than hotels and other airbnb offerings.
57669	258571	8.0	9.0	8365265	Convenient, comfortable and easy. Thanks!
57670	258571	8.0	9.0	8503718	We never met Nick, Nicole was the one who took care of logistics, we never met her either but we received clrear easy instructions on how to find the keys to the apartment. Look no further, THIS is the best location. I loved Capitol Hill, everything is within walking distance. Having an apartment to ourselves with everything we needed was awesome. This place is the best!!!
57671	258571	8.0	9.0	8762908	Great location. 
57672	258571	8.0	9.0	9039945	Cheap and cheerful apartment. Friendly and responsive host. 
57673	258571	8.0	9.0	9316656	Apartment was very accommodating and was fine for my three week stay. It was comfortable, and close to a lot of places of interest. Capital Hill is a cool neighborhood with many dining and drinking establishments to choose from. The apartment was also a close walk to downtown and South Lake Union. It was a bit cold, but I did stay during the winter and during a not so normal cold stretch. The extra space heater definitely helped. Nicole answered all of my questions quickly during my stay, and even brought me an iron quickly after I requested it. The roku also was nice, as I got to catch up on some shows on netflix. Would definitely stay again.
57674	258571	8.0	9.0	9355966	Nick and Nicole were great hosts! Very accessible and left great instructions.
57675	258571	8.0	9.0	9495516	The location could not be more perfect! Small, but perfectly situated in Capitol Hill. 
57676	258571	8.0	9.0	9680494	"Nicks apartment was wonderfully located-it was not only easy to walk to tons of bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill, but also downtown and the waterfront , and if you have a car it is situated right off a highway.

The place was suitable, but I would recommend it for two only.  We had three and it was a bit small for that number of guests, and one had to sleep on a couch.  Also, the bedroom lacks a door which made changing and privacy tough.  Also, make sure to Bring towels as not much was provided.

In all, good value and great location , but a bit dirty and the photos make it seem nicer, brighter and larger than the apartment really is.

Also- nick was a very communicative host and returned my messages and let me check in early- a great accommodator!"
57677	258571	8.0	9.0	9982840	"Me and my gf booked Nick's place for a week months before our trip. The apartment looked nice, had good reviews, and wasn't too pricey. 

When we arrived at the airport we took the light rail to Seattle and were allowed to check in early, which was great. Once in the apartment, our first thought was it looked better in the pictures. The apartment needed some cleaning. There was quite a bit of dust built up on most of the appliances and when we checked the bed there were a few hairs on the sheets, so we decided to wash them before sleeping on the bed. When we checked out we tried to leave it clean. We wiped many of the surfaces and even threw away a few things that were expired. 

Setting that aside, the place was pretty comfortable and it had everything we needed. The location was probably the best thing about the apartment, close to downtown, Pikes Place Market, and Capital Hill. Nick also allowed us to check out late, another great thing because our flight was in the afternoon. 

The apartment has lots of potential just needs a bit of work. I would recommend staying a few days but I would probably not recommend staying a week.  "
57678	258571	8.0	9.0	10126940	Clean space, on the darker and older side, and the bed is very noisy but overall it was perfect for the price and you cannot beat the location.
57679	258571	8.0	9.0	10157197	Great location. Easy check in and out. Modest accommodations but quite nice for the price.
57680	258571	8.0	9.0	10244249	Nick was quick to get back to us when we had questions.
57681	258571	8.0	9.0	10309916	Just what my girlfriend and I needed, an affordable pad in a great part of the city. We had very few parking issues after switching rentals to a Fiat. Tricky keeping the apartment warm in the middle of winter, but we survived, otherwise we were lucky to find you. Thanks Nick/Nicole!
57682	258571	8.0	9.0	10357982	Nicole was really friendly and welcoming. The location of the apartment is awesome; it's very close to downtown but close enough to Pike/Pine and Broadway for some good food and drinks. I recommend this place!
57683	258571	8.0	9.0	10494255	A perfectly pleasant apartment at the base of Capitol Hill in Seattle. Very convenient for access to the convention center and downtown Seattle and near a lot of great places to eat in the Capitol Hill area. The apartment is well-suited for two people and well stocked with the basic cooking essentials making it easier for people who don't want to eat out all the time. While I didn't actually meet Nick or Nicole (the onsite manager), they were very quick to respond over email and we were able to coordinate key pickups and dropoffs with no trouble. I'd certainly stay here again if I were to come back to Seattle!
57684	258571	8.0	9.0	10532910	Stay was great. Apartment was clean and close to the Capital Hill scene!
57685	258571	8.0	9.0	10673815	For the location, it's hard to beat the price and convenience of this spot. Just a couple blocks from downtown with tons of great cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. Nicole was quick to address my needs including arriving early. Any issues I had with the property are fairly minor.
57686	258571	8.0	9.0	10853375	"
This was my first time using airbnb and my experience at Nick's apartment exceeded my expectation. I felt at home from the minute I stepped inside this cute and cozy place. Nicole (Nick was out of town at the time) was very helpful and she made sure that we had a pleasant stay. I stayed with a good friend of mine from Vancouver and we were both amazed how convenient this place is to everything. I would definitely book one of these apartments again when I visit Seattle in the future. "
57687	258571	8.0	9.0	10955026	Melrose Court was convenient, quiet, and well equipped. The clean rooms were ample for 2, the bed was comfortable and great coffee was just around the corner. I plan on staying here the next time I come back to Portland!
57688	258571	8.0	9.0	11055002	My friend and I stayed in Seattle for three nights and thought this place was stellar. It had plenty of space for the two of us, and the location is hard to beat. Cool, trendy bars nearby and a reasonable walk down to the market were musts for us. The next time I visit Seattle I intend to stay here again. 
57689	258571	8.0	9.0	11168550	Spatious apartment in a very convenient location, only a few minutes from Downtown and close to a lot of great coffeeshops (Bauhaus) and bars. The apartment was clean, and there is also a well-equipped kitchen. Key exchange through lockbox. The apartment doesn't have much daylight but that wasn't really a problem as I was out most of the day. 
57690	258571	8.0	9.0	11269285	We really enjoyed our stay. There were a few issues at check in due to the cleaning service but Nicole was responsive and had a place for us to store our bags until the room was ready. Nick even called that evening to make sure everything worked out. Perfect location to downtown. Walking distance to everything. It was nice to have a quiet place to come home to after a day of touring. Thanks for the great hospitality! 
57691	258571	8.0	9.0	11390499	Check in was easy. Allowed us to drop our bags as we arrived early. Good location, close to everything and walkable if you're willing. If not, transport is close as well. Unsure as to how often the bedding is changed, noticed a few worrying stains and found a pair of socks tucked between the mattress and bed frame. In saying that, I would still recommend this place for the price and location.
57692	258571	8.0	9.0	11591116	My first experience using airbnb and it was great. I recommend this location to everyone.
57693	258571	8.0	9.0	11631465	This was my 2 friends and my own first experience with Airbnb, and it was a great first impression.  The apartment was a bit small for 3 people and the couch wasn't the comfiest, but the overall experience was awesome.  Smooth key pick up & drop and a great location. Thanks!
57694	258571	8.0	9.0	11718490	"I stayed in Melrose Court #107 during a recent trip to Seattle for a business conference. Very happy with my decision. The location of the apartment can't be beat. It's a 5 minute walk from downtown (and the convention center) and a 5 minute walk in the opposite direction from Capitol Hill, which is filled with countless restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and even live music clubs and a great record store (EM).

The apartment was properly priced, had a nice size living room and a small kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. The apartment was quiet and came with Netflix on the TV and a comfortable bed. There was a giant dresser and a closet with hangers. Nicole was available, real nice and very helpful whenever needed.  

Not sure what else to say. This was my first Air bnb experience. I'd for sure do Air bnb again and would also stay in this apartment again on a future Seattle trip. "
57695	258571	8.0	9.0	11813020	Place was great, small things like coffee Mahoney not working and the check in was late, but the place was nice and was a great location.
57696	258571	8.0	9.0	11992044	This apartment was clean, and in an awesome location. There were tons of great places to eat right around the corner. They were even awesome enough to provide a little guide book on the awesome things to do in the area!
57697	258571	8.0	9.0	12184271	Checking in was easy. There are free parking spaces near the apartment which you have to move every 2 hrs in daytime or you can park at public parking nearby. The place is nice, a bit too small for 3 ppl. Everything works well. The heater was broke and Nicole brought us a new one on the next day. Walkable distance to Pike Place market and it is not far from bus stop.
57698	258571	8.0	9.0	12503612	The host is very responsive and helpful. The location of the place is ideal. Walking distance to a lot of the tourist sites in Seattle. Highly recommend.
57699	258571	8.0	9.0	12626610	The location was great and check-in was a breeze.  Parking is a bit tight but there is plenty of public transport in the area.  A great value for our weekend in Seattle.
57700	258571	8.0	9.0	12777001	"We stayed in Seattle 5days. 
We really enjoyed stay at Nick's appartment. 

Melrose avenue is à gréât location.. You Can do everything by foot. Also it´s à good place for going out the Night : dîner and pub. 

The appartment was so clean, quiet and nicely fitted out. 

Also, information gave by Nick for findinig the place were perfect ! We found it very easely ! 

Thank you so much ! 
"
57701	258571	8.0	9.0	12866566	Nick was very helpful and informative about his place in Seattle. I had no trouble finding or accessing the keys to the apartment. The apartment was in a great location, really close to the Paramount theater and a ton of restaurants and bars. 
57702	258571	8.0	9.0	12946231	"""Nick's apartment is very well situated, a 5-10 min walk from Capitol Hill and 15-20 min walk from Pike Place Market and Seattle Centre, all places which we have enjoyed visiting. Convention Place is only a 5 min walk as well, and is a major interchange for buses which made it perfect to visit places like the The Northgate Mall (where there is a great Seafood and Sushi buffet restaurant - Bluefin buffet) and the University of Washington. Visiting for 2 days from France and UK, Seattle was our third city break after Toronto and Vancouver where we stayed in modern high-rise apartments with stunning views which greatly enhanced our trips, but the equivalent in Seattle would have proven a lot more expensive, so we chose Melrose Court for its great all-round location. The description and photos on the Airbnb site are accurate, there's plenty of room for 2-3 people (large lounge and fair size bedroom), tv with Netflix, lots of guides and maps for Seattle, not much of a view from the windows unfortunately which have to be left open during part of the day preferably to avoid damp, and Nicole is quick to respond to any queries. All in all a good stay.
"
57703	258571	8.0	9.0	13045390	Location, location, location.   This place has an excellent location.  It is within walking distance to all the cool tourist spots.  The neighborhood around the apartment has lots of cool bars and restaurants to check out.  Plus you can't find a place even close to this price anywhere near the city.   But this is just an apartment.  No frills room but has everything you could need besides a microwave.  This place gave us a good preview of what it would be like to live downtown.   I would definitely recommend this place.  
57704	258571	8.0	9.0	13128528	"Everything was good except the couch. It looked to be very old and rough. Almost like it had been in the rain for days on end. Neither one of us wanted to sit on it or even put our luggage on it. Also, the fan in the living room must've had been burnt because it was black and one of the prongs were missing.
Overall though, it was a decent place to stay. "
57705	258571	8.0	9.0	13227891	"Great Neighborhood. Clean and simple place. Worth with you pay for it. 

Simple checkin and checkout process. "
57706	258571	8.0	9.0	14157270	Nick provides plenty of information to his guests---where to eat and play in Seattle. His information is very helpful for tourists and visitors. The apartment is very clean and neat, just as is described. The neighbourhood is very quiet and close to bus and subway stations.
57707	258571	8.0	9.0	14196654	"Nicole was responsive prior to our arrival. Very good directions were given to the apartment and to accessing the lock box for the key. 

The apartment is in need of a deep cleaning. The bed is very soft. There were no bugs in the apartment."
57708	258571	8.0	9.0	14542067	Great and very clean space in a perfect location!  
57709	258571	8.0	9.0	14680920	"Great communication throughout and thorough instructions about arrival/departure. 
The apartment itself was lovely: exactly as described in walking distance of downtown with all the facilities anyone could need (living room with sofa, TV etc, fully kitted out kitchen, nice bedroom and bathroom).
Haven't got a bad thing to say about it, thank you Nick and Nicole - A* AirBnBers!"
57710	258571	8.0	9.0	15181154	It was a very positive experience. Easy check in check out process. Nicole is very courteous. Everything as promised! Clean comfortable apartment. Also the apartment is in a great neighborhood. Nicole leaves list of recommended places to eat. Everything I tried was spot on! Highly recommended to stay here 
57711	258571	8.0	9.0	15443410	This place was just enough space for our visit! Close to everything we did including walking to pike place market and the space needle! Also Nicole was very helpful and attentive! 
57712	258571	8.0	9.0	15592047	The apartment was great, located in a cool neighbourhood and only a 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed. I didn't meet Nick or Nicole during my stay but I had no problems while I was there. 
57713	258571	8.0	9.0	15674821	We really enjoyed staying at Nick's apt. The location was great and within walking distance to lots of the fun stuff we wanted to do. Nicole is extremely friendly and attentive, and her fast responses were extremely helpful. Check-in/out was easy as well.
57714	258571	8.0	9.0	15915877	Great place! Great location, easy to check in and out. Close to everything. Would recommend.
57715	258571	8.0	9.0	16297323	"Easy to find and quick to settle in. The apartment is well kitted out with things you need for a short stay in Seattle. The location is ideal for neat local spots like Melrose market or walking up the Pine-Pike corridor. Equally you can walk straight down to the waterfront without breaking a sweat. 
The information provided is more than ample for what we needed and served as a good reference guide and gave us some ideas."
57716	258571	8.0	9.0	16575351	Nick was so organized and had very easy-to-follow instructions on how to check into the apartment.  If you're checking in later in the evenings, this is a great choice for the key is in a lock box out front rather than meeting someone for a key.  Bed was extremely comfortable and the apartment very clean. I lived that there was a binder full of great restaurants to visit nearby.  Parking was a little tricky for it's all street parking, but we didn't have an issue finding a spot. A close walk to Capitol Hill and other popular areas. It is near the highway, but surprisingly quiet for the window faces the courtyard and not the street, so a great place for light sleepers.  All in all very satisfied - Thanks Nick!
57717	258571	8.0	9.0	16625409	"Good location near downtown freely in and out . Lots of utilities in kitchen.  floor and bed cover clean condition is so so. 
Good for more than 3people."
57718	258571	8.0	9.0	16893478	I stayed here in late July/early August.  I had to arrive earlier than the listed check-in time to drop off my luggage, and Nicole was very helpful and understanding, allowing me to store my luggage until check-in.  The neighborhood is perfectly located, and the apartment was clean and well-furnished.  Because this was a business trip, I ended up staying in on most nights and found the kitchen to be very useful.  On the couple of nights I did go out, I found several great restaurants in the area.  Overall, this is a wonderful place to stay and I would definitely go back!
57719	258571	8.0	9.0	17432153	"The Good: Nicole was communicative and clear, which we appreciated.    We had some issues with the Wifi and she got right back to me to sort it out.  The location was great for brewpubs and restaurants, but a long walk to the ""touristy"" stuff down by the water.  This was fine - we enjoyed staying in a cool, local-populated neighborhood.  Don't be fooled - it's safe at night!
The Bad: I have to be honest about the apartment, though, and say that it was not pleasant.  The smell of mold or just mustiness hit us when we entered, and it didn't really improve even with the windows open.  I am by no means a ""clean freak,"" but the apartment felt dingy.  There was hair in the tub, the floor was dusty, and the comforter felt dirty as well.  The couch is chewed up and should be retired.  There was no laundry detergent under the sink, so we bought some AND paid for the washer/dryer in the basement.  It was not entirely clear that we would have to pay for it in the listing.  "
57720	258571	8.0	9.0	18144361	Nick's place was simple and cozy and we had a good time staying at his place. The listing is accurate and the place is in a good location close by to any number of things in walking distance. I'd note that the bathroom is a little small and for some reason the wifi password wouldn't seem to work for my phone, but we weren't in the apartment long enough for that to be a problem so we didn't bother Nick about it. Sadly didn't get to actually meet Nick, but thanks a lot for letting us stay!
57721	258571	8.0	9.0	18467633	This was a wonderful place to stay in Seattle.  The location is fantastic, just minutes away from the Melrose Market area, Pike Place market, lots of shopping and fantastic food.  The apartment had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.  The host was very responsive before and during my stay, which put me at ease.  The host even put together a binder with recommended restaurants nearby and information about the listing.  Despite being in a busy area, it was very quiet.  If you are looking to experience Seattle like a local would, this is the place to stay!
57722	258571	8.0	9.0	18872532	"Nick and Nicole were in constant communication about the listing from the time we booked.  They answered any questions we had and were responsive.  The apartment was more than adequate for the stay and was clean and comfortable.

If you are going to Seattle and want a cheap but great place close to almost everything, look no further."
57723	258571	8.0	9.0	19314927	The place was exactly as listed, super convenient to everything!
57724	258571	8.0	9.0	19439486	"Nick's apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures. There's nothing fancy about this place, but it's an excellent home away from home. Kitchen, pantry, bathroom were all stocked with items that you would want in your own home. Communication and getting in to the apartment were a breeze. 

Location is really the best part. Capital Hill is an awesome neighborhood and Nick's place happens to be directly in between two of my favorite places in Seattle (Pine Box, which is a beer bar in an old mortuary) and Pie Bar. I would definitely stay here again. "
57725	258571	8.0	9.0	19523241	"Nick's place is cool, I could have the whole department during my stay.
The place is big and comfortable. The location is good too, most of the famous spots are in walking distance. 
Nicole provided me the clear information for checking-in. Everything was smooth and easy."
57726	258571	8.0	9.0	19671666	Great experience with the hosts, who are responsive and informative. The apt itself is comfortable enough but could use an upgrade of furnishings which would help make the overall place more pleasant. I couldn't help but think the couch came from a dumpster dive. It worked for us for 2 nights but if you spend a lot of time in apt or for a longer stay I'd opt for another place that meets your needs. Our biggest concern was location which is awesome. Windows look out to concrete wall a few yards away. Bathroom access is through the bedroom. No bedroom door. Makeshift closet for clothes (next to water heater).
57727	258571	8.0	9.0	20494200	Arrived mid evening and there was a bit of confusion with keys.the last occupant seem to have mis laid the keys luckily we were able to get the spare set which is good as the actual keys never turned up again.the apartment was big and very spacious. There was Netflix on the TV which was perfect if you were wanting an early night and had good film choices. The bed was really comfy too! Neighbours seemed really nice also and the location was perfect for us as Capitol Hill was the area we wanted to be in the most!i love Seattle and would come back for sure!cheers
57728	258571	8.0	9.0	20820142	Everything was set up as described. Photos are very accurate. The apt is in a great area for walking, too.
57729	258571	8.0	9.0	21463048	Nick and Nicole were great!  Excellent communication and getting into the apartment was super easy with the lockbox.  The apartment is a great size and located in a fun area of Seattle with many bars and restaurants near by. The walk to downtown and to Pike's market was short, about 10-15 minutes and there were plenty of bus routes near by.  The apartment was stocked with everything one would need; dishes, coffee, silverware, towels and even an iron!  I would recommend Nick's apartment for you next trip to Seattle. 
57730	258571	8.0	9.0	21598994	The location of this apartment is fantastic. It's so easy to walk downtown or hang out in the cap hill area. Communication about checking in and out was really easy. The apartment was quiet and clean. The only downside is the quality of the furniture and amenities. I had a good idea of what it was going to be like based on the other reviews, but there could definitely be some updating. 
57731	258571	8.0	9.0	21928079	The apartment was exactly like the pictures.  Older apartment but clean.  Easy process to check in and out.  Very helpful brochures and maps on the desk.  For people staying multiple nights the netflix account helps a lot.  Parking is very limited in the area but not hard to find.  Overall and good stay and would consider if I'm ever in Seattle.
57732	258571	8.0	9.0	22508523	Place looked exactly like the photo. Good area next to a lot of bars and where its easy to see the area!
57733	258571	8.0	9.0	22716698	Extremely close to everything being in cap hill and only ten minute walk to pike place. Loved the location and price. 
57734	258571	8.0	9.0	23267482	"This was the second time that we have stayed at Nick's place. Once again, it was clean and comfortable. However, communication was difficult.  Checking in and checking out were a problem because of lack of access to keys to the storage unit and the apartment and because of lack of response from Nicole. As a result, we had to make our own arrangements with the previous guest, the subsequent guests, and the cleaning lady -- all of which succeeded, more by luck than by planning.



"
57735	258571	8.0	9.0	24300341	Nick's place was great! He provided everything we needed to know on the front end. The apartment is represented very accurately by the pictures and it is a clean and comfortable place. The location is the best part about it. We could walk to places in Capitol hill and downtown really easily. I would definitly recommend this place.
57736	258571	8.0	9.0	24856935	The place is just like the pictures. It was a little cold at first, but after leaving the heater on the temperature was good. It was the end of December, so it's understandable.
57737	258571	8.0	9.0	25307741	Nick's place was exactly what I needed in terms of affordability, and proximity to downtown Seattle where I was attending a week-long conference. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and well taken care of. Furthermore, the location is fantastic for someone who wants to explore the city. It's about nine blocks from Pike Market, and a multitude of retail stores, venders, bars, restaurants, and more. It's literally two buildings away from the Pine Box, perhaps my new favorite bar, and about a block away from the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room--It's like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but for coffee. I would definitely stay here again.
57738	258571	8.0	9.0	25415531	Apartment was pretty much as advertised.  It was clean, close to downtown, and met my needs while I was in Seattle.  It was great to have save a few bucks by using the kitchen too.  There were a few minor inconveniences that came up, but nothing major and the manager of the space was very quick to respond to emails.
57739	258571	8.0	9.0	25598340	Great neighborhood and a very comfortable place. Thanks Nick and Nicole!
57740	258571	8.0	9.0	26099455	We had a great time staying at nicks place.  The location was perfect for our needs!  Thanks for hosting us!
57741	258571	8.0	9.0	26225647	"Great location and great little apartment, within easy reach (not more than 10 minutes by foot) of Seattle downtown, convention center and Seattle transit center. Also very easy to get to from I5. There is a decent grocery store just one block away and lots of Capitol hill cafes around. Parking wasn't a big problem (in PM, though), we were able to park either right in front or across the street.

Apartment is on the ground floor, but feels more like basement, as the windows are looking at supporting walls of the adjacent building. Clean and quiet. Decently furnished and with a small kitchen, missing only a microwave. There were basic supplies in the kitchen, like cooking oil and spices, to get you started cooking.

Best for two people, as the third would really struggle on the couch. The bathroom is very small, but in good working order."
57742	258571	8.0	9.0	26427127	"TL; DR - if you are a germaphobe or have a strong sense of smell - look elsewhere.  Otherwise, great location.  I was able to walk everywhere and saw most Seattle attractions and eateries this way.  Within the neighborhood, there are very good restaurants and bars.  Pike Place about 10 blocks away.  Nicole, the apartment manager, was easy to get a hold of via the website.  The key access was easy, since it is stored in a keybox near the entrance.  

Like other reviewers mentioned, what you see is what you get.  Just imagine these pictures with less brightness (The windows look out into a high cement wall, so not much light - but it is Seattle anyway).  During the time of booking this place, I thought it was a good price for 4 nights and we won't spend much time at the apartment anyway.  After staying there the first night, I wish I spent a little more for an updated airbnb or a hotel.  What isn't pictured and what I didn't account for, was the smell.  Look at that couch and just think about what that couch should/would smell like.  There was an overall mildew/moldy smell that perhaps came from the lack of air circulation and piled wet leaves right outside the windows.  Nonetheless, it was this smell alone that made my stay uncomfortable.  I had to go out and buy some air fresheners, but that was only a temporary fix.  The bed was really squishy, the bed frame very squeaky.  If you are used to a firm mattress, this bed might be a problem for you.  The pillows were really stained and yellow.  I was so happy I brought a thick sheet so I was able to cover them.  I think there was an old blood stain on one of the blankets.  I tried my best to just sleep with a sheet.   The bathroom, and most importantly the bathtub, seemed clean.  There was just that mildewy smell we couldn't escape.  We didn't use the kitchen, but there was a leak that would come out of the counter area.  I think a previous reviewer said it came from the shower.  "
57743	258571	8.0	9.0	26738186	Convenient location. House is just as pictured. 
57744	258571	8.0	9.0	27649847	Apartment was as described. Only concern is that the bed was really squeaky, but overall the apartment was clean. Roku box was a great addition and location was perfect since it is pretty close to downtown and has several bars and restaurants in the area. 
57745	258571	8.0	9.0	27820971	Great and efficient host, place was exactly as described. This is my second stay and would stay again!
57746	258571	8.0	9.0	28080478	Nick's apartment was absolutely wonderful!  My friend and I stayed for 5 nights while on a bestie trip to Seattle.  She took the bed while I took the couch, and we were both very comfortable.  Having a kitchen was super helpful, and the apartment itself was close to a lot of cool bars and shops.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Bonus:  There's an arcade bar right on the corner.
57747	258571	8.0	9.0	28305404	"*Easy to get the keys for the apt.
*Easy walk into Pike and Pine and the Westlake hub for airport links.
*Capitol hill, for me, turned out to be my preferred choice for an evening out. The area had a good vibe, some interesting people, some history (a few metres up the street is where Bruce Lee had his funeral) and plenty of options for food, breweries and coffee.
*The apt would be a tight squeeze for 2 people, but there is no reason, other than to sleep, to spend time in the apt when you are in Seattle. Get out and explore."
57748	258571	8.0	9.0	28576661	Great place, great location, great host! Exactly what we were looking for.
57749	258571	8.0	9.0	28636867	Everything was as described by all other positive reviews. The apartment was clean and checking in was a smooth process. I recommend this place to anyone traveling through Seattle. 
57750	258571	8.0	9.0	29156897	I never met Nicole or Nick, but the check-in and check-out process went smoothly. Nicole was usually prompt to return my messages, and allowed us to use the storage locker for our luggage after we checked out while waiting for our flight. Since it's a garden apartment, there was very little natural light, and a musty/mildew smell despite air fresheners and multiple dehumidifiers. The bed was very soft and squeaky, but comfortable. If you leave the bedroom window open, there is a considerable amount of traffic noise. The furnishings in this apartment could use some updating, but the neighborhood is absolutely fantastic. Lots of restaurants and nightlife, and a short walk to downtown. If you are looking for a budget stay in a vibrant neighborhood, this is the place.
57751	258571	8.0	9.0	29552854	"I found this to be a delightful location. Central to both The downtown and capital hill sections of the city. There is a lot of interesting night life in the area. 

As for the apartment, it was a clean and very cozy place. It's an ideal place for a couple, or just a lone adventurer. Check in/out was easy and well managed. 

I would highly recommend this location to anyone headed to Seattle. "
57752	258571	8.0	9.0	29824731	"I adored this awesome little apartment in Capitol Hill. It has everything you could ever want from an airbnb: location, space and value. 

I could have literally went to Seattle and scouted the city, and still not come up with a better location than this spot. It is walking distance to everything. The neighborhood is filled with the best coffee shops in the world, amazing food and fantastic drink. 

The space itself was really nice too. I mean, just look at the pictures! It is as advertised. Excellent storage as well; the provided bureau is enough for 2 people. Also, it is stocked with tons of personal use items you may have forgotten: everything from tylenol to shampoo to spices in the kitchen. The alka-seltzer was a particularly nice touch after a long nite of drinking in all the awesome NEARBY AMAZING BARS. 

Communication was super easy: in and out without a problem. Nicole left a detailed sheet of paper. 

Overall, this is an amazing spot and I give it the highest recommendation possible. "
57753	258571	8.0	9.0	30259717	Listing description was fairly accurate. 
57754	258571	8.0	9.0	30443382	While I would not choose to live here personally, as far as a place to crash while you're in town, it's awesome. The location is perfect - you're right between downtown and Capitol Hill, and it's really walkable! I loved my vacation to Seattle, and honestly, this place was a part of it. I got a feel for the neighborhoods, too, and I felt safe at this place. This apartment did everything we (my friend and I) needed while we were in town for a conference: place to sleep, shower, get ready, put leftovers, etc. We were mostly out and about, minus sleeping, so we didn't chill there too much. Overall good, but nothin' too fancy.
57755	258571	8.0	9.0	30586734	Great experience. Just as described. The place was easy to walk to where I needed to go and felt safe. Nicole was super attentive as things came up. Thanks! 
57756	258571	8.0	9.0	30924351	"Our experience was pretty good. Location was perfect and the room had all the basics and more. The room was a lot older than we initially expected, but it wasn't really a problem for us. Only thing that was difficult was parking. We had rented a car and finding parking was a bit of a hassle. We would eventually find a street parking spot, but usually not before driving around a bit. 

Also we couldn't find an outlet in the bathroom, so we had to dry/straighten/curl our hair in the living room using our laptop camera as a mirror. It wasn't a big problem for us, but just be prepared. "
57757	258571	8.0	9.0	31935553	Perfect location! Simple, clear instructions, great communication. A smooth and easy stay! Hope to come back some day. Thanks!
57758	258571	8.0	9.0	32174165	The host is very well organized and is quick to reply to emails. The location of this flat is amazing. This flat is within 30 secs of great pubs and restaurants. There is plenty of buses only minutes walk away. The flat is cosy but has everything you need. We would stay here again without question. 
57759	258571	8.0	9.0	32411125	The apartment was a nice private space in a fantastic location for walking to Downtown and in Capitol Hill, although parking got tricky. Checking in and out and communicating with the hosts went very smoothly, would recommend if you want to be staying in a vibrant part of town!
57760	258571	8.0	9.0	32940955	Great location. Easy check in/out. Don't plan on spending too much time indoors.
57761	258571	8.0	9.0	33503942	My parents had a great time staying at Nick's house in capitol hill. Nicole is a great host and is very welcoming. The house had all essentials and I will recommend this place for any future visitors!
57762	258571	8.0	9.0	34041960	Nicole gave us very thorough information, as we were checking in after a late flight. The apartment is clean and convenient to the highway. Some items in the apartment need upgrading (broken blinds, old shower curtain). Very close to restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Parking was easy late at night but that might have been lucky.
57763	258571	8.0	9.0	34420972	Has all the basic amenities, easy access in and out of building, quiet, and has the best location in the city!!! The neighborhood is bustling with things to do, downtown is close by, and public transit is close by. Also Nicole is very explicit in her instructions and timely in her response.
57764	258571	8.0	9.0	35433128	We had a great time in Seattle thanks to Nicks cozy apartment. The apartment access is super easy and it is located in a great spot. The apartment has all the amenities you might need + internet! Parking was indeed a little tricky but it is not that hard to find spots in the surrounding streets. 
57765	258571	8.0	9.0	35647405	"Overall, a decent place to stay in Seattle if you don't plan on spending too much time indoors. Close to many entertainment options, which was very convenient. Major downtown must-sees were generally between 25-35 minutes walking. 

Pros: All instructions provided by Nicole were great. Easy to get in the building complex with the provided instructions. Relatively convenient location and amenities provided. 
Cons: With three people, it was a bit tight. Wi-fi connection was a bit finnicky and slow. The apartment complex itself is a bit older, and this can be felt throughout the building, with some muskiness. "
57766	258571	8.0	9.0	36097709	Great location!
57767	258571	8.0	9.0	36389112	"Very satisfied with my stay in Capitol
Hill, this location is great. Was able to walk to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, the art museum and Space Needle. The apartment provided plenty of space for me, and my only complaint would be that the mattress is very worn/saggy and needs to be replaced. Other than that, I was very happy with my stay and would stay here again. "
57768	258571	8.0	9.0	36763869	"The location in Capitol Hill was great. It was a convenient to many restaurants, shops and bars. Checking in and out was easy and Nicole was very easy to reach. A few downsides were the lack of an outlet in the restroom and while the couch was comfortable but seemed dirty. It is a safe area despite the outward appearance. Much more suggested for 1-2 guests than 3. Overall a fine experience. 
"
57769	258571	8.0	9.0	37292288	This property is in a great location that's walking distance from many unique bars and restaurants. We actually acquired a favorite while we were there -- Six Arms, try it! It's also a hotspot for Uber pickups, since it's right by the highway. The apartment itself was tidy and even though there was a heat wave and no A/C, it was kept cool by being on the bottom floor and the host provided several fans to chill the space. The kitchen is pretty minimal (no microwave). But if you're traveling with a party of 3, you'll fit no problem. The host was also very responsive and happy to provide anything we needed. 
57770	258571	8.0	9.0	38122605	I was given the wrong lockbox code for the storage unit, which caused some confusion, but after 10 or so minutes, Nicole was able to buzz me in. The bed also was very uncomfortable, but other than those two things, they stay was good. Great location and clean.
57771	258571	8.0	9.0	38489068	Really enjoyed the location and found lots of great restaurants in Capitol Hill within minutes of this place. We arrived by Boltbus which stops by the train station, right at one end of the bus tunnel. It was easy to just catch any bus to the other end of the tunnel and then walk a couple minutes to the apartment. Nicole was very communicative and the lockbox system was so simple. The apartment itself is older and basic so don't expect luxury.  However due to the price and location we would stay here again. We recommend Pike Street Fish Fry for lunch; Pine Box, Elysium, and Six Arms for drinks or dinner; and for dessert - Molly Moon's and Pie Bar.
57772	258571	8.0	9.0	38743640	Well...the location is 5 stars. Located near all the best Seattle has to offer.  That being said, the apartment itself is extremely outdated.  On your way up to the door you'll see tons of spiderwebs and dust. First step in the door you will smell mold. Dehumidifiers all around the apartment.  Popcorn ceilings and hot water that lasts about 5 minutes. Advertised a couple items that were not operable. Wifi didn't work, refrigerator did not work. (Brought leftovers home that went to waste. ) We found a bug in the bathroom as well. Place was neat but I felt like we were overcharged for what we received. Did the location make our stay worth it?...yes. Would we stay here again.? Most likely not. We're pretty easy to please, but this was a bit too much. Hate to right a bad review but I would have liked to know this beforehand given the price.  Host was very nice though! 
57773	258571	8.0	9.0	39007872	The listing and itinerary was really clear. I didn't spend too much time in the apartment, but the bed was very comfy and the area was ideal, the biggest plus for me. It's nice to be within walking distance to so many restaurants and the downtown tunnel corridor for public transit options. I'd stay here again if I were in Seattle.
57774	258571	8.0	9.0	39251982	Great location, clean apartment, simple entry process. Parking is a bit of a hassle, but we got a good night of sleep and were within walking distance of several bars and restaurants.
57775	258571	8.0	9.0	39913553	This accommodation was easily accessible and we arrived to a spotlessly clean apartment. Great for what we needed, something basic and comfortable to leave our bags and rest our heads each night! There is lots of parking close by which is very convenient. Neighbourhood was great, bars, restaurants and coffee shops all nearby and a short stroll down to pike place market.
57776	258571	8.0	9.0	40154780	Location location! This apartment was exactly what I expected. Has everything you need without any extras. Very affordable in a prime location. The property was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Nick!
57777	258571	8.0	9.0	40347004	The apartment was very cozy and fit our needs perfectly. Great neighborhood with easy access in and out. Only hard part was parking. We had to search and search to find a place that allowed us to park overnight and not have to renew at 7am.
57778	258571	8.0	9.0	40899813	"Nothing fancy but perfectly serviceable apartment, great value for money in the heart of capitol hill. 

Light sleepers beware: very, very creaky bed."
57779	258571	8.0	9.0	41924479	The price for the place was cheap and affordable. The listing and itinerary was clear and concise which helped a lot with getting access to the apartment and parking. The apartment was cozy and was at a great location. You have access to variety of restaurants on Capitol Hills and not too far from the Seattle Conventional Center. There are a lot of Edward Norton movies but not a lot if you love Edward Norton movies. 
57780	258571	8.0	9.0	45238024	This place was in such a great location and was a great price. It was more or less exactly what I expected from an apartment in seattle. I would highly recommend it if you need a place for a few nights. It's cozy and has a fridge and stove for preparing food and snacks. 
57781	258571	8.0	9.0	46617818	Nicks place is in a great location, and is walkable from the Westlake light rail downtown. There is a courtesy kit with shampoo, conditioner, etc. and a hairdryer. If you don't see the electrical switch in the bathroom, look up! It's in the light fixture.  Very comfy spot. Only negative - the bed is very creaky. If you're a light sleeper, and you're with a partner that turns a lot, this could be a problem. Other than that, it's a great spot!!
57782	258571	8.0	9.0	46883890	First off, an honest review of the actual apartment. This place could use some updating. The apartment complex itself is pretty quiet, no loud neighbors, which was nice. The room is down a semi creepy hallway next to a storage unit where we were able to keep our stuff when we first arrived (Read on later for storage unit use.) The apartment is small, but two people fit pretty comfortably. There is a faint musty smell, but that disappears pretty quickly if you open some windows and turn on the fans that are provided. The couch is old but comfortable, however I would not suggest that you use this as a sleeping option. There is a queen sized bed that is actually quite comfy, but was so creaky that we would wake each other up sometimes if we rolled over in our sleep. The bathroom was about as basic as it gets and I had two complaints: 1. There were no outlets in there and no other mirrors anywhere in the apartment which made doing our hair a little bit trickier. 2. No water pressure in the shower and anyone over 5’8” is going to need to do some bending to get underneath the shower head. We barely touched the kitchen, so I really can’t say how conducive this place would be for cooking. Oh and one more thing, the outlets in this place SUCK! They plugs literally just fall out of the wall and then hours later you realized your stuff hasn’t even been charging. Luckily there are some power strips scattered throughout the apartment so I suggest you find a reliable socket and plug everything into that. Overall, the apartment was not the most pleasant looking place I have ever stayed, and the view out the window was of a beautiful concrete wall with a swastika etched into it, BUT, it worked for our two day weekend trip and very minimal time actual spent in the apartment. This apartment’s saving grace is its location. Capitol Hill is awesome. It seems to be very up and coming and full of yummy restaurants, coffee shops, and the most amazing Starbucks I have ever been to (Starbucks Reserve, check it out.) The apartment is about a 25 minute walk to the Space Needle area and a 15 minute walk to downtown and Pike’s Market. The location really could not be better. Review of our host, Nick and the Pillow company. There is plenty of communication sent out before the trip giving out all of the information about the apartment and how to access it. This is much appreciated and made it very easy to find the apartment and get the keys. We did end up having some troubles with finding some keys at the end of our trip, but we were able to directly contact Nick and he was as nice and helpful as could be. He was immediately concerned with our situation and quickly offered to drive to the apartment...
57783	258571	8.0	9.0	47176621	"I had a mixed experience staying at Nick's apartment.  On the plus side, I found the check-in process to be smooth, the apartment was conveniently located near public transportation, and the surrounding Capitol Hill Neighborhood was charming.

In terms of drawbacks, the apartment isn't very inviting.  There is very little natural light, none of the electronics seemed to work (i.e., television, wi-fi), and I couldn't find a thermostat to regulate the temperature.  In retrospect, for the price I paid, I think other options in the same area of Seattle may have been a better fit.

Furthermore, I actually never communicated with Nick.  The property is managed by a third-party (at one point it was an individual then it switched to an independent company named Pillow). Although  I found both property managers to be amicable and responsive, it seemed to take away from the benefit of staying in another person's home.  That is, I think this style of management also contributed to the lack of ""creature comforts"" in the apartment.  For instance, I imagine if someone regularly lived in the apartment, there would be an ironing board and easier means of regulating the water temperature in the shower.

All that to say, this apartment wasn't my best, nor my worst, experience using AirBnB.  If you're primarily looking for a place to lay your head, find the price to be reasonable, and don't mind staying in an apartment managed by a third-party, then this could be a really good fit for you.  If you prefer to cook a few meals at home while traveling and enjoy having natural light where you stay, then you might consider looking elsewhere."
57784	258571	8.0	9.0	47689074	It was great! The apartment is located in a nice area. We really liked it!
57785	258571	8.0	9.0	47961425	"Nick has signed up with (website hidden) to maintain his apartment, who are very quick to respond at most hours of day. The apartment is very conveniently located to some trendy eateries nearby, as well as reasonable walking distance to the Space needle.
The apartment itself has all the necessary facilities for a comfortable stay, along with a decent size bathroom.

The only downside I'd say is the overnight parking, if you want to park there's a high change of driving around for an hour before a spot opens up. It's probably worth paying for a garage spot."
57786	258571	8.0	9.0	48866565	The location of this space was perfect! It was within walking distance of many of the places we wanted to go and we rarely had to uber. The host provided instructions in a timely manner and someone even stopped by to make sure we had checked in ok. The apartment is a good size for two people; I would not recommend that anyone sleep on the couch. Like other residents have stated, just be sure to open the windows during the day (if it's not raining) to air it out, the bed is creaky, the shower is small and there are not outlets in the bathroom - you have to do your hair in the kitchen! Because we spent most of our time exploring, we just used the space to sleep and get ready and for that it was perfect! 
57787	258571	8.0	9.0	50880979	Terrific neighborhood--apt is right in the middle of Capitol Hill's many restaurants and bars. This is a great crash pad for those used to urban living. Nothing fancy, but totally adequate. It was clean overall, but dusty in areas--couch was old & worn, and I couldn't reach the outlet next to the bed (lamp was plugged in but stereo/alarm was unplugged). I would stay again. Nick & Pillow service were communicative & responsive. Note: parking is very difficult in this area. I don't recommend if you have a car.
57788	258571	8.0	9.0	51112993	The apartment is clean and presents as advertised. The location is quite convenient to downtown Seattle. The company which manages the property was supposed to provide the code with instructions to get into the property 2 days prior to our arrival, which they didn't. I had to call them from the airport. They responded promptly. However, outside the building there were 6 lock boxes and we had to fumble in the dark to figure out which lock box was the right one. Otherwise the stay went smoothly.
57789	258571	8.0	9.0	51610668	My wife and I absolutely loved staying at Nick's place in Seattle! It's located in a cool urban neighborhood and is a very quick walk or Uber ride to all of the city's popular attractions. We felt the apartment was very safe & secure and had no concerns about safety. The apartment itself was very clean and nicely furnished. Clean linens and towels were provided. The check in/out procedure with Pillow also went very smoothly with no problems. We will definitely look to stay here again if we return to visit Seattle. 
57790	258571	8.0	9.0	52380830	I absolutely loved this apartment! It was convenient to everything that I needed and wanted to do while in Seattle. It is a place that I have already looked at booking again. The bed is amazingly comfortable as is the sofa. The building is very quiet with a nice courtyard and I appreciated the fact that there was salt, pepper, spices, etc, on hand if we wanted to cook. The space was very clean and it felt like my own apartment. The only thing I wish it would have had was washcloths, but I can bring my own to stay there again. Thank you, Nick, for having me!
57791	258571	8.0	9.0	54212376	Great stay.  Everything went smooth.
58961	7987846	8.0	10.0	51300651	Our hosts definitely made us and our doggies feel welcome and at home. The location is awesome - felt safe and secure, super close to tons of bars and restaurants, easy access to Pike Place, and a short Uber/Lyft ride to things that are not within walking distance.
60021	5618094	8.0	10.0	29457160	Easy communication.  Good location, comfortable bed, and room.
60022	5618094	8.0	10.0	41473310	"Our host was out of town, but her roommate was welcoming and helpful. The apartment was spacious with a fabulous view of the skyline from the deck and bedroom.
The location was great close to public transit and great neighborhood restaurants. The bed was v comfortable. "
60023	5618094	8.0	10.0	41678019	Beautiful views of the space needle and the ocean. Room looks just like it is pictured. Comfortable bed and very close to downtown.
60024	5618094	8.0	10.0	48546770	"Staying in the ""heart of Capitol Hill"" was amazing! We were right in the center of the action with all the bars and boutiques walkable. Only a quick jaunt from the Pie Bar (yes pie and cocktails) and another that keeps Moscow Mules on tap. Who can complain? The room was adorable and guides to Seattle were a sweet touch that made us feel welcome and definitely more informed. Thanks Kathleen!"
60025	5618094	8.0	10.0	51520612	The host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
60026	5618094	8.0	10.0	53688764	"Kathleen's place is awesome!
It is situated in Capitol Hill, one of the coolest neighborhoods in Seattle.
Tons of restaurants, shops and clubs right around the corner.
Even if Kathleen is not at home, you will be able to share the apartment with two super-friendly and easy-going roommates.
The view from Kathleen's room is amazing and she was even so kind to supply me with tons of shampoo, body wash, and even Ibuprofen!
Thumbs up!"
60746	338091	8.0	10.0	1140397	What a lovely place. Judy was really nice and accommodating. The apartment was beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. The location was right on too. We were minutes from some awesome bars and restaurants. All in all we had a great stay and I would highly recommend this spot.
60747	338091	8.0	10.0	1171894	Great location! The apartment has a lot of charm.
60748	338091	8.0	10.0	1205512	Judy was a great host for me and my group. The apartment is lovely and it was really clean. She was really accommodating to my group, and she was always helpful.  We enjoyed our time in the apartment very much, and we'd love to stay in her unit again. I really recommend staying here, you will not regret it!
60749	338091	8.0	10.0	1250482	The place was really comfortable and in a great location, Judy was very helpful even when we booked at the very last minute and we weren't familiar with the airbnb system. She met us to pass on the key and then we just left it there when we moved on. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever and much cheaper than a hotel in the same area, great spot!
60750	338091	8.0	10.0	1272377	Judy was very reliable and flexible--her apartment is comfortable and centrally located. We enjoyed our stay!
60751	338091	8.0	10.0	1322567	Judy's place was beautiful and in a great location.  We communicated over text and she was very responsive and helpful.  Parking in the area can be a little tight, but that's probably because there are a lot of popular spots close by!  Would definitely stay there again.
60752	338091	8.0	10.0	1374075	"Fun space and perfect location. Whether you choose to stay in Capitol Hill or venture out into other parts of the city, Judy's apartment is a great home base.
"
60753	338091	8.0	10.0	1401771	This apartment was fine. Great neighbourhood. Judy was easy to communicate with. We enjoyed our stay in Seattle. 
60754	338091	8.0	10.0	1413070	We had a great experience at Judy's place, she was very friendly and helpful, her apt was located in a very central location, easily accessable to all attractions.  thanks for a great weekend.
60755	338091	8.0	10.0	1554982	Like other reviewers have noted, the apartment is in an excellent location.  You can easily walk to some wonderful restaurants, bars, music venues and everything else in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Public transportation was very accessible to get downtown, too. Cha Cha Lounge, La Bete, and Unicorn Bar are just a few of the great places you can walk to with minimal effort from her place.  I would definitely stay there again.  
60756	338091	8.0	10.0	1652450	Fantastic location! I was there during the 4th & it's only a few blocks from an amazing spot to watch fireworks. There's tons of bars & restaurants plus a couple parks. Parking was challenging. We parked several blocks away & didn't drive the rest of the trip, which was fine since there's so much w/in walking distance. The apt was clean and exactly as represented in the photos.   
60757	338091	8.0	10.0	1745613	Tons of great light and tons of space, in the heart of Capitol Hill. It's a super-fast walk to amazing bars and restaurants, and only a 30/40 minute walk to downtown Seattle (Pike Place Market, etc.), but the bus stop is around the corner, if you need it. The apartment was stocked with everything, and Judy even put chocolates on our pillows. The bed was super comfortable! It's a hip area, so there was some street/neighbor noise at night, but with a pair of earplugs, you should be fine. Judy was very helpful during the process. We'd definitely stay again.
60758	338091	8.0	10.0	1899515	The apartment is located in the best part of seattle and its big and cool. However our experience here was not that good. The apartment wasn´s clean when we arrived, it was full of the owner stuff, there was no room on the closet or the fridge, the trash cans where full of garbage and the internet connection didn't work. Judy didnt came for the checkin or the checkout, she just left the keys under a bench and we needed to figure out how everything work. The apartment is cool but it was too dirty and crowded of the owner stuff for us, we wouldn't stay again there. 
60759	338091	8.0	10.0	1968853	"Judy's apartment is exactly as described and shown--lots of light, plenty of room, and enough exterior trees and plantings to feel comfortable leaving the blinds open. Easy access to public transit, a bus stop about a block away with no hill to climb to get there. She also gave us great recommendations to local restaurants and hangouts. Judy was not personally available when we arrived, but made certain that both checking in and out were easy and hassle-free.

Those looking for a sterile, corporate apartment will not find it here. Full of plants, books, and lived-in clutter. Kitchen is small but very workable, with an extensive spice collection. Groceries--from urban mini-mart to full-blown supermarket--are within easy walking distance.

Our stay included some hot days, but the cross-ventilation allowed us to stay comfortable. Washer and dryer use easy and quick. WIFI worked very well.

There was a bit of normal urban street and neighbor noise occasionally, but closed windows took care of that.

All in all,  we found it a comfortable base for exploring Seattle. "
60760	338091	8.0	10.0	2141088	"I had a great stay at Judy's wonderful apartment in one of Seattle's best neighborhood. 

Judy's apartment is well equipped and comfortable with lots of natural light and many plants.  The apartment is in a great location with easy access to downtown and also the highway for getting in and out of town. I used a bicycle to get around and was in heaven.  :) "
60761	338091	8.0	10.0	2402750	Great apartment! Would highly recommend!
60762	338091	8.0	10.0	2425476	Great apt in great location!!  Also, try Analog Coffee around the corner (235 Summit).
60763	338091	8.0	10.0	2550285	Judy is a great host!  I loved her place, and she was also very responsive and easy to communicate with.  Her place is located a couple of blocks away from Broadway, which is great if you love walking - which I did most of my stay.  
60764	338091	8.0	10.0	2722877	"Apartment is in a good location, with a number of shops and restaurants in the area, and it's a downhill stroll into the CBD or short bus ride (the public transport is very good) There is no TV, dishwasher or microwave, and while this was not a problem for us, it's worth keeping in mind if you are planning to eat in. Judy was very responsive by email and text.

Seattle is a great city with lots to do and see. The Pike Place market is absolutely worth a visit - especially the fishmongers - but some guidebooks told us that it opened early in the morning and we got a bit caught out when we turned up around 7.30/8am (a few cafes across the road were open then though)"
60765	338091	8.0	10.0	2868916	This was my family's first airbnb experience, and it could not have been better.  Judy's place is exactly as advertised -- a comfortable, spacious apartment in a great part of town.  Who knows why we spent so long staying at hotels. 
60766	338091	8.0	10.0	3069188	Great experience!  Great space, good location.  Could not rate it more highly!
60767	338091	8.0	10.0	3106299	Judy's apartment was nice and in great location! Everything was exactly how Judy had described. Only thing to keep in mind, is parking is very difficult in this area.  We spent over an hour trying to find parking the first night we were there. Overall a great experience.
60768	338091	8.0	10.0	3179232	Great location--so convenient to downtown and all of Capitol Hill. Everything we needed! Thanks.
60769	338091	8.0	10.0	3193010	Judy's place is a little gem, just 5-6 blocks off of Broadway on Capitol Hill. Judy was out of town, but made it easy for us to get the keys and check in. Her boyfriend even made sure there were extra towels and sheets waiting for us, on very short notice. The apartment is spotless, with a good layout. It worked well for 3 or us - 1 on the (surprisingly comfortable) couch, 1 on the air bed, and 1 on the full size bed in the bedroom. The only real downside that we experienced was the street parking situation, but you wouldn't have the same trouble if you parked for the day and walked up (up up up) the hill instead of trying to drive/park wherever you went. We only stayed the night, but folks who stay longer may want to note that we didn't see a television. As for us, it wasn't missed. Highly recommended!
60770	338091	8.0	10.0	3236433	We had a last minute reservation and Judy was very easy to correspond with even though she was out of town. We had a lovely stay. The apartment is in a perfect location and for New Years in Seattle we had a perfect view of the fireword from the Space Needle right out the living room window. The bed was comfy and the place was very clean. I would recommend this location to anyone else without hesitation.
60771	338091	8.0	10.0	3313804	Judy has a wonderful apartment; well located, spacious, and clean. Unfortunately, I was only in Seattle one evening, but even so - my stay was made very easy w/ clear communication from Judy throughout. I would highly recommend to anyone visiting the lovely city!
60772	338091	8.0	10.0	3329915	The apartment was bright, clean and spacious. Very comfy little bed. The temp outside was about 35deg and a small heater was not enough. We ended up moving to a different place for the second night of our stay. Judy was very accommodating and allowed us to change our reservation without any grief. 
60773	338091	8.0	10.0	3521200	Judy's place is cute and in a great location. As other reviews have noted, parking is challenging, but we did eventually find something.  Walking distance to lots of restaurants and (in maybe 20ish minutes) Pike Place Market.   
60774	338091	8.0	10.0	3535749	Judy's space was large and inviting - exactly what she advertised!
60775	338091	8.0	10.0	3695044	Judy's place is in a fantastic location and is very inviting. A total of three of us stayed there with no problem. Having to find a hotel and parking would have been a pain but this location really made it easy for us to explore Seattle without having to drive much. Judy is a great host and was very quick at responding to my messages and calls. Definitely recommend this place!
60776	338091	8.0	10.0	3857656	Great spot, easy to find and Judy was a wonderful host.
60777	338091	8.0	10.0	3902227	We had a great time at Judy's place. It was exactly what she advertised in the description and pictures. Her place was in a great (email hidden)t too far from Downtown but still away from the hustle and bustle of the whole city. I recommend staying here if you have 3+ people because there is plenty of space and feels very comfy! Thanks Judy!
60778	338091	8.0	10.0	3989011	"Best place in the best neighborhood. I stayed with my friend and Judy let us borrow an air mattress. I enjoyed walking to the Top Pot donuts 2 blocks away and 2 Analog coffee which is right around the corner.

Good kitchen, very well lit living room and comfy bed and blankets. We planned to work from the coffee shops but ended up working in the living room instead."
60779	338091	8.0	10.0	4456875	Great location. Judy's place was awesome. I stayed at her place with three others. She provided an air mattress and the couch was very comfortable. She was very easygoing throughout the whole process.
60780	338091	8.0	10.0	4524152	"Great location -- really enjoyed being able to jog to Volunteer Park and then access everything I needed to do Downtown for work. Apartment was comfortable and made me feel like I was living in Seattle for the week. Judy was really responsive and had no issue with me checking-in a few hours before I had anticipated I would be there.

Only thing to note, the apartment overlooks a courtyard area and with nice weather the cigarette fumes from smokers wafted into the apartment (when the windows are open). Probably not an issue for the majority of the year when it's too rainy for people to hang out down there. :P"
60781	338091	8.0	10.0	4697230	Great spot! Very easy hand off! Judy was super nice.
60782	338091	8.0	10.0	5087357	Judy is so helpful and nice, very easy to get in touch with, and her apartment is amazing. You can walk to Pike Place, hike downhill to the water and go kayaking, or walk a couple blocks and go to an amazing coffee place or donut place. Besides being in a fabulous location, the apartment is airy, spacious, clean, and really comfortable. My boyfriend and I had an amazing time here!
60783	338091	8.0	10.0	5122336	"Judy was very helpful and quick responding to any questions we had. Definitely fantastic location and great space with lots of light and very comfortable. Will recommend to anyone! 
Thanks again Judy! "
60784	338091	8.0	10.0	5191548	Staying here was great! We never saw Judy but she was so helpful and responsive over messaging. She got the key to us easily, and the place was beautiful (and obviously in a fantastic location). Plenty of bedding and room, convenience, a good deal, a safe location - what more could you ask for?
60785	338091	8.0	10.0	5735015	Clean, well situated, good sized, quiet apartment, with a considerate host (who left us coffee and tips!). A real home away from home!
60786	338091	8.0	10.0	5925777	suuuch a great place. judy was super responsive and helpful, couldn't have asked for a better stay! very quiet and clean. amazing location, i'd never stay anywhere else in seattle. :)
60787	338091	8.0	10.0	6026961	"It was a pleasure to have Judy host my party of 4. She was very responsive to my enquiries and requests. The apt was a good size for us, and there were fresh linens and some toiletries for our use. Getting to downtown was easy by bus, but we have been using Uber to get us to Pike Place and surroundings. The apt's location in Capitol Hill is great, as it is only a short walk to Broadway. A note to those with a car, parking is not easy, but with some patience and luck, you will be able to find a spot within a couple blocks. 
"
60788	338091	8.0	10.0	6101286	Judy was very hospitable and made sure we had everything we needed. She has a beautifully decorated home with lots of space and natural light. She also lives in my favorite neighborhood of Seattle!
60789	338091	8.0	10.0	6145117	Convenient location, comfortable bed, beautiful apartment and easy check-in/check-out process - everything I got from Judy. Highly recommend staying at her place.

The place is great and roomy and the location is simply amazing. Great spots all around and at walking distance! 
Had no problems whatsoever during the whole trip and this easily trumps a hotel.

People like Judy really do make airbnb worth trying out.
I will, with 100% confidence, book this spot again when I head back :]"
60791	338091	8.0	10.0	6843345	Spacious apartment in great location (exactly as described) and Judy checked in with us during our stay to make sure everything was OK. Definitely recommend this spot!
60792	338091	8.0	10.0	6968631	The apartment is spacious and well located with plenty of windows and thus great ventilation and light. Parking is on street and can be a challenge to find - I ended up using a pay lot four blocks away as I was nervous parking the Camaro convertible I had from my rental agency. 
60793	338091	8.0	10.0	7382694	judy was incredibly helpful in escorting me through any&every question that arose w/ my first airbnb experience—very responsive via text. checking in&out was a breeze. her place was within a 15-20'ish minute walk or 5-10 minute drive to pretty much every where i decided to trek to, so that was incredibly convenient. the apartment itself was very tidy which made for an awesome temporary home-away-from-home. i personally enjoyed judy's collection of books, original art pieces&plants. judy's bed was crazy comfy, too! tons of natural light pouring in through the windows was also very pleasant. i am already planning my return!
60794	338091	8.0	10.0	7894890	Judy's place was great, clean and very conveniently located. She was extremely helpful and quickly answered our on-the-fly questions about the neighborhood, and even had a really helpful list of nearby coffee shops, restaurants and bars ready and waiting for us. Parking is tough in Capitol Hill, so even though we had a rental car, we decided to forgo driving most places and per Judy's advice, we ended up taking Lyft cars quite a bit, and we also took advantage of the great bars within walking distance of her apartment. We would definitely stay at Judy's again, and thank her for an incredibly comfortable stay in Seattle :)
60795	338091	8.0	10.0	8096996	"Judy was a great host.
The apartment was clean, cozy, and very (website hidden) was walking distance from everything interesting in Seattle, from tourist attractions to hipster dive bars and great local food secrets. I highly recommend this place to anyone coming to Seattle!"
60796	338091	8.0	10.0	8661409	Judy's place is warm, inviting and perfect for a weekend getaway! 
60797	338091	8.0	10.0	8824084	Three friends and myself fit very comfortably in Judy's apartment. It was in the prime location; endless bars, restaurants and coffee shops in the area. Judy was very quick to respond to any sort of question or concern I had. Though I never did meet her in person, she made sure that we had air mattresses, fresh towels and even an economical ride to and from the airport. The apartment was very hip and very comfortable. I would recommend Judy's place to anyone visiting Seattle.
60798	338091	8.0	10.0	8952756	This place was one the best AirBnB places I've been to. Also, Judy was very responsive. Highly recommended.
60799	338091	8.0	10.0	9680661	"We stayed 5 weeks in Judy's apartment with my wife and our 4½-year-old son. I will be very open about both pros and cons of the place - you can't know many of these beforehand. 

PROS (1) The location is great, safe and within walking distance from downtown and some great cafes. (2) No wall-to-wall carpeting. (3) Quite roomy for a studio. 

CONS (1) The apartment wasn't very clean when we arrived, many surfaces were dusty, the bath tub had all kinds of hair and dust in it, parts of the kitchen were just filthy, so while I was working my wife had to clean up a lot before we could settle - not cool straight after two long flights. (2) The apartment was cold, 80% of time it was impossible sit on the sofa wearing just a T-shirt. We ended up covering the bedroom window with plastic, but even that didn't help much. And this was despite the manager 'fixing' the central heating twice. Judy had a small portable heater, which made our stay tolerable, but not comfortable. [we know two couples living on the same street, both had warm and comfy apartments while Judy's was freezing] (3) The kitchen was very rudimentary (no coffee cups or pots [below 4 gallons] etc), so cooking was a pain and we ended up buying a water boiler and a new frying pan just to get by. Judy, however, was reasonable and compensated the price back to us. (4) A couple of times the neighbors were playing loud music late in the evening and were very rowdy, so at times falling asleep was a challenge even with earplugs. (5) The squeaking floorboards first seemed kind of cute, but it was a bit irritating not being able to walk to the bathroom without waking up the whole family, they squeak that loud.

Judy usually was quite quick to respond to our messages and she ordered a set of thermal curtains and curtain rods to the living room but then on the other hand didn't have anyone install them.

All in all, I have to say the apartment is not equipped with many necessities and not fit for a stay longer than perhaps a couple of days when the weather is above 50-60 F. It was not worth the price we paid, unfortunately."
60800	338091	8.0	10.0	10171534	Great location and Judy was very accomodating. The apartment was well kept and it was nice to have a parking spot to use!!
60801	338091	8.0	10.0	10250110	"Judy's place was a delight to stay at. My friends and I enjoyed the spacious living room and had a wonderful time together over dinner and drinks. The location is convenient with the Thomas st. market close by. It was snowing when I stayed and we didn't have trouble with the heat. Judy was attentive and made every effort to be accommodating. 

"
60802	338091	8.0	10.0	10683991	Judy's apartment was the perfect home base for our weekend in Seattle. We came for a conference and the walk to downtown took less than 15 minutes. In the evenings we were happy to explore the immediate neighborhood and were surprised with the numerous delicious restaurants and bars. Also there's a great coffee shop just around the corner (we went every morning). The apartment itself was cozy with great natural light, although we spent most of our time out and about. Great apartment, perfect location!
60803	338091	8.0	10.0	11100795	Great apartment with beautiful light and decor. Very close to Capitol Hill shopping, cafes and nightlife. The street is quiet. Judy was very responsive, flexible and helpful. Definitely recommend. 
60804	338091	8.0	10.0	11371175	Judy was very flexible and welcoming as a host. We never met up, but coordinating the space and the parking space went smoothly and she responded quickly to my questions. The neighborhood was perfect to wander around Capitol Hill and the downtown area. It was a great and easy getaway!
60805	338091	8.0	10.0	11545089	Great communication with Judy. Suite was super easy to find and really clean upon our arrival. Highly recommend.
60806	338091	8.0	10.0	11784800	"Judy was quick to reply and with all other correspondence. She is conscientious of her neighbors. The apt was fine for one night maybe two. I couldn't actually find the parking spot but since we were only going to be there one night I just parked on the street and that was fine. Neighborhood is busy and there is a lot to do even into the wee hours of the night and within walking distance of the apt. 

When the profile stated sleeps 4 I had expected a sofa bed or futon type couch in addition to the bed in the bedroom, but what she had was air mattresses.  I am not sure if that was in the listing and I just missed it.  Also, I didn't ask.  The air mattress situation is why I stated that for the 4 of us one to two nights would be all we could do.

I was satisfied overall.  "
60807	338091	8.0	10.0	12165892	Great location and Judy is really fast at responding. Bring your own amenities. The parking is at a different location than the apt, one block up. No heating in the apt, but there is a small space heater available in the bedroom. The bed is comfy and good 1 person. Best point about this place is the host is very quick to respond and accommodating.
60808	338091	8.0	10.0	12447010	Judy's place was perfect. The spot was in a perfect location for Seattle, right in the middle of Capitol Hill. Only spent a day or so in the apartment, but the place was really cozy. I got better sleep at Judy's place than I have in awhile. I liked all of the windows in the apartment, as it really lit up the place. I highly recommend her apartment.
60809	338091	8.0	10.0	12596309	The apartment was amazing; much larger in person. I can understand if someone stay for a long time how the wood floor creaking would drive you nuts but its no big deal for a night.
60810	338091	8.0	10.0	12757019	Judy's place was large for a 1 bedroom apt and in a great location! Getting into and leaving the apartment was super easy and allowed me to do so on my own schedule. No reason not to stay there again. 
60811	338091	8.0	10.0	12807461	Judy was professional and responded quickly, letting us book on short notice.  The space was clean, nicely decorated (the plants were a great touch,) and well appointed (clean towels and bedding, WiFi, an air mattress, and extra goodies like coffee.)  I love the neighborhood, too—I used to live a block away, though, so I might have a bit of a bias.  She also offered parking, which was a big plus since street-parking in that neighborhood is a nightmare.  All-in-all, great experience.
60812	338091	8.0	10.0	13831159	"This was a superb spot in the best neighbourhood in Seattle - great bars and amazing food very easily walkable.
Highly recommended."
60813	338091	8.0	10.0	14123376	"We had a pleasant stay at Judy's. The apartment is spacious and tidy. It was within walking distance to downtown and there are a lot of restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. within a few minutes walk of her place.

Parking was a little tough due to the time we came in (Sunday evening) and this being a popular neighborhood, but it worked out. Just know that you might be parking a few blocks away if you are traveling by car. 

Overall, we had a good time and would stay here again."
60814	338091	8.0	10.0	14348293	It was at an awesome location. Very convienent.  
60815	338091	8.0	10.0	14753597	"Judy was easy to reach and it was no problem getting in the apartment when we arrived.  Very flexible about check in/check out times.  The apartment for the most part is as advertised, big one bedroom right between downtown and capital hill.  It was quiet and felt secure and my 14 yr. old who is 5'8"" slept fine on the couch so we didn't need to pull out the air mattress.  It was not as clean as I would have liked and I wound up cleaning the bathroom our first night there.  Looks like the corners and behind and under things have never been cleaned.  Also note: parking is an extra cost and the washer & dryer in the basement are an extra cost as well.  There is no microwave, dishwasher, or toaster which wasn't a big deal to me but might be for others.  There were also no smoke detectors that I could see in the apt.  "
60816	338091	8.0	10.0	14890435	My stay in  Judy's apartment was fine, the apartment is very spacious and bright. Very safe neighborhood, close to many cafes and restaurants near to capitol hill. cleaning generally lacking, especially in the kitchen and his room, very dirty under the bed. Parking is not include , have to pay.
60817	338091	8.0	10.0	15049721	Judy was very accommodating and her place is great.  The location cant be beat and she even had air mattresses, so everyone was comfortable.  She also responded quickly to any questions during the stay!
60818	338091	8.0	10.0	15488147	Judy is a fantastic hostess with an amazing location in Seattle. We had such as great time exploring Capitol Hill and were able to get to any part of the city because of the central location. Unlike other reviewers, we found Judy's place to be spotless and perfectly cleaned. Judy was quick and very kind in all her communications. If you decide to stay with Judy, make sure you check out Analog Coffee and Crumble & Flake Patisserie just around the corner - trust me you will not be disappointed.  
60819	338091	8.0	10.0	15688093	We had a great stay, thanks!
60820	338091	8.0	10.0	16239457	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
60821	338091	8.0	10.0	16257688	"We didn't meet Judy, however, we didn't need to as we found the keys relatively easily just a block away from the apartment - which was very convenient seeing as we were arriving late at night. Our trip from the train station was quick and easy via taxi, too!

The apartment itself is in a great location, located close to town. The neighbourhood is fantastic, offering some lovely local bakeries and restaurants that we frequented during our stay. We also recommend the local barber - really great service!

The apartment looks exactly like the image, and accommodated us well - although there was a strange odour throughout the apartment. The unit felt slightly unclean too, and we were a little disheartened to find the MP3 player and heater either broken or missing.

For the price we paid, however, we still had a great stay - we used the high-speed internet a lot, and also frequented the Netflix account on the television, too. It was affordable for Seattle as a location!"
60822	338091	8.0	10.0	18850412	The description of the unit was accurate and the neighborhood was great.  It was a little noisy on the weekend when the bars let out, but not too bad.  Picking up the key in the lock box was easy.  
60823	338091	8.0	10.0	20697195	"I stayed in Seattle for 4 weeks, so I was looking for a comfortable place, which I could feel most at home at. Unfortunately, there were a few major things that made the stay unpleasant and generally made me avoid spending time in the apartment. In more details:
Pros: The apartment was in a good location, from which you can easily access restaurants, nightlife spots, shopping areas, transportation and really all the essentials. Judy was quick to respond to all my messages, so communication was very easy.
Cons: The worst thing for me was that the place was very unclean. The insides of the kitchen counters were covered with some thick black sticky dirt, which despite my best effort I was not able to clean and I gave up on using the utilities altogether.  The bed sheets and towels had not been changed since the last visitor, which is completely unacceptable for me. And on top of everything else, on my last day I found a pair of dirty socks in one vase...
Another drawback was the building itself - it was quite old, so the floors were squeaking very loudly. The isolation was not good, so it was cold inside and you could hear everything that was going on in the neighbors. I was waking up with the people in the apartment above, whose alarm clock I could hear at 6 am.
Lastly, the furniture in the apartment was old, so a lot of things kept shaking when you touch them (e.g. wardrobe, iron board, etc.), which made me feel a bit dizzy."
60824	338091	8.0	10.0	41791344	"Judy was a great host. She always responded in a timely manner when we asked about the place. Checking in and checking out was very simple with the provided instructions. 

The place itself was great. It was very clean and comfortable. It was very spacious and there was more than enough room for everyone. There was plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. 

We all had a great time here."
60825	338091	8.0	10.0	43862417	"Judy's apartment far exceeded our expectations. Her apartment was stylish, roomy, and very clean. My favorite part of our stay was the roof top garden and lounge area. Absolutely incredible views of Rainier and the skyline from up there. It was the prefect place to hang out and have a few drinks before going downtown.

I will definitely be staying here again next time I visit Seattle.

Thanks Judy!"
60826	338091	8.0	10.0	48830748	Really nice!
60827	338091	8.0	10.0	52943805	The space was (email hidden)ean and very similar to the pictures. It's location was close to everything we were wanting to do.  Judy was quick to respond to all of our questions and made getting into the space fast and simple.
60828	338091	8.0	10.0	54940152	Judy is great. Easy to work with and left a helpful list of instructions to navigate around Seattle with.
61470	2909809	8.0	10.0	13157256	Katie and her fiancées place was fantastic. My partner and I are major walkers when it comes to exploring new cities and the location of the apartment was great for getting to and from great sites. When there was a need to venture further, car services around town were easily accessible and inexpensive from their local. The neighborhood felt safe which was a huge plus since we stayed out pretty late at many of the nearby bars. Great eating and chilling spots by the apartment topped off a wonderful weekend to a fabulous city. Thanks again Katie for trusting us to spend time in your wonderful pad. 
61471	2909809	8.0	10.0	13367928	Katie was an excellent host and very accommodating to our schedule. We really enjoyed the price point and the location of her apartment. The apartment was cute and really reflected her artsy personality. Everything was in order and communication was cake. Thanks so much for a wonderful Seattle trip!
61472	2909809	8.0	10.0	14367663	"Katie was a very gracious host, although we didn't get to meet her.  She has a very comfy apartment in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle that overlooks the Space Needle.  It is a good central location for exploring the Capital Hill area.  

The bed was VERY comfy and her home was well furnished and worked out great for us.  The ONLY downside (and this is completely out of Katie's control) is that parking is difficult to find.  We spent quite a bit of time waiting for someone to leave before we could park.  If you have a small car, scooter or use mass transit...you probably won't have a problem."
61473	2909809	8.0	10.0	14636522	Katie was an excellent host and very thoughtful/helpful. The flat is very interesting and had everything someone would need.
61474	2909809	8.0	10.0	15738602	Katie's apartment is a great place to stay when in Seattle. A seamless transition in and out, with great views of downtown from the living room. Would recommend to anyone. 
61475	2909809	8.0	10.0	16186332	Many things to like about this place.  Great location - lots of places to visit on foot and felt safe walking around even as a single woman.  Loved the apartment - so much better than any hotel. Comfey and made you feel at home besides great view.  Best of all was Katie.  She checked in and made sure I had no issues during various points of travel.  Also had great tips on the area and transport from the airport.  
61476	2909809	8.0	10.0	17885622	Katie was a great host. Her apartment was bright and airy with beautiful views. It's located in a great neighborhood to boot. I would definitely stay there again!
61477	2909809	8.0	10.0	19970303	Katie's apartment was fantastic! Grat big bright windows, and centrally located in Capitol Hill. The area felt safe and very walkable. Communication+ checkin/checkout was easy peasy.    There are plenty of great restaurants and bars,   and if youre feeling like walking, the Space Needle or Pike's Place Market are a nice 30 minute walk down hill !  I would definitely love to stay here again next time I visit Seattle.
61478	2909809	8.0	10.0	27220243	Katie and Trent were really nice. Their apartment is conveniently located close to everything.

61480	2909809	8.0	10.0	49558191	Katie's apartment was great!  Centrally located so we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, from around cap hill to downtown. It was easy to get into the apartment and it was very cute with a great view. Parking was the only problem! That was of course not Katie's fault! :)
61754	4808173	8.0	10.0	24439789	We didn't get a chance to meet Caitlin on this trip, but she was very communicative and helpful beforehand. Her instructions for getting into the apartment were very thorough and easy. The apartment itself is wonderful. It's in an amazing location, and yet very quiet despite being so near such a busy part of town. Her place is very comfortable (the bed was amazing), and has everything one would need for a Seattle stay. It was a perfect apartment and a perfect stay!
61755	4808173	8.0	10.0	24795534	Caitlin and Charlie's flat is in an excellent location and is super comfortable. We loved feeling like we had our own place in Capitol Hill with everything in easy walking distance. Caitlin's communication before arrival was outstanding. We would love to stay here again. Thanks for a great stay guys!
61756	4808173	8.0	10.0	28373843	Absolute best location in all of Seattle! Both Caitlyn and Charlie were professional and helpful. Their house was clean, comfortable and literally a 5 minute walk to all the best venues. I was very happy with my stay at their house and would gladly stay again.
62076	719233	8.0	9.0	2501320	The reservation was canceled 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
62077	719233	8.0	9.0	2552461	The apartment was in a great location and was exactly as stated in the listing.  Nick was really flexible about working around our schedule and was really quick and thorough in his communication. The place seems like a great deal, and I highly recommend it.
62078	719233	8.0	9.0	2567617	"This place was just amazing! From the very beginning Nick responded so quickly to my request. He made the best to make the futon in the living room so comfortable for my friend. Nick had no problem with our bicycles inside the place which made us feel safer. The apartment is located in a nice area, very close to downtown with tons of restaurants, coffee shops, bars and the vibrant energy of Capitol Hill. 

Nick wasn't in town to check us in but his friend Nicole was going to be in charge. She met us even before than we were supposed to (two hours before), she was very nice and attentive, she gave us some ideas on places to eat. I needed a screw driver to remove something from my bike and she got one right away.

The whole apartment for such a wonderful price is seriously the best deal in town!!! the living room is spacious and the TV has the Roku box so we could stream Pandora and watch anything from Netflix. The kitchen has everything you need to make a delicious meal, the bedroom is very spacious and comfortable, the bedding and appliances were new, the bathroom  and the whole apartment was super clean. 

On our second day at the place we met Nick, he is very laid back and genuine, I could tell he just wanted to be the most helpful possible, he felt like an old friend. He had no problem with us checking out later than supposed to if we needed to.

I definitely recommend Nick's place and look forward to come back for more Seattle times! I will not look for another spot to stay, just like that. "
62079	719233	8.0	9.0	2607900	"The description Nick gave is spot on.
Very quiet building, can only hear sirens sometimes, good locks on doors and windows, good lighting, great to have Netflix and Pandora, kitchen well stocked, comfortable bed, good shower and toilet. 
Nice little living room with a breakfast table next to the window. Wooden floors all throughout.

Yeah it's well used but it's clean and the location is perfect to get downtown or late night fun in Capitol Hill!"
62080	719233	8.0	9.0	2635014	Cute apartment, great location.  And Nick was an incredibly attentive and accommodating host.  Thanks!
62081	719233	8.0	9.0	2686557	Nick's Melrose Court Apartment is minimal but has everything you would need. Nick is beyond helpful, had a list of useful information for us and is more organized than any host I've ever stayed with. Nick is just a few doors down and was quick to mention that he's always up to help. We shortened our stay because we found an apartment in Seattle, and Nick could not have been more accommodating in refiguring the reservation. Although our stay wasn't for tourism, the location is really awesome for people who want to see all Seattle's sights!
62082	719233	8.0	9.0	2734552	We stayed at Nick's place for a couple of nights in October. The apartment is clean and tidy, and in a fab location, close to the CBD and some funky inner city areas. Nick was really amenable and easy going, easy to get in contact with, flexible and also great in making sure we were ok and comfortable. If I make it back to Seattle, I'd definitely stay again!
62083	719233	8.0	9.0	2754550	Nick's place is cozy,  tastefully decorated, and in a fantastic location.  He made us feel  welcome and went above and beyond our expectations in terms of friendliness and making sure we had everything we needed. The place came complete with maps, local guides, wifi, and Netflix streaming! (Not to mention a helpful host). I would definitely recommend Nick's place to any other traveller.
62084	719233	8.0	9.0	2792919	ANicks apartment was great and exactly as advertised. It was clean with a fresh bed and an excellent location. Nick and I did not meet until the day I left, which goes to show that I had no problems to give to his attention during my stay. Check in and check out was simple, and he even let me check out really late in the day to accommodate my 11pm flight home. I would stay here again, for sure.
62085	719233	8.0	9.0	2813980	"Nick was so great! My friend and I arrived at 11PM on a Friday and he was there to greet us and let us in, show us around the apartment and lay everything out for us. The apartment was so great! Everything we needed was right there- towels, a nice comfy bed, a clean bathroom, kitchen utensils, even Netflix! Nick even had books and recommendations out for us and even went out of his way to let us store our bags after checkout time so that we wouldn't have to carry them around with us all day until our scheduled flight. 
The location of the apartment was FANTASTIC! Perfect spot in Capitol Hill. Great coffee shop nearby, as well as Melrose Market and yummy Li'l Woody's! I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I were to revisit Seattle.
Thanks Nick!"
62086	719233	8.0	9.0	2841523	"This location is very close to Seattle downtown. For me the apartement was almost prefect. It was clean, nice, warm and the kitchen was well equiped. Some guides for the town has been prepared, also a personal one from Nick himself.
Nick was a very nice and friendly host!"
62087	719233	8.0	9.0	2844101	The place is terrific! I only stayed for one night, but was left wishing I'd stayed for more. The apartment is in a great location, very close to cool restaurants, coffeeshops, bars, shopping, etc., and you can easily walk, take a bus or drive to downtown. It was clean, a good size space, and great value for the money. Nick is a really great host--friendly, knowledgeable and reliable. He offered lots of recommendations, and went out of his way to make sure I got into the apartment okay. 
62088	719233	8.0	9.0	2853819	"My friend and I had a fantastic time in Seattle and Nick's place was perfect for our short stay. It was my first time using airbnb and everything worked out well. His place was clean, and had everything we needed, the bed was super comfortable and the location was fantastic. Walking distance to Capitol Hill as well as Pike Place / Downtown Seattle. 
I can absolutely recommend Nick's place and probably even use it myself again when I'm in Seattle the next time.
Thank you so much Nick for being such a great host as well!"
62089	719233	8.0	9.0	2878279	Nick was great.  So was the apartment.  Exactly as described in a very cool and accessible area of Seattle. 
62090	719233	8.0	9.0	2892358	Nick was a fantastic host--super helpful and made everything easy from checkin to checkout.  Apartment is a great 1 bedroom in a fantastic location.
62091	719233	8.0	9.0	2897970	"This was a great first time experience with airbnb and my stay at Nick's was perfect. 

It's a cozy apartment that was more than adequate. Nick was extremely helpful and friendly. The location is convenient to food and entertainment and we enjoyed walking around exploring the surrounding neighborhood.  I recommend staying here!"
62092	719233	8.0	9.0	2936721	Nick's apartment was my first AirBnB experience. Before the booking, he ensured that I had everything I needed and was incredibly responsive. When I arrived in Seattle, he let me borrow an umbrella (I know, I was going to Seattle and forgot one somehow!) and offered a few suggestions for places to check out in the Capital Hill area. Staying in his apartment which was tastefully decorated, roomy, comfortable was everything I expected. If everyone is as friendly and helpful as Nick, I would say my first (and certainly) not my last booking was a huge success. Thanks for making me feel so welcome!
62093	719233	8.0	9.0	2960981	Nick was helpful, friendly, and very welcoming.  We did not get to meet in person but he was very easy to communicate with and even left a list of tips for places to check out in the area.  The apartment is in a cool area of Capital Hill and a short walk downtown.  Overall the stay was perfect and I would like to stay again if I am back in the area.
62094	719233	8.0	9.0	2983866	We had a great time at Nick's place! The location was fantastic and Nick was a friendly host. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Nick!
62095	719233	8.0	9.0	3016399	Nick was a welcoming and gracious host who went out of his way to make us feel at home. The apartment is well-furnished, with a great location in Capitol Hill, and the Roku box is a nice touch. Next door to the apartment are a game room/bar and French creperie. Not bad at all. Overall, we were immensely pleased with our experience and will be returning again soon. 
62096	719233	8.0	9.0	3028742	"Nick's place was perfect for our stay. We were only there one night, visiting from Portland, looking for a warm bed and a good ""home base"" to explore the city. The location was amazing, walking distance to downtown and capitol hill! Pike's Place Market, coffee, food, bars, etc. Parking, although not provided was really easy and close by. The bed was incredibly comfortable and clean and Nick made sure we were aware of all the heaters in case we were cold. Very easy, friendly, convenient.  "
62097	719233	8.0	9.0	3037434	Great location. Not quite as nice as the photos, but still an enjoyable stay!
62098	719233	8.0	9.0	3048775	Perfect location in Capitol Hill. Really interesting space (a former motel). Nick couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. 
62099	719233	8.0	9.0	3054389	"I came to check out a grad school and had never been to Seattle before. Nick went out of his way to show me around town and make sure I had everything I needed.

While the apartment is nothing fancy, it is clean and a solid choice for a traveler looking to get to know the city. I took the rail from the airport and got off at Westlake; the rest of the distance was an easy walk.

All in all, a good value and a great host. If you choose to stay here, time permitting, you should hang out with Nick. He's a great guy who has interesting thoughts on Seattle and life."
62100	719233	8.0	9.0	3058272	From the get-go, Nick was very attentive and made sure that he had all my travel info correct, but also that I had everything that I needed.  As for the apartment itself, it's well heated, has everything you need for a few people (I stayed by myself and found the size of the apartment more than adequate), and the location is pretty solid.  I was able to walk to downtown and to the bars in Cap Hill.  I'd recommend staying here and I will next time I'm in Seattle and need a place to stay in the Cap Hill area.
62101	719233	8.0	9.0	3119286	Nick was an attentive host, who checked in during our stay to see if we needed anything. The apartment is quiet, well heated, and comfortable, though not fancy. Great location! - convenient to many good restaurants (I could eat at Skillet every day), nightlife, and public transportation.
62102	719233	8.0	9.0	3129183	We had an excellent stay with Nick in apartment 307. Had the apartment to ourselves, everything was clean and comfortable. He was able to accommodate our later checkin at about 9pm and our early checkout of 6am. Was great to have the place to ourselves, complete with netflix and full kitchen with all the basics - coffee, tea, etc. Right between Capitol Hill and Downtown, super convenient location. Don't hesitate to book here.
62103	719233	8.0	9.0	3133091	Location is fantastic; right in the middle of Capitol Hill nightlife and within walking distance from Downtown as well!  Living room is spacious, kitchen is convenient, bed is comfortable, and Nick (the host) is very helpful.
62104	719233	8.0	9.0	3141914	Our stay was wonderful, Nick was punctual in his responses it was very easy to access his place. Located in the center of the city in a funky part of town with lots of restaurants coffee shops and bars. We truly had an amazing time don't forget to access the little taco shop up the street.
62105	719233	8.0	9.0	3146406	My second visit at Nick's place at Melrose Court in Seattle. The place is always super clean with Netflix and Wifi. The location is fantastic, very close to Pike Market and in easy walking distance to Capitol Hill. Nick also has some great tips on what to do in Seattle and some great tips on where to eat and drink. I totally recommend his place!
62106	719233	8.0	9.0	3178398	Nick is very easy to deal with, and this apartment is perfect for what we needed, somewhere to crash at night when we weren't exploring the city. Just keep in mind that this place appears to be a super old motel converted into apartments. My only beef was that the futon in the living room was probably less comfortable than a rock. That being said, the bed was comfy and there are heaters in each room. I would stay there again. 
62107	719233	8.0	9.0	3251770	We stayed over New Years at Nick's Melrose Court Apartment which was warm, cosy, comfortable, clean and tidy. We found the location to be perfect for what we needed and was within walking distance to great bars and restaurants as well as downtown which made our stay and seeing Seattle just that little much better. I would recommend staying with Nick as he is extremely helpful and really wants you to experience Seattle at its fullest!
62108	719233	8.0	9.0	3279207	Nick is a good responsive host.  He was out of town while I stayed at his place so he put another person in his building in charge.  She was super helpful and dealt with our request to keep luggage in the room after check-out.  The place is in a primo location (you can walk everywhere and it is steps from the heart of capital hill nightlife and restaurants).  It is as advertised and the price is appropriate.
62109	719233	8.0	9.0	3297699	nick is very easy to communicate with, and though he wasnt around when we came, everything was taken cared of so that we wouldnt have any problems getting to his place and checking in. the apartment is in a very good location, a rather nice walk to pikes market. transportation was also hassle free, and there was a supermarket nearby which was also very convenient. the house was clean in general.  could have used just a little bit more dusting, but it wasnt really much of a problem. overall, it was a very good stay and id recommend the place to anyone looking to go around seattle.
62110	719233	8.0	9.0	3332125	Great location. Included the basic amenities of an apartment without being pretentious.  Clean and met our expectations. We would stay here again if we ever visited Seattle again! 
62111	719233	8.0	9.0	3349063	Nick's place was clean and wonderful to stay in.  Close to many fun areas of town and although we didn't meet him personally, he was easy to work with and very quick to communicate with us making everything go smoothly.  He had a friend give us the keys and she was also super helpful and wonderful to work with!  I would definately stay in his place again.
62112	719233	8.0	9.0	3441909	Great location and space for the money! Very walkable to downtown area and felt safe.
62113	719233	8.0	9.0	3480970	We were very pleased with the arrangements pre arrival and with the appartment itself. It is conveniently located (close to  atractions, bus stops nearby,restaurants, grocery) and provides adequate space for three people . (room 107 accomodates easily 2 people).  Good kitchen applicances and some stuff in the cubbard such as tea, coffee and peanut butter. Parking is a problem but can be managed wiht $10-$12 full day sites and off street parking; manageable over the week ends but some creativity required. Nick is extremely helpful:we forgot some stuff after packing in a hurry and he will send this ..and declined us paying postage... Highly recommended!!!
62114	719233	8.0	9.0	3515557	This was my first Airbnb experience and I was very impressed by the whole setup! Nick was a great host and prompt with his responses when I had a question. If you're looking for a place that's central to the different neighborhoods in Seattle, Melrose Court is a great option! I would definitely recommend it. 
62115	719233	8.0	9.0	3529154	This modest apartment is in a great central location. Nicole, Nick's helper, was very warm and welcoming, and was helpful in orienting us. The apartment is basic, as Nick clearly outlines, so visitors should temper their expectations to match the listing. The beds were comfy and the unit was quiet, which was great. Everything worked as it should! There were a couple of minor cleaning issues, which I understand Nick is currently correcting. 
62116	719233	8.0	9.0	3566515	"We visited Seattle for the NASP conference in February and we had a great time (sorry for the late post). We really appreciated how helpful Nick was before our arrival, he always answered emails promptly and gave us a lot of information. When we were there Nicole was very helpful, she pointed out the great coffee shop around the corner (Bauhaus) and even walked Katie to the convention center on the first day. She was available for late check-in and was always helpful when we had questions.
We enjoyed the location of the apartment very much, which made us very independent of public transportation. It was also well heated and cozy, and we enjoyed how silent it was. 
Some minor cleaning issues were discussed with Nicole directly and we are sure that that's not an issue anymore since a month has passed. 
Marlene and Katie :)"
62117	719233	8.0	9.0	3594649	"Nick and Nicole are both very accommodating. The place is centrally located in Capitol Hill where everything was. The place does need a bit of a clean up. Very dusty and bathroom was somewhat dirty. The bathroom door also had problems closing fully and required a huge force to close and open it. Overall, the apartment had everything you needed for a weekend getaway minus free parking, which wasn't an issue for us since we traveled by foot and public transportation. 

Thanks Nick and Nicole for all your help! "
62118	719233	8.0	9.0	3622240	I cannot recommend enough staying in the Melrose Court Apartments. Nick and Nichole do an excellent job of making sure that you feel comfortable and at home. The place is centrally located within blocks of some of the main strips in the Capitol Hill area.  My wife and I walked back-and-forth from Pike Place Market and all around the area without any issues at all.  The apartment itself was clean and cozy, and they kindly provide cups, dishes, paper towels, towels, and so on. They were very helpful in checking us in around our unique schedule, and we would gladly stay in their unit again.
62119	719233	8.0	9.0	3630693	Great place to stay!  Was our first time using AirBnB and it was definitely a great first time.  Very easy to communicate. Clean place. Would definitively recommend.  Close to some good bars/restaurants. Overall great experience.   
62120	719233	8.0	9.0	3635712	I guess that the cleanliness problems pointed out by previous reviewers were corrected - I saw nothing that I could complain about. The apartment is simple, but has everything you might need during a weekend or longer stay. The bed is comfortable, the room is quiet (even though the location itself is not - guess that's the price for living close to downtown)  and the apt exceeded my expectations if you consider its price. 
62121	719233	8.0	9.0	3682067	Fantastic location!  Comfortable, low-key apartment with big windows and lots of conveniences covered.  I especially appreciated the Roku box (playing Netflix, Hulu) and coffee maker :) Getting keys was easy and Nick & Nicole were both friendly and prompt!
62122	719233	8.0	9.0	3697906	I surprised my bf with a trip to Seattle and this was the ideal location to stay at.  It was very easy to get to from I-5 and the whole surrounding neighborhood is Seattle at its best.  If you are coming by car, make sure to investigate parking options beforehand.  The hosts are also very helpful with this.  The apartment is a good size for two people, and surprisingly quiet and private given the very populated area.  We were relieved it is on the third floor, away from the busy streets around the building.  There is nothing showy about the apartment or the apartment building, but there is everything one would need to feel comfortable.  Nicole is who we dealt with - she lives in the apartment complex as well so is easy to contact, and a pleasure to deal with.  We would stay here again in the future.  
62123	719233	8.0	9.0	3729848	Great place if you don't need too many luxuries. Cool neighborhood with bars and coffee places nearby. Super easy to check in and check out. I miss Seattle already!
62124	719233	8.0	9.0	3743647	"Nicely kept apartment very convenient for both the city centre and Capitol Hill.  There were 3 of us staying there and found it fine for just a few days.  I slept on the futon and found it very comfortable.

Parking around the area can be difficult.  Most spaces around the apartment are 2 hours only during the day, but spaces can be found for overnight parking.

Nicole was very accommodating when we asked for an extra key, but we only had one key for the first day.  I'd suggest letting Nick & Nicole know beforehand that you need a second key if this is what you require."
62125	719233	8.0	9.0	3789584	"Everything went smoothly and well.  Although Nick was out of town, his assistant Nicole did an extremely wonderful job being present and answering questions!  The room was very nice and clean and the location was perfect!  I'd definitely recommend staying here.

Best,

Sean"
62126	719233	8.0	9.0	3799764	"We actually ended up staying in 107 instead of 307 (there was some sort of mixup on arrival) but the apartment was pretty comfortable and conveniently located. We especially appreciated that there was only about a 20 minute walk (our luggage slowed us down) to the light rail, which then took us to the airport. Easy walk to a lot of restaurants and downtown attractions. 

There was a lot of construction going on in the courtyard, which wasn't really a problem for us for the one morning but it would have been for a longer stay. Hopefully that's just temporary. 

Nicole handled all communications and was very friendly and helpful. Nice bargain for the location. Would stay here again. "
62127	719233	8.0	9.0	3812485	Even with same day notice our host was very accommodating. Great value, enough space for three to sleep (four if you share the bed). Really convenient location. Stumptown coffee right around the corner was amazing!
62128	719233	8.0	9.0	4029478	Great experience. Easy to coordinate. Super friendly host. Comfortable place to stay. Very close to lots of cool places. Thanks!
62129	719233	8.0	9.0	4062751	The apartment has everything you would need to feel like you are living in Seattle.  The location is perfect, only 5 blocks from the Hill and a short walk to downtown. They even had umbrella in the apartment for guys like me who from SD and forgot to bring one.  Nicole was very helpful as well :-0  She even let me have a late checkout.  Look forward to staying here again. 
62130	719233	8.0	9.0	4082129	"The apartment (307) was really great for me. It was big enough, clean and had everything you need to live for a couple of days and even for a longer period of time. 
The location was excellent. You could easily walk to the ""Spaceneedle"" and the ""EMP"" or to downtown within 10-15minutes.
Nicole was a great host, she answered my mails within 24 hours, most of the time after 1 or 2 hrs, and she was super friendly.
Whoever wants to stay in Seattle and needs a good, clean and cheap location- Nick and Nicole are the right hosts for you!"
62131	719233	8.0	9.0	4103784	Nick's place is in a great location! The apartment is a functional home-base for access to all of the great bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. His disclaimer that parking can be tricky is true, but it was definitely manageable. Check-in/out was really easy and convenient. 
62132	719233	8.0	9.0	4107105	Nick was not available, so his friend Nicole checked us in and everthing went alright and short time arrangememts we're no problem. That was the good thing concerning this accomodation. The position at downtown was pleasant, too. BUT the accomodation itself was very dirty and we were disgusted (hair in the bed and the bathroom, floor was full of dirt and had not been swepped for I do not know how long). Even the sheets on the bed had not been changed for a while and there had been some people for just one night sleeping there before our arrival. 
62133	719233	8.0	9.0	4116002	We booked a room mid-week for one night to see a show at a local music club. The location can't be beat.  It was walking distance from everything we needed and much more affordable than any motel we would have found in that area.  We weren't able to meet up with our hosts (our fault--forgot our phone) but they left perfect instructions for us to get in and out via a lockbox.  It's basically an apartment in a complex with other residents.  Seems many of them smoke outside, so I would warn future visitors if they are sensitive to that, but it didn't bother us at all, and couldn't tell from inside the rooms.  The apartment had all the basics with kitchen and comfy bed--nothing extravagant, but nothing missing either. We appreciated the maps and binder of local eateries left on the table for us.  We parked in a lot up the block for the night after 6pm and were out by 7am, so paid $6 total for that, I think.  When we visit the neighborhood again, we would be sure to stay here.  
62134	719233	8.0	9.0	4131813	Nick was great about communicating and relaying details for my stay, and the apartment was beautifully appointed and a short walk to downtown and the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  
62135	719233	8.0	9.0	4143155	"Spent two nights here in April.  Very happy with this apartment and would return.  Close to lots of good eats in Capitol Hill.  Walk to downtown is also not so bad.  Accommodated 3 of us without trouble.  Nick's crew were easy to contact and were helpful with our delayed check-out.  

Apartment is up 5 or 6 flights of stairs, no elevator if that is relevant."
62136	719233	8.0	9.0	4148363	We were in town for a show at Julia's on Broadway and the location of 307 was premier. Situated in a cute neighborhood intermixed with stores and restaurants. In the morning, we ventured outdoors for a 12.5 mile run and it was so much more pleasant to begin in a neighborhood, than in downtown (although downtown is a mere 1/4 mile, Pike Place - maybe 12 blocks, very convenient).  Nicole (who coordinates for Nick) is delightful, responsible, respectful and a true Pacific Northwestern. Thank you.
62137	719233	8.0	9.0	4173683	"We spent a night here in April, as it was a prime location and nicely priced! Nick wasn't in town, so Nicole checked us in and made sure that we had everything we needed. She was super accommodating, when we were unsure about when we would be checking in, as well as when I forgot a couple of things in the unit after checking out and needed to be let back in. 

The unit wasn't that big, but it was big enough for the two of us to move around in comfortably. Everything was clean and looked great. There were some issues with using the oven/stove (as the markings for the temperatures were scratched off), but overall the kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pots & pans, and utensils. 

The other parts of the unit (bedroom, shower, & entryway) were also nice and up to standards, with a couple minor issues with things coming off/loose. I would say to also be sure and look around the unit/explore before you move in... we almost entirely missed spotting the garbage underneath the sink. 

All in all though, it was a great stay at a great place/location and a great price!"
62138	719233	8.0	9.0	4211719	"For our recent stay at Nick's we solely dealt with Nicole. Communication was excellent. Our arrival and departure was very easy and hassle free. The location felt safe and was reasonably close to downtown Seattle which enabled us to walk to most places. The apartment isn't the Ritz and is probably best described as ""A single guy friends apartment"". It had everything we required. We would happily stay at Nicks again."
62139	719233	8.0	9.0	4242491	Nick was great in communication beforehand. We didn't actually meet Nick when we were there, but Nicole was super sweet and very helpful checking us in. The apartment was exactly as described, except I don't think the description/map do justice to how fantastic this location is! Google maps can't capture the amount of awesome stuff that's within an easy walk of this location. If Nick were to provide a comprehensive list of the great cafes, bars, restaurants, shops, etc. within a five-minute walk, it would probably fill the entire airbnb page. You'll just have to book a visit here to see for yourself. 
62140	719233	8.0	9.0	4318221	We wanted a cheap and easy place to stay for one night in Seattle. This place was in a very convenient location, right off the freeway in downtown Seattle and close to bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. The apartment building and apartment itself were a little dingy. Apartment 307 was located in the back corner down a dark hallway. It faces the back lots and alleys between neighboring buildings. The apartment has low ceilings, poor lighting and a cramped layout. I don't know how anyone might live there for more than a few nights but it served our purposes. Generally, it was clean. We didn't use the kitchen. The bathroom was pretty clean except the spots on the ceiling. Nicole was nice and responsive. We got lucky with parking and found a spot a block away on Melrose between Denny and Olive Way, as Nick recommended.
62141	719233	8.0	9.0	4337211	Great location.  Place is small but the location makes up for that. Has everything you need. Very nice bed and very  comfortable. Clean. 
62142	719233	8.0	9.0	4449410	I loved this place. Quiet complex, ridiculously good location (walkable to pretty much everything I wanted to go to), lovely to come back to at the end of the day. It's nothing fancy, but it does the job. 
62143	719233	8.0	9.0	4502392	"My wife and I had a great stay at Nick’s flat in Seattle. It really is in a great location, within easy walking distance of the city centre. On arrival we were a bit surprised by the outwards appearance of the apartment block which reminded us both of our student housing at University (rather austere). However the flat is really nice and my wife and I used the kitchen often to cook food from the farmers market (a must). The local area has some great cafés, bars and restaurants so you’re never stuck for somewhere to go to close by after a long day of sightseeing. We didn’t meet Nick but thanks to Nicole for all her help. 
With regard to things to do in Seattle, the Space Needle is fun but right next to it you have the Chihuly Glass Garden which is definitely worth a visit; it’s truly astounding and beautiful. It’s right next to the Space Needle so make sure to get the group entry ticket for them both. 
If you don’t mind jokes, music and water then you must ride the ducks. The amphibious buses take you around Seattle then into the lake! Our driver was hilarious!! Seattle isn’t huge so these tours gave us a really good look at the city which we then continued to discover on foot.  
This is all we managed to cram into our two day trip. We had a great time and I hope you do too.
"
62144	719233	8.0	9.0	4521762	"Nick's rental apartment served our needs well, during our 24-hour stay in Seattle.  We needed to be able to walk to Downtown as well as to Seattle Center, and the location, being one point of the triangle,  worked fine for us.  All the essentials are there, including the basics for a simple breakfast (such as dry cereals)  and the bed was comfortable to sleep on.  The building is close to highway I-5, but this unit is tucked away such that the traffic sound did not disturb us. The building itself is quiet, and we never
heard any noise from others in the building.  We had no problem getting keys and had excellent communication with Nick and his helper Nicole.  Overall this was a good, practical choice which served our needs well.  Many thanks to both Nick and Nicole!
"
62145	719233	8.0	9.0	4560629	Nick's apartment was nice and clean and very close to the downtown area. We enjoyed our stay. It was a great price for what you get.
62146	719233	8.0	9.0	4631851	Great place! The location is awesome and it's the perfect size. Definitely would stay here again. 
62147	719233	8.0	9.0	4647681	"This apartment was very convenient to all Seattle sites we were looking to see. The apartment was clean and had enough space for 2 people. 
I only wish there was a little more communication about when to pick-up and drop-off the key and where. Other than (email hidden) was a fabulous stay."
62148	719233	8.0	9.0	4676444	The apartment was exactly as described, exactly what my Dad and I needed for a weekend visit to Seattle, no frills. Nicole was super accommodating and responsive when it came to information and keys. This is a reasonable option for 2-3 people with the futon couch.
62149	719233	8.0	9.0	4773177	Nicole was SO helpful!  This is a great apartment in an amazing location.
62150	719233	8.0	9.0	4906767	The apartment is a bit old and not very clean but it has perfect location. It is very close to downtown and all public transportation. There is also a grocery store right around the corner, making your life much more easier. If you do not mind a rather old apartment and opt for the location and the price, this is a great place for a short stay
62151	719233	8.0	9.0	5224310	"We spent 4 days in Seattle. Prior to our arrival, we had very nice contact with Nicole. Nicole explained everything to us (TV, cooker, frontdoor, etc.) and gave us great recommendatons where we can find tasty food and drink in the neighbourhood. Very much recommended is Linda`s Tavern in 707 E Pine St  Seattle, WA 98122, if you like a cozy and Little bit crazy place to drink a beer or two in the evening.

The Apartment is cozy and well located to explore Seattle. We had nice walks to Pike Place Markt, Pioneer Square and the Waterfront. On our way to the Space Needle we used the Monorail. Busses to downtown departs in the Pine Street, just around the corner.

Furthermore you can use the laundry with washing machines and dryers in the Basement of the Apartment block. They are easy to use if you have enough quarters. 

We can recommend this apartment. Thumbs up for Nicole. If we come back to Seattle, we would book again with Nicole."
62152	719233	8.0	9.0	5249740	The apartment was very clean and cozy. Nicole is awesome and was very very helpful!!! It was great for two people with the pull out Futon bed and the area was great. I would definitely stay here again!
62153	719233	8.0	9.0	5311393	This was first time to vist Seattle and also used Airbnb. Nick and Nicole are very helpful. The apartment was bit old but very cozy and comfy. The location is super safe! You can stay just like own house. I love Seattle so much and I'm believe to stay there next time. Thanks for all.  
62154	719233	8.0	9.0	5357957	Small private cozy apartment located in the perfect location. Loved it, will definitely stay there next time I'm in Seattle
62155	719233	8.0	9.0	5395624	Quiet studio in Seattle that was a great location for being able to experience Seattle by foot. We hardly took the Sound or the bus. 
62156	719233	8.0	9.0	5554292	We came from Orlando, to Seattle.  We had never used Airbnb before or stayed with Nick.  Nichole greeted us and the stay was lovely.  It was everything we expected and would enjoy staying there again.  I would also suggest it to anyone who is visiting Seattle
62157	719233	8.0	9.0	5674257	Overall this was not a bad place to stay. The location was really convenient for downtown Seattle activities and there were quite a few coffee shops and restaurants within a few blocks of the apartment. If you're a neat freak I wouldn't suggest this place, it was older and not as clean as a hotel would be. It's also quite a bit smaller than I anticipated from the photos. Still, the price is fair and it worked for us for just a couple of nights. We basically only used the place to shower and sleep and it worked well for that,
62158	719233	8.0	9.0	5751708	Good place to explore Seattle and return to sleep. Close to bars and restaurants.  Nicole answers all your questions right away. 
62159	719233	8.0	9.0	5915008	My daughter and I had a nice one-night stay in Apt 307. Nicole was great, friendly, kept in contact with us and met us at the property, walked us through the apartment and explained things, gave me a tip on nearby free parking, and made clear she was available if we needed her or had questions. The apartment itself is comfortable, safe, clean and well-appointed with all the basics. Would stay again! Thanks!
62160	719233	8.0	9.0	5968705	"Nice place to stay... If you r under 40~ no bus needed to anywhere downtown:)
Fit in 3 ppl with one king size and a foldable sofa.
It was perfect for me :)
You can have your own kitchen to cook anything you want.
Laundry at the basement which is very convenience even to have a long vacation in Seattle.

Book it and enjoy your stay :)"
62161	719233	8.0	9.0	6103426	"This modest apt is in such a great location - 15 minute walk to Link Light Rail (for airport), 15 minutes to Pike Street Market, short walk and monorail ride to Seattle Center, plus tons of great restaurants very nearby (thai, vegetarian, pastry shops, sandwich shops, wine bars, etc). The apt has all the essentials you'll need if you plan to be out on the town during most of your stay. 
Nicole (on site person) was great with communication and took care of an issue very quickly. 
Not terribly clean, and be ready for late night noise (it is located in Capital Hill, after all. there was a music video being shot at nearby Dick's Drive In our first night! helicopter noise well into the night).
Overall, a great deal and super great location! Would definitely stay there again."
62162	719233	8.0	9.0	6160295	The apartment is very convenient for accessing many places in the city.  Excellent restaurants were just two or three blocks from the place.  Although I thought I'd hear a lot of noise from the highway,  it was quiet.  I did not get to meet Nicole, but she was really good with getting back to me quickly when we had a key situation.  I would gladly stay there again.  Alas, I recommend reading the notes in the binder thoroughly, it was as we were leaving that we discovered there was a cushion for the futon in the closet which would have made sleeping on the futon much more comfortable.
62163	719233	8.0	9.0	6309965	"Most things with staying in this apartment didn't go smoothly, but I feel like that was probably an anomaly based on the other reviews for this place, so I'll share my experience, but with the note that this was probably just a fluke.
I had contacted Nicole prior to the date to see if we could leave our luggage in a storage unit because we would be getting into seattle before check in (3pm) and she agreed, which was very nice. The keys to the storage unit were in the lockbox, as promised, but when we came back, the keys to the unit were not there at 3pm. We waited outside for 15 minutes before a neighbor came down to give us the keys, but also to tell us that the apartment wasn't ready and to come back. When we did get in (about 20 minutes later), there was a tiny amount of TP, and when I asked Nicole for some, she implied that there had been plenty, and I had to insist there wasn't. She then brought some, but mistakenly left it at another unit, and insisted that she brought some to us until she figured it out. So, some awkward interactions and a little sense of unreliability, but I've had way worse experiences at hotels, so I took it in stride.
Regarding the place, it is FANTASTICALLY located. We saved about $120/night on this versus staying in a hotel nearby, for which we were grateful. This is definitely just a crash pad, though. I wouldn't choose this if you were planning to cook at all. The Roku with netflix is also an excellent touch though, if you do stay in! "
62164	719233	8.0	9.0	6554212	The apartment was perfect for what we needed.  It is centrally located and easy to find.  Nicole assisted us with check in and couldn't have been more helpful.  She also gave us very helpful advice when asked.  I look forward to staying here again!
62165	719233	8.0	9.0	6697396	Nick's place was really convenient. Close to most attractions in Seattle. Perfect for what I needed, exactly as advertised, easy check in and out.  It is an older building/apartment but I knew that going into it. Nichole was very nice and very helpful! Thanx guys!!
62166	719233	8.0	9.0	6725611	Nick's place was just what we were looking for - simple, clean, and in a great location. The caretaker, Nicole, was extremely communicative and patient during our quick and hectic stay. It was a great first experience using Airbnb and everything worked out fine!
62167	719233	8.0	9.0	6782979	Fab little spot to stay - just a 10 min walk to the shopping district and Pike market and so close to loads of really cool trendy little bars and restaurants in capitol hill . Nicole was so  helpful and fast to respond with ideas and suggestions on where to go that it made our trip a nice smoooth one and she was really helpful on any questions we had. The flat was really cure with everything we needed including one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in!  Nice safe neighbourhood ina great location, lovely clean falt - just what we wanted and well worth the money - Thanks Nick and nicole!
62168	719233	8.0	9.0	6868311	This apartment is well situated, close to all attractions of Seattle, so ideal for tourists. There are also many coffee shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. 
62169	719233	8.0	9.0	7099498	"a small but efficient apartment very near downtown Seattle.
If you have a car parking is tricky but it is a great area near the Space needle!"
62170	719233	8.0	9.0	7122108	My girlfriend and I did a long weekend in Seattle, staying at Nick's place on Thursday and with friends the remainder of the weekend. The apartment is perfect for those traveling and looking to explore the city: great location, walking distance to local coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and steps away from downtown Pike Place area. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable with every amenity needed. Nicole was an amazing host in providing prompt responses to questions regarding traveling to Nick's apartment and the surrounding area. She also allowed us to use the apartment's storage unit for our luggage after we checked out so we didn't have to lug it around the city while waiting on our friends to meet us. We will definitely stay here again when in the area. Thanks so much, Nicole!!!
62171	719233	8.0	9.0	7158609	Nick's place was great. Easy walk to downtown and great local bars. My boyfriend and I will definitely rent this place again next time we're in Seattle.
62172	719233	8.0	9.0	7217804	Great apartment just outside of downtown, and right in the Cap Hill neighborhood. It was perfect for exploring the city over the weekend. 
62173	719233	8.0	9.0	7302031	Nicole is a great host.. Very kind and gentle.. The apt is just a little bit small but is located in a nice area, close to everything.. I raccomande her as a host... good experience ;)
62174	719233	8.0	9.0	7574397	The apartment is simple but comfortable.  I recently visited for ten days.  The location is super if you need to take mass transit.  Walk a block and find a bus to downtown and beyond in minutes. Considering the location the place is remarkably quiet. The bed is very comfortable but the futon not so much. The kitchen could use some upgrading but you can make do even without a microwave and toaster.  Not fancy but I felt at home after a long day of seeing the sights. Convenient market around the corner.
62175	719233	8.0	9.0	7642294	Nick's apartment is a good place for staying in Seattle in a walking distance to downtown. Check-in and check-out were easy and the apartment itself was clean and comfortable.
62176	719233	8.0	9.0	8038949	The apartment has a great location, it was in the heart of Capital Hill and is a close walk to downtown. It was clean, homey and comfortable. I would stay here again! 
62177	719233	8.0	9.0	8148220	The apartment was exactly as expected! Nicole was so helpful with helping find parking for our car. We were there for a conference at the Washington Convention Center, and the location was perfect for this! I would definitely stay here again in the future!
62178	719233	8.0	9.0	8325228	"This place is great! A nice, quiet apartment that was clean and well-kept. Nicole handled all of the check-in process and was extremely friendly and available if there were problems. 
The place is close enough to everything that I pretty much walked all over. Great restaurants and coffee shops in one direction. Westlake (and a 2-minute monorail ride to the Space Needle!) and Pike Place Market in the other.
The Roku was great so I could have Netflix on when I was in the apartment. And the full kitchen was great for morning coffee and such. 
I'll definitely check this place out again next time I'm in Seattle!"
62179	719233	8.0	9.0	8425601	The apartment was in a good location, and was relatively clean. there were good kitchen supplies for basic meals and a large fridge. our check-in wasn't a fantastic experience as the directions provided to make our way to the apartment via public transit were incorrect, and we were left instructions and keys for a different room to the one we booked (we luckily figured it out after a desperate 30 mins of not understanding why the keys didn't work) but other than that, it was fine. thank you.
62180	719233	8.0	9.0	8479236	The apt is perfekt for two persons and in a great location to explore the Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill. 
62181	719233	8.0	9.0	8615072	This apartment was perfect for myself, my fiancé, and my 4 month old daughter. It was conveniently close to various restaurants. Though it was difficult going up 3 flight of stairs with luggage and a stroller, we have nothing to complain about. It was well equipped and made our stay in Seattle like we were at home. Made our time there the best it could be! 
62182	719233	8.0	9.0	8848568	"If you're looking for an affordable stay, Melrose Court Apartment is a great value option. Well-kept inside the apartment, and with everything you need. The location is awesome too. Our host was not able to meet us, but the key was easily gotten from the lockbox.

My only feedback is that the smoke detector needed its batteries replaced, and it didn't work when I tested it."
62183	719233	8.0	9.0	8882787	Nick wasn't around to greet us, but the location was great otherwise. Our group just walked everywhere, and it just was a great place to stay. A few blocks away from Pikes Market also walking distance to the needle. Just for warning, if you have a car.... don't have a car... parking can be a bit expensive. There is overnight parking right around the corner if you do have a car.
62184	719233	8.0	9.0	9014167	The apartment at Melrose Court Apartment is situated in the perfect neighborhood. You will be within walking distance of bars, restaurants and pike place market. If I were to return to Seattle, I would gladly stay here again. Thanks, Nick!
62185	719233	8.0	9.0	9081689	The location of the apartment is great - everything we needed was walking distance (great restaurants, shopping, etc). Parking was a challenge, though. Luckily we found a spot on the street that was free and unlimited. Everything else was 2 hour limit, or expensive above-ground lots that only let you pay for 12 hours at a time. The basics were provided. I would suggest bringing your own towels as there were only two bath towels available. Overall, the apartment was a decent place to hang our hats for our short trip enjoying Capitol Hill. 
62186	719233	8.0	9.0	9209283	Great location, nicely furnished, and comfortable.  Walking distance to just about everything.  Parking takes a little bit of time but you can find spots that have no restrictions if you look for them (The city provides a map online of parking restrictions by street).  Wifi was hit or miss so plan accordingly...Would definitely stay here again.  
62187	719233	8.0	9.0	9282791	Great apt! Its just like the pictures, very comfortable and well located!  With two friends spend a couple of nights in Seattle and this apt was a great experience. We didn't meet Nicole but she was lovely attending our requests and doubts, and even she resolve us a problem that we have in very short time, definitively I will consider this apt if I return to Seattle. Super recommendable
62188	719233	8.0	9.0	9734020	"A clean and basic apartment in an excellent part of town. Not a bad Seattle base for a short stay. Certainly good for the money.

The bed was comfortable and the shower was good. The space heaters all worked and got the apartment warmed up quickly.

Just two quibbles:

1. I had a late check-in and had been given self-check-in instructions. I successfully retrieved the keys from a lock-box but was rather alarmed when the keys wouldn't open the door! I'd mistakenly been sent the instructions for Unit 107 instead of 307. To be fair, I should have read the AirBNB page more thoroughly so the mix-up was half my own fault. Nicole (who lives on-site) acted quickly and sent the correct instructions when I messaged her through AirBNB from a nearby bar. Phew!

2. The main WiFi connection was not accessible and the backup connection was weak. I had to sit in one particular spot to use it and it still kept cutting out. I managed to do the most important things like checking into my next flight but the idea of using something like NetFlix or Skype, I'm afraid, would not have been possible. 

A really great thing about this apartment is the location. Capitol Hill has lots of good bars, coffee shops and breakfast places."
62189	719233	8.0	9.0	9817278	I had a good time at Nick's place. Even though I never actually saw anyone, handing over the key and getting access to the apartment was very well organized and worked absolutely fine. The apartment itself has most amneties you will need and an extremly comfotable bed! We also enjoyed the Netflix account which is perfect for some relaxed evenings. The location was right in between Capitol Hill and Downtown - which made it easy to walk to nearby venues. As the ad mentioned, parking really is a problem. However I can only recommend this place - thx again!
62190	719233	8.0	9.0	9898012	"Stayed here with a friend for an event being held at the Convention Center. This location was super easy to walk to/from Downtown, and we didn't have any problems.

When we arrived, there were a few things we requested from Nicole, and she was able to get them to us almost immediately, fantastic response.

Next time I'm in Seattle, I'll be checking if this space is available again. :)"
62191	719233	8.0	9.0	9938838	"Check-in was easy, just met at the door and handed over they key. Apartment was pretty much as expected. Not the nicest finishing, but very functional and fair for the price. Only small issue was that we had to call and ask for more sheets for the futon.

Overall, I was happy with the apartment."
62192	719233	8.0	9.0	10244652	I booked this place for two weeks while traveling by myself for business, and thought it was a fantastic deal. The apartment is tidy and clean, exactly as it appears in the photos. The location is very convenient to downtown and Capitol Hill; I walked to Pioneer Square every day. Getting here from the airport is easy; you can take the light rail to Westlake and then walk right up the hill to get there in about 10 minutes. Nicole was right on time, communicative and helpful every time we corresponded. Basically, I couldn't be happier with the experience and will definitely try to book again next time I travel to Seattle.
62193	719233	8.0	9.0	10361067	This apartment was exactly what I was looking for - clean, simple, in a great neighborhood (Capitol Hill) and walkable to downtown. Very comfortable for one but would work well for a couple as well. No complaints about this, would definitely stay at Nick's place again next time I visit Seattle. A great alternative to the high-priced, impersonal hotels. 
62194	719233	8.0	9.0	10509585	This is a perfect place to stay if you're attending a conference at the Washington State Convention center!  It's less than a 10 minute walk and in just the right location between the downtown shops and Capitol Hill's wealth of amazing restaurants and bars.  We were in town for a conference and were able to have easy access to our place throughout the day, as well as a short walk home if we wanted to go out in Capitol Hill after a long day of talks.  I would recommend the Pine Box, which has amazing beer and is literally 2 buildings from the Melrose Court Apartments!  Nick and Nicole were great hosts and we wouldn't hesitate to host them at our place in Portland!
62195	719233	8.0	9.0	10673689	"Great apartment. Easy check in. Perfect location, especially if you like pie (Pie Bar is right around the corner, among many other great food and drink places). Internet worked 99% of the time, heating worked wonderfully. Clean bathroom. Kitchen is functional. Bed was comfy. Don't sit down too hard on the futon or you'll get a bar where it hurts. 

Overall, way better value and experience than almost any hotel I've stayed in. Highly recommended."
62196	719233	8.0	9.0	10776007	"My girlfriend and I stayed in this great little apartment on our 4 day trip to Seattle. After our flight, we took the train into town and was dropped off at Westlake Center, from there we walked to the apartment. Took us about 20 minutes to walk and it would have been very easy to take a cab. 

Once we got there we had a little problem with the keys, but our contact was very close by that it took no time at all to get the correct key and get in the building. 

The apartment is small but definitely got the job done! A living room, a hallway kitchen, and a bedroom with an attached bath. The living room has a tv, local tv channels, a Roku and a DVD player. During the trip we ended up just watching the regular tv channels. We did bring our laptop and use the wifi that was provided. 

Since we had a kitchen, and we love to cook breakfast, we went grocery shopping and got eggs and bacon to cook every morning. The one thing I would suggest if you're going to cook on the stove top is open the window in the living room up, and the window in the bedroom to make sure the fire alarm doesn't go off. We had the alarm go off every time we cooked but the windows definitely helped. 

The bed was great, I believe it was a double size bed. Plenty of blankets. Also the bathroom is small but has great storage. Enough shelving for all your toiletries, there was body wash and shampoo in the shower. My girlfriend and I are both pretty tall, her at 5'10 and me at 6'1, the shower head was a little short. The shower head was probably around 5'8. We laughed about it and enjoyed the hot showers anyway. 

About the neighborhood, what a great place!! The apartment is right in Capital Hill where there are bars and restaurants. We literally walked the whole area our first night and passed so many places. Seattle I believe is known for the boutique style restaurants, and we definitely found this on Capital Hill, but we ate at the Walrus and Carpenter near Ballard and would definitely recommend going there or to the area to find some great food! It's worth whatever the cost of the transportation to get there. 

We also walked from the apartment to the Seattle Center which was a little far, but definitely do-able. 

We would love to thank everyone who took care of us! The communication was great and the place was clean and very inviting. Thanks for everything and we would definitely stay there again if we ever planned a trip to Seattle again! "
62197	719233	8.0	9.0	10822365	We had a great stay at Nick's apartment and it was in such a great location. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go downtown. If you don't feel like walking all day or can't, there are also plenty of modes of transportation nearby. We took the light rail from the airport and walked the rest of the way- it was super easy. Didn't get to meet Nick or Nicole, but Nicole was readily available for any help that we needed. I will definitely come back whenever I am in town. 
62198	719233	8.0	9.0	10926259	The check in process here left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I often think of airbnbs as a personable experience where you are renting from the owner of the apartment. Here there are 4+ people involved in the management of the apartments at Melrose Court, leaving plenty of room for miscommunication and errors in check in. In my case, I asked to store my luggage before check in as I had to check out of my conference hotel by 11 am. I was told that the apartment would actually be ready for check in at 11am. When I arrived, the keys were not there. When I was eventually let into the apartment (by some random man who watched me struggle with 2 suitcases up 3 flights of stairs without offering to help), it was evident that the place had not yet been cleaned. Check in was not smooth. Once the apartment was finally cleaned, it was fine. I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said, except maybe to say that there is no corkscrew, should you fancy a bottle of wine. 
62199	719233	8.0	9.0	11239681	"I recommend this place without reservations. The apartment is very centrally located, within walking distance of the market (about 15 mins) and all the hotels and convention centers, so very convenient for conferences etc. 
The place is comfy and functional, bit enough for 2 people for sure. 
Both Nick and Nicole were super friendly and helpful. I felt at home and would definitely stay again if I go back to Seattle. I hope I will because I loved the city!"
62200	719233	8.0	9.0	11341628	We spent an awesome 6 days in a beautiful location within Seattle.  From the apartment, you are not only within walking distance of the Washington Convention Center and Pike Place Market but also all of the cool shops and restaurants of Capitol Hill.  We spent all day just walking around and exploring (the best way to see a city, in my opinion).  When it came to the cleanliness of the apartment, I believe that the bed could use some new sheets.  We spent our first night doing laundry at the local laundromat due to the sheets and pillowcases having some hair and other foreign substances on them.  However, after we washed and dried the bedding, it seemed that they had merged and became one with the sheets.  *Side Note: I really appreciated that there were extra sheets/ pillowcases/ pillows/ blankets provided in the dresser, though we didn't see them until after we did the laundry* Though I didn't meet Nicole (who helps manage the apartment), communication was quick and she was able to see to providing us a storage space for our bags after checking our and prior to our flight back home.  Other than that, I think that this apartment is great and comfortable for two people who want to be in the center of the city and experience it all. 
62201	719233	8.0	9.0	11541721	"The photos are slightly deceiving. It looks a lot brighter and newer in the photos, but regardless our stay wasn't bad. There was an old/mildew smell and the bathroom could look cleaner. We stayed here for two nights so I don't really mind. 

Also, Nicole sent us directions for the wrong apartment number so for 5 minutes we tried to get into an already occupied unit. Luckily, we called her and she directed us to the appropriate unit. 

On the bright side, the location was very ideal. Easy walk downtown to Pike Market and also close to many bars/restaurants up the hill. "
62202	719233	8.0	9.0	11753804	The location is perfect: halfway between downtown and Capital Hill with a pinball bar and pie shop just around the corner. Be sure to pack comfy shoes because you'll be climbing up and down hills. The apartment itself is an Ikea special: sparse, yet adequate, furnishings. It's rather dark and all windows look out to concrete walls. Internet was spotty at best. We never met Nicole (who manages several of these in this apartment building for Nick, I guess) but she was easy to communicate with. 
62203	719233	8.0	9.0	11845640	My friends and I had a great time in Seattle at Nick's place. It was quiet and pretty comfortable. Located centrally to everything we wanted to see. We walked everywhere! The only problem we had was the internet connection didn't work. But the TV in the apartment had a pretty sweet setup with Pandora. There were three of us that stayed and it was fine for one night, but I think anything after that might get claustrophobic. Getting in the apartment was super easy and there was a nice courtyard we sat in at night. 
62204	719233	8.0	9.0	11893006	It was a clean and efficient apartment with a big fridge and comfortable king size bed.  The Roku player was a nice addition since we had a Netflix account. The location of the apartment is the best part. It's right downtown and super close to many things like Pike Place Market!
62205	719233	8.0	9.0	12280313	Overall we had a good stay. The place was clean when I arrived and it was super convenient to the convention center which was exactly what we needed. They even left a useful binder that had good information about the area and about the apartment.
62206	719233	8.0	9.0	12709804	Perfect location - walkable distance to downtown and the Space Needle and tons of great bars and restaurants right on the doorstep in Capitol Hill. The apartment is basic, but adequate, and as shown in the photos. The check-in and -out process was very easy and Nicole was very responsive.
62207	719233	8.0	9.0	12832808	"So when my wife wanted to go to Seattle for her birthday/mother's day weekend I knew that it was going to cost me an arm and a leg in lodging alone. So after trying to find a hotel close to Pikes Market and the waterfront the only place was a hotel for $135.00 per night and horrible customer reviews. I was lost, but then I remember airbnb. I went on and found exactly what I was looking for. 

Our stay at Nick’s apartment was amazing. This was such a great and clean place to stay in the city of Seattle. The apartment was exactly want our little family of three needed. Such a welcoming place with a furnished kitchen, comfortable bed, roomy living room and everything you need to enjoy your time. It was very close to Pikes Market and all the great things that Seattle has to offer. 
The neighborhood of Capital Hill was amazing. Capital Hill is so diverse and is bursting with so many wonderful things it’s really hard to explain. The people are nice, the food is excellent and the area just makes you want to move there and just live life different from the norm. 
I would come back here again and again. Nick was a great host and had everything that we needed to know in his itinerary. We never say him, but I was comfortable knowing that if we needed anything that it would happen if we just asked. 

The only thing that was an headache was the parking. And that is not something that Nick can control. You will just have to find a place to park and hope that you don't need to leave. We stayed at a paid parking lot: 
The Salvation Army Lot - Parking Lot
Diamond Parking Services LLC
1101 Pike Street
Seattle, WA 98101
(location id 200113)

and used the app ""CalltoPark"" to keep paying for our spot. Its not a long walk to the apartment and it was a God send when we found it. But other than that it was EXCELLENT!!!! 
  
"
62208	719233	8.0	9.0	12933201	The apartment is extremely conveniently located to both Capitol Hill and downtown but pretty small. This was a great launching point for our stay as we were without a car and relied on walking. The apartment is nicely appointed. Although it is small, its perfectly fine for two people. Internet was spotty but Netflix on the TV made up for it. While we didn't ever meet Nick or Nicole, she was quick to answer our call when we had confusion getting our key (our fault, not hers!). 
62209	719233	8.0	9.0	13128538	Nice experience. Good neighborhood, centrally located. 
62210	719233	8.0	9.0	13269806	"The place was incredibly clean, had all amenities as listed and everything worked great. Cozy and comfortable little apartment. 

Neighborhood is fantastic and felt safe at night. Easy walking to many restaurants, coffee shops, stores, bars, etc. and to the middle of downtown. Walkable (less than 1 mile) to Pike's Place Market and waterfront. 

Nicole (liaison for owner Nick) made everything super easy. She was great. Easy to get in and out. We never met in person but did not have to with convenient key arrangement.

I would definitely stay here again if needing a place near heart of downtown. Highly recommended."
62211	719233	8.0	9.0	13553645	With mostly utilitarian decor the space has the main plus of being located a few blocks from Broadway in the Capitol Hill district, and being fully self-contained. The communication with the host's assistant was prompt and courteous. It was a last minute booking and I was grateful for that. There are more romantic locations. This one is practical and functional at a fairly reasonable price. Be aware that there is a $30 cleaning fee and $20 service fee in addition to the stated nightly price of the space. This amount is not per night but for the duration of the stay. The hot water pressure was iffy (the apartment is in an older building and on the top floor).
62212	719233	8.0	9.0	13680273	My parents and I stayed in this apartment for a quick weekend in Seattle, including a show at the Paramount. The location was awesome and the place had everything we needed to be comfortable. 
62213	719233	8.0	9.0	13915147	We had a great experience! Nicole was great with communicating directions and procedures, and upon arrival, everything was just like we expected - no surprises! The location was ideal for us. We were attending a conference at the Westin downtown, which was less than a ten minute walk, but we were also within easy walking distance of some great restaurants/bars in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Considering how pricey Seattle is, I thought the apartment was a great value and would stay there again if visiting.
62214	719233	8.0	9.0	14115461	Very responsive host.  Great neighborhood.  Apartment clean and quiet but shabby.  Building looks like a former motel so the hallways are in an outdoor courtyard -- dirty and not an experience I would repeat.
62215	719233	8.0	9.0	14167242	My brothers and I stayed at Nick's place for one night while visiting Seattle. It was in a great location for us since we wanted to go out to the Capitol Hill bars. There were plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Everything was clean and the move in process was very easy. Thanks again!
62216	719233	8.0	9.0	14342625	This was my first time using airbnb and I was a little hesitant. However, the reservation process was clear and easy so I was excited for my stay. The apartment location was great. Very close to downtown Seattle...walking distance, actually. I was pretty disappointed when I walked into the bedroom and bathroom. It looked like someone had just rolled out of bed. The pillows were smashed and spread out throughout the bed. The comforter and blankets were just balled up. Gross. The towels in the bathroom were also hung like someone had just used them...just thrown on the towel rack. My cousin and I actually made a Target run to buy towels and a couple throw blankets because that's how uneasy we felt. Very inconvenient when you're on vacation. No one wants to take time to go buy supplies. Would we stay here again? Probably not. 
62217	719233	8.0	9.0	14540543	"Host was very responsive and gave great instructions on the process.  Answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly.

This is an excellent location in Seattle.  It may seem like the area is a little run down but this is really the charm of an older part of downtown/capitol hill corridor Seattle.  Loved it!! Lots of great restaurants nearby, easy walking distance to both downtown and Capitol Hill.  This is really a very safe and cool part of (email hidden)t pretentious or uppity, the Seattle I love!"
62218	719233	8.0	9.0	15087611	The apartment I was staying is great neighborhood, good restraints, coffee shops, all you want are available in few minutes. Nick is very kind and helpful all the time, response quickly, great owner what I ever know. 
62219	719233	8.0	9.0	15501101	The place is cute, clean and convenient. Nick gives very clear instructions in checking in to make it easy!
62220	719233	8.0	9.0	15628161	If you are looking to stay in a simple, small, but cheap apartment in a great location; then this is the place. The check-in and out process was simple, the host communicated promptly with great instructions on how to get to the location. There are great bars and restaurants all around the apartment. My favorite was Pine Box, they have amazing food! The walk down to Pikes Place and downtown was close. The only negative I would say is that the apartment does need some updates. The bed wasn't the most comfortable, the towels were a bit warn and it sometimes smelled like cigarette smoke. I had the windows open since it was hot during my stay so it must have come from the courtyard. I do recommend the apartment for short stays and only two people. 
62221	719233	8.0	9.0	16055846	"Location, location, location! This was my second time up to Seattle to visit my friends who live in Capitol Hill. The apartment was in a great location:  close to Downtown, close to a show we saw at The Paramount, and close to all the great restaurants and bars that Capitol Hill has to offer. I even walked down to Pike Market to meet some other friends, and it took less than 20 min. to walk there.

I wasn't planning on spending a lot of time in the apartment. I was just looking for a clean place to crash and have a clean bathroom. And the apartment satisfied my needs. The apartment is nothing fancy; it's functional and utilitarian. But it was clean. Bed was comfortable and clean to sleep on. Temperature (with windows open) was perfect and cool. Bathroom was clean. Clean towels provided. Enough outlets to charge mine and my friend's electronic devices.

The two negatives were the Wi-Fi and the shower pressure. The Wi-Fi worked only in the living room area and it took a couple tries between the two networks provided to get a decent connection, but once connected, it worked fine for the most part.

The shower pressure was the worst part of the apartment. It was really bad, and it seemed to get worse over our 3-day stay. By the last morning, there was barely a thin stream coming out of the shower head. I don't know if it was a ""low flow"" showerhead that was breaking, or if it was the building, but the shower pressure was definitely a huge negative. However, the water temperature itself was fine. There was always enough hot water, so we could at least get in a hot, albeit minimalist, shower.

Lastly, Nick was great. He left great instructions that were easy to follow (especially on how to obtain the key), and the one problem that I messaged him about, he got back to me in a reasonable and timely manner.

As long as the shower-pressure situation is remedied, and someone is just looking for a clean, functional, basic place to sleep and use the bathroom, and one is looking to be in a great location in Seattle, then I would definitely recommend the apartment."
62222	719233	8.0	9.0	16203141	Nick/Nicole sent very detailed instructions on how to get into the building and apartment, which was very helpful. The apartment was appointed in a very basic but comfortable way, and it was very conveniently located. We were delighted by the restaurants, bars and shopping within a couple short blocks from the apartment.
62223	719233	8.0	9.0	16311382	"Nick/Nicole were very attentive to me and my friend who were visiting Seattle for the first time from NYC. I received prompt confirmation of my reservation within 24 hours of booking at which point Nicole introduced herself and asked me if I had any questions/concerns. Given that it was nearly a month in advance of booking, I didn't have much to say at that point, but it was great to know she was looking out for me already.

Leading up to my visit to Seattle, I received a couple messages from Nicole further confirming my stay even providing easy-to-follow directions to the apartment from the train station as well as providing a check-in time reminder. Given that I had never been to Seattle before, having all this information at hand prior to arriving was much appreciated!

The apartment itself has all the bare essentials that you would absolutely need during your stay in Seattle. It's not a home per se, but more like a hotel at nearly half the cost. Everything that we needed to be comfortable at the apartment was there, so no regrets there at all. Given that we were in Seattle to visit the city, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in the apartment itself. But as a place to rest and stay overnight, it certainly served its purpose. Wouldn't expect more than that given the price.

The building itself is old (as mentioned in the post) and the entrance can be a bit... creepy. But coming from NYC, it's not something I hadn't seen before and didn't really bother me all that much. And certainly not a reason to not stay here if you're just looking for a place to sleep and rest up during your visit. 

The surrounding neighborhood is awesome! So much to do in the Capital Hill neighborhood. The main thoroughfare (Broadway) is merely a 10-15 minute walk from the apartment. On it you'll find a plethora of shops, restaurants, bars and coffee shops. 

Everything is within walking distance of this apartment (downtown shopping, Pike Place, Space Needle, etc.). It's absolutely perfect in that respect and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Thanks for a wonderful visit!"
62224	719233	8.0	9.0	16395339	Great location but apartment needs work. Couch had a defective leg making it unusable. Wifi was very unstable and did not work most of the (website hidden) did not work at all. Apartment had a strange smell when we where there - and is painted in dark colours, making it an unpleasant place where we did not spend much time. Wrote to host after our arrival regarding wifi, couch and tv but did not receive reply. Overall would not recommend despite the location.
62225	719233	8.0	9.0	16892970	"Both Nick and Nicole made us feel welcome and provided a very thorough description of everything.  The apartment was as described except the futon, which we planned to use for our son, was broken.  Although our son had to sleep on the floor, Nicole  had a new hide-a-bed delivered the next day.  The only issue we have is that according to Nicole, she knew about the broken futon before we arrived-we were never informed although we clearly stated in our paperwork that we were arriving with three people.
We are attempting to get some type of adjustment in the rate since the apartment, on the first day, could really only accommodate two people.  "
62226	719233	8.0	9.0	17139704	"Nick was a good host. Everything was very straightforward. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood with many good pubs and restaurants. Downtown is very near, in a walking distance. The bed was good. The sofa is not what you can see in the fotos. It´s smaller and in combination with the futon not comfortable. I would recommend this apartment for two people sleeping in the big bed. I expected it cleaner.
"
62227	719233	8.0	9.0	17346049	"The place is conveniently located within walking distance to downtown Seattle and Pike's Market. That is, if you don't mind walking about a mile. The weather was nice and sunny during my stay,I did not mind walking. The location was perfect, within walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants in the Capitol Hill area.  I had a rental car and was worried about parking, thankfully there was a metered  parking lot withing a few feet away from the building. Be ready to pay top dollar for parking though.

I didn't spend much time at the apartment since I was always out; used it only to shower and sleep. 

Just two minor complaints:  food left over from previous renters left in the refrigerator made me question the cleanliness of the place. But to be fair, the rest of the place did look clean. And second, the internet connection was not stable, no sinal in the bedroom only in the livingroom. 

Overall this is a good place to stay at, I would stay here again."
62228	719233	8.0	9.0	17637400	The apartment is very close to everything in downtown which was important to us. It is basic, but had everything we needed for just one night. Communication with host was easy. 
62229	719233	8.0	9.0	17824223	"I was actually not able to go due to some last minute conflicts, but Nick/Nicole were very accommodating and allowed my friend to go without me and stay even though the booking was under my name. Review below from my friend who actually stayed there:

Nick provided directions that were easy to follow even for the directionally-challenged.  Apartment located in a great location.  Walking distance to Pike's Market and great restaurants.  Apartment had all basic necessities.  WiFi a bit slow and spotty at times.  Nice place to stay, and not a whole lot to complain about. "
62230	719233	8.0	9.0	17970710	The entire time I communicated with Nicole over email or text. She responded quickly, all the info is in their binder so read it, we where so excited to explore Seattle that we just dropped off our bags and did not come back till late. Realized the next day we still needed to store our bags and did not give Nicole a heads up (needs a day) so storage room was locked but she tried. The location was great we walked to pikes market ~15mins but at night close to an awesome pie bar and other restaraunt  sand bars. The room was as described with a pullout bed for our third person. Was worried about the water pressure as mentioned in other reviews but three of us showered in the am back to back with no issues. 
62231	719233	8.0	9.0	18234541	"We were given all information 
key was in lock box anything we asked was answeared"
62232	719233	8.0	9.0	18539423	"We did not contact the host for the time we were there, although all contact details were provided if we needed to contact Nicole. 
The unit was in a great part of the neighborhood - as we expected and we were able to walk easily to all attractions, restaurants and bars as needed. Although if you didn't want to walk up the hill home you could easily catch a bus or grab a cab cheaply. 
The unit is in an old apartment block so you need to expect a few musty smells in the common stairwell and at times in the unit. The unit overall was clean and the the bed comfy, but the floor did feel a bit grimy underfoot. Overall the unit was what we were expecting for the price. The location was great. However, if you are wanting a 5 star experience this is not the unit for you. "
62233	719233	8.0	9.0	19020747	"We enjoyed our stay at the Melrose Court Apartment. The apartment wasn't lavishly appointed, but it was a very good value considering our other options and what we were charged for our stay. The pictures aren't quite accurate, as the futon has now been replaced with a love seat/hide-a-bed combo. The hide-a-bed is only a single, however so bear that in mind. 

Other reviewer's feelings about the internet are accurate, myself and my companions were unable to get internet about 30% of the time. There are two networks available to guests though, so as long as one of the two networks are up, you're connected.

Hot water was no problem, and shower pressure was adequate from what we found. The shower head is quite low though (it sprayed no higher than my neck, standing at 6'1"") so be prepared for that. 

The apartment was ideally located near restaurants and about a 4-5 block walk from the WSCC which was an excellent distance for us and our vacation. 

Host contact was prompt, courteous and professional. 

Parking was available, but quite scarce during the day. We were fortunate in finding a space near the apartment but most areas near are 2 hour only until late, and off street parking can be expensive (20-30 dollars per day, and you have to go and pay it twice. No parking/forgetting).

Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would definitely stay again in the future. "
62234	719233	8.0	9.0	19084446	"The place was very clean and in a great location.

No issues and communication went very well. 

"
62235	719233	8.0	9.0	19173269	"This place was super convenient, well cleaned, and had everything i needed. The check-in, check out was smooth and I would definitely stay here again.
"
62236	719233	8.0	9.0	19315963	This is my second visit with Nick. Great location, clean and comfortable. Easy check-in, check out. Thanks!
62237	719233	8.0	9.0	19390088	I rented this room for my in-laws, who are technologically challenged. Nicole was very helpful and understanding. They loved this place and thoughts it was an excellent location. I can't wait to rent it for myself the next time I am in Seattle.
62238	719233	8.0	9.0	19518083	First time using airbnb. Nicole was very responsive and helpful before our arrival which I really appreciated. The day of, I was notified that I would receive a text when the apartment was ready for check in, in case it was ready before 3:00pm as we were a bit stranded it the city. However, I never received a text. The apartment was indeed ready at 3pm but it would have been nice to have received that text either way. She did offer to let us store our bags in the apartment while it was being cleaned but consistent communication would have been helpful. I was told to let Nicole know 24 hours in advance if I needed to use the storage unit after check out. I called and left a voice mail, and texted 3 times (the preferred method of communication) and never got a response over the course of the 24 hours. This was very disappointing as we were looking forward to this service since we were in town for wedding festivities and it was very odd as she had been so responsive before. Had we needed to get in touch with her during our stay for any amenities, we would not have been able to. The lock box for the keys was a nice feature since we could let ourselves in but it was very difficult to use as the black lever you have to push down on is jammed and requires all your strength and multiple attempts. The room was nice enough but located right near a trash room so very smelly when you exit the room. My feet were covered in black dirt from walking on the floors bear foot despite washing them constantly so the floors could use some extra cleaning. There is a coffee pot but no coffee so bring your own. There is no microwave but a stove. There were only two towels for two people and no wash cloths.  One of the towels was still wet when we arrived. Some of the appliances' plugs were fried so we couldn't use them. All in all, it was a decent stay, not great, not bad. I would have expected a little more for the price. It was fine because we weren't staying in much but had we needed to spend a lot of time inside, we would not have been very happy with our stay. 
62239	719233	8.0	9.0	19773723	Very accommodating.  A hotel-like experience for a much better price in a great location.  There are plenty of nice bars/restaurants within blocks and downtown/main tourist attractions are 1-2 miles away. Nice to have a kitchen to be able to cook fish purchased at Pike's Place!
62240	719233	8.0	9.0	20005189	"Perfect location - walking distance to downtown, lots of shopping and bars. 
Instructions were clear and place was nice! Host was kind enough to let us put our bags in storage due to a later flight (this was very nice of him). "
62241	719233	8.0	9.0	20612172	The location of the property was very convenient. Close to downtown locations (1-2 miles) but walking distance is subjective. The apartment itself, however, definitely looked better in the pictures. It is a very simple apartment, with a firm bed, and a small kitchen and TV with Netflix. There is a peculiar smell throughout the apartment, which didn't bother me, but definitely bothered my girlfriend who has a more sensitive nose. Buying a candle fixed that problem. The Internet, like others have complained about, was hit or miss. If you're looking for a very simple place at a decent price in a good location then this is it. Don't expect too much when you walk in. Check in and check out was smooth, I picked up the key and dropped it off at the lockbox without having to wait to meet anyone. This was a must for us since we had an early flight to catch. 
62242	719233	8.0	9.0	20949001	Location was great with downtown being a 10-15 min walking distance.  Inside was clean and nice. Host left very clear and detailed instructions, and was very accommodating letting us drop off our bags before check-in.
62243	719233	8.0	9.0	21280750	"The apartment was well located and we could walk everywhere in Seattle easily. 
Everything worked well and was we needed for a base to explore."
62244	719233	8.0	9.0	21418394	"Rental process, checkin and checkout were very smooth, with the keys in the right place, easy to open with the code to the lock that was provided a few days before.
The apartment is old-ish but clean and apartment building looks like some social housing... Only issue I have to report is the weak wifi signal, just OK in the leaving room but simply inexistant in the bedroom. I sent a message through Airbnb messaging to Nick... still waiting for the reply... Other than that, super location off Pike street. For those who want to travel by car around, there is a Budget/Avis rental place on Pike street, 5 mins away and the apartment is 20 meters away from the Interstate 5 North."
62245	719233	8.0	9.0	21663794	Nick and Nicole were very accommodating. When we addressed an issue we had towards some stains on the blanket cover, they were quick to resolve the issue and brought us a new blanket immediately. This is a prime location to stay at and is close to many good restaurants, cafe's, and touristy spots. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay in Seattle.
62246	719233	8.0	9.0	21704406	Had a nice quick stay at Nicks. The location is great, and the storage room for bags after check out was a huge help. Pretty small for 3 guys, but it worked. 
62247	719233	8.0	9.0	22040577	Checking in was easy and parking wasn't that bad. The building is older so a little creepy. The apartment is small so two people is definitely more comfortable than the 3 we had. When you open the door to the apartment it is a small living room and a galley style kitchen that leads to a small bedroom and a small bathroom. It filled the need for a place to sleep but wouldn't be a place to hangout. 
62248	719233	8.0	9.0	22594127	"It was very easy staying at this location. Nick & Nicole sent me all of the instructions on checking in & out, so I actually never really had to contact or meet them once I arrived. The location is great since it's really just a 15 min walk away from the Westlake Station & just a block or 2 away from anything you really need for your stay, like groceries and/or restaurants & bars. 

The space itself is more than enough of what you'd need for a few days stay. It's definitely more affordable than a hotel room. The Wifi signals were choppy at best & I did see a questionable wall outlet that seemed short circuited (burned/melted?) by a previous guest from the portable heater. I did like how they had a Roku set up with Netflix & Pandora though.  Someone mentioned a scent in the apartment, which I think really comes from outside, since the windows were cracked open. A scented candle from the deli a block away helps. I left a new one for the next guest since I finished off the last one. =)

I've already told other friends who are interested in visiting to check on this Airbnb first if available. Thanks for the stay!"
62249	719233	8.0	9.0	22823893	The place was clean, quaint and cozy, and it has everything you could need. The location is hands down superb. It's close to everything and I mean everything, from great restaurants to great pubs to public transportation. Downtown is a hop away, as is the light rail to get to and from the airport(and around Seattle in general).  This made it easier for me to get an any time flight without needing someone to go and pick me up from Sea-Tec. The only down side is the internet connection, as other people have mentioned. It is definitely a hit or miss, but there is Netflix on the tv which made up for it. And if I needed to check emails or anything I usually used my phone itself or used it as a mini-hot spot. Other than that, this is a great place and when I'm back in Seattle I'll be booking here again. 
62250	719233	8.0	9.0	23329657	"I really liked the location of Nick's apartment.Nice restaurants, close bus stops, light rail. I was thinking to rent a car to tour Seattle, but I actually did not need to. We walked to the fish market, farmer's market, aquarium, downtown to shop, space needle, children's museum and took a bus to Japanese garden. 
When I stepped in Nick's apartment, I felt fresh. Everything was clean and I felt welcomed. I enjoyed staying there!"
62251	719233	8.0	9.0	23364206	I would say it was about 4 out of 10. The location was ok however, there was somewhat issues during this stay. We first struggled to open the lock in front of the gate because it was really stiff. Also we were curios if the house was been cleaned or not because there were some spots on the bed cover as well as dust in between the bed and the wall. We couldn't sleep on the bed so then decided to sleep on the couch. And the house was really cold even though we turned on the heater. Seattle was raining, windy and even snowing during our visit.. This is a truly objective experience from me and my friends, which will be helpful to others in the future. 
62252	719233	8.0	9.0	23617935	This was a perfect space for what we needed, and out short stay easy in and out, close to everything! A bit difficult going up the stairs with suitcases but still a nice space! Thanks for letting us stay. 
62253	719233	8.0	9.0	23884100	Nicks place was the perfect location for me.  Nestled between downtown and capital hill.  For the price this was a great stay.  Thanks Nick
62254	719233	8.0	9.0	24117481	"It's wonderful to stay at Nick's place!
There is a supermarket within 2min walk that you can buy your daily necessaries! And public transportation is convenient! 
The suit is so warm the decorations is modern and host is so nice! "
62255	719233	8.0	9.0	24616009	"I really enjoyed my trip to Seattle, thanks to the amazing location of Nick's apartment, the actual apartment itself, however, was not a big factor in that. If you're looking purely for a place to drop your bags while you're out seeing the city, this is the perfect place for you. The check-in/check-out processes were seamless, and it was clear that Nick/Nicole run their spot as a fluid business. We arrived to a leftover trashbag and dirty dishes, but Nicole was quick to apologize and handled the trash issue for us, which we appreciated. It did make me wonder how much of the ""cleaning crew"" fee was actually being used. The beds were clearly the cheapest possible and were annoyingly squeaky, luckily we spent very little time in the apartment. Overall, the location of the apartment made up for any of the downfalls of the apartment itself."
62256	719233	8.0	9.0	25012556	"This is apartment is in an absolutely superb location.  We were able to walk to tons of places to eat, shop, dance and drink in Capital Hill.  Pike Place Market is also a quick and fun jaunt.  
We did need a couple things once we settled into the apartment but Nicole was super quick in getting it handled.  The apartment itself has somewhat of a funky, urban feel which was all part of the experience.  Roku was definitely an added bonus to our stay!"
62257	719233	8.0	9.0	25181885	"quaint little apartment really close by the city, 3-5 minute uber to and from downtown, pike place etc. 

perfect place for lounging, resting and getting ready for sightseeing

everything was really clean from the sink, bathrooms and couch

nicole did a great job communicating as well, would definitely recommend
"
62258	719233	8.0	9.0	25348675	Exactly what I paid for, and then some. I was pretty impressed! This is my second time staying at Nick's, and everything went smoothly. Just a few blocks from Broadway and a downhill walk to Pike's Place. Buses run right by it, too! Parking is a little tricky, but all in all, I wasn't worried about it. Food, coffee, and drinks is great by this complex, so that wasn't hard, either. I'd definitely recommend Nick's place to everybody who needs a weekend getaway!
62259	719233	8.0	9.0	25424533	The apartment was clean, centrally located, and parking wasn't as bad as I might have thought. The place is pretty close quarters and not terribly cozy but the location is great so you won't likely spend much time in the house anyway. There was an issue with the hot water heater while I was there and Nick was very quickly able to get me access to another apartment with working hot water. 
62260	719233	8.0	9.0	25551533	This apartment is in a great location in a very hip area of town.  It is within walking distance to many tourist attractions (walked to Pike's Market for example during my stay) as well as tons of nightlife.  It also is near many convenient places, including a convenience store, a great pie place, and a bar/arcade.  The apartment is a budget apartment, and that's reflected in the price, since I wasn't planning on spending much time in the apartment itself, that worked out great. 
62261	719233	8.0	9.0	25838288	I liked how convenient the check in/out process is with the lock box right outside the door. The reviews don't lie, street parking is really hard but thankfully we only had trouble 1 of the days we were there. And 1 other thing, there was absolutely NO hot water. Other than that, the place was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Thank you for having us :)
62262	719233	8.0	9.0	25939001	The location was so much better than we expected. We basically walked everywhere - a mile to pike place market, a few blocks to good restaurants and coffee houses. The apartment would have been perfect for two. It needs a new sofa bed for the third person. We had water issue but Nicole and Nick responded quickly.
62263	719233	8.0	9.0	25965152	Great crash pad in a cool location. If you're staying for a day or two, this will be a good spot if you are looking for a night life. If you plan on staying longer, you'll probably want a bigger place. Nick was great and very accommodating. 
62264	719233	8.0	9.0	26120438	Check in was very easy and communication was great. 
62265	719233	8.0	9.0	26321754	"This apartment is the ideal place to stay in Seattle. It's a walking distance to many restaurants and bars, or you can get a 3-5 minute ride to the Space Needle or Pike's Market. So many good restaurants around the area. I think we gained 5 lbs during the 3 days we were there. 

Although the apartment is small, it is cozy and a great place to sleep and shower. The apartment is ideal for 3 people. 

Check-in and check-out process was very simple; just take the key from the lock box to check-in and put it back to check-out. Nick and Nicole are only a text away to answer our questions and concerns. We didn't have any issues, because the place was clean and everything was in working order. 

I would recommend people to stay here! I'll book this place again if I ever go back to Seattle. Thank you, Nick and Nicole!"
62266	719233	8.0	9.0	26469486	Cool place in a great neighborhood. Pretty rustic, but great value. And clean.
62267	719233	8.0	9.0	26602018	The location is very central. Walking distance to anything relevant in that district. The place was equipped with all the basics and more like extra heater and blankets and pillows. I recommend the unit for quiet guests because the complex is pretty quiet itself.  A bag of ice comes in handy as there is not real freezer. Didn't like that they left used shampoo and conditioner in the shower! Didn't smell pleasant, it smelled like wet laundry! Old TV didn't work good. The mattress pad needs to be replaced it looks very old and unsanitary.  
62268	719233	8.0	9.0	26956988	The place was warm and bed was comfortable. Surprisingly quiet, for being right in the middle of town, and close to transportation. plenty of food, coffee, and nightlife options within walking distance, bus close for all others. instructions were timely and clear, the candy was a nice touch, thanks
62269	719233	8.0	9.0	27260248	"I had a great stay in Seattle thanks to Nick and Nicole. Nicole was very helpful during the check in process and ensured we enjoyed our stay. Listing was 100% accurate.

The location was great. Within walking distance of a local grocery store and some awesome bars. I particularly enjoyed the 21-and-over arcade/bar that is literally right around the corner from the apartment.

I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking to experience Seattle from a local's perspective. And for the money, this will be the best deal you can find for how perfect the location is."
62270	719233	8.0	9.0	27381674	Nick's appartement is perfect and is all we were expecting. The neighborhood is really fun and yet the flat is very quiet and confortable. Nicole who we were in contact for the reservation was really easy to reach. When I go back to Seattle, I'll definitely ask Nick to stay in his flat again !
62271	719233	8.0	9.0	27483698	Apartment was in a good location and perfect for my travel needs. If you're wanting easy access to downtown and exploring Capital Hill it's a good spot. 
62272	719233	8.0	9.0	27765147	The location is great - it is so close to everything you could need. The apartment is perfect if you just need a place to sleep and store your things. It is very comfortable and quiet, albeit a little bare bones. I would definitely stay here again.
62273	719233	8.0	9.0	28017691	The perfect location to everything with Amazing restaurants all around. We spent much of our time in Seattle out and about so we mainly just slept there. The TV is cool because it's adapted to so many different movie and TV show channels. The bed isn't extremely comfortable but it did have a great amount of pillows. Host was very curtious to us while we were checking out. 
62274	719233	8.0	9.0	28108273	Very easy to get in and out of.  Nicole made the experience effortless and I didn't mind the stairs one bit.  Had a great trip.
62275	719233	8.0	9.0	28306887	I never met Nick or Nicole, but they were always clear and kind with communication.    The neighborhood was alright, not bad for downtown Seattle.  They were quick to respond to any issues we had and the place was clean and workable, especially for the price!  A couple of issues like the only bathroom being right next to the bed and the internet sometimes not working, but overall it's a nice place!
62276	719233	8.0	9.0	28448210	"This place worked out great for us! We wanted to go to the Starbucks Roastery and it was five minutes walking distance. The parking wasn't too bad, we ended up paying for about 2 hours of parking since we arrived on a Saturday and then parked on the street for the rest of the trip and walked. Everything was really convenient and it worked great for having 3 people there. Nicole was great, and got back to me pretty quickly. I couldn't figure out how to keep the shower at a ""perfect"" temp, but that wasn't' a big deal. There's a pad for the pull out bed which was really comfortable and it was nice and warm. When we got there we opened the windows it felt like it needed some fresh air, and then we closed them and it was still warm. One way to describe this was: easy, convenient, and efficient. Thanks guys."
62277	719233	8.0	9.0	28553973	Great place to stay in, apartment was well kempt and equipped with necessary amenities. Thanks!
62278	719233	8.0	9.0	29042233	Listing was alright, although I have to admit, the apartment was not quite what we expected. The wifi was absolutely awful. Walkway/outside portions of the building all smelled like smoke. A few minor things could have made the space seem much nicer, such as replacing the rusted fixtures in the bathroom or removing the burnt heater panels. Nicole was great though, very responsive when we had questions. It was also surprisingly quiet for the area, and a fun neighbourhood. All in all it was a good stay, we just felt like the pictures made it seem nicer than it actually was.
62279	719233	8.0	9.0	29383404	Check in and out was very easy and the apartment was well stocked and furnished. It was within walking distance of everything I needed and had some good food in the area. 
62280	719233	8.0	9.0	29764884	Nick provided a detailed check in itineary and enabled me to check in a little earlier than expected. The location of the apartment is good and within easy access to buzz of Capitol Hill.
62281	719233	8.0	9.0	30126687	The best thing about Nick's apartment was the location. It is very central and walkable to lots of restaurants and bars. However, we had a bit of a communication mix-up when we first arrived, which was resolved relatively quickly thereafter. Overall, it was a positive experience.
62282	719233	8.0	9.0	30444582	Communications for check in, home use and check out was timely and clear. I felt like I had all the information I needed at the right time. The apartment is quite small and a little musty, but comfortable and safe. The only drawback was the sketchy wifi. The lack of reliable internet access really changed my weekend's productivity. But the location is incredibly central to the heart of downtown and within walking distance of nearly everything we wanted to see. I recommend the apartment and I would stay there again.
62283	719233	8.0	9.0	30769283	The appartement was great. Just what we needed en really good located.
62284	719233	8.0	9.0	31246772	Good location for people wanting to explore Capitol Hill.  No frills accommodation.  Check in and check out was no fuss.  
62285	719233	8.0	9.0	31509364	Details on check in were spot on! My GF and i were very satisfied with the stay. I needed to store my bags on check out day for a few hours and Nicole helped make it happen even with late notice. Located walking distance to an arcade bar, night life, shopping, restaurants, and of course Pike Place. 
62286	719233	8.0	9.0	31814455	Like everyone else has said before me, check in was a breeze.  The place was perfect for the three of us.  The location was the highlight.  We were near a lot of cool bars like The Pie Bar and a speakeasy called Knee High Stocking Company.  We were easily able to walk down to Pike Place Market.  We parked in the lot near the Apartment which was a little pricey, but much better than worrying about whether or not we were going to get a ticket.  The place was a little dusty, but nothing to really complain about.  For the price of the place compared to all of the overpriced hotels, this is a steal.  
62287	719233	8.0	9.0	31946345	"Great location just minutes walk from downtown. 

Checking in and out was very easy and straightforward. 

The apartment itself was basic but adequate, not the kind of place to hang out in for extended periods but if you just need a place to get clean and sleep then it's perfectly fine.

Only real negative of note was the wifi as some others have also mentioned. We had problems with it the whole time and found it basically unusable, probably due to there being no dedicated router in the apartment. 

Communication was mainly excellent and responses usually very quick.
"
62288	719233	8.0	9.0	32464228	Couldn't have picked a better place to stay while visiting Seattle. Situated in the perfect neighborhood. The apartment is cozy and clean. Easy to find and get in and out of. Highly recommended. 
62289	719233	8.0	9.0	32914903	Although I never got to see the host directly, she was very easy to get in touch with and very helpful. The place was clean and everything worked as expected. I've lived in Seattle before so I knew this was a great location.
62290	719233	8.0	9.0	33089990	Place was little outdated but great location and price. Hosts were responsive and accommodating for early arrival.
62291	719233	8.0	9.0	33390283	"We were looking for a clean and cozy spot to rest/sleep and this place was exactly that. Capital Hill was awesome so we were in a great location. Checking in was a hassle though. The lock box was jammed and my friend had to wait for nearly an hour for Nicole's friend (Nicole was away on vacation) to get her keys to the apartment. We also had some trouble later with getting a key to the apartment building (was not given with the apartment keys initially), BUT it was smooth sailing after all of that was sorted out.

Like others already mentioned, the wifi was pretty terrible. We couldn't use it at all during our stay.

Communication was easy, even with Nicole being away on vacation- her responses were still fairly quick."
62292	719233	8.0	9.0	33482852	I had a lovely experience at this place! The neighborhood was great, the apartment was clean and very pleasant. I would recommend it to anyone!
62293	719233	8.0	9.0	33790563	This spot served my needs perfectly. Situated among some of Capitol Hill's hippest joints, adjacent to the Downtown scene, I would happily book this apartment again. No red flags.
62294	719233	8.0	9.0	34228459	The apartment was just as described and the price was great. We only needed to stay a night and this place was in an excellent location. Would definitely stay again! 
62295	719233	8.0	9.0	34699745	My two adult sons and I stayed here for 4 nights. It is a great location (close to downtown and two blocks from grocery store) and the apartment met our needs very well. The hosts were very responsive to our questions. 
62296	719233	8.0	9.0	35077636	This is a great spot for a couple or a single person. The location is great as it's right in the middle of a lot of spots locals like to hang out at and only about $5-$10 cab ride to downtown. If you're going to Pike Place I would just take a ride to downtown and walk the remaining 5-6 blocks as traffic gets bad the closer you get to it. The apartment is clean which is about all I ask for as I tend to spend as little time as possible in my living space while traveling. If all you need is a clean bed, bathroom, and decent kitchen then this is the place for you. 
62297	719233	8.0	9.0	35356073	The room is quiet and comfortable. And the best thing I love is the location. We can walk to the Pike Market.
62298	719233	8.0	9.0	36005754	Listing was accurate, place was good. Great location, we walked to almost everything and lots of bus routes crossed the area.
62299	719233	8.0	9.0	36263374	It was good stay overall, however both of the internets did not work. Check in and out process was easy. 
62300	719233	8.0	9.0	36947558	Excellent location. It was walking distance to the to Pike place and the Starbucks roastery. The apartment was a little hard to find at first but it was big enough and very clean for the two of us. 
62301	719233	8.0	9.0	37461886	"Had a good time at Seattle, Washington for 4th of July weekend, and being at a central location contributed to that experience.  The pictures are completely accurate except for the couch.  There's now a collapsible Sofa Bed instead of a fold open sofa bed.  It's semi comfortable, but acceptable comfort level.  The bed in the bedroom was comfortable, and I slept like a baby.  Though, a lighter sleeper might hear the neighborhood if it's rowdy, as it was for me since it was the fourth of July weekend.  It was hot, so we had to keep the windows open, equaling high accessibly to the street noise.  

If I had to be nitpicky, the wifi was spotty and slow.  outside of that, Nick's place delivered as advertised, and in a big way on it's location.  20 min walk to everything, and lots of food and bar choices close by.  Grabbing a morning Coffee was just up the street and convenient.  

If I roll into town again, this place is a nice place if location is a priority, which it is for me. "
62302	719233	8.0	9.0	38259208	Pros: Amazing location. Affordable. Easy access. Includes Netflix and other free movie subscriptions. Cons: Wifi internet pretty much non-existent. Shower drainage was slow. A little dingy in some corners. Overall: Good for travelers on a budget looking for a centrally-located spot. 
62303	719233	8.0	9.0	38499171	Great location, especially if you're visiting the convention center, and everything was very clean. All communication was clear and responsive. Thanks!
62304	719233	8.0	9.0	38625318	Great location in Capitol Hill! Walking distance to restaurants, bars, and downtown. This apartment has a really nice wall of windows, and gets a great breeze when you open them all. Plenty of room for a solo traveler or couple. Nick worked with me to let me drop off my luggage  at the complex early before check-in, so I wouldn't have to lug it around at my convention all day. Would definitely stay again!
62305	719233	8.0	9.0	39001164	The house was small but clean. It's in a great location. We walked or took an uber everywhere. Only downside was there was no air conditioning and we were there in July so it was hot.
62306	719233	8.0	9.0	39209675	"Unfortunately I only have bad things to say about this place. 
The bedding was stained, the wifi didn't work, and the bath & the basin were both blocked. I had a lot of trouble sleeping because I could feel the springs coming through the mattress & the freeway was extremely loud.

I was very disappointed with what I got for the high price I paid. 
I wouldn't recommend this place. 

The host did make the check in process easy & left some brochures for things to do in Seattle, which was nice. "
62307	719233	8.0	9.0	39392602	"Pictures can be deceiving..
We recently stayed here for what was supposed to be a romantic vacation for my boyfriend and I, until we found out what we picked to stay in. If you have luggage or lots of stuff to take with you on the trip don't book here. We had to walk ten blocks with all of our luggage the haul it up 3 flights of stairs. Parking was horrible. We had to wake up at 7 am to move my car and be back at 6pm to move it again, it really put a damper on the things we could do. But there was no other parking around

The apartment was close to downtown which is the only good thing I can say. There was mold on the roof in the bedroom.. Mold growing in the drains of the bathtub. The vanity where you're supposed to put your toiletries was all rusted. And we were only left a roll and a half of toilet paper.. 

This is definitely not a 3 person apartment. The pull out couch is half of a love seat that looks pretty worn in. And the only bathroom is through the main bedroom. So if your third guest has to use the washroom in the middle of the night, everyone is being woken it.

We rented thos place for the kitchen and never used it once. We needed to clean out a cooler and so we used a little soap, which wasn't soap it was pure bleach.. 

The walls looked like they had snot smeared across them.. It was aweful I dreaded every night we had to go back to this place.."
62308	719233	8.0	9.0	39643438	Nick notified us a couple of days before our arrival and gave us detailed instructions on how to check in.  We had a smooth arrival and was able to get into the apartment.  The description of the listing was accurate and was suitable for 2-3 people.  There were even some leftover food (unopened box of crackers) in the kitchen.  The neighborhood was safe and only about a 10-15 minute walk to Pike Place and downtown.
62309	719233	8.0	9.0	39912781	Generally the property was as described. There's no AC and the surrounding area is a bit noisy (it's located close to a major highway), which makes keeping the windows open at night difficult (we visited in July). The apartment was clean but in an older building. Generally, when compared to hotels in the area this unit is a great value. 
62310	719233	8.0	9.0	40342425	Very accommodating host (coordinated with cleaner to let us check in early) and fantastic location!
62311	719233	8.0	9.0	40728040	This a great location for anyone who is looking to explore Seattle by foot. The apartment is older so expect it to show some age. So, if that is all okay then this is the place for you! Area is surprisingly quiet. All in all it was good stay. If you have a car you can park at the Washington Convention Centre which allows secured overnight parking (locks up midnight-5:30am).
62312	719233	8.0	9.0	41924369	"The listing description was spot on. It whole place was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The little kitchenette was just enough to cook some basic meals, which was just what we needed(mainly breakfast). 

It is maybe a mile walk down the hill to Westlake Station to catch the monorail and just a few blocks down is Pikes Public Market. 

However, you can catch some great coffee, beer, and food all around the apartment. Nightlight is very vibrant on Friday and Saturday with lots of energy and young people walking around having a good time."
62313	719233	8.0	9.0	42386992	"Basically as described. The location is convenient to the conference center.  The WiFi is sketchy and bordered on useless, as others have noted. The shower would have been a great height for someone a head shorter (I'm 5'9""). Communication was OK, not great. I mostly chalk that up to Pillow, with whom I was not impressed. I asked about stashing my bag someplace when I got in at noon and before my departing flight, and Pillow referred me to a hotel a half mile away. But when I got there, there was a note in the room that there is actually storage on site. No one ever told me that. Then the cleaning person was late and had to clean around my bag anyway. The person from Pillow who called to tell me they were running late spoke barely passable English and told me the cleaning person was having car trouble, but when I talked to the cleaning guy after he got there he clearly had no idea when he was supposed to arrive (I told Pillow I wanted to check in at 3, and he showed up after 3:30 cracking jokes about how early I was). "
62314	719233	8.0	9.0	43363616	A disappointment. The initial information did not disclose a mold and mildew problem. That can be deadly for someone who is allergic. The initial information said to contact the Pillow Team for any problems. We did. They responded but did nothing to correct the problems - no hair catcher in the tub, internet would not work, no washcloths or lack of full set of bedding for the couch. We were offended by the response from Pillow Team, and we would not stay there again.
62315	719233	8.0	9.0	43618611	This is a great place and a great location! Nick made everything very easy for us to put our bags away before check-in, and the place is exactly as described. It was clean and incredibly spacious. As far as the noise concerns go, please be aware that you will be staying in the city-center of Seattle so expect big city noise. I would stay here again because it is within walking distance of everything that you could possibly want, and I enjoyed staying in the apartment! 
62316	719233	8.0	9.0	43924904	The neighborhood was in walking distance to everywhere that we wanted to visit. The building was older but description was accurate. 
62317	719233	8.0	9.0	44134731	There was some confusion regarding the key and storage room. There were no sheets for the sofa bed. everything was solved and I was issued a $45 refund for the inconvenience. I was told there was a new management company handling the property and the issues will be corrected in the future  
62318	719233	8.0	9.0	45233403	"GOOD STUFF: Excellent location just a few blocks away from the Convention Center. Our room was off the road and quiet so that was an unexpected plus. Communication was rapid especially when we had car problems and had to check out a few minutes late, they were very accommodating. Queen size bed quite comfortable.

BAD STUFF: The only reasons I am not giving a full five star is that the futon pictured was actually a pullout armchair and the sheets were not labeled but just in a trash bag in the closet. Also we were only given a 1/3rd of a roll of toilet paper with no back up so we had to go out a buy more our second day there. Also limited outlets. Recommend bringing a power strip if you have many electronics. INTERNET: The internet they provided in the information page from Pillow was a terrible connection and came from a mysterious unknown source. However there is a modem/router inside the room with the information on the bottom of the router- much better connection. 

Would stay again."
62319	719233	8.0	9.0	45947555	"Nick's place was exactly what I was looking for in Seattle. It was conveniently located, easy to find, in a safe neighborhood, and clean. Instructions and communication were clear and easy throughout the process. 

The neighborhood was great, too! The oyster bar just up the street was a fun late evening stop. 

If you're looking for a simple, clean place while in Seattle, I'd recommend Nick's! "
62320	719233	8.0	9.0	46715879	The flat is administered by a company and is rented professional. The house is dirty, the flat was quite clean but everything inside is really old. A couch where you don`t really want to sit on. (not the one from the picture) When I came there the drains where blocked, but they fixed it the next day. The area is quite nice, a lot of bars around. Next time I would pay a bit more to get into a hotel, the flat wasn`t worth the price. 
62321	719233	8.0	9.0	47157023	"Overall good experience and would definitely recommend this place. The place was very clean when we arrived. A little putzy dealing with the ""Pillow"" management site for check-in info, etc. but not bad. Great neighborhood to stay in with the best restaurants/bars/culture of the city. My only complaint was the bedding, there was no fitted sheet on the mattress, only a top sheet that did not stay tucked in making sleeping somewhat uncomfortable along with a cheap bedspread. Parking was also somewhat difficult but the host makes that clear in the description. You can pretty much walk to everything if you can make it without a car."
62322	719233	8.0	9.0	47671696	Great location! Nice clean apartment w/ in walking distance of everything I wanted to do in Seattle. Pine box is a great spot & is right next door. Would definitely stay here again! 
62323	719233	8.0	9.0	47959955	We did not meet Nick, and after our reservation request was accepted, the rest of the process was carried out through Pillow. This Airbnb experience felt a bit more impersonal than others, but worked out just fine. Killer location. Very simple accommodations. Recommended if you're just looking for a bed to crash in a centralized part of the city. Not recommended if you require fanciness. 
62324	719233	8.0	9.0	49094010	I am very sorry but I have to give a bad review. The most important issue had to do with the keylock code. They gave me a wrong one. We had to call the administration while waiting in the street with all our luggage until they sent the cleaners. They also tried the given code and nothing. It was wrong. The cleaners used a different code and we could finally get the key and open the building front door. Once we could open the door we realized that there were no elevator. Not such a big problem, but they should have advised because it's a third floor. The apartment had one wardrobe with no place in it for even 1 bag. Wifi didn't work at all. None of the three different networks given in the welcome book. The apartment had 1 (one) glass and we had to share it for the four days of our stay. On the good side, the location was excellent and the apartment is big enough for a couple.
62325	719233	8.0	9.0	49766970	I did not get to meet Nick but there was enough instructions and guides etc. to feel very comfortable in his apartment and the city. The place is the perfect base to explore Seattle from. The Location is awesome! It is incredibly quiet at night which is amazing for how close you are to everything. The apartment has everything you need and also appears much bigger in person. Would happily stay again!
62326	719233	8.0	9.0	50747837	"Overall a rather subpar experience. We had to call the pillow company upon arrival because, like a previous guest stated, the code we got was incorrect. Fortunately, they had the correct code and we didn't have to wait until a cleaner arrived. Once we got in and set everything down we had to immediately open all the windows and empty the woefully inadequate dehumidifier in order to help assuage the musty smell permeating the place. If you're over the height of 5'5, be prepared for an awkward showering experience due to the height of the shower head.  The information book seems to have been put together circa 2011, which made for a few errors in places that are still in business. The internet code we got was also incorrect, but thankfully the one on the book was able to get us access to the laughable internet connection. It took us far too long to find a place to eat as well as directions there using the provided internet connection. If you're planning on an extended stay, we wouldn't recommend using the freezer. We bought ice cream and it was melted the next day.

On a better note, the location couldn't have been better, right in the middle of everything we wanted. We were also able to store out luggage after checkout in the supply closet for several hours which was incredibly helpful as we had an 11pm flight."
62327	719233	8.0	9.0	51428258	Nick's apartment overall is very nice and cozy. The group who take care of the apartment gives good advises and help when I couldn't get the keys from the master lock. A great thing I would like to mention is they provided a lot of trash bags for you to use, which helps when travel with dirty clothes. The apartment is locate in the quiet zone but a little bit scary at the hallway because it was dark outside. Suggest someone who can install a bright light at outdoor. No parking provided to us but street parking was available and kind of easy to find parking in the neighborhood. 
62328	719233	8.0	9.0	55320582	The place was nice and cozy. Lighting was not as bright as the picture showed. 
62798	1039766	8.0	10.0	5480716	Great host, very friendly, helpful and organized. The room is very private and the house is in a convenient location, close to many stores and a short walk from downtown. 
62799	1039766	8.0	10.0	5802545	Lillian was able to accommodate my last minute booking for the same night and was very fast to respond to all messages. Her place was in a great location for visiting downtown and surrounding areas. Highly recommended!
62800	1039766	8.0	10.0	5848798	Lily was a great host; she was communicative and accommodating. She gave me complete privacy. The location of the apt could not be better, and with parking to boot! 
62801	1039766	8.0	10.0	5931562	Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.
62802	1039766	8.0	10.0	6561229	This was exactly what I was looking for—a clean bed in a great location at an affordable price. Lillian is very sweet and accommodating, as well. 
62803	1039766	8.0	10.0	6787494	"Lilian is a nice host who is nice and accommodating.  The apartment flooring is a bit older than what the photo shows due to natural wear and tear.  The room is a bit small and so is the window.  The living is room is nice and big and Lillian usually has no problem with the guest using that room.  The AC is only in the living room and is not powerful enough to cool the guest room which can get kind of hot in the hottest days of the Seattle summer.
The point of biggest complaint is the smell from the cat's litter box.  The litter box is in the washroom but the smell permeates into the hallway and makes the using of the washroom & kitchen (besides the washroom) a very unpleasant experience."
62804	1039766	8.0	10.0	6839976	Lily was great about communication and easy going about the whole thing. Thanks again!
62805	1039766	8.0	10.0	7068755	"I had a great stay with Lillian, although I wasn't around the house much as I was in Seattle for the PAX 2013 gaming convention.

Lillian was friendly from the moment I entered the door (as was her cat!), and any issues were quickly resolved with text messages (as I said, I wasn't at the house much).

The house was nice and clean, I had the use of the kitchen if I wanted it (although I actually ended up eating out for all of my meals - Seattle has a lot of great places to eat!), and the wifi was fine for catching up on my internets in the evenings.

20 minute walking distance from downtown Seattle (specifically the convention center) was fine for me, I'm from the UK and thus used to walking around cities. It's also a lovely place to wander.

I would definitely consider staying at Lillian's again if I happen to be travelling to Seattle in future!"
62806	1039766	8.0	10.0	7128558	"Lillian was a fantastic host.  She helped me find a restaurant late in the evening after I arrived.  I also enjoyed her cat that is very friendly.
I used her dryer to dry my clothes after I'd been walking in the Seattle rain."
62807	1039766	8.0	10.0	7284670	I had a such a great time here! Lillian is super friendly and willing to give you directions or recommendations. The apartment is in a great location, lots of good restaurants ect., and you can easily walk to downtown Seattle. The room had a big closet and was very clean and the kitchen and washer/dyer were a huge plus. Also, Mushi the cat is adorable and super friendly. I would definitely recommend staying with Lillian! 
62808	1039766	8.0	10.0	7444013	Lillian is a total sweetheart and her sweet little house is located in the heart of one of Seattle's most vibrant neighborhoods. A real gem if you want to experience an authentic Emerald City trip!
62809	1039766	8.0	10.0	7892565	"I only stayed with Lily for two nights, but she was really welcoming and helpful. 

The house is in a great location on Capitol Hill which was my favourite part of Seattle, with lots of interesting places to drop into. 

Lily made the whole process really easy and helped me have a great visit. In fact she even put a load of my washing in the dryer for me on my last day which was lovely- thanks!!

A great home base to explore Seattle."
62810	1039766	8.0	10.0	8058750	The apt is in a great location right in the heart of Capitol Hill and Lillian is a great host.
62811	1039766	8.0	10.0	8106235	"Had an enjoyable time staying here. The place was walking distance to Pike Place Markets and the trendy places around Capitol Hill.

The room was clean, comfortable and Lillian was very hospitable."
62812	1039766	8.0	10.0	8297271	Place is not great no coffe maker .room is cold there is heater but host dint mentioned . Most of the host not home . Day I checked in I met her that's all . Host ch with guest but not . Bed  not comfortable makes noise. I won't recommend . 
62813	1039766	8.0	10.0	8513964	Clean, safe accommodation at a great price in one of Seattle's best neighborhoods.
62814	1039766	8.0	10.0	8629710	Lilian is a wonderful hostess. Her place is the center of everything. I enjoyed my walks to the convention center. I enjoyed her cat, too. Mushi the cat is so well behave. Thank you, Lilian for having me. You are great. Morie
62815	1039766	8.0	10.0	8691222	Clean, good firm bed, access to kitchen for cooking, unobtrusive cat, walking distance to shops, pubs, restaurants. Lily was respectful of our privacy and made an effort to let us have the place to ourselves even though that wasn't part of the arrangement.

62818	1039766	8.0	10.0	9337049	This apartment has a great location if you like urban, walkable neighborhoods. It's right in the middle of everything in Capitol Hill. The parking spot is a big plus too. The other thing I really enjoyed about the apartment is that I had a lot of privacy and space to myself, which was essentially what I was looking for. Thanks, Lillian.

62826	1039766	8.0	10.0	10380748	First time using AirBnB. Reservation & communication with host went very smooth. Received a very warm welcome on arrival. Room & facilities as described. Parking right in front of the door was very nice as I decided while I was there to rent a car. Interesting neighborhood - lots of cafes, bars and restaurants. Very accessible by public transport as well. Would stay again! :-)
62827	1039766	8.0	10.0	10487782	Very convenient location to down town and heart of cap hill.  I was a bit of a ghost (in late out early) but place met my needs readily.
62828	1039766	8.0	10.0	10524513	As my first airbnb experience, I made a last-minute reservation to stay at Lillian's for two nights in Feb 2014. She was the perfect hostess - responsive to enquiries, friendly but not intrusive, helpful and informative - and I had the run of her apartment including kitchen use and living room (which I really didn't have time to take advantage of). Room isn't huge but clean, warm, included wireless internet and was perfect for my short stay. All in all it was just what I expected/hoped for and the price was right. Her Capitol Hill location is perfect - great neighborhood and an easy fifteen-minute walk down to Central Seattle and the conference center which was the reason I was in town. I will certainly repeat next time I'm in Seattle.
62829	1039766	8.0	10.0	10655414	I was in town for a conference so I didn't spend much time at the house.  Lily was very communicative before and throughout my stay.  The accommodations were basic, but the place served my purpose well: safe place to crash, affordable, close to conference.  To anyone out there looking for a place to stay during a romp in Capitol Hill, this is an excellent location.  Thank you Lily!   
62830	1039766	8.0	10.0	10729911	"Lillian is very friendly and makes you feel right at home.  She also has some great suggestions for nearby breakfast areas!

The location is right in the heart of Capitol Hill with awesome restaurants nearby.  There is a bus service right to the downtown public markets at your fingertips.

Would recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore this area of Seattle.  Which in my opinion is one of the best!

Also, the location can't be beat -- in a very hip neighborhood and within easy walking distance (though I do like to walk, so my sense of ""easy"" might be warped) to downtown and the waterfront. "
62843	1039766	8.0	10.0	13566362	Our stay with Lillian was great! Her guest room is very clean. We were greeted with a friendly hello and some helpful tips about the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The location of the apartment is excellent, a close walk to many sites in Seattle. The bed is very comfy and she even provides complementary towels, a nice touch. As well, the kitchen is open to use which is very convenient. Thanks so much!
62844	1039766	8.0	10.0	13677143	"Lillian was very warm and welcoming! She made me feel very comfortable in her cozy apartment! The room is exactly as decribed and there is also a large closet (not shown in the photos) with hangers, which I used to hang some wrinkle-prone clothes :) The only minor issue I had was the comfort of the bed, especially since I have bad hips. I mentioned this to Lillian at the end of my stay and she, without hesitation, mentioned that she would have gladly switched beds with me for my comfort, which was very kind. After leaving, she replaced the mattress with a new memory foam one, which I can't wait to try if I am every in Seattle again in the near future! :)

Location, location, location! Lillian's apartment is located near the southern part of Capitol Hill - gorgeous area. I was meeting up with friends around downtown Seattle everyday, and was able to easily walk there in less than 40minutes - even to the Space Needle. I really appreciated the ease of access and gorgeous scenery along the way. 

(Rating is due to the bed, which has been replaced now anyways!)

Thanks Lillian!"
62845	1039766	8.0	10.0	14114687	Chambre très bien située dans Capitol Hill. Propre, bonne connexion wi-fi. Lillian est d'une gentillesse! très disponible. Very good location in Cap Hill. Clean, and good wi-fi connection. Lillian is so kind! she take care of her guests. Je recommande cet endroit!
62846	1039766	8.0	10.0	14200521	Lillian's room was in a great area. Clear close by to places to dine. The place was quiet and neat - and Lillian was very kind. I was in a huge rush in and out - so didn't get to spend much time, and had to leave at 4:00am in the morning! So I left in a hurry at dark thirty! Didn't get to make the bed or wash my glass! Sorry Lillian!
62847	1039766	8.0	10.0	14514218	"I had a comfortable stay at Lillian's place. It is awesome to be so close to everything on Capitol Hill and downtown. I didn't see Lillian much because I was busy but she was very helpful. This was my second stay at her place and I would stay here again.

62848	1039766	8.0	10.0	14657472	This was a short but very nice stay on Capitol Hill for me. Lillian is so nice and everything is perfect in the house, near the bus stop and downtown. Thanks again !
62849	1039766	8.0	10.0	14789626	This is a great place if you're looking for a laid back neighborhood only minutes away from downtown Seattle. 
62850	1039766	8.0	10.0	14847952	Lillian's home is located two blocks from Broadway, where restaurants and coffee places abound. Her home is clean and she is a friendly hostess. 
62851	1039766	8.0	10.0	16197721	"   The bedroom has enough room, a street front window with good ventilation and a fan, a good collection of brochures on the city, and a selection of books for evening reading.  The living room is spacious with a wide-screen television.  The kitchen and bathroom are adequate.  Security is very good.  The street is tree-lined, with jasmine in bloom while I was there.  The location is wonderful: a couple minutes from four different bus lines to various parts of the city, with two ending in the center of the Downtown after a bus ride of about ten minutes.  These lines also run west to Seattle Center with the Space Needle and other attractions, north past Volunteer Park with the Seattle Asian Arts Museum and its conservatory and to University of Washington campus, and south past the northern end of the International District-Chinatown.  A high-end supermarket is close, a four-minute walk; a cheaper Safeway is a couple of stops away on one of the bus lines.  Overall, a comfortable stay in a very fine location.

62852	1039766	8.0	10.0	17209012	"I had a great time with Lily. Communication with her before rival was great, she helped me find my way to the house. The room is as described, and I slept very well on the big bed. For warm nights there's a fan. I really enjoyed the time there. Lily is a great host, who gave me a bunch of tips and was always helpful. I regret I could not stay longer with her.
The location is perfect, you can't be in a better spot on capitol hill, walking distance to all the bars and restaurants.... I hope I can stay with her again when I come back!"
62853	1039766	8.0	10.0	18236116	"Honestly, I was disappointed. Lillian is a lovely person and I know that she truly tried to give me a good experience, but it was not at all what I was expecting. It is definitely a good value and a GREAT location, but the worst part (for me) was that the entire apartment smells really badly of cat/cat litter. I think the smell was probably the worst part for me to be honest. It also wasn't as clean as the picture makes it seem....just  heads up. 

For the price some of these things may be OK, and like I said Lillian is really very sweet. But just a heads up!"
62854	1039766	8.0	10.0	18443510	"Lillian is an excellent host--helpful and unobtrusive. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was marvelous. I'm a walker, so I was able get downtown easily on my own, but public transportation was also easy to access from the neighborhood.

62859	1039766	8.0	10.0	20497933	Lily's apartment was a great place to stay within a very short walk of Capitol Hill! I've mostly stayed in Airbnbs in Brooklyn previously, many of which were entire places that weren't lived in and basically felt like hotel rooms. This was obviously a bit of a different situation, as a spare room in a lived-in apartment, but that made it feel like a more authentic way to see what it would be like to live in Seattle. We only ran into Lily a couple times, but she was super nice and really communicative during our stay! Would definitely stay here again.

It's a very cool part of town with lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The room is simple and not big on luxury. Don't expect a hotel-like stay, but if you are planning on spending most of your time exploring the city it's perfect."

62901	1039766	8.0	10.0	34110381	Friendly host, clean and comfy room, in a very fun area. Definitely a good place to stay.
62902	1039766	8.0	10.0	34753617	Responsive responsible host. Comfy bed. Clean. Great location. Nice cat.
62903	1039766	8.0	10.0	35418119	Lillian was super nice! Very friendly and made me feel at home. Good room and fun area to stay, easy to get around. The cat is cute too!
62904	1039766	8.0	10.0	35501688	It's a simple clean front room on the street-- some street noise, but not a lot considering how central the location, which is just a block off Broadway; super convenient, nice and accommodating host, super fat old cat.
62905	1039766	8.0	10.0	35788988	"Lillian was a great host. She made sure my late-night arrival was easy. She was very welcoming and answered all of my touristy questions.  

The apartment is in a great neighborhood... short walking distance to so much good food and coffee. Some of my favorites within walking distance - Glo's (amazing eggs benedict), Analog Coffee, Vivace Coffee, Cafe Solstice (cheap/yummy breakfast sandwiches) and Melrose Market (delicious wine + cheese counter). 

I even walked to the Space Needle one day! (It's about 1.5 miles - a good distance but worth it.) 

You are truly in the heart of Capitol Hill when you stay with Lillian. 

I can't wait to visit Seattle again!  "
62906	1039766	8.0	10.0	36206653	Lily is really nice and accommodating to your schedule. Great location within walking distance of downtown. However it could use a deep clean across the board.
62907	1039766	8.0	10.0	36589779	The place is exactly as pictured, and is clean and neat.  Lillian provided directions from the airport  to her place by public transportation, and was waiting to greet me when I arrived.  Her place is only one block from Broadway, which is the fun and lively heart of Capitol Hill.  There's a great used bookstore down the street.  It was only a 20 minute walk (downhill) into downtown and on the way you can meander past the Starbuck's Tasting Room and Serious Pie.  I'd be happy to stay here again.  
62908	1039766	8.0	10.0	36877847	Lillian made me feel very welcome and was most accommodating. The neighborhood is excellent with easy access to a bus that goes downtown and restaurants just steps away. There's a reading light and a fan in the room, and the bed is very comfortable. There's a closet for hanging clothes.
62909	1039766	8.0	10.0	37179353	"Lily was a great host who makes you feel like home from the first minute of your arrival. 

The listing is as described, room is basic and location could not be any better. The room gets some street noise and with the lack of an AC, it may get a bit uncomfortable if it is too hot out there. Fortunately that does not really happen that often in Seattle. "
62910	1039766	8.0	10.0	38132250	Lily welcomed me on a day of arrival and gave a tour of the house. She is attentive and helpful host. Room was exactly as described in listing, the location is great - close to park, restaurants and PRONTO station (bike-share). 
62911	1039766	8.0	10.0	39634377	The host was very nice and helpful who provided all the details about the house and neighbourhoods before you arrived. Cosy room and everything was exactly described in listing. It is definitely the place you wanna choose for your short vacation.
62912	1039766	8.0	10.0	40037519	Lillian was very nice and welcoming. She let me know quickly the details about the house and tips about getting around the neighborhood. Everything was accurate to the description in the listing. She was very accommodating and let me do my own thing. This is a nice, clean private room in a very good location in Seattle's capitol hill neighborhood.
62913	1039766	8.0	10.0	40239461	Great location and Lillian is friendly and helpful!
62914	1039766	8.0	10.0	40656209	"I felt very welcome upon arriving to Lillian's place. I usually woke up and turned in pretty early due to my work schedule while in the city. She is very helpful in getting you to her place and has loads of suggestions as to where to go. The room was comfortable and the mattress (memory foam!!!) was great to sleep in when paired with the clean sheets and cool Seattle air.

The neighborhood has a feel of a college town with older houses and plenty of bars and things to do everywhere. If you're going to primarily be walking or riding a bike beware of the hills.

Overall a great visit and very courteous and conscientious host. Would recommend for a stay."
62915	1039766	8.0	10.0	41086718	Lillian was very sweet and helpful thanks for letting us stay in your home 
62916	1039766	8.0	10.0	41927957	Lillian was a great host, she communicated with me from the start through the airbnb app and let me know of ways to get around the city. she greeted me and showed me around the house her home is a quaint little place. The room was great and very comfy. some street noise during the night but earplugs were provided so it wasn't an issue. the surrounding neighborhoods are lively with plenty of great places to eat at and shops around the area. She has a cat and with me having allergies it wasn't a problem at all. She made my first visit to Seattle wonderfull and go off without a hitch. Would recommend her and her home  to anyone thinking of taking a trip to Seattle. must try Americana brunch spot great breakfast meals.
62917	1039766	8.0	10.0	42252953	Lily was awesome! She was communicative, and really made the point to introduce herself and make me feel welcome. There is no AC, BUT even in one of the hottest months, I didn't mind it at all (this is also coming from a spoiled California boy). She really made the point to be super accommodating about my cat allergy, checking in and making sure I was comfortable. I also spilt a protein shake all over my pants, and she was very nice to allow me to use her washer and dryer. I would recommend this place to someone else, because it is in a convenience location, and Lily was great! Thank you!
62918	1039766	8.0	10.0	42528133	"Lillian was a wonderful host and her apartment is located just a 15-ish minute walk (downhill) to the city center; it is also located a block away from a few bus routes that will do the same. Just in case you want to take the bus, Lillian has a rotating transit card that can be reloaded.

The room looks just as it does in the pictures; quaint with a closet, phone charger, and fan - which was very appreciated in the summer! "
62919	1039766	8.0	10.0	42999713	Clean, quiet space for city adventuring. Adorable cat. Bed is slightly creaky with two people on it and so would recommend that sensitive sleeping couples (we're earplugs + face-mask people) be aware. Otherwise, super wonderful. 
62920	1039766	8.0	10.0	43300551	Lily was super friendly, and the room was very tidy. Excellent neighborhood too!
62921	1039766	8.0	10.0	43718391	The spot was clean and quiet and the cat was pretty cool. I didn't spend a lot of time at the apartment since I was wandering around Seattle most of time, which was very easy given the apartment's great location.
62922	1039766	8.0	10.0	44051794	Welcoming and friendly. Experienced host with all consideration taken care of
62923	1039766	8.0	10.0	44870935	comfy bed right in the heart of town. everything was great.
62924	1039766	8.0	10.0	45206131	Lillian was AWESOME, she's super down to Earth. Showed me where everything was, got me settled in and was an amazing host. Muushi was the best and sweetest cat too. I would definitely stay here again.  
62925	1039766	8.0	10.0	45644059	Great location and Lillian was very helpful!  Place is more rustic and in an older part of neighborhood. Good location to shops and bars. 
62926	1039766	8.0	10.0	46204244	Lilian is amazing. She made sure she disclosed everything about the house and the area. The house is pretty much centrally located so everything is either a walk or a bus ride away, which I loved. I wasn't home a lot since I was out exploring, but you definitely get what you pay for. Small quaint room, the bed was a bit squeaky, but other than that I loved it.
62927	1039766	8.0	10.0	46812906	Lily was a great host.  She was well organized and we communicated well many times before I arrived.  She welcomed me at the door and showed me around her place.  Smooth check in and check out.  She was very warm and friendly.  She was able to answer all my questions about the local area and guide me appropriately.  Her listing is as stated, a nice room in her home.  Her place was clean and tidy.  The Capitol Hill neighbourhood is a great central place to stay.  It was only a 15 minute walk to downtown, and a very nice one at that.  It was very safe walking around at any time of the day or night.  She lives right near a great grocery store.  It certainly was great value for the cost, as the local hotels start at $300 per night!  It was a great experience (my first one with airbnb) to have stayed in Lily's home - including using her kitchen for making breakfast.  Thank you for helping me learn about Uber and sharing your coupon with me Lily!!
62928	1039766	8.0	10.0	48519055	This was a prefect location --two blocks from a close friend's apartment-- and Lillian provided everything I needed. We didn't see much of each other, since I spent the time with my friend, but I loved her friendly cat!
62929	1039766	8.0	10.0	49076708	Lily is extremely kind and welcoming. The room is as advertised. Would recommend to anyone. 
62930	1039766	8.0	10.0	49738570	Lillian was great and Capitol Hill is a really cool area.
62931	1039766	8.0	10.0	50115457	Lillian is a polite, gracious host and her location is perfect! I loved walking the neighborhood and into downtown. It is walkable to a great Thai restaurant, smoothie shop, thrift stores and acupuncture clinic, as well as to Volunteer Park & the Asian Art Museum. A large grocery store and used bookstore is also nearby. I was very pleased and satisfied with my stay at Lillian's.
62932	1039766	8.0	10.0	50599347	Lillian is a very nice girl,she always check me if I need help. Good location also. She has a cat. But if you mind the smell of the cat, you'd better think again before booking.
62933	1039766	8.0	10.0	51103000	Was great. She was super helpful 
62934	1039766	8.0	10.0	52451759	I had a great time staying in Seattle with Lillian. This location in Capitol Hill is super convenient to both UW main campus/ UW Medical Center, Harborview medical Center, and the Seattle Downtown area. It was perfect for me since I had to be in multiple locations for an interview and also wanted to visit Downtown/pike place market and whatnot while I was there. The room was as described with a comfortable bed and fast reliable internet. As an added bonus, Lillian has an Orca card available for guests to use, as well as a clothing steamer! I also appreciated that the house has good water pressure. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a convenient location while in Seattle. 
62935	1039766	8.0	10.0	52949665	Lillian was quite accommodating, bed was comfortable and everything was clean. Great location!
62936	1039766	8.0	10.0	53411566	Great location! Easy to access Capitol Hill and the rest of Seattle from Lillian's place. Lillian was very easy to communicate with and was there for check-in right when she said she would be.
62937	1039766	8.0	10.0	53582549	Lillian was very welcoming and accommodating. I was able to check in early and park my car just in time for my dance competition that morning. Comfy bed. I'm so grateful that she had a washer and dryer available! I am not the best packer and didn't pack enough clothes for the weekend so yay for laundry! Full kitchen and yummy French press coffee. Thank you for a great stay!
62938	1039766	8.0	10.0	54343383	Lillian was a very gracious and accommodating host and her cat Mooshi was very sweet! 
62939	1039766	8.0	10.0	54560823	Great place to stay if you want to explore the city!
62940	1039766	8.0	10.0	55052852	Sweet host, great neighborhood. If you're looking for simple accommodations and a comfortable room in a great area, this is a great pick.
62941	1039766	8.0	10.0	55492911	The stay at Lillians place was nice and the location is very convenient, pretty close to downtown and a minute from a bus stop away. Lillian was also very helpful with answering questions about things to do in the city.
62942	1039766	8.0	10.0	56935428	Lilly was great to stay with! Her place was super convenient to everything and she went out of her way to help me out! It made my move to Seattle so much better! Highly recommend.
64527	9411935	8.0	9.0	54418964	Staying at Sebastian's was great.  The place was nice and clean and the location was excellent.  I would recommend to anyone, especially if you like night life and proximity to downtown.
64528	9411935	8.0	9.0	56699332	I was very comfortable with memory foam (perhaps?) Mattress. Sebastion was helpful, even with my luggage. The environment is clean. It is a very small studio. 
64807	6278216	8.0	9.0	32290719	"There was almost nothing positive about our experience with Isaiah and his rental. I rented this place for one night for my brother and his family who came down from Vancouver BC - communication was a difficult task in itself, It was hard to get a clear check-in time - not to mention when I called, I felt like I was it was an inconvenience. I found out that  Isaiah does not manage the place, but his neighbor Henry does and also seemed put out by the responsibilities included. For the rate that is being asked, my expectations would be a lot higher - my brothers family was not able to stay in the home as it was too filthy. The bed was not made, only sheets & blankets provided, the trash had not been removed, dust covered all surfaces in the apartment, mold in the shower, pictures did not represent the actual space and the last straw was having to pick out the pillow that was the least stained. My advice? Hire a maid! Nobody should be spending $100 / night to sleep in such conditions. I was extremely disappointed and upset my brother had to scramble to load up his family and kids late at night and take them to a hotel nearby. 

Spend your money elsewhere, there are plenty of other hosts who want to give you the experience you deserve and hold up to the Airbnb reputation.

"
64808	6278216	8.0	9.0	32605565	Great place right in the middle of the action in Capitol Hill. Isaiah was very helpful and responsive during the whole process. Nice, safe area with plenty of options for food and nightlife around. Would stay again.
64809	6278216	8.0	9.0	32777470	Amazing apartment for the price. Has everything you will need for a trip to Seattle! I would recommend especially if you are using public transportation - our car window did get smashed in at the closest lot, but that is to somewhat to be expected, especially in Capitol Hill - there has been a lot of this lately, so I'm told! Anyways, apartment is nice, clean & spacious. Construction begins around 8am right outside the window so if you are late risers this may be an issue, though it didn't bother us & host does provide earplugs (we didn't need them). 
64810	6278216	8.0	9.0	33175117	The location was great. It's in a very lively neighborhood and all of Isaiah's food recommendations were yummy. The apartment is a spacey studio, clean and basic. The apartment does not have a tv, but my group did not stay in the apt much since the neighborhood was so fun, and extremely gay friendly. An uber to the light rail was only $5, and $8 to century link. You can also walk from the light rail if your luggage is not too heavy. 
64811	6278216	8.0	9.0	38649779	"I had a great time in Isaiah's apartment in Seattle, between Pine and Pike in Capitol City (10-15 minutes from downtown walking downhill but there's a bus stop less than 200 yards away). With lots of bars in the vicinity (a campus is nearby) it actually reminded me of my college years - which is a good thing! :-).
Three specific notes: if you are a cleaning freak this may not be the place for you; the mattress is extremely firm - something I personally appreciate but which might not suit everybody; and yes, there is construction work starting early in the morning very close by (but clean earplugs are provided).
All in all a great place to stay for a solo traveler like myself!"
64812	6278216	8.0	9.0	46088129	We had a great stay at Isaiah's Apt. Capital Hill is probably the best area to stay in Seattle with downtown in walking distance and some great food/nightlife around the corner. Isaiah always responded very quickly and had some great food recommondations. He couldn't be there when we arrived, which was our fault because we were later than expected, it was easy to get access to his apt. There was a very cheap carpark two blocks away if needed. Would stay there again.
64813	6278216	8.0	9.0	46846062	"I contacted Isaiah the morning before we needed to stay in his apartment. He responded promptly within the hour (even during regular weekday work hours) which was great because we were running out of time to book a place!

Checking-in was seamless. There is even a parking garage less than a block away (Seattle Central College) for $5.00 a day.

The location was perfect for our needs. We were within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Downtown, the Space Needle, and SLU.

The apartment complex is quite old, but his studio was very clean and simple. We needed two beds, so Isaiah offered a regular queen bed & frame in the main bedroom as well as a full size mattress that was placed on the floor in the living room. The pull-out doors worked nicely to close off the main bedroom from the rest of the studio. The sheets were freshly washed, so no concern over cleanliness, but were well-used and could stand to be replaced.

As Isaiah warned, there is still a good bit of construction in progress right next to the complex, so beware of the noise factor. They get started early in the morning...even on weekends. If you plan on being out and about early each day as we were, it shouldn't be a big issue.

Overall it was a great location and great value! Would recommend!
"
64814	6278216	8.0	9.0	49751453	Great apartment in an awesome location.....easy to get around.
64815	6278216	8.0	9.0	51419854	Great location and it was really easy to get ahold of isaiah. He gave us lots of food recommendations which was very helpful

67121	1190571	8.0	9.0	16178434	Awesome host! He gave us some great tips on where to get some food on Sunday morning! Which was fantastic! Easy going, courteous, and offered us everything we needed! Thanks Andy! Hopefully we'll see you again soon! 
67122	1190571	8.0	9.0	17251274	"The listing was accurately described. Andy was a very good host, who not only made sure that everything was available, but also was able to make suggestions about the area which was useful since I was new.

The location of this place is nice (easy to walk down to Matthew Beach) with convenient and quick bus to UW area."
67123	1190571	8.0	9.0	35981917	Andy is a wonderful host.He was always available to answer any of my questions and made my stay enjoyable.
67124	1190571	8.0	9.0	36635029	Andy was very welcoming and the room matches the ad.
67125	1190571	8.0	9.0	41009782	Andy was very welcoming and really laid back. The listing was exactly what I expected. One thing that I really appreciated was that although the listing didn't include AC and I happened to come on a fairly hot weekend, Andy made the effort to provide me a good fan. The neighborhood was quiet, serene. I'd stay here again.
67126	1190571	8.0	9.0	41703300	Andy made everything easy, including being flexible on the check-in time.  The room was quiet and clean, as advertised. I took the bus lines to downtown - they run fairly often during the day. With more time I would have explored the area around the lake. I enjoyed my short visit. Thanks, Andy!
67127	1190571	8.0	9.0	42494093	Andy was a good host. The house had everything I needed - it was basic, in a great location, and clean. 
67128	1190571	8.0	9.0	46685011	Andy is a cool guy, very hospitable. Room was quiet and cozy, as advertised. 
70866	3562617	8.0	9.0	19147896	Jennifer was a warm and welcoming host. The room was very convenient to where I was going in Seattle. The room faces the street, but I had no difficulties with noise disturbing my sleep. Thank you Jennifer!!!
70867	3562617	8.0	9.0	19835585	Jennifer was very friendly and accommodating.  The room was small with a bed and side tables only, but I had use of a closet area and most of the apartment and kitchen. The lower Queen Anne location right near City Center was key for me.  A great deal for the price. There was traffic noise during the day, earplugs or closing the window worked fine; noise was minimal during sleep hours. I was able to eat most breakfast and lunch there and I'm sure a hotel and most meals out would have been 3 times what I spent. Jennifer and I didn't see each other much once she met me at my check-in.  I found her very communicative and responsive. 
70868	3562617	8.0	9.0	19955486	"Jennifer and I were not actually able to meet during my 2 night stay, but she  had the key hidden outside for me to access on the first night. 

The neighborhood was great walking distance to the Space Needle and the artistic venues in the area. I stayed very little in the apartment other than sleeping. The bathroom and shower were smaller than I expected, but just enough to do what you need. Everything was kept tidy and organized. "
70869	3562617	8.0	9.0	20351084	"Jen was a great host.  We did not see her much, but there was great communication before and during our stay.
The apartment was cosy, and what an awesome location.  We walked all over the City.  Parking was also excellent; we found a place within a block on two days. 
The view is great too. "
70870	3562617	8.0	9.0	20868522	It was our first visit in Seattle. Jennifer was an amazing host. She's very accommodating and was in constant communication with us since our application was approved by her. Her place is cozy with a great view of the Space Needle. I sat in the living room and stared at that awesome structure every night we were there. The bedroom is just the right size for two people. It's close to Kerry Park and very accessible by bus. Jennifer was easy to talk to and really spent time talking to us about the city and her personal experience living in lovely (email hidden)xt time my girlfriend and I are in town, we surely will stay at Ms. Jennifer Moore's place. :)
70871	3562617	8.0	9.0	21450112	Jennifer was great, and her apartment was in a great location. But if you don't like the smell of incense it may be too much for you and parking can be somewhat difficult for it is all parallel parking. We had to park blocks away due to the immense amount of cars. Be sure to read the signs about where you can can't park or else you'll be towed. She provided us with tea and even a little tolietrity basket in case we forgot something. We didn't see her the two days we stayed because we out and about enjoying and exploring Seattle but I'm sure she's a lovely person. Would def reccomend her and staying with her. 
70872	3562617	8.0	9.0	21542471	Jennifer was great. The house was as expected, it's an apartment with two rooms. There is a breathtaking view of the city and the Puget Sound from her dining room table. The neighborhood is great, the apartment is up from an area with shops, restaurants, the Key Arena, and walking distance to the Space Needle. Jennifer was easy to get in touch with, and when my boyfriend left his tablet at her house, she sent it the next day through FedEx to us. 
70873	3562617	8.0	9.0	21733960	Easy going host, simple accommodation, comfy bed and generous common area. It was like staying at a friend's place. 
70874	3562617	8.0	9.0	22035058	The place looks just like the pictures! Yes, the view is that amazing. Such a great location. Easy to walk or bus anywhere. Jennifer was great and made us feel right at home. 
70875	3562617	8.0	9.0	22538652	This place is very close to space needle. About 15-20 minutes walking to Seattle Center. Commute is a bit inconvenient as monorail is a bit far. Taking bus is a better choice. Apt condition is ok. But with the price under $100, what can you ask for?
70876	3562617	8.0	9.0	23075405	"Jennifer has a very warm and welcoming home environment! All of her instruments inspired me to start playing something! 

It's very close to the space needle. And has a cozy space heater for a cold rainy day. "
70877	3562617	8.0	9.0	23450085	Very convenient location for anyone who wants to explore Space Needle or Chihuly museum. Very friendly host.
70878	3562617	8.0	9.0	23604702	"We were in town for a wedding, and we were lucky enough to find Jennifer's listing only 2 blocks away from the event, which was perfect.   Jennifer was very polite and the apartment very tidy (we were in and out for the wedding, so we didn't get a chance to talk much).  However, the apartment smelled very, very heavily of musky incense...so if that bothers you I would find a different spot.  Finding parking can be an adventure, but that's Seattle overall.  Would recommend with some cautions for the guests (see below).

Pros:
- Polite host
- Jennifer provided toiletries in case you were out/forgot something
- Clean and tidy apartment
- Great view/location
- Lots of instruments! I wished I had enough time to jam a bit with the host.

Cons:
- There were two pillows on the bed, but one was some sort of odd meditation pillow with a hole in it...so only one pillow for two guests?
- The incense smell.  There was no way to purify the air in our room, and it was so strong it gave one of us a headache. There is nothing in the listing that mentions this, so be wary.
- Sheets wouldn't stay on the bed (even after we got up and remade the whole thing twice)...but the bed itself was pretty comfy."
70879	3562617	8.0	9.0	25406439	I stayed at Jennifer's place for almost two weeks. She was very welcoming and the location couldn't be better (as well as the view of the Space Needle and the Puget Sound). There is a bus stop literally right outside of the apartment, and several other ones that take you all over the city not too far away. All in all, a great experience!
70880	3562617	8.0	9.0	26766629	Bed and room was clean and placed away past common area, so it was really quiet. I mostly didn't see the host because of the very early hours I kept due to work. This was no problem because communication with Jennifer via text was easy and what I needed was placed out for me ahead of time. When I did see the host I got some really nice tea! Neighborhood was a 6 minute walk, downhill, to Seattle Center. I recommend the listing, it was everything I wanted.
70881	3562617	8.0	9.0	27478913	Very friendly, home comfortable, tidy, clean etc.
70882	3562617	8.0	9.0	28286507	"This was my first Airbnb experience, and Jennifer made me feel more than welcome. I was visiting Seattle on a whirlwind two day trip to watch my team play in the NCAA tournament being held at Key Arena. Jennifer's apartment is extremely close to Seattle Center, with the Space Needle, EMP Museum and Union Lake all easily within walking distance.

Jennifer was very flexible with my late evening arrival from the airport, and other than the initial meeting, our schedules didn't cross for the rest of my visit.

The room itself is on the smaller side, but comfortable. The views of the Space Needle and Puget Sound are just as the photographs show. The bed I believe was a double, so while I fit comfortably, putting a second adult in might be a little tight.

Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely stay again if I find the excuse to visit Seattle again."
70883	3562617	8.0	9.0	28781197	Jennifer was a good host - she is very kind, checked in with us frequently, and responded quickly to messages. We didn't cross paths much but when we did she was very calm and friendly. The apartment is really lovely and we had everything we needed. Thanks for letting us stay!
70884	3562617	8.0	9.0	29141242	"The flat is really nice and charming and the location in Queen Anne is lovely, full of nice bars and restaurants. Plus it's just a few blocks away from downtown.

Jennifer was a great host, helped me to find her place, went for a drink with me and always checked if everything was OK. She kept saying ""spread out"", so I would feel comfortable using the whole flat. Best Airbnb Experience so far. Will definitely contact her again when I come back to Seattle.

Thank you Jennifer for the great experience! 
"
70885	3562617	8.0	9.0	29819821	Jennifer was very kind and welcoming and made sure I had what I needed. She even made me tea when I arrived! Her place is in a great location, close to the Seattle Center and right across the street from a bus stop. I like this neighborhood because it has great eating and grocery options, and is quiet and relaxing. Oh, and the view of both the Space Needle and Puget Sound from the room is fantastic!
70886	3562617	8.0	9.0	30251706	"Jennifer was a great host, she made me feel very welcome in her spacious and central Seattle apartment with gorgeous views of the water. Her listing was spot on and the neighborhood was within walking distance from the EMP museum, where I was headed for a conference, as well as bunches of restaurants, bars and a grocery store, if you’d rather grab food in less expensive way.

If you’re in Seattle and need a place to stay, Jennifer’s place is a perfect option. Also, if you’re a bit of a hippie, she’s got all the accouterment for that lifestyle as well so I felt right at home next to the Jimi Hendrix poster and her carton of stevia. =) "
70887	3562617	8.0	9.0	32897852	I never actually met Jennifer, but her communication and availability by phone was excellent. The apartment was basic, and airy with lots of windows. The location of the airy apartment was great for visiting the Seattle Center where I was headed. Buses were very convenient from downtown, dropping me off in front of the apartment. 
70888	3562617	8.0	9.0	34123205	I had a lovely time at Jennifer's place in Queen Anne.  It was not high-end (and I did not care for that), but it was comfortable and clean. Jennifer was a relaxed and warm host to me throughout my stay and was easy to reach via phone. I had my own room with a towel, shampoo & conditioner and the kitchen had pots and pans out for me to use. My favorite part about this space is its convenient location. During my stay, I did not have to travel far (never more than half an hour walking and much less driving or by bus; the number 13 bus stop is right in front of the apartment) to go to the Queen Anne Farmers Market on Thursdays, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and pathways along the water that led to Sculpture Park and downtown Seattle. If you do not like walking up or down steep hills, this may not be the place for you. The apartment is located on the hill. However, I found the walk enjoyable and it was always a good pre-workout to the Seattle Gym (a ten-minute walk uphill before the Trader Joes) where I received a free week-long membership as part of the gym's deal to new customers. So, if you are only staying a week, you can go to the gym or attend scheduled workouts (spinning, Zumba, core work, etc) for free! In all, I highly recommend Jennifer's apartment to other people interested in staying in the Queen Anne area.
70889	3562617	8.0	9.0	34463591	Host was very amiable and greeted us right at the bus stop in front of her place. The bedroom window had the view of the space needle just like she mentioned but the floors in the bedroom were kind of dusty. My only suggestion would be to leave a broom so the guest can sweep inside of their bedroom. This would also save you time by not having to clean as much. Thanks overall for the stay! It was exactly how you described it!
70890	3562617	8.0	9.0	34780812	Jennifer was very friendly and accommodating. The neighborhood was very close to a main bus station and not far from the downtown area. the apartment has a nice view of the space needle. She gave accurate instructions for how to find and get into the apartment.
70891	3562617	8.0	9.0	37611568	Very laid back apartment, full use of kitchen. Full size bed. Shared bathroom but didn't feel full, includes towels. Jennifer is accommodating to your needs. Great location near supermarket, public transport, and restaurants. Also close to bike share station and shoreline which made it easy to get downtown.  Not fancy but very comfortable. 
71816	8147215	8.0	10.0	50048442	Jaimee provided excellent service, the house is nestled on a quiet street with great beach access. We really enjoyed the stay, it's like a hidden pacific northwest gem. 
71817	8147215	8.0	10.0	51166070	"Our stay at Jaimee's beautiful home was great. This property is perfectly situated in the beautiful North Beach area just North of Seattle. The home decor and layout are great and allow you to feel right at home. The backyard of the property is beautiful and provided for some of our fondest memories of our trip to Seattle. During our stay Jaimee was not available but we were assisted by the ""Pillow"" management staff and they were very helpful and communicative during our stay. We ran into a small maintenance issue which was resolved within hours of us bringing it to their attention. I highly recommend this property and will definitely look to book it during our next trip to Seattle. "
71818	8147215	8.0	10.0	53557966	Jaimee's place was great – super comfortable and great vibes. The house had everything we needed and close enough to all necessary things. The price was right for the location – meaning it's a decent walk to the grocery, so you may need a car. And there is a 3rd Party service called Pillow that manages the listing – they're responsive/attentive if you have issues or questions (though it feels a little less personal than most Airbnb's, it works!)
71819	8147215	8.0	10.0	54324186	We loved the beautiful cozy home with great art on the walls.  It was the perfect size for four persons.  The home is in an lovely quiet neighborhood with a short walk to the waterfront.  The front and back yards are private and (website hidden) on the gourmet stove was a treat.   We travel often to Seattle to visit our granddaughter and daughter, so we appreciated finding this little gem.  We definitely will check for availability at this adorable place next time we are in town.
71911	7219541	8.0	8.0	42778299	We had a nice stay at Mie's house.  The room was clean, quiet, and was in a good neighborhood.  We would stay there again.
72066	4681885	8.0	9.0	29153241	Kirsten is very friendly, helpful, and fast to reply. The room and our bathroom were clean and neat. The house is also in a great location, and it was easy for us to get from her house to downtown. Overall it was a good experience and a great place to stay for our weekend trip to Seattle.
72067	4681885	8.0	9.0	31400570	"Perfect accommodations and Kirsten was a perfect host - flexible, friendly, and funny.  And, her dog is loads of fun and friendly, too.
Great location with easy accessibility to a variety restaurants, fast food, malls, etc, all in a peaceful neighborhood."
72068	4681885	8.0	9.0	32042183	Had a really good experience. We found Kirsten's place last minute as we needed a place to stay before our flight. She was super quick to respond and very helpful. Her house is big and the room was comfortable. Had clean towels for us and let us use her kitchen. Overall, it was just what we needed. She was great. 
72069	4681885	8.0	9.0	32596283	Kirsten was super chill and welcoming. The house is a big, friendly space and Kirsten just lets you get on with things. The area is calm and a short drive to some interesting spots in Greenwood. A very easy experience. 
72070	4681885	8.0	9.0	33276612	Kirsten's home is lovely. We had access to a nice bathroom and her kitchen is well stocked with everything needed to make a home cooked meal while away from home. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. I enjoyed beating my boyfriend on her pool table (3 times lol) so it goes to say that I LOVE her pool table. :-)
72071	4681885	8.0	9.0	33636561	Kristens house was perfect, plenty of privacy in a nice quiet neighbourhood and close to buses to downtown. Kristen responded really quickly which was great because I found her place really last minute. I would definitely stay with Kristen again. 
72072	4681885	8.0	9.0	33715795	Kirsten has a very nice home in a quiet neighborhood. Communication was great and the stay was pleasant. Kirsten wasn't home but she made sure everything was arranged for my stay.
72073	4681885	8.0	9.0	34099418	Kirsten was a great host! Her home was very nice and she was very welcoming. The house is in a great location and conveniently right next to the bus stop.
72074	4681885	8.0	9.0	34728910	It's a awesome place to stay !! Kirsten is so cool!and the dog Callie is sooooo cute!!!!!
72075	4681885	8.0	9.0	34927161	We arrived late in the evening and were greeted at the door. Kirsten showed us our room, which was clean and a good size. She also provided towels and gave us a key so that we could go in and out of the house as we pleased. Kirsten is nice and has the friendliest dog. We did our laundry and in the morning had time to go on a run before leaving. Would definitely recommend.  
72076	4681885	8.0	9.0	35211123	Kirsten was a very friendly host. We had our own key and access to our own bathroom which was nice. The house was in a residential area which was nice to get away from downtown. 
72077	4681885	8.0	9.0	35361062	Kirsten was a great host and made the check-in and check-out process as easy as could be!  
72078	4681885	8.0	9.0	35666324	It was a good value and the location provided easy and cheap access to the downtown and public market area.
72079	4681885	8.0	9.0	35979772	Nice modern house. Clean Room. Kitchen use was helpful. Friendly dog...wants to play catch. 
72080	4681885	8.0	9.0	36479585	Kirsten's place was in a great location, just a few blocks from the beach and great restaurants, bars, groceries, etc.  The neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe.  I had access to her kitchen and was able to make some great breakfasts.  Kirsten was not around much but was very friendly and positive during our interaction.  
72081	4681885	8.0	9.0	37027357	Kirsten's house was spacious and I loved the patio. It was clean and simple, which suits my taste, and I enjoyed my time there. Thank you Kirsten!
72082	4681885	8.0	9.0	37234695	Very courteous.
72083	4681885	8.0	9.0	37370420	Kirsten was very nice and hospitable. Her dog was also very sweet and well  behaved. A good stay overall. 
72084	4681885	8.0	9.0	37647009	"Staying at Kirsten's house was great. 
It was well located and we didn't have any problem. She was a good host. 

Rester chez Kirsten était simple. Elle a été une bonne hôte et nous n'avons rencontré aucun problème. "
72085	4681885	8.0	9.0	37982137	Kirsten was a gracious host.  The home was clean and inviting, everything went well.
72086	4681885	8.0	9.0	38431273	"My boyfriend and I stayed with Kirsten for 3 nights. It was our first time using airbnb and she have us a great introduction to the community. She was very flexible/accommodating. We were able to check in early on the day of our arrival which was extremely helpful. We dropped off our things and went right back out to explore the area.

The neighborhood was really nice and felt very safe. It is very convenient to downtown Seattle. 

Though we didn't really get to hang out with Kirsten much, she was always very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. 

Thanks Kirsten!"
72087	4681885	8.0	9.0	40448777	Kirsten is a wonderful host. The house and the room were great aswell.
72088	4681885	8.0	9.0	41557052	Great experience! It was exactly what we expected. Clean room and house. Comfy bed. Awesome dog! 
72089	4681885	8.0	9.0	41804583	Host was awesome.  Everything was clean and ready to go.  She made me feel very welcomed and comfortable in her house.  Callie was probably the most gracious of the bunch, friendliest contact you could ask for.  Host really just opens her house to you, I would stay here again 100%.
72090	4681885	8.0	9.0	42343218	This is a great house with a large patio and the world's friendliest dog! She'll play fetch with you until your arm falls off. The patio is great and the trees surrounding it make for a very nice setting. It was a problem-free stay with a very friendly host!
72091	4681885	8.0	9.0	42502138	Kirsten was very welcoming and is a great communicator.  The house is in a nice, fairly quiet neighborhood with plenty of parking (which is nice :)  The room was small but functional.  If you are looking for a reasonably priced room in a good location, this is a good choice.
72092	4681885	8.0	9.0	43714076	The neighborhood was perfect! Great restaurants nearby and very close to Carkeek Park for sunset watching. The house was great overall and quite spacious, and the room was very private and just across from the bathroom. Her dog is also so adorable and extremely well behaved! My only concerns are that if you're wanting to enjoy the patio furniture- ask her about where the cushions are beforehand, because we didn't cross paths much and the chairs had no cushions and weren't practical to spend time on (which I was stoked for). I also had problems connecting to the internet and there was no shampoo/conditioner provided, but if you ask her about these things asap I'm sure she'll take care of them.
72093	4681885	8.0	9.0	44469393	Kirsten is a great host.  I truly felt like I was at home away from home.  The listing is just as advertised - great balance between location, comfort, and price.  I would stay here again if given the opportunity.  
72094	4681885	8.0	9.0	44873365	Kirsten's place was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for a short trip to Seattle.  The buses into town were frequent and easy to navigate 
72095	4681885	8.0	9.0	45647120	We booked Kirsten's place super last minute, and she was extremely accommodating! Her house is in a safe neighborhood and is easy to get to from downtown Seattle. The bedroom is rather bare bones, but we were still comfortable. The bathroom is shared, and while not immaculate, was perfectly fine, especially given our short notice. We didn't meet Kirsten, but she is a great communicator and made sure we had everything we needed. Recommend!
72096	4681885	8.0	9.0	45759652	Kirsten was very nice and easy to talk to. Her place was great and exactly how it looked in the pictures. Communication was fast and easy and I would definitely stay with her again!
72097	4681885	8.0	9.0	46044836	Good location, on major bus route to downtown and comfortable room. The bathroom & shower were not the cleanest, but otherwise our stay was great and we enjoyed Seattle!
72098	4681885	8.0	9.0	47254317	"Kirsten's nice and chill. Her black lab is sweet and playful. Her neighbor Stel is nice too.
I enjoyed my stay there. Was out till late most nights and got in without a problem. No ac, but lucky for me it was cool 50/60's. I needed an extra blanket.
Instructions for towels and bedding are on the back of bedroom door. Read it.
I would take your towel into your bedroom, as the other guest on my last day grabbed the one I was using. Ugh. 

 it was a good deal. I the location. Super convenient off 15 love th and to Otherwise Northgate or into the city. I like the Ballard area too and it's near to that."
72099	4681885	8.0	9.0	47556732	House was large, and had plenty street parking available on a quiet street near major road in a neighborhood with flair. House has nice big backyard big enough for hosting with mature fruit trees. Black Lab is very friendly. Host, Kirsten, is friendly person, and passionate, and smart, and wise. I enjoyed hospitality and resting in the room that I booked. Kirsten is hard working person. I had short stay over before leaving early to an early morning group bicycle ride from Magnuson Park to Seward Park and looping back to Magnuson Park -- 25 miles. I didn't have chance to utilize the coffee or chance to buy grocery from nearby QFC. I did have chance to eat at nearby Bick's Broadway Grill restaurant that opens at 5pm and really had a nice meal and had a hot shower that let me fall asleep. There is a nice easy to follow instruction behind the door. 
72100	4681885	8.0	9.0	50730084	"We had to get a last minute accomodation and had some troubles with the booking system, but Kirsten was very helpful and finally we solved the issue. 
Kirstens accomodation was easy to reach by public bus #5. We had an own room and were also allowed to use the kitchen which we appreciated. Maybe it could have been a little bit cleaner but the rest was okay.
Thanks again Kirsten for hosting us."
74043	7970663	8.0	10.0	45183715	Jaime's apartment was comfortable, in a lovely neighborhood right by Green Lake and Jaime was very accommodating. 
74044	7970663	8.0	10.0	45911036	Some friends and I were planning to pass through Portland at the same time on different road trips and Jaime's house was a great spot to base ourselves during our stay. Very comfortable, accommodating home where I was able to work from the road and relax after hitting up downtown Portland. Definitely recommend this spot.
74045	7970663	8.0	10.0	47020587	We needed a place to stay in Seattle last minute and found Jaime's listing. We were glad she was able to accommodate us on such short notice. She was very good about communicating how to pick up keys and find the apartment. The place looks just like the photos. Great location across from Greenlake Park. We only stayed one night so didn't have time to explore the area too much.
74046	7970663	8.0	10.0	55305186	"Great location across from green lake, which was really nice to walk around, convenient to have food nearby.

The concerns about noise in the listing are intentionally cautious on the host's part, it really wasn't bad at all.

Bed was a bit soft for my taste, but everything we needed was present (sheets, towels etc).  Good wifi.

Host has an agreement with a nearby(ish) cafe to allow for key pickup if/when she's not around.  She was quick to communicate via email, and accepted and managed our booking on really late notice and over a holiday weekend, which we really appreciated.

"
74047	7970663	8.0	10.0	55333152	Jaime accepted our reservation VERY last minute (thanks Jaime!) and everything was perfect. The house is as advertised, very quiet and in a great neighborhood. 100% recommend.
75906	859467	8.0	10.0	4091020	"The house is a quirky ""very West Seattle"" place. The property is literally on the water. Amazing views from the bed and really the entire property. The pictures are exactly what you get. Mike is a great guy and very accommodating. the price is well worth what you get. I only had ""same day"" to find the place because other plans fell through. Mike was right on it to help out. The property is lived in, so it feels such. It feels like you crashed your friends house and kicked them out for the weekend...food in the fridge, clothes in the closet, etc. The positive part of that is you have all the cookware and dished you need. If you can hang with that, its all good (I can and don't mind) but I also travel allot, and know that feel isn't for everyone...so just an FYI.
All in all the property and experience was awesome. HBO, Showtime, and good Sat TV all provided. NO WIFI or INTERNET...once again...just FYI...some require it, some don't care.
Would I, will I visit again? Hell yeah...loved the place, Mike is awesome...perfect price...Loved my stay."
75907	859467	8.0	10.0	5622646	"The view is absolutely amazing. Michael was great at communicating and letting us know exactly what to expect and what was expected from us. I loved that it was dog friendly. Again the view was AMAZING!
"
75908	859467	8.0	10.0	5721007	This is a wonderful place, right on the water. Literally, the porch and new bedroom sit right on the water, with great views of the sunset and the islands in Puget Sound. We enjoyed our stay immensely.
75909	859467	8.0	10.0	5828306	"When you walk into home and there are a multitude of air fresheners going, it should raise the question, ""what odors are they masking?"" This place was filthy, messy, and no privacy. Who puts a bed in the breakfast nook and calls it a view bedroom.  Very deceptive.  Clothes were in the closet, so no room to hang anything...hair on the soap in the shower...ugh!  I had to wash grease/dust covered glasses to use them. The carpet, furniture was dirty.  Also, there was construction going on right next door beginning at 7 AM!  Not what I call a relaxing vacation.  If you rent from this place, ask more questions and what in land's name does he do with the cleaning deposit?  I'm sure it's not for it's intended purpose, based on the condition of this ""home"".  Yuck......beware! "
75910	859467	8.0	10.0	6490593	"Michael and his girlfriend's home is RIGHT on the water. Best view ever and the wonderful breeze makes the house just wonderful.

We had a few issues while there one of which being a house being constructed next door that we weren't notified of before arriving. The construction disrupted many of my toddler's naps which was unfortunate and made for early awakenings. For a vacation, this was suboptimal. As a previous reviewer commented on, the house is very ""lived-in"" but there was still room for our items and nothing got in the way of our comfort.

Michael was a great host, though, and took care of our problems as soon as he could. If you are looking for a view, this is your place."
75911	859467	8.0	10.0	6699647	This was a fabulous place to stay.  In a quiet neighborhood, right on the water, and an amazing view.  Lots of cozy furniture and a deck over the water.  Very relaxing.  I will be back!
75912	859467	8.0	10.0	6884893	"The Good: Great Property, good location, great food choices nearby, absolutely beautiful views from the deck (right on the water), spacious & quick replies from the host.

The Bad: The home had a very bad smell, and was not very clean.
This left us not wanting to return to our suite during the day to even have a nap. We just sort of avoided being there.

I know its harder to keep a place clean when you are right on the water, but this place just needs a deep cleaning to get it up to standards. 

Please Note though: If the host does a major clean ...it still could still be a good place to stay!"
75913	859467	8.0	10.0	7527242	Hard to describe my stay at Michael's place in Alki Beach....sublime and heavenly don't do it justice!  It's absolutely amazing being so close to the water.  When first sitting up in bed after waking up in the morning and the first thing one sees is the Sound is an incredible way to start the day!  The only problem with the place is that the views are so wonderful that it made me not want to leave the house to explore Seattle!  House is very well equipped and clean and in a lovely location.  West Seattle is a nice alternative to being in the heart of the city....a real beach community feeling, and yet very quickly accessible to downtown.  Overall, a perfect stay.
75914	859467	8.0	10.0	9411314	Overall our stay was perfectly lovely. The view truly is incredible and we even spotted some seals from the living room! I do agree with some of the comments regarding cleanliness, even as someone who is quiet accustomed to the beach lifestyle, however this did not negatively impact our experience. I think the host provided exceptional value that resulted in a wonderful stay. He even provided a small Christmas tree for us to decorate, which was a really nice touch. I felt at home to celebrate the holiday in a very special setting!
75915	859467	8.0	10.0	9607464	We really loved this place sooo much. It is right on the water, so we were constantly hearing the waves as well as the ships fog horns in the distance. We had a fire every night. It was difficult to leave to go and explore Seattle. But when we did explore, we always loved returning to our little Beach House. The only thing I would say was a bit disappointing was the construction going on next door. They would start at 7:30 am and would wake us up. And for me, when I am on vacation, I like sleeping late. But other than that, I would go back in a heartbeat.
75916	859467	8.0	10.0	11244860	We had a pretty good time in this clean and cozy beach house. There are two bedrooms and one bathroom. Perfect for 3 people. Michael just prepared everything you might need during your stay, like dozens of towels, toilet paper, shampoo, and everything you need for cooking.This place is just much better than  any hotel rooms!!
75917	859467	8.0	10.0	11697752	The beach house was beautiful. The views were breath-taking, and we even used the fireplace one night! Michael Joseph was a kind and responsive host. My wife and I had a wonderful time.
75918	859467	8.0	10.0	11857322	The location is unbeatable.  Waking up to the view of the Sound will stick with  you for a long time. The host  was very accommodating and responsive.

75920	859467	8.0	10.0	13976700	"We rented the ""Beach House"" as we were moving out of Seattle and it was a great way to end our stay here. The house is located in a great area and the views can't be beat. Close to downtown and the sights but far enough away you feel like you are away from it all. We walked the dogs every evening on the water front and the sunsets were amazing. There were small things as there are with all vacation rental that could be improved but overall we would highly recommend this property. The only concern which is not the owners issue is if you have small children it may not be the most ""baby proof"" house but we managed. Michael was more than accommodating and helpful. We had a wonderful experience and if we ever get back to Seattle this will be the first place we look to rent. "
75921	859467	8.0	10.0	14449022	"We had a fantastic time! What a beautiful place this is. It takes about 15-20 minutes to get to the sightseeing areas of downtown, but while you're there it is like your own private island, with the gentle waves lapping at the foot of your bed.

"
75922	859467	8.0	10.0	15623288	Michael Joseph supplied an experience as shown in the photos.  My family had a fantastic time at his home. The view and lapping sounds of the water are priceless.  It was really fun just walking the street admiring the architecture of this dynamic community.  The bottom line on this property is the spectacular view which can be admired from nearly every point in the home.  It was really hard to leave the porch and explore the rest of Alki.  
75923	859467	8.0	10.0	17044435	We really enjoyed our stay. It was a challenge leaving the deck (morning and evening). We especially enjoyed the otter neighbor stopping by to say hi. The location was great.

75926	859467	8.0	10.0	20696603	Michael's place wasn't available for the 3 days that I needed it so I had to rent another place for the first night. When I got to Michael's place I just couldn't believe what a difference it was from the first place where I stayed!  The first place was so cold and sterile......whereas Michael's place is warm and homey.    You feel like you're staying in a friend's home.  I've told Michael that his home is probably the place where I feel at my happiest and most at peace.  The views, the serenity, the light.......all sublime and heavenly.  It's an absolutely amazing place!
75927	859467	8.0	10.0	21409685	Yes, it's true. You can hear the water lapping you to sleep, watch the ferries,  and relax at Michael's Alki Beach home. Comfy bed with great pillows, an easy 20 minutes to downtown, with Alki beach village about five minutes away. All for the price of a lower-priced downtown hotel. Great for two people  or two plus a child. Privacy could be an issue for two couples, as the main sleeping area is open to the kitchen and separated only by a privacy screen, but it was perfect for my wife and I. You will need a car, although there is a bus stop across the street. Road noise not an issue. Recommended.  
75928	859467	8.0	10.0	21922205	"Michael Joseph was very accommodating. The beach house was clean and the view was amazing. There was a tray with a couple of chocolates on the bed, which I thought was cute. However, I never really could get the heat to work and was cold the whole time. But the TV worked great and the bed was comfortable. 

Unfortunately,  there was a bad storm that night so we lost power for a little while and never got to see the beach.  You definitely need to take a taxi or have a car because it is not close to where the water taxi drops you off.  We ended up getting soaked along with all our luggage walking from the water taxi drop off to a restaurant to call a taxi. This would have been a great place to stay had we had more time and a rental car."
75929	859467	8.0	10.0	22174650	Couldn't ask for a better view. Michael was extremely accommodating and a great host. Wonderful experience!
75930	859467	8.0	10.0	22281646	"The Alki Beach home is in an absolutely beautiful location, right over the water. It was easy to find and the neighborhood is great - everyone we passed on the sidewalk was really friendly. It was amazing to fall asleep to the sound of the water and the moonlight shining in. 

Michael Joseph was very kind, responsive, and accommodating through the booking process. His instructions were easy to follow and he even left us some beers in the fridge.

After reading reviews of people taking long walks on the beach, we were surprised to find that when we tried to go down to the beach, someone in the basement of the house came out and rather rudely told us we weren't allowed down there. We weren't even aware that people were staying down below as the booking is listed as entire home/apt.

Overall, the location is really incredible and a nice getaway, but it just would have been really nice to get to go down to the beach."

We didn't plan it to be a work/free weekend. Clearly, that  is what happens when we are surrounded by formidable ocean views,  constant wave sounds, cute curious birds, wind & rain.  It was perfect.  MJ's  Place is spacious & bright, it has lots of comfy seating space, a good kitchen and a perfect little patio where we enjoyed a few cold ones.  We loved it, thank you MJ for sharing it with us! :) 
75937	859467	8.0	10.0	30233192	This place was great for a little family getaway. It was easy to coordinate with Michael Joseph; he was quick about responding and checking in throughout the process. The place is in a great location. Easy access to all things great in West Seattle. Will definitely plan on returning!
75938	859467	8.0	10.0	31142956	The place was really nice. It was right on the side of the beach so the view was beautiful. The neighborhood is really clean and quiet. The location is pretty great too, around 10 minutes drive to the shops at alki beach.
75939	859467	8.0	10.0	31407659	"We had a wonderful stay at Michael's Alki Beach House!  It was just perfect and met all of our needs.  The views as shown in the pictures are stunning!  Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very friendly sea-lion who swam right up to the shore below the outside porch.  We were very fortunate to be there during a full moon and got to experience a ""moonset"" of right out the bedroom window over Puget Sound -  it was breathtaking.  We had perfect weather and could see the snow capped mountains across the Sound every day. We absolutely loved it there and will stay again next time we're in town.  The beach house itself was very comfortable, cozy, and lived-in (in a good way).  If was very personal and not sterile, and was stocked with more than adequate supplies -- plenty of dishes, cooking pots and pans, glasses, etc.  We would have liked to have stayed longer!  Thank you Michael for a great place to relax for a few days!"
75940	859467	8.0	10.0	31990248	This charming little house was just what I was looking for.  The location was perfect and the view could not be any better.  Everything was in working order and the host was very accommodating.  It is an old house with lots of character and therefore might not be suitable for anyone looking for a new and pristine place to stay.  My wife and I enjoyed it and would stay here again.  The Sunset was amazing!

75944	859467	8.0	10.0	37307194	We enjoyed being right on the water. We saw 2 sea/river otters one night swimming right near the shore! Lots of boats to look at and beautiful sunsets! We were there over July 4th weekend and you could see fireworks from the distance, and one of the neighbors had their own fireworks over the water. The place is only a few minutes from the main beach and close to grocery stores. 
75945	859467	8.0	10.0	37946187	We loved this place so much. What a great location and value in Seattle. It's about a 20 minute drive to downtown but the view alone is work it. We were also able to walk to a nearby park and saw two bald eagles on our first day. The owner was visiting downstairs and was very nice and personable, letting us check out a bit late so I could shower after a half marathon. The one drawback was communication since the property manager has been ill. But everything worked out well in the end.
75946	859467	8.0	10.0	40734211	The place was exactly as pictured, described, and was an enchanting place! The views made the trip to Seattle!  The 3 of us were very comfortable, and our son joined us for the last night- all of us loved it! Thanks, Michael!  5 of 5 stars! Larry

76865	7940358	8.0	10.0	46227104	We had a wonderful time in Mark's house. It has all you need. We loved the design, the neighborhood and our time in Seattle. Very accessible to downtown, we walked it. The neighborhood is really nice as well. Mark is welcoming, really friendly and responded very quickly to all our requests. Pictures are really accurate. We definitely recommend Mark's house! Great host!
76866	4632923	8.0	9.0	24779338	Lovely, eclectic spot! Perfect for walking around and exploring the Capitol Hill area.  
76867	4632923	8.0	9.0	28347892	"We really enjoyed our stay in Capital Hill. The apartment was comfortable, and Margot made us feel very welcome. My wife and I like to be pedestrians as much as possible, so the location of this apartment is perfect. There are tons of bars and restaurants all within walking distance. We spent a lot of time out on the balcony, and the view is great. 

There was no TV, so that is something to be aware of. We don't really watch TV all that much, but if it is part of your routine, make sure to bring a laptop or ipad.

We would definitely stay here again.  "
76868	4632923	8.0	9.0	33034421	Margot's apartment was amazing. It had lots of amenities. Towels/linens, full kitchen, and super comfy beds! Great location :)
76869	4632923	8.0	9.0	47110603	The apartment was clean, conveniently located and had what we needed. Just wish there was a TV ;)
76870	4632923	8.0	9.0	48746545	Great apartment. View was amazing. Awesome location. Host was very quick to respond to any questions we had. 
76871	4632923	8.0	9.0	55296097	"Margot was extremely helpful and very prompt in responding to any questions.  She was a very nice hostess.  We didn't meet her, but she was available for any questions via phone/text.  When we arrived, we were a little confused as to how to get to her apartment., but that's because I did not see her email with the instructions. For me it was a challenge as it does not have an elevator, and the apartment is on the 3rd floor. But, by the second day it was fine and I got better at minimizing the trips by being more organized and not forgetting things in the apartment or the car.

The location is very convenient, and once acclimated I was very comfortable in the neighborhood. Quite a few interesting sites within walking distance - Bruce Lee's gravesite is about 6 blocks away and it's in a beautiful park that includes a museum, lake & just a very peaceful and calming environment.  Bakery Nouveau is a 7 minute walk (5 for most people), and is to die for.  Many restaurant to choose from.  We had a car and it seemed like everyplace was only a 5-20 minute drive.  I found it to be very convenient.

We had 6 for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a bit of challenge in terms of pots and pans, but we made do and we had a wonderful meal.  There should be plenty of space for 4 people for a short stay. Bed's were comfortable and the whole home was warm & cozy. The furnishing was quaint, so if you're expecting a 5 star hotel,  this is not the place. 

I would choose this place anyday over a cramped hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend this place if your looking to visit Seattle."
79035	3811872	8.0	9.0	18350269	I had a wonderful experience at this very unique house.  Lots of guests allowed me to meet new people everyday from all over the world.  And yet, the house was so big I would only see 1 or 2 travelers a day, giving me the feeling I had the whole house to myself.  Everyone was very kind and sharing, and the neighborhood was so beautiful to walk through.  I would come back in a heartbeat!
79036	3811872	8.0	9.0	18689152	Beatiful views, huge house and friendly people in it :) the right place to stay at the right price!
79037	3811872	8.0	9.0	19256087	My stay at the house was very welcoming. It's a busy house (but still kept perfectly clean) with plenty of other interesting guests, so the place has a nice social vibe.

79039	3811872	8.0	9.0	20175899	Gorgeous views, nice kitchen, really cool people.  Neighborhood is very residential, but bus/bikeable to what I needed.  Leah was super helpful.
79040	3811872	8.0	9.0	20403078	"The neighborhood is lovely and peaceful with winding roads and trees. Parking in the driveway was available, and public transportation was also convenient.  The house, dubbed the ""crayola house' is an unusual color-coded place with hardwood floors, many rooms and  shared spaces. It's no-frills and a fixer-upper, but welcoming with everything that the minimalist traveler needs. The kitchen was excellent,  the Wi-Fi was really fast, and the top bunk I slept on was really comfy. There's plenty of space for folks to spread out since it seems that many guests stay in this hostel-bungalow at any given time, and hand-written signs provide instructions and useful ""house rules."" The other guests were really nice and friendly, and I am thankful to Leah and Eric for accepting a last-minute reservation and answering my questions! "
79041	3811872	8.0	9.0	21361522	"Great place to stay! Leah and Eric were very welcoming and generous!
Leah would bake delicious food and make it available to the guests.
The house is great, the neighborhood is very quiet and lovely!"
79042	3811872	8.0	9.0	22772095	Helpful hosts, convient option. Other customers staying in the place were great.
79043	3811872	8.0	9.0	26342991	Can't say enough about the Crayola house. Felt like a roomy myself. Clear guidelines. .. close proximity to down town seattle.  ($8-$11 uber).  Bunks were comfy. ... friendly people.   Plan on this being my home every time I come to Seattle!   You will love the view from the kitchen on a clear day!
79044	3811872	8.0	9.0	28911296	Great experience in a unique setting.... My first time... Highly recommend! 
79045	3811872	8.0	9.0	33337367	I found this experience to be good. The house was quiet and kept clean and everyone I encountered was friendly.
79046	3811872	8.0	9.0	35857688	Excellent experience!!! It's a big house with a beautiful view!!! The neighborhood is quite and peaceful!!! All the house is clean and good environment!!! 
79047	3811872	8.0	9.0	37101378	"A strange but generally positive experience. This large old home – clean but worn – functions as a hostel in an older residential part of Seattle. The house was often very silent throughout whether it be day or night. Several long-term guests seemed to spend significant amounts of time in their own bunks while others were scattered through the common spaces talking quietly or working on their devices solo. I often felt like I was in an offbeat monastery. 

There are many rules and guidelines, which were clearly communicated (as well as important with so many people sharing a common space), but I never felt fully comfortable during my short stay. Perhaps I didn't spend enough time there to fully understand the vibe of the house. It was a quiet space in which to sleep however. 

I never met the hosts, but they were always in communication to make sure everything was fine. "
79048	3811872	8.0	9.0	37412457	The neighbourhood was nice with great areas for running close by, however, grocery shopping, UW and Seattle city center is quite far away.
79049	3811872	8.0	9.0	40963383	I had a wonderful experience at the Crayola House. Everyone was so kind and welcoming, and there were always new people around to meet. Even though there were several people in the same room, I felt like I had plenty of privacy and could fall asleep easily. The location was extremely safe and convenient, with multiple bus stops, parks, and grocery stores within walking distance.
79050	3811872	8.0	9.0	42144987	CrayolaHome is a warm and welcoming listing, which allows you to see a side of Seattle probably not seen by those staying downtown. Fresh linens, towels and blankets were provided and the people you'll meet will no doubt be the highlight. Recommended for those that want to see some of the northern parks of Seattle with the option of still heating into downtown.
79051	3811872	8.0	9.0	42752730	An interesting stay for a nontraditional traveler.
79052	3811872	8.0	9.0	48827919	Easy stay. They were very thorough with instructions and there are signs to explain everything, everywhere. I liked the vibe of the house, met a couple other guest but none of the residents or Leah but had a great experience. 
79053	3811872	8.0	9.0	56344689	My experience was overall good. Beautiful neighborhood. Confortable house. But wifi did not work and some rather unfriendly guests. Still a nice experience and a good value. 
80335	9511777	8.0	10.0	55290690	Excellent location - walking distance to tons of restaurants, shops, and close to freeway to get elsewhere in town. Nice place -- modern/new construction. Greg was easy to contact and communicate with -- even when he was on a plane! Read the fine print, especially about parking (look up online parking rules & find a place on the side of the street where they don't require a parking permit). Also, as Greg notes in the description, there are cameras watching you -- you gotta figure out if that'll work for you or not.
82119	637710	8.0	10.0	3349943	"We rented Farhad's house for a one night trip to Seattle, and had a complete blast!  The house was amazing, complete art district charm right in the middle of great restaurants/bars/music/nightlife.  We came up from Portlanf for the night for my boyfriend's birthday, I set up the rental, and the group was SO excited once we got inside!  It was a big lovely house, one block from the canal, with three bedrooms, two with two beds.  Farhad himself was SO geat to deal with.  He let us bring our dog, and even recommended some great restaurants, one where we could bring the dog IN to eat with us!  It was one block away and completely delicious:)

We had so much fun and would rent this place again in a heartbeat.  It was both myself, and Farhad's first AirBNB experience and from my side I have to say it was completely great!  If we head up to Seattle again you can bet we will be staying here again!"
82120	637710	8.0	10.0	3978775	Farhad was a wonderful Airbnb host. The house was exactly what I needed for the night, he was punctual with communication, and left very clear and reasonable house rules for us to follow.  I would be happy to be hosted be him again.  Thanks so much Farhad.
82121	637710	8.0	10.0	5074384	Farhad was an amazing host to my friends and I. He gave us some fresh baked bread to eat and had lots of great suggestions for places to eat and visit.

82122	637710	8.0	10.0	5169435	"We enjoyed our stay at Farhad's house.  When we arrived, we were a little surprised at the fact that the stairs are as steep as they are and there are no banisters.  The fact we have small children, this was a worry.

  The house was comfortable and clean.  Not the easiest location to find as it is in a business neighborhood."
82123	637710	8.0	10.0	5755453	Chill housing in walking distance of cute coffee shops and bars. Great option if you're young and on a budget. Farhad was super nice!
82124	637710	8.0	10.0	5835658	Farhad's house is in a perfect location. It's walking distance to lots of restaurants, shipping and a grocery store. His house was very cozy and perfect for a group traveling through. Thank you for the tasty bread and the great hospitality. Pet friendly is a plus too!
82125	637710	8.0	10.0	5968577	"Roots@ the Center of the Universe was completely perfect for us. We were a party of 8, mainly family, staying briefly in Seattle on business. We arrived to live music (Farhad checked beforehand whether we would be OK for his weekly band rehearsal to go ahead in the basement), and  the warmest of welcomes. It was a lovely surprise to have the run of the whole house, which is perfectly located to explore Fremont, and an exceptionally generous host. The house is old but the beds clean and comfortable, the shower piping hot, and the neighbourhood quiet. It was our first time to use Air BnB, but I would guess Farhad has set the bar high for future hosts.
"
82126	637710	8.0	10.0	6002324	"The level of hospitality shown to my group and I on our recent trip to Seattle was nothing short of spectacular.  From the moment we stepped foot into the door we knew we had made the right choice to stay there and that feeling was affirmed time and again throughout our trip.  I fell in love with the Fremont neighborhood while we were there and honestly feel like I made a lifelong friend in Farhad.  He knows he better call me if he ever visits North Carolina.

Anyway, about the place.  This is not the main downtown drag of Seattle.  So if you want to go stay under the Space Needle this is not the place for you.  But if you want to get a taste of what real Seattle is and how real people from Seattle live, then just stop reading now and book this place immediately.  That is what we wanted, and did we ever get it.  World-class food, beer, and coffee shops all within walking distance and reasonably priced.  Awesome art everywhere and record shops that blow the ones I have at home away.  A sweet park across the street with a jogging path that went down by the water.  I mean what else could you want?

This place is not a 4-Star hotel.  If you think you're getting that for this price then you may be delusional.  But it is 100% honestly represented in all of the pictures and descriptions.  The beds are clean and warm.  There are also 6 of them, which was big for us because we had 6 people.  There is a cool little outdoor area that is very private.  An additional bathroom/shower would have been ideal (there is only 1), but we made it work without too much difficulty.  Farhad will probably leave you some kind of fresh-baked good or fresh fruit, and it will be amazing."
82127	637710	8.0	10.0	6028639	I stayed here for an evening with six friends while traveling through Seattle. Farhad was a great host. He recommended many local spots to check out and even brought us fresh bread and other treats from the farmers market. The house was clean and spacious. We would definitely stay here again.
82128	637710	8.0	10.0	6103528	"We stayed 2 nights in the secluded house in Fremont. Far had was an excellent host dropping by to offer suggestions and fresh baked goods/fruit. 

The place is a best fit for the 20-30 something crowd though it would certainly work for others. 

Noise is never an issue as it is the only true residence on the block. The rest of street is filled businesses with normal 9-5 work hours. 

Highly recommend. 
"
82129	637710	8.0	10.0	6340391	Roots is an outstanding bargain in a great neighborhood.  It’s an eclectic house with 5 single beds, one full bed and a queen futon, so there is lots of room.  The area is great fun every night of the week, so make sure you stick around and enjoy the neighborhood (especially on the weekends because you won’t find a parking place ‘till after 11 if you give yours up).    For a family of 5, there was plenty of space and even Parcheesi, fresh bread and fruit, fully stocked kitchen, friendly host and washer/dryer.  The only words of caution are it’s not for small kids (not safety proofed) and not for fastidious folks (bring your own sheets and wash clothes if you are used to the Ritz).

Tip: call your order in) to vintage shops to the THEO CHOCOLATE FACTORY, I loved our stay at Roots! My friends and I referred to the trip as ""glamping in the city"" because the house had that rustic cabin feel. 

However, in terms of transportation, I didn't feel it was that close to things (but perhaps that's because Seattle is so huge!). Luckily, we rented a car and had no problem but I can see that being an issue for others. "
82131	637710	8.0	10.0	8058139	We had a great stay.  Farhad left some fruit, bread and wine for us which was a really nice touch.  The place was spacious, clean and in a really fun area of Seattle.
82132	637710	8.0	10.0	9239131	"Farhad's house in Fremont was the perfect place to house my friends for a surprise birthday party for my partner! It's in a super cool area, tucked away between industrial buildings. If this house had a persona in high school, it would be the party guy. I would recommend this place for large groups and people who just want to hang out and party in a neat neighborhood. Not so much for couples or those with kids. 
I'm told the beds were very comfortable, and on Sunday morning we walked over to Theo chocolate and then to the Fremont Market. Totally walkable, totally fun. Thanks Farhad!"
82133	637710	8.0	10.0	9730189	I couldn't ask for a better host and a better pale to stay!!
82134	637710	8.0	10.0	10276197	This is a great, albeit rustic, spot in one of the coolest neighborhoods in town.  The owner is easy to work with and an all around good guy.  This spot is a great choice for bands or any other large group that requires multiple beds and space to hang out.  
82135	637710	8.0	10.0	11804111	"Farhad’s Roots at the Centre of the (Seattle) Universe was perfect for our 6-person group. He was flexible and responded quickly to any of our pre-arrival questions, and once there he gave us the hot tips for the surrounding restaurants, markets and bars.

The house itself had everything we needed — great kitchen, towels, Parcheesi, washing machine, good beds — and a  great sound system. It’s a warm and comfortable space to hang out in with easy access to downtown, and the University area via public transport. 

A nice stroll down the nearby canal leads to the Sunday morning markets, packed full of good Seattle produce and trinkets. Thanks Farhad, there’s a piece of Seattle in all of us."
82136	637710	8.0	10.0	13259105	Farhad was a great and generous host. I highly recommend his place. The location is also excellent.
82137	637710	8.0	10.0	13571386	Farhad was a great host.  He even let us check in early!  The neighborhood is excellent for going out and walking places.  
82138	637710	8.0	10.0	15638671	This house was great! Farhad always got back to me quickly and even left nice fruits and local breads for us when we arrived. The location of this house cannot be beat: walking distance to all sorts of cafes and bars and a nice river walk. Really awesome place to stay if you are in Seattle! 
82139	637710	8.0	10.0	15675474	"Six of us stayed at Farhad's this weekend for a bachelorette and there are definitely pro's and con's. 

The house is exactly as pictured. It's not a fancy hotel, so don't expect that, but it's big, comfy, and in the best location. Tons of bars/restaurants in walking distance, and the casual atmosphere was great for a party. 

While Farhad was easy to communicate with, he definitely seemed a little disorganized and I had to remind him multiple times of our check-in date. Even after establishing 1pm as the check-in time, a few weeks later he didn't remember and wanted to move it to 1:30. Not a huge deal, but when I arrived the woman cleaning the home was still there and didn't leave until about 3:30. Not a huge deal because she was very friendly, but it definitely cut into a few hours of our stay which wasn't ideal. 

We were also supposed to have until 4pm to check out, but on the day of our reservation Farhad emailed me to say he forgot there was another group arriving that night and would need more time to be able to clean before they arrived, and wanted to know if we could leave early. Not being able to have the house on time and then being asked to leave early was not a great combo for making a positive experience. 

The only issue with the house was ants... in the morning we woke up to find ants all over the kitchen and bathroom. It's an easily fixed problem though so hopefully that's taken care of for the next guests. "
82140	637710	8.0	10.0	15971649	Farhad was an excellent host. And his place was absolutely perfect! A group of six of us had to be in Seattle for a work trip and his place was incredibly comfortable. A couple people mentioned that they usually have trouble falling asleep in new situations, but that was not the case during this trip. Farhad was also instantly available when we accidentally locked ourselves out one night. We had a great time staying in Seattle (particularly in Fremont) and this place definitely helped with that.
82141	637710	8.0	10.0	16075898	The hosts was responsive and quick to answer all of our questions. He made an extra effort at a quick turnaround so that we could get into the house a bit early. The house was exactly as described and in a terrific walkable part of Seattle. Funky and fun. The house is in a very quiet spot directly across from a park and bicycle trail. There is a bike rental shop one block to the east. Overall, we were satisfied--and especially pleased that the host provided a means to recycle and compost. 
82142	637710	8.0	10.0	16631334	"Farhad was a thoughtful and accommodating host. The place itself had a comfy vibe, but for the money I expected something nicer. Although clean, this felt like a party house where I lived in college. We also met with an unfortunate experience our first morning: during the night, a mini mountain of ants had deposited their eggs on a bookshelf in the room where our baby slept.  It was fascinating and disgusting. Farhad immediately offered to get an exterminator, but I didn't want to expose the baby to poisons.  Not ideal. (Though after cleaning them up, the ants didn't come back en masse). 

We still enjoyed our stay. And the location was perfect--we loved being right across from the canal.

I think there are nicer places on AirBnB for less money. We waited a little too long to book anything. In a pinch, we'd probably stay there again."
82143	637710	8.0	10.0	16778782	good location, perfect place for the weekend that was planned.
82144	637710	8.0	10.0	17123011	"Clean only by the standards of a party or frat house. Kitchen filthy. Sugar ants everywhere - kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms. This apparently is an ongoing problem. We were advised to keep all food in fridge or plastic bags. We felt it necessary to wash everything in the kitchen before using it.

Small, low power microwave. Tea kettle and French press, but no coffee maker. Although described as a ""fully equipped"" kitchen, few pots and pans, and most of those in really bad shape (heavy burned on crust in one pan, for example).

No air conditioning + no screens on windows = mosquitoes. Not enough fans for each bedroom.

Exposed wiring and fire hazards. Wires taped together with electrical tape. Hard to find light switches. Fan missing grille, so blades exposed. Holes in walls, rotten / broken woodwork, bathtub disintegrating.

Street parking very difficult during business hours. Didn't tell us about parking issues until the day before we arrived. Some of us had to pay to park.

Only house on block, in between tall concrete walls in industrial neighborhood. 

Two wash cloths for four people to share. No kitchen linens. When we asked for wash cloths and kitchen linens, got brief answers on text messages that basically said 'sorry"" and use paper towels. But then the next day, he dropped off washcloths and linens and mentioned ""I just got back in town."" Why didn't he just tell us he was out of town and would bring something the next day? We went out and bought some.

Asked us to check out early - apparently based on other reviews, that's a pattern. Asked if it would be okay for his band to practice in the basement, but when we requested quiet, he replied no problem.

Odd seating in living room (one full size futon, one easy chair, two office chairs, a padded bench). Not enough chairs in kitchen. Odd assortment of chairs, one very rickety. Downstairs bedroom has one standard twin bed and another that is very high--would need a small stepstool to get into it. One upstairs bedroom has two twins. The other has a full bed with a nice mattress and a twin bed. 

This is clearly a ""party house."" Overall, this place would be best for a group of friends not planning on doing much cooking and not concerned with cleanliness. Definitely not suitable for children. Stairs have no railing, floors filthy, lots of evidence of marijuana (yes, we know it's legal in Washington, but some families might prefer not to be confronted with it in every room).

On the plus side, it was right on the Burke-Gilman Trail and just a couple of blocks from the heart of Fremont. Host dropped by some organic strawberries and plums, Cheerios, and blackberry honey the second day. We were happy to have recycling and composting available."
82145	637710	8.0	10.0	17243206	House worked just as planned. Needed a spot for extra friends to stay at during my wedding. Great location and plenty of space. 
82146	637710	8.0	10.0	17347400	"Farhad was very accommodating, allowing my group to check in several hours early.  We ended up hanging out a bit while his band played on our second night at the house.  All the guys were very friendly and welcoming and a great time was had by all.

The house was very clean and comfortable.  Wi-Fi was easy to connect to and we had no complaints about the entire experience.  Would absolutely book a reservation with Farhad again."
82147	637710	8.0	10.0	18129220	This place is fantastic--although it is a bus ride from downtown, it has everything you need nearby. I traveled to Farhad's place with my parents, and we really enjoyed the spacious place and the zen garden, as my father named it. Fremont is a really cool area and we did not see that many tourists. All in all, it is a great place for groups of various sizes.
82148	637710	8.0	10.0	18470442	Our stay at Roots was perfect. The place / location / everything was great. We didn't get to meet Farhad but we did meet his lovely girlfriend Emily who was very sweet & welcoming. She gave us some really nice bread and the fridge had drinks for us all. We would not hesitate to stay there again next time we are in Seattle.
82149	637710	8.0	10.0	19127505	Great place to stay in, perfect location. Belgian restaurant down the street was delicious, we had a lot of fun at the arcade nearby as well. Accommodations were comfortable, it was nice to have a back yard to hang out at. Stayed there with a group of guys and the location was great for turning up the stereo a bit without bothering any neighbors.
82150	637710	8.0	10.0	19841164	I rented Roots for 2 weeks and it has been amazing. There were many attraction nearby and transportation is very easy to access. Farhad has been really kind and always text ahead of time before he drops by to pick some of his band stuff. One of my favorite things is his backyard, where it's really chill and comfortable. 
82151	637710	8.0	10.0	19998622	This house was the PERFECT location for the Fremont Oktoberfest. Unfortunately, that was the only perfect thing about it. This was more like a party house than anything and definitely NOT family friendly. My son (who is 24) loved it but the rest of us were not so pleased. Farhad was gracious and checked on me several times. I appreciated that very much. I would not stay there again, but I would recommend this place for anyone going to the Oktoberfest that does not have small children because of its location.
82152	637710	8.0	10.0	28707460	Farhad was a very welcoming and hospitable host. This place was stocked with some kitchen essentials (good coffee, tea, milk, cereals, a bottle of wine, etc.) and the kitchen was well equipped with pots, pans and dishes. We felt at home at this place and Farhad was great about telling us about the best activities and food in the area. He asked us if his band could practice one night and we had no problem with it, they were really good! We highly recommend staying at this place if you want to be in the center of an awesome neighborhood and don't have unreasonable expectations.
82153	637710	8.0	10.0	31208484	The reservation was canceled 45 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
82154	637710	8.0	10.0	34518773	Awesome house, awesome location, once in a lifetime experience. Farhad made sure we had everything we needed, and everything we wanted was just a block or two away. Highly recommended. 
82155	637710	8.0	10.0	36522736	The house was everything we needed.  We brought a steamer but I saw that there was a brand new iron available to use. We did not cook at all...we went to one of the Thai restaurant recommendations and it was delicious. The house was in the perfect location for the rehearsal dinner at The Red Door and the wedding at the Foundry. Thank you!
82156	637710	8.0	10.0	37076331	Farhad is a very friendly cool cat. I felt at home in his place with my musician son.  The neighborhood has vibrant night life with many places to eat and have fun. Check-in was max easy.
82157	637710	8.0	10.0	37296925	This house is amazing; Farhad is a wonderful, accommodating host! It's everything in the description, and yet so much more! We were celebrating a bachelorette party and everything that we could need or want to do is within a block of the house. There is, indeed, quite a nightlife in the neighborhood, but if you are a musician or a band touring locally, Roots in a dream location! The basement is completely set up to run through your set list, and the backyard is a PNW-lovers ideal chill spot! My friends and I will be returning to Roots as often as we can!
82158	637710	8.0	10.0	38645735	"Host is very nice. The house is very big, convenient to travel not far from the city. Also calm ,clean and ready to use. There are a lot of towels cleaning supplies Pillows are more than enough for seven people. Thanks again for the hospitality provided. I feel like being at home. 
"
82159	637710	8.0	10.0	39905275	Farhad's place was a great place for us to host our out of town guests for our wedding weekend. I found our stay to be exactly what I expected from the pictures and description. We were able to sleep 7 people comfortably. We wish we would have had an extra day to maybe take advantage of that backyard, would have been nice to hang out back there in the shade and relax. But we were so busy we never got the chance.  I saw some reviews where people felt that it was more of a party house than a family vacation home, I'd say that's correct, but in our opinion that isn't a bad thing at all. It's sandwiched between 2 large buildings and therefor there is the opportunity to turn things up a bit, once again, we would have loved to have done that but we were too busy. I'd absolutely love to stay here the next time we have out of town guests because not only is the house fun and accommodating.. It's in Fremont! One of the greatest neighborhoods in Seattle and even if you aren't a fan of Fremont its centrally located and anywhere in the city is a quick bus ride away!
82160	637710	8.0	10.0	41924367	"We rented the place for 1 week with 6 of my friends and what a week it was. The house is really private and you won't be disturbed. If you not quite sure because of the pictures, don't worry about that, the pictures don't do justice to how wonderful this place is. A lot of space, beds are comfy. Easy access to the city by bus. We had to go to the KeyArena each day which is pretty much at the center of the city and it was easy.

Farhad's a nice guy, made us feel right at home. Left us a list of places to go get food, beer, coffee and other stuff. I'd rent the place again without thinking about it. I almost wish I was still there at the moment actually!

Rent the place and spread the world that Farhad's place is the best place to stay in Seattle!"
82161	637710	8.0	10.0	43509439	"Many thanks to stay at the ""Center of the Universe"".
Farad is a very friendly and helpful host.
It was awesome to stay in a House witch is full of history.
One of the greatest neighborhoods in Seattle and even if you aren't a fan of Fremont its centrally located."
82162	637710	8.0	10.0	46153090	nice all around..  House is a def a lil warn in but it's cozy and comfy.
83605	8578490	8.0	10.0	49196681	Great AirBnB. I had an emergency situation and needed somewhere to stay in a hurry. Ryan got back to me immediately and we booked it. He was very accommodating and the apartment was very nice. The view Is amazing!
