The apartment was quite comfortable, it matched the description exactly.  It was maybe a five or ten minute walk down to all the restaurants, bars, and shops in the Queen Anne area.

It made us want to rent an apartment just like it when we move to Seattle!  The location is perfect, the neighborhood peaceful, and everywhere we wanted to go was well within walking distance!"

She's lovely and very easy on the eyes.
Stay with her!"
11688	1090307	10.0	10.0	4398578	"Very pleasant accommodation in a quaint, artistically furnished house - in a picturesque neighborhood.  Lovely, quiet garden surrounds the house.  Walking distance to beautiful Green Lake, small restaurants, coffee shops, public transportation, etc.  
Karen is a lovely hostess and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  A five star experience indeed.  "
11689	1090307	10.0	10.0	4580708	"Karen was such a wonderful host! She was a great communicator prior to my stay, she was very accommodating of my early arrival time and made me feel very comfortable in her home.

The room was extremely cozy and convenient. I particularly enjoyed having a personal bathroom attached to it.

The neighborhood was great, minutes away from great restaurants and the lake.

I can't wait to go back!"
11690	1090307	10.0	10.0	4794338	Karen's home was lovely, and the neighborhood was great for taking walks by the lake.  Karen was a fantastic hostess- always open to give suggestions on area restaurants, and we definitely enjoyed doing crossword puzzles in her coffee shop right down the street.  It was a great experience- Thanks!
11691	1090307	10.0	10.0	4882225	Karen was consistently friendly and avaliable. Unfortunately we were not able to spend much time together (we were racing around trying to see everything in Seattle) but it was something I would have liked to do. Starting our mornings at Karen's coffee shop was very nice, everything was tasty and reasonably priced, not to mention that the bar on the corner had an excellent beer selection.
11692	1090307	10.0	10.0	5114101	"We love Karen's ""homey"" and quaint house.  What a nice place to call ""home base"" while we are in Seattle.  We felt very welcome and comfy. And just down the street his her Café Lulu's where we can enjoy a great cup of coffee and breakfast before we launch into our activities.  We highly recommend Karen's house as a short term rental. "
11693	1090307	10.0	10.0	5227947	"Karen is an excellent hostess.  The room was most inviting especially after a long day - a respite to come ""home"" to.
It is conveniently located to Greenlake.  I walked every day around this 3 mile circumference lake and listened to the birds and saw the blooming trees.  Her little outdoor garden is a lovely place to sit and read.  Karen's coffee shop is right down the road. a short walk and a good place to stop in for a good cup of coffee and some pastries.  Her place is conveniently located close to public transport.  The bed was super comfortable, the pillows perfect, the private bathroom with a tub and shower was especially nice. 
 Karen has some great life experiences and her warm personality makes for some great conversation.  Karen's place will be my favorite home away from home any time I am in Seattle.    "
11694	1090307	10.0	10.0	5331171	"Karen's house was perfect...
So perfect in fact, that my now fiancé used the beautiful (and romantic) patio and garden as the setting for his proposal!  Needless to say Karen's house will always be 5 stars in my book but personal bias aside it was a great place to stay.  Simple, clean and in a great neighborhood.  "
11695	1090307	10.0	10.0	5557758	We just LOVE Karen’s historical and tastefully decorated home and yard!  We had a busy schedule while we were staying there, but wish we could have spent more time relaxing in her peaceful yard and visiting with her in her cozy family room   She is an excellent host; she made us feel comfortable and welcome.  She was very easy to communicate with before and during our visit.  She was also able to accommodate our late night arrival.  Her house is located in a great neighborhood, and super close to Greenlake… we are hoping to have time during our next visit for walks around the beautiful lake!  We also loved starting every day with a short walk down the street to Karen’s coffee shop for breakfast & coffee.  Karen is so hospitable and friendly, and that shines through her coffee shop.  It is definitely a place to meet for the neighborhood locals, and we felt right at home there   We highly recommend staying at Karen’s house, as it is a great home base for experiencing Seattle!  We will try to stay here every time we come up!  
11696	1090307	10.0	10.0	7773481	My recent 3 night stay in Green Lake with Karen was great. the home was lovely, it was an excellent location, and Karen was very helpful in making suggestions when I had questions. I would recommend this destination to anyone. 
11697	1090307	10.0	10.0	7953274	"We were a first for Karen. We live local, but after arriving home from our honeymoon to a flooded apartment, we needed a place to stay.  

Karen was very accommodating and made us feel right at home. Her house was clean and very well decorated. It was perfectly located with everything at walking distance.

We would definitely recommend her house to our friends and family!

Thank you Karen!

She was totally cool with us lounging around the house. She owns a really good coffee shop around the corner that we went to several times. The shop and house are super close to Green Lake, which was perfect!
We highly recommend staying with Karen!"
11699	1090307	10.0	10.0	8187163	"Karen is a wonderful hostess. I have the room so found exactly as they were presented on the Internet. The rooms are very comfortable and stylish. I had great sleep and move about freely. Also, I have received from you some tips of what Seattle offers that. Karen's cozy little cafe around the corner you should visit =)

11700	1090307	10.0	10.0	8431289	Karen was a lovely host. I enjoyed our brief interactions and felt welcomed by her. Her house is beautifully furnished, which made it a pleasure to be in. The bed is comfortable. I was able to make my own breakfast in the well-appointed kitchen. The location is near a bus that goes right into the center of Seattle. I happily recommend staying with her.
11701	1090307	10.0	10.0	8740867	wonderful stay, wonderful place, wonderful host.  
11702	1090307	10.0	10.0	9685057	"Karen, thank you so much!
This was excellent stay. Greenlake location is just perfect - walk to all shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants. Bus every 10 minutes for 20 minute ride to downlown.
If you are coming to Seattle - you must stay here!"
11703	1090307	10.0	10.0	10064773	Karen's house is in an amazing location for morning runs/walks around Green Lake. Her house is beautiful, with a comfortable and private guest bedroom/bathroom. Karen herself is kind and welcoming. She is willing to offer suggestions and help you navigate the city, or to give you space to just relax. Highly recommended!
11704	1090307	10.0	10.0	10663822	I was very comfortable at Karen's and she was a great host. Her house is beautiful, artistic, clean and welcoming. The bedroom is small, but has all you need in it (including a closet) and the bathroom feels spacious. The bed was cozy and the room was quiet. I would stay again and I would highly recommend.
11705	1090307	10.0	10.0	11472074	Karen's place was great for my stay in Seattle. Right next to Greenlake for a run, and within walking distance to a number of restaurants/stores. I easily took the bus to work every day. The bed was comfortable, and even with my busy schedule I was able to hang out with Karen a few times. Recommended.
11706	1090307	10.0	10.0	13102121	"My spouse (64) and I (60) spent three nights in this location. The house is in a quiet, lovely neighborhood near a lake, convenient to everything in Seattle. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom was private, and the kitchen had everything we needed except coffee (it seems that people in Seattle drink coffee in cafes, not at home...). Karen is a sweet person, helpful and not intrusive, and the orange cat next door came in and visited with us, which we found to be an added attraction. All in all, our stay was rather pleasant, and everything inside the house was beautiful and charming. 
I wish I could recommend this location more highly, as it has great potential, but there were problems. 
Only street parking is available, and it was difficult to find a parking spot at times (Karen's description had said ""Street parking is free and never a problem""). There are twelve steps up from the sidewalk to the front door (Karen, in answer to an inquiry, had said “a few steps”). Six of them are of concrete; the rest lead to the porch and are in good condition but somewhat steep. The concrete steps are very steep and uneven, some of them are cracked and in disrepair, and there are no handrails, making it quite difficult to go up and down while carrying luggage. Karen did help us carry our bags – but even if a guest is carrying only a pocketbook, the steps can be scary, especially in a Seattle rain and/or at night, for older or less able guests. 
If the form enabled me to do so, I’d give the place 3.5 stars. 
"
11707	1090307	10.0	10.0	13475192	"Karen was most gracious and we were able to work out details despite the fact that she was going to be absent while we were there.  Karen's is a lovely home with interesting furnishings -- in a terrific location.  The garden was gorgeous and the house was truly charming. 

There was lots of great reading material.  We had no problems parking nearby and each day we were able to alternate reasonable-length visits with an energetic two-year-old with quiet naps back on 65th.  Altogether, quite delightful!!"
11708	1090307	10.0	10.0	13681304	Loved staying with Karen...I'm only sorry I didn't get to spend more time at the house and getting to know Karen. The rooms, the location and Karen's warmth and hospitality make this listing exceptional! And don't miss Karen's cafe, Cafe Lulu, just down the street.
11709	1090307	10.0	10.0	13893299	Karen has a gorgeous home in the wonderful area of Green Lake. She was an excellent host -- greeting me outside even though I did not arrive  until 830 pm.  The room and experience was just what I expected and I recommend staying with Karen.
11710	1090307	10.0	10.0	14027159	"My wife and I have a friend who lives near Greenlake but doesn't have much room for guests.  We stayed two nights at Laurie's BnB and found it to be a great place to stay and would recommend it to others.  Because we had meals with our friend  nearby we didn't avail ourselves of the kitchen.  It was a great location for us and we have recommended that our friend have other ""overflow"" guest stay at Laurie's place.  "
11711	1090307	10.0	10.0	14873762	"My stay at Karen's was great! The room/house was very nice and located in a beautiful spot. Her place is very conveniently located - tons of buses that take you everywhere in Seattle and a bunch of restaurants and cafes. Karen was super nice and extremely helpful during my stay. She offered great advice and tips and was always trying to make me feel welcome in her place. I spent most of my time working so I regret not being able to hang out a bit more with her. If I go back to Seattle I will stay with her again, no question!
"
11712	1090307	10.0	10.0	15270894	We stayed with Karen on our trip to Seattle over the 4th of July week. Karen was a great host and made us feel right at home. She had lots of excellent suggestions for us, and her house could not be in a better location, just blocks from Green Lake, and even closer to nearby restaurants, and the cute little coffee shop she owns. Her house is beautiful and artistically decorated. Our room and attached bathroom were clean and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. Karen was very welcoming and even invited us out with her and her friends to watch fireworks on the 4th. All in all we had a great time. I would definitely recommend her place!
11713	1090307	10.0	10.0	15770786	Just came back from Karen's house in Seattle, and it's everything as advertised: A really great, well appointed home, with a great guest room with an adjoining  private bath, with a really great host.  She knows how to be a great host.  In a few words, Karen is: busy, trustworthy, caring, solid.  If you need to stay in Seattle, this is the place to stay, as its location is absoutely perfect and the neighborhood is very friendly.  I definitely would stay there again if the situation arose.
11714	1090307	10.0	10.0	15887596	Karen was very friendly and welcoming. I loved her place, the bed was comfortable and the location to Greenlake was awesome. She also has a cute coffee shop just up the street which we visited both mornings. :) I would definitely recommend Karen's place for your Seattle visit!
11715	1090307	10.0	10.0	16204290	"Had a great time.  Karen was very accommodating a very
nice neighborhood.  "
11716	1090307	10.0	10.0	16467420	"Our stay here was wonderful! Karen's warmth and hospitality really made us feel welcome. She was so nice, giving us full reign to the kitchen if we needed, suggesting places to eat, etc. Every morning we stopped in to Karen's lovely coffee shop around the corner and it made us feel right at home. Additionally, the house is just a few blocks away from gorgeous Greenlake and is situated in a quiet, lush, laid-back part of the city.

We had a wonderful experience visiting Seattle, and Karen really helped shape our experience!"
11717	1090307	10.0	10.0	16719199	Karen is a wonderful host and has a lovely home, both my girlfriend and I felt very comfortable and right at home.  We were greeted with a lot of warmth and Karen was very flexible to work with our timeline.  Hopefully in a few months this property will be available for another stay!  Thanks for letting us into your home for a few days - it was too short!
11718	1090307	10.0	10.0	16913065	We had a delightful time at Karen's.  Her home is beautiful, comfortable, and well located.  It is within easy walking distance of Green Lake and is located directly on a bus route to downtown.  We loved hanging out at her cafe around the corner for coffee and would highly recommend her home as a convenient and comfortable place to stay in Seattle.
11719	1090307	10.0	10.0	17050918	Despite my stay being very brief and my plans changing, Karen was readily available and easily accommodated me. She has a wonderful place located in a great spot. I would definitely utilize her room again if I needed. 
11720	1090307	10.0	10.0	17245317	Wish we would have had more time to explore the area and enjoy the house(and Karen).  Beautifully restored home with great gardens.  Lovely area with restaurants/shops within easy walking distance.  Greenlake park is beautiful.  We parked our car out front and never moved it in the 4 days we were there.  Buses are plentiful and easy to catch.  We went into downtown each day.  It does take 30 min(sometimes more) but was inexpensive and worth it to avoid the crazy Seattle traffic.  The bus system is very safe and pleasant to ride, even at night.  Plus it was a great way to get to see different areas while riding to downtown.  Karen was very welcoming the few times we saw her, we were busy and she is busy.  The bed was comfy and the bathroom was large and clean so it was perfect for us.  Would definitely stay there again.  
11721	1090307	10.0	10.0	17539358	All great things! Very comfortable bed, great location, lovely house! Would definitely stay with Karen again! 
11722	1090307	10.0	10.0	18149259	"Our stay with Karen was VERY pleasant and we really felt at home. Everything was absolutely the same as it was described on the site: comfortable room with a bathroom, cozy house, great location convenient for buses and shops, places to eat and walk. We didn't drive and at first thought it was a bit far from the downtown, but then realized that it was not: about 25 minutes by bus (there are a couple of routes are almost net to the house and many more from Green Lake area) and 10 minutes by taxi (the trip from Space Needle will cost u only 18$)
Karen is a great host. We didn't see each other a lot during the day as we were trying to spend all the days exploring the city but she was very caring and helpful with everything we needed. I had to mail some packages to my friends and she took her time and efforts to do that for me. Very grateful to her! While staying with Karen we never worried what  we would have for breakfast: always had it at the small cafe she owns (a 3-minute walk from her house) and coffee there is very good.
It was my first experience with Airbnb and I'm really glad that it was very good. Thank you , Karen, and thank you, Airbnb. :)"
11723	1090307	10.0	10.0	18272898	"Lovely host and wonderful home. Quaint, comfortable room and the fabulous claw foot tub was a treat. Karen was attentive and friendly and the home was very welcoming. This neighborhood was a lot of fun to explore. Everything was in walking distance from our room. Pubs, a beautiful walking path around the lake, shopping, bars, restaurants etc. Karen made some great recommendations on places to check out both in the neighborhood and downtown. Our room had great light, stayed cool, and even had maps of the area ready to use. This is a charming home and the owner really takes the time to ensure you have a comfortable visit. We will certainly return. 
"
11724	1090307	10.0	10.0	18577070	I can't imagine a nicer place to hang your hat while in Seattle. This is a truly beautiful, old west coast home and Karen has made it very welcoming for guests. I was in Seattle for a conference, and Karen's home was a wonderful, private retreat at the end of long days of socializing with colleagues. Much better than staying at the conference hotel for an introvert like me. I especially enjoyed the company of Simon, the very friendly orange cat who lives next door. 
11725	1090307	10.0	10.0	18733304	Everything was fantastic and I would love to stay there again!  I have nothing bad to say about Karen's home.  Everything was lovely!!!

The room was as described.  Conviniently located with easy free parking. "
11727	1090307	10.0	10.0	19522851	Lovely location- a couple of blocks from a beautiful lake. Host and room are excellent!
11728	1090307	10.0	10.0	20099121	Karen is awesome! She is super accommodating. I was out and about most of my stay, but Karen made sure I had everything I needed.  The room was very comfortable and suited me just fine. The neighborhood itself is nice and quite, a great place to experience Seattle. Thanks, Karen!
11729	1090307	10.0	10.0	20241677	Karen's place is all about comfort and relaxation. The details (great beading and towels, hot shower and plenty of closet space) of the room and private bath made us feel at home. We'd stay here again for sure. Thanks Karen!
11730	1090307	10.0	10.0	21875684	"We appreciate the hospitality and warm welcome we received from Karen. Every thing was just as it was described in Her listing. She opened her home to us.

Elaine & Jack Horsley "
11731	1090307	10.0	10.0	22241294	This was our first Airbnb experience, and we couldn't be happier.  The room/bathroom are exactly as described in the listing, very cozy with a comfortable bed and linens.  The house has lots of great artwork and is located within easy walking distance of Green Lake and restaurants, or easy freeway access to anywhere else.  The best part, though, was our hostess Karen.  She is very easy to talk to and be around, available without being intrusive.  She was quickly responsive to text requests for directions or recommendations.  We would go back to Seattle again just to stay with her!
11732	1090307	10.0	10.0	23912409	"This is a wonderful location is a small district near Green Lake. The home is a lovely Craftsman-style with a comfortable private room and bath and a shared living room area. The host was clear about instructions and getting in and out of the house is easy w/ her key pad system. A perfect first AirBnB experience! 
"
11733	1090307	10.0	10.0	24654109	Not sure what I can add to all of the positive reviews of Karen's Green Lake home.  I agree with all of the accolades.  It is so pleasant, cozy and charming. I felt right at home.  The bed is super comfortable. The bathroom is private.  The clawfoot tub is a charm and the shower works great. There's am ample closet with lots of drawers and baskets so you can easily keep the room uncluttered. A bonus for me  --  there is a piano and a guitar. You simply can't go wrong here. 
11734	1090307	10.0	10.0	25492691	Karen was friendly and welcoming from the start. Communication was excellent before our trip. After we arrived, she gave us helpful information about the public transportation system, the neighborhood, and the city, including a great tip about the pub down the street (totally didn't expect a pub to have such good food). We were out and about a lot, but the guest room was clean, private, comfortable, and attractive, as was the entire first floor (including the kitchen), which we were welcomed/encouraged to use during our stay. 
11735	1090307	10.0	10.0	26433383	It was a very pleasant first experience with airbnb and closer than any hotel to the work I needed to do in town. Thank you, Karen!
11736	1090307	10.0	10.0	26831555	Karen is soooo nice and helpful that my parents had a wonderful time with her and green lake neighborhood. 
11737	1090307	10.0	10.0	27426088	We very much enjoyed the neighborhood we stayed in.  Very close to many different outlets in the Seattle area with many things to do close by.
11738	1090307	10.0	10.0	27918866	Karen was a wonderful hostess. She made me feel right at home, and offered suggestions to help whenever I asked.  The room was very clean, the house cozy and she welcomed me to use all the downstairs. I would highly recommend her home!  The location is also excellent to enjoy the Green Lake area. Did I mention her wonderful coffee shop around the corner?  
11739	1090307	10.0	10.0	28180808	I had an amazing stay with Karen.  She is so helpful and informed about the area and went above and beyond in providing info to help me get around town.  Her home is lovely and very welcoming...felt like I was visiting an old friend.  Communications and arrival were seamless.  Staying with Karen really made my trip!
11740	1090307	10.0	10.0	28834325	Karen and her partner Mark were wonderful hosts who made sure that staying in Green Lake was a very pleasant experience. The bedroom and the bath are just as described, and Karen is a very friendly and hospitable host. As a guest, I got to share the common areas, as well, and had a generally fantastic time at their place. Also, Green Lake is a nice neighborhood with lots of recreational activities around the lake and good restaurants and bars nearby. I recommend staying here to anyone!
11741	1090307	10.0	10.0	31843470	Fabulous!  our stay at Karen's home was great.  Home was as described; very clean and comfortable.  Two blocks to Greenlake which we walked every day.  It was fun getting to know Karen, she was more than accommodating...offering her entire home too us.  We will be back!!
11742	1090307	10.0	10.0	32355720	Karen is a great hostess.  Her house is very well located, very clean, and very nice.  I highly recommend.
11743	1090307	10.0	10.0	32950245	Karen's hospitality was beyond my expectations. My girlfriend and I vacationed in Seattle and after a last minute decision to stay in the city instead of going on to Portland we were able to book a  couple of nights with Karen in Greenlake. She was there to greet us into her home and was kind enough to make arrangements in the event of us missing each other at check in. Her home was beautiful and very accurately described from her Airbnb listing. Clean, welcoming, cozy and easy to get to. I would definitely recommend anyone staying with her because I would in an instant.
11744	1090307	10.0	10.0	33225321	"Karen is a fabulous and helpful host who made me feel right at home while I was there.  She's friendly and very attentive.  

The room is charming, comfortable, and the private bathroom is ideal for privacy.  The house itself is beautiful, and I very much enjoyed drinking tea in the backyard.  

A short walk to Green Lake, Whole Foods, and several restaurants made the location perfect, without the hustle and noise of downtown.  Getting to and from downtown via public transportation was easy and convenient.  I definitely recommend this listing for anyone visiting Seattle. "
11745	1090307	10.0	10.0	33697091	Great home, great neighborhood - quiet neighborhood, but with solid restaurant choices in walking distance and close to the lake. Eau access from highway.  Easy to park in the neighborhood. Very clean.  Probably my best airbnb experience.
11746	1090307	10.0	10.0	34061619	I think that whoever conceptualized Airbnb had Karen Laurie in mind. She was the perfect host.  There was a welcoming note on the front door and we had already received email instructions on accessing her home.  The room was cozy, clean, and conveniently located off a very comfortable common area. It was as depicted in the description. The ensuite bathroom had an antique claw foot tub.  The neighborhood is comprised of interesting craftsman homes, a lake, and park and restaurants right around the corner from Karen's house. We had a car so didn't use public transit but saw many buses in the area.  A bonus was the coffee shop right down the street from the house, owned and operated by Karen and serving really terrific coffee which is saying something in coffee-mad Seattle.   Karen was wonderful to us, she has a great sense of humor and made us feel totally at home.
11747	1090307	10.0	10.0	34201089	Hostess was gracious and accommodating, nice home and great out door space. Awesome location to the city and parks and freeway.
11748	1090307	10.0	10.0	34949863	Karen was a lovely host.  Her house was perfect, and we felt very comfortable.  Close to Greenlake and the heart of Seattle, it was easy to find everything.....
11749	1090307	10.0	10.0	36004372	My mom and I loved staying at Karen's!  The location can't be beat. Use one of the many bus routes or an easily available Car2go to access other areas of the city, but you are within walking distance of many things to do and see and plenty of places to eat and shop. Green Lake is 2 blocks away for plenty of outdoor fun. If you have your own car it's only 5 minutes to I-5. Karen is a very gracious host and will help you with anything you need. Her home is lovely and comfortable with a gorgeous bathroom, super comfy bed and quiet garden areas to enjoy some solitude. Definitely on my list to rebook next time I'm in town.

Unfortunately Karens and my schedules didn t mesh, so didn t get to meet her but she's very-responsive to emails and welcoming.  Would certainly stay again if need arises and would highly recommend.  Thanks Karen !!
11751	1090307	10.0	10.0	37557956	I had a lengthy stay, some 11 days, at Karen's home near Green Lake and every day seemed to exceed the day before as I got to know Karen and the surroundings. I felt extremely welcomed by Karen into her lovely, clean, comfortable home. The bedroom and bathroom were pleasantly spacious. Karen was a gracious host with helpful ideas and suggestions. It was very enjoyable being in her company. With her tips I was able to make the most of my time experiencing what was a completely new place for me. Everything seemed so easy and convenient with downtown Seattle close by and Green Lake just two blocks away.
11752	1090307	10.0	10.0	38698226	We enjoyed staying with Karen very much.  She is such a wealth of knowledge and helped us plan our sightseeing.  I know we saw more and did more than we would have done on our own.  She and Mark were very welcoming and made us feel comfortable.  The location was great for an early morning walk around the lake.  And having coffee at Lulu's before setting out on our day was a pleasure.  Thanks Karen and Mark.  P.S.  We enjoyed West Seattle on our way to the airport.  Nice suggestion.
11753	1090307	10.0	10.0	39198706	A very nice room, with beautiful attached bathroom.  Location was great, with local amenities very close.  Karen and her husband were delightful hosts, and helpful local knowledge.  We were very happy with our two night stay here - thanks Karen!

11755	1090307	10.0	10.0	39805160	We stayed 2 nights in Karen's room.  Karen was a very welcoming host, and the house and room/bathroom were as described in the listing.  The mattress was great, the shower was hot and had good pressure, the neighborhood was peaceful and quiet, and the house was very clean.   I highly recommend this listing for future visitors to Seattle.
11756	1090307	10.0	10.0	40345772	Well what can I say other than what a great start to an amazing trip! Staying with Karen is like staying with family. The room is perfect and the bathroom is gorgeous so we couldn't ask for better. Karen and Mark are great and we wouldn't consider them anything other than friends now :) so we will most certainly be returning when we can! 
11757	1090307	10.0	10.0	40826416	Karen and Mark were exceptional hosts! This was our first Air B&B experience and we were pleasantly surprised! Their generosity and graciousness made our 4 night stay seem like a few nights at home! The private space and bathroom were clean and welcoming! Additionally, the area is AMAZING- tons of shops, restaurants, and outdoor activities- a diamond in the rough for sure!
11758	1090307	10.0	10.0	41106936	Score!!!! Karen's place was perfect for our Seattle visit. She is literally about a 5 minute walk to green lake park and a few feet away from her adorable coffee shop, a pub, and a delightfully delicious breakfast nook. Her decor was an added plus. Oh and her backyard is like something out of a magazine. We truly lucked out with this reservation. 
11759	1090307	10.0	10.0	42263480	Karen's place was perfect for us! Her house is in an ideal location for visiting Seattle. It is just a quick bus ride into downtown where you can visit all of the major Seattle tourist attractions you would want to see yet is still in a quiet neighborhood where you can go for a wonderful walk around Greenlake and have great coffee (of course at Lulu's!) or dinner out at nearby restaurants.
11760	1090307	10.0	10.0	42830934	If you are searching for a cozy and relaxing place in Seattle this a very good choice. Karen is an extremely friendly person and helpful beyond one would expect. Perfect. Thank you, Karen!!
11761	1090307	10.0	10.0	43434103	Karen has a sweet home and our room with attached bath was comfortable and perfect for what we needed.  Plus she makes great coffee at her local coffee shop.   Playing uke on her front porch with an orange cat and a cuppa joe.  Pretty nice.  
11762	1090307	10.0	10.0	44375096	Karen was perfect! Nice, welcoming and helpful. This was our first Airbnb stay and I was a little unsure about the whole staying in a room in someone's house thing, but it worked out great. We had all the privacy we needed. Plus the house and room are beautiful! 
11763	1090307	10.0	10.0	44684387	Karen was a lovely host and her home (and backyard) was amazing! Clean, cute, charming, comfortable, safe. The neighborhood was incredible. Great coffee shops, pubs and recreational activities within walking distance. Minutes from downtown. Karen was warm, friendly, hospitable, organized and resourceful. This was a great place to stay! I would do it again in a heartbeat if I came back to Seattle! Thanks Karen!
11764	1090307	10.0	10.0	45473678	"Karen & Mark are great hosts. We felt very comfortable in the house. The location is excellent, short to downtown and at best for sports like running around Green Lake. A view coffeebreak-shops in walking distance and always parking lots close to the accommondation. The house is lovely furnished and very clean.
We got so much support from Karen & Mark what makes us the day likeable. If we stay again in Seattle we would'nt hesitate to come back. 

Many thanks for hosting us!"
11765	1090307	10.0	10.0	47206847	Karen and Mark were wonderful hosts!  They have a lovely home 2 blocks from Greenlake and its walking distance to other eateries and the freeway and downtown.  They made us feel very welcomed and interacted with us about their city, food and sights to see.  The room was exactly as pictured and described and I would definitely stay there again.  Thank y'all for a great experience.  
11766	1090307	10.0	10.0	47987709	"Karen and Mark were friendly and flexible hosts, present enough to have a conversation and be helpful, and in their own space enough to allow us to enjoy privacy in ours. 
  
Karen's home is as beautiful and acommodating as it appears, and in a convenient location.  You can take a walk around the neighborhood, or down a few blocks for a longer walk around Greenlake.   PCC (Puget Consumers Coop) is close by, as well as Wholefoods, several restaurants; even the East West Bookstore.

We were pleased to find top notch cookware in the kitchen, and a large gracious dining table with fresh flowers.  The bed is comfortable and cozy with plenty of warm covers, and a private bathroom."

Wir haben unser allabendliches Bier in dem sehr netten Pub um die Ecke und das Frühstück in Karens gemütlichen Café sehr genossen. Busse nach Seattle Downtown sind fussläufig vom Haus erreichbar. Mit dem Bus ist man in circa 30min in Seattle Downtown. Das kompakte Zimmer ist hübsch eingerichtet und verfügt über ein schönes eigenes Bad. Es lagen viele Karten und Informationen über die Stadt bereit. Karen und ihr Freund Mark sind sehr nette und zuvorkommende Gastgeber, die uns herzlich willkommen hiessen. Die Schlüsselübergabe fand persönlich statt und verlief reibungslos. Wir haben uns wohl gefühlt und kommen sehr gerne wieder.

Natalie's place was perfect for this - it was close to our venue & also close to our house.  Natalie was perfectly accommodating & perfectly hospitable.  She made everything so much easier & I never felt like I had to worry or feel the least bit stressed knowing that my family would be well taken care of in Natalie's beautiful home.  
The house is gorgeous & in a wonderful location close to Greenlake.  I highly recommend staying here if you're in Seattle.  Natalie was a dream to work with."

12283	261912	10.0	10.0	1341074	We loved this charming house in a great neighborhood. The master bedroom was very comfortable and quiet with dark curtains, plenty of storage and a comfy bed, and the whole house was clean and modern, including a spotless renovated bathroom. Yet it still had the old touches of a classic, classy house that we love. Parking was not a problem - there was always a spot directly in front of the house. Natalie was communicative and helpful, and put us at ease, even though we had along a toddler. We would definitely stay here again. Handy hint: Zeeks has great pizza and they delivered to us in under 30 minutes, after ordering online.
12284	261912	10.0	10.0	1381805	The place was pleasant and clean.   We enjoyed the neighborhood a lot.

12286	261912	10.0	10.0	1611434	my family and i could not have been happier with our stay at this lovely house at green lake! we were coming off an Alaskan cruise and craving a comfortable space and some home cooked meals. the close proximity to PCC, the natural foods store, was a huge bonus for us! we felt right at home. we enjoyed walks around the lake and cozying up in the couches as well as grilling up some fantastic local meals. it will certainly be the first place we will try for any future trips to Seattle!
12287	261912	10.0	10.0	1663793	We had a great time in the Greenlake area and very much enjoyed the Storybook Tudor house.  Our son and his family were just a few blocks away so we were able to spend most of our time with them.  We went to the Market and had lunch at Lowells, just a 20 minute bus ride away.  We went to the zoo which is not all that far from the house where we stayed.  We especailly enjoyed having the lake so close!  It was a treat to walk early in the morning and just people watch.  We would recommend this house for anyone going to Seattle and wanting to enjoy a bit of the city in a semi-residental area.   
12288	261912	10.0	10.0	1834208	We had a fantastic three weeks staying in this perfectly-located apartment!    It was spotless when we arrived and we had everything we needed to be comfortable.  The proximity to Green Lake, restaurants, grocery stores and  major arterials for getting around Seattle is great!  Natalie and Beau were helpful and immediately responded to any questions we had.  We will definitely stay again if possible and highly recommend this darling apartment to anyone visiting Seattle.  
12289	261912	10.0	10.0	1866689	Great, Super Location! We would like to stay here next time again!
12290	261912	10.0	10.0	1946445	What a great place for a family of five.  We found it clean, spacious, comfortable and convenient.  We loved being so close to Green Lake and took advantage of the prime location every day.  The home had all the amenities you could ask for including appliances, books, washer/dryer and many more.  Natalie and Beau were great hosts who were accessible by phone or email any time we had a question.  We will most definitely return on our next trip to Seattle.  
12291	261912	10.0	10.0	2008458	"We had a lovely time at Natalie's home.  It was close to the walking traili at the lake, close to shops and dining and very convenient to get downtown via the bus, which we did many times.  

The home was very clean and well appointed upon our arrival and Natalie maid the process extremely easy and fluid.  This is a great spot for anyone coming to Seattle that wants a home in a nice neighborhood.  "
12292	261912	10.0	10.0	2037096	"We loved staying at Natalie's place. It was a great location, very close to everything.

Lots of space for us and two kids. 
Thanks Natalie for the great place to stay!

"
12293	261912	10.0	10.0	2154147	"The setting for Storybook Tudor couldn't be better with the house just around the corner from the lake.  During our stay, the weather was perfect and we were able to walk around the lake one day - no problem.
It should be noted that the house is on a busy street (though at night with the bedrooms at the back I hardly noticed) so if someone were sensitive to street traffic they need to be aware of this fact.
The kitchen was fully equipped and we found everything we needed.
We also found a wonderful alternative market just up the street.
The master bed was comfy and the bathroom nicely renovated. 
Check-in was easy and when I had a question late at night, Natalie got back to me right away.  Thanks for hosting us.  
"
12294	261912	10.0	10.0	2443282	"Storybook Tudor was a perfect spot for us.  We had wonderful weather the three weeks we were there.  Loved being able to walk around the lake and watching the activity on the lake.  The house was perfect for the two of us.  Washer and dryer were a great help.  We certainly would consider staying at Natalie and Beau's house on our next visit to Washington to visit our son.  The restaurants, grocery store and coffee shops were within walking distance.  
"
12295	261912	10.0	10.0	3208375	"Natalie's home is the perfect place to fully experience the essence of the best Seattle has to offer with its proximity to Greenlake, coffee shops, restaurants, PCC (Natural food stores), and it is a great walking neighborhood. The house is fully equiped and felt like our Seattle ""home"". I looked at other choices in this Seattle area and nothing beats this location and accommendations!"
12296	261912	10.0	10.0	5577472	This is a wonderful place in a fantastic location just steps from Green Lake. I absolutely loved the location, layout and decoration. For groups of six that need a little privacy it may be a little tight but for families of six with children or two couples with two children it would be absolutely perfect. I did not meet Natalie myself as she was out of the country but all of my interactions with her where very positive, and the check-in and check-out were a breeze. 
12297	261912	10.0	10.0	5860909	"We stayed at the Storybook Tudor for two weeks with our three children.  We absolutely loved the location.  The home feels like it is practically across the street from Green Lake.  We spent many afternoons at the wading pool in the park (really couldn't be closer), and enjoyed the pizza, ice cream, and chocolate shops greatly.

The home itself was charming, clean, and comfortable, and the check-in process was easy.  We had no need to contact Natalie during our stay, as the notes she left answered all our questions.  All in all, this was a great home base for us, and we'd love to come back someday.  It is worth mentioning that it is an older home with an apartment below, so it was important to keep the kids quiet, especially their little feet!  While I would recommend this home to any family, it might be easiest for families with older children.   "

12299	261912	10.0	10.0	18675507	Great location, comfortable house. Air con was a plus on hot days. Backyard seating area while not private was very lovely. May not be as suited for families with small kids, as noise travels between the upstairs and downstairs which is occupied.

I was sad the bunnies weren't there but they must have been on vacation too.

12305	261912	10.0	10.0	42442121	My two adult sons and I found Storybook Tudor to be a lovely vacation home in an ideal location with all the amenities needed. Scenic walking areas and activities are just steps away at Green Lake.  Good restaurants and local organic market also are within a short walk.  We loved the easy access to bus service into downtown Seattle, Freemont and other sights we visited. Host Natalie was out of town but easy to contact on the few occasions we had questions.  We had an ideal Seattle vacation experience while enjoying the comforts of home.
12306	261912	10.0	10.0	43123686	The house was nice.  The AC instructions were difficult and it was a hot night the first night but they responded with directions when asked.  The neighborhood is amazing!

13219	7402190	10.0	9.0	40987851	The room was exactly as advertised. Very quiet a good place to crash after a busy seafair weekend. Door was a bit tricky, but not problematic.  Carolina is a very gracious hostess very welcoming.

The room has all what you need, including a closet and a great TV. Wifi runs well. Everything is clean, the bathroom is big and the kitchen has all you can need. 

Carolina couldn't be at home for checking in, but the comunication with her was easy and fast. In fact, we were talking each other before our visit to Seattle in English often, and she can sepas Spanish too perfectly. 

We would be back at her place again. "

The bedroom allows us 2 ppl to rest comfortably and Carolina happens to be not around during our stay so basically we have the house all to ourselves. I would definitely recommend Carolina's place to anybody who needs a good place to rest and tour in Seattle city. During our stay Carolina was always quick to respond to any of our needs. I believe if Carolina's around she'll be a great host to live together and would be super helpful for the first-timers to Seattle city. Thanks a lot Carolina.

It's in a beautiful neighborhood and everything is a short 1-3 mile distance from his home(downtown/pike place/lake Washington). Mike is very welcoming and communication was never a problem he even left the lights on when we were out late night. We will def be back. Our stay was extraordinaire. Thank you Michael your place is awesome and the decor/ lighting is amazing. Loved it
14717	6209191	10.0	10.0	33393369	This house is absolutely fantastic, and Michael is equally as good a host. The neighbourhood is green, quiet, and very friendly. Great access to both public transit and cycling paths for those of us who don't drive.
14718	6209191	10.0	10.0	33732127	Great experience -- terrific location and Michael was a very gracious host. We had a car, but still appreciated that we could walk to neighborhood restaurants and a nearby park. Very comfy bed, cozy room, tranquil vibe. 
14719	6209191	10.0	10.0	33934529	Michael is a very nice host, he helped us to plan the trip. He drove us to some of the attractions when he picked us up at the airport. The house is super clean and nice. The neighborhood is quite and close to lake union. Highly recommend.
14720	6209191	10.0	10.0	35484172	Michael's place is very nice. It's in a quiet area, yet it was very easy to access Downtown. It's right next to a couple bus stops. My hosts were very friendly. The room was well prepared. The house is very clean. Madrona is a very nice neighborhood and I highly recommend Michael's place if you are exploring the city.
16105	5744931	10.0	8.0	28760352	Cute, clean apartment that is exactly as it looks in the photos. Lively, but fun neighborhood. Easy access to the university, shops, and bus lines. We appreciated the accommodations of coffee, oatmeal, and wine. The reserved parking spot was a huge bonus. The bed was comfortable and shower was consistently warm. Morteza was very quick to respond to any questions we had. Overall, our stay was wonderful and we would highly recommend staying here!
16106	5744931	10.0	8.0	29941480	"Morteza was a great host! He was flexible on our arrival and departure--even letting us check out later because of a 10 p.m. flight arrival on day one and 10 p.m. departure on the last day. Everything was extremely clean and comfortable. 

We cooked but a few essentials were missing for proper cooking and cleaning, though we worked with what we had! (Maybe a skillet spatula and dishwashing sponge? And more than 1.5 rolls of TP) 

The only glaring issue was a house party (in the same house/unit) on Friday night that was so loud the walls were vibrating with bass/music and we could hear people falling down and yelling from 6:45 p.m. to 2 a.m. We weren't sure which other unit it was but Morteza apologized, spoke to the college students renting, and it didn't happen again. We only cared because we chose Friday to do a day hike and wanted to have a calm, quiet night in cooking dinner!

The neighborhood is definitely young (University District) and fun with plenty of interesting bits of culture and restaurants. Make sure you are ok with being around a bunch of college students if you stay here! We had a nice spot for our rental car in back of the apartment and it was really convenient. 

Thanks again, Morteza, and best wishes. I recommend this spot as a temporary getaway or home for anyone visiting Seattle.
"
16107	5744931	10.0	8.0	35362144	The host canceled this reservation 41 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
16108	5744931	10.0	8.0	38697463	Morteza was an excellent host. Checked in with us when we arrived to make sure we had everything that we needed. If we ever had any issues like the Internet being reset, it was fixed within the hour. The apartment was just as described and the pictures were accurate. The neighborhood was nice but it could get noisy some nights being that it is close to the college. Everything was in walking distance which made it very convenient. Overall we had a great stay! 
16109	5744931	10.0	8.0	39545462	Great host, location and communications.  The tea, coffee & wine was a great welcoming.   Thank you Morteza!
16110	5744931	10.0	8.0	45704940	Morteza was a most excellent host. Super easy to contact and really friendly. When the wifi went out he was there within 30 minutes to set up a new modem and brought me hangers the next day since he noticed they were missing! The apartment is tiny but sweet and very clean! Great area close to everything you could possibly need. Would come back again for sure!
16111	5744931	10.0	8.0	46287593	Morteza is a very gracious and responsive host. He always promptly replied to emails and text messages from the minute I booked until I checked out. The apartment is as-advertised--clean and cozy, but more than enough to accommodate three adults. The neighborhood is very young as can be expected in University District, with college students dominating the area. It is also very central to many of the Seattle hot spots. One quick tip--if you're using Google Maps to locate the apartment, note that the reserved parking is in the alley between 19th and 18th (Google Maps will take you to the front of the apartment on 19th).
18819	4737727	10.0	10.0	41698797	Jessica and her housemates were really favorable and friendly. I was a little worried because the location of her house looked somehow far from downtown when I checked google map. But it wasn't difficult to find the location, and I was able to take buses nearby home which was convenient. Also, the room I stayed was exactly same to this picture. Everything I needed as a tourist was furnished, and they were clean and neat.  I really liked it. 
18820	4737727	10.0	10.0	42070092	We had a great time staying at Jessica's place. Although we didn't get to meet her in person, we were able to reach her when we needed anything. She was very nice and accommodating, so were her housemates. It was a pleasant stay.
18821	4737727	10.0	10.0	43554330	Jessica was very accommodating in check in and check out times. She was extremely friendly for the duration of my stay. Her room was well maintained, clean, and inviting. Her roommate were as friendly and understanding as well. The pistachio colored walls were soothing and overall her room is cute! I would not hesitate to stay at this place again!
19470	5241773	10.0	10.0	27525736	This was a wonderful AirBnB experience for me - a last minute plan that worked, and was much improved, by staying with Louis. I had some logistics to accommodate which he took in stride. The communication ahead of time made the arrangements clear, the room was great, the location was what initially attracted me to the listing and proved to be ideal, and what started as a place to stay turned into a lovely experience that started my day in Seattle just right - with sunshine (unusual, I know, and probably not always part of staying there) and fantastic suggestions about where to explore. Louis made me feel very welcome - and helped me avoid my introverted tendencies by making it clear I wasn't imposing. I certainly plan to stay here again next time I am in Seattle.
19471	5241773	10.0	10.0	27744497	Louis and Kevin were very welcoming and contacted us in advance to make sure they were home when we arrived.

They are interesting conversationalists, knowledgeable about Seattle. Don't miss out on the opportunity to learn about Seattle from them! Can't recommend highly enough staying with them!
19478	5241773	10.0	10.0	28744673	"Kevin & Louis are great host, and I think their place defiantly the great place to stay in Seattle. 20 mins walk away from downtown, makes it very easy to go around. The house is so cool, well organize, and very cozy. BTW, the two cats in the house are both very friendly, but a little be shy thought. I also enjoy talking with them after a day tour in the city, they give great advises about the city.

They have two cats, one who fetches which i adored! I was able to meet Louis late the night i arrived and he helped me find a place to eat since i was starving, then Kevin the next day was able to tell me about the details when renting in Seattle.

hope to keep in contact with them! "
19484	5241773	10.0	10.0	29688664	"Louis and Kevin were great hosts - welcoming and informative.  I was at a downtown conference and enjoyed the walk down and back up Pike St (perfect if you LIKE to walk up and down hills, but drive or public transport if you like it flat).

The home is lovely - still a few spots where you can see their ongoing renovation, but it is all tidy and has that cozy ambiance, everything very clean, bed is comfy.  Lovely garden was a site for my sore - wintry Vermont eyes."
19485	5241773	10.0	10.0	29977051	"Great hosts, lovely house, excellent location, two friendly cats. Everything you could hope from an airbnb.

This was our first Airbnb experience and we have a feeling it is going to be a hard one to beat! Kevin and Lois made us feel extremely welcomed the entire time and gave us excellent recommendations on things to do/where to eat. Downtown Seattle is an easy walk (10-15 min). Capitol Hill is an excellent neighborhood with plenty of places to explore. I would recommend this place to anyone and hope to stay there again when I come back to Seattle!
19511	5241773	10.0	10.0	37070199	This was our first Airbnb experience, and Kevin & Louis set the bar extremely high for our next stay! They are some of the most genuinely kind and generous people we have ever met, and the highlight of our stay in Seattle was spending an evening getting to know them on their back porch over a bottle of wine. Their home is in a fun and exciting part of Seattle in Capitol Hill, and we were only a 30 minute walk from Pike Place. Their home is cozy and they have 2 adorable cats, especially Sam, who will hop on the bed and say hello if you welcome him. They made sure we felt at ease and comfortable in their home; it was very clean and felt like a bonafide bed and breakfast. The next time we're in Seattle we absolutely hope to stay with Kevin and Louis again. We had such a lovely experience!
19512	5241773	10.0	10.0	37643792	Kevin and Louis have created a very comfortable and physically beautiful environment in which to have people stay.  Kevin greeted me when I arrived mid-day from Toronto.  The house and backyard are relaxing places to unwind after a busy day exploring the city.  These guys are so nice and easy to talk to.  Kevin gave me some great suggestions for eating in the neighbourhood, especially for breakfast.  The location is absolutely the best.  You're within walking distance to plenty of good restaurants and bars, eclectic Cal Andersen Park as well as my favourite homemade ice cream place, Molly Moon's.  While close to plenty of action, the home is located on a beautifully quiet street (which I tend to prefer).  In terms of bus routes, it's a snap - a 2-min walk to the bus stop and then you zoom downtown!  However, walking down Pike Street is a great bohemian experience!  Thanks so much guys for a great stay in one of my favourite cities!
19513	5241773	10.0	10.0	37875110	What a great place to stay.  Louis and Kevin have a nice private room on the main level of their house, and had coffee available in the mornings.

19515	5241773	10.0	10.0	38502136	"Louis & Kevin were fantastic hosts! We got in early in the morning and they met us at the curb, helped carry our bags up to the house, and got us some much needed tea and coffee. We loved chatting with them about what to do in Seattle - and they gave just the right amount of input and guidance while still letting us figure things out and explore independently. They were kind enough to let us store things there before our room was ready, and when we got back after exploring, the room was clean, ready, and they had moved our bags in as well. 

Although we only stayed for 1 night with Louis & Kevin, we would definitely recommend them. The house and room are great, comfortable, homey, and in a great location. My friend (a Seattle-native) was very jealous of our location on Capitol Hill and said we really found a great place. Plus, the welcoming, friendly atmosphere was wonderful - and getting to pet their cats and see their gorgeous gardens were added bonuses. "

We were only here for one night and we were definitely sad to leave.  This is the perfect spot to stay on a visit to Seattle!"
19520	5241773	10.0	10.0	39916770	Staying with Louis and Kevin was the quintessential Airbnb experience; what it should be, why everyone loves staying in them. They were absolutely exceptional hosts with on point neighborhood advice (everyone should try Plum Bistro, as recommended to us by them!) Their home was wonderful, we slept well and the room was quite comfortable, and we enjoyed the amazing space that they have curated. I always felt welcome to join in meals and conversations, which was the highlight of the trip. I wish I could have spent more time with them, however just the weekend was enough to reinforce and remind me how wonderful people can truly be. 
19521	5241773	10.0	10.0	40127117	Extremely kind, respectful, and accommodating.  I needed a room for one night at the tail end of a wedding trip and Louis and Kevin were happy to have me in their home. The house is well decorated and the bed I slept in was extremely comfortable. They have an amazing coffee selection and their home is in one of Seattle's hottest neighborhoods. I was out with friends the afternoon of my arrival and Louis and Kevin were very flexible and made sure someone would be available to get me checked in. I would definitely stay here again. 
19522	5241773	10.0	10.0	40428982	Louis and Kevin were awesome hosts, very welcoming, relaxed and happy to share all kind of information about Seattle. They were also great to chat to each day and Louis even very kindly offered to drive us down to the metro on our departure. The house is very comfortable and spacious and it is possible to walk to many of the main tourist sites. The only public transport we used was the monorail to the Seattle Centre. Coffee, tea and water are provided and it was great to enjoy a coffee on the sunny back deck in the morning. Overall, highly recommended choice of accommodation for Seattle!
19523	5241773	10.0	10.0	40864160	Prime location (3 min walk from bus stop). Our friendly hosts welcomed us into their house and had set up a comfortable bedroom where we slept soundly; noise was minimum to none. While it was clear that conversation was welcome, it was by no means forced (for those who are introverts). Clean bathroom and provisions were made for those who like a cup of coffee or tea in the morning. Fridge, kitchen, and patio were also made accessible to guests. Unfortunately, we happened to be locked out on accident as we returned home one evening around 1am. I like to think it was an honest mistake and reparations were made. The cats were nice also.
19524	5241773	10.0	10.0	41049079	Amazing house, great guys, wonderful location. Would go back in a heartbeat.
19525	5241773	10.0	10.0	42720466	"We loved staying at the house on Capitol Hill!! We didn't get a chance to meet Kevin but Louis was so kind and helpful! We sat down with him when we got there and he helped us make plans for our two days in Seattle. His advice was excellent. 

They live in such a neat house with so much character. It's a very comforting and very homey house! We became quick friend with their cats Uno and Dos. They were even great! 

We highly recommend staying here if you are looking to Stay in Seattle! It's close enough to down town by bus, train or even walking. But there is a lot to do around Capitol Hill as well!"
19526	5241773	10.0	10.0	43043983	Clean and comfortable, the room was small but sufficient with convenient access to a shared bathroom. The hosts were friendly but not intrusive and provided everything I could need in a place to stay for a weekend in Seattle. I can't imagine a more convenient location if Capitol Hill is your desired destination.   
19527	5241773	10.0	10.0	43251719	We loved this place in the city! Great hosts (printed out maps, told us places to go, allowed us to drop off our bags) and a great neighborhood (close to shops, restaurants, 15 min walk to Pike). Fun to talk to, too - we shared a bottle of wine and they've lived on the street for over 20 years! Would absolutely recommend this place and we'll definitely be staying there again when we come back.
19528	5241773	10.0	10.0	43404688	Kevin and Louis were both very good hosts. We had great communication, exchanging several messages before arriving and on the day of arrival and they were more than willing to help us navigate the area. Their helpful suggestions came in handy when my wife and I stayed in their home for one evening. The room itself is quite simple and the linens aren't the same ones used at the Ritz but we found our stay comfortable. There is another room right across the hall and we shared the bathroom with the guests staying there which was never a problem. In all, a great location and very welcoming hosts in modest accommodations. 
19529	5241773	10.0	10.0	43833343	Louis & Kevin were great. They managed to accommodate us even though our flight to Seattle delayed us and they gave us great tips for sightseeing. They live walking distance to several breweries for those interested in beer & near the Starbucks Roastery. Downtown is only around a 25 minute walk. The walk is great for seeing Seattle too. There was coffee, tea, a clean room & nice bathroom. All in all, a great experience. Thanks guys!
19530	5241773	10.0	10.0	43955268	everything was amazing! Thanks so much Louis and Kevin.  The home was warm and welcoming and our private room was perfect.  They were extremely accommodating and helpful with suggestions about the Seattle.   Highly recommend having a stay with these gentlemen! 
19531	5241773	10.0	10.0	44433761	What an awesome stay. My girlfriend and I were primarily in Seattle for the hiking so this room served us perfectly. The location is great as there are so many places to eat and drink afterwards. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a simple room to crash in. Kevin and Lou were excellent hosts. 
19532	5241773	10.0	10.0	44619074	Kevin was very pleasant, helpful & recommended the Starbucks Reserve roaster/tasting room while I was in town. Good conversation. Thank you.

19534	5241773	10.0	10.0	45479038	Louis and Kevin were wonderful hosts. We had great conversations with them on several occasions. They also proved to be a wealth of knowledge about the city (especially when on the hunt for great food). The location was great and we had a very pleasant stay.
19535	5241773	10.0	10.0	45628743	"We had a really great stay.  Louis and Kevin were great hosts and offered a lot of great information about the city.  The neighborhood felt safe and is central to everything you want to do.  The place was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  

We wish we had more time to stay so if there is chance we can stay here for our next Seattle visit, this would be the place we book!

Thank you Louis and Kevin."
19536	5241773	10.0	10.0	46373777	Louis and Kevin's house was a welcoming, simple and stress-free place to stay in a fantastic neighborhood.  They are very hospitable as hosts, very courteous, and were willing to go above-and-beyond such as drawing maps to the best brunch spots, and letting me use their printer and ironing board.  If you enjoy a very pleasant, diverse, chic and walkable neighborhood, this is it.
19537	5241773	10.0	10.0	46692081	"We had a warm welcome at Louis & Kevin's place. Louis was happily providing us with some good tips for our short stay in Seattle and helped us out with any questions we had. We really enjoyed our  two days there and had a great time! 

We definitely highly recommend staying with Louis & Kevin! Thanks for making the beginning of our trip that nice! 

Tamas & Vanessa"
19538	5241773	10.0	10.0	46956781	"Louis and Kevin were perfect hosts - it was a lovely and welcoming first stop after doing a long haul flight.

The area was good for us - lots of nice coffee places and restaurants and a 25min walk to the market/observatory tower.

The room and house were really well maintained with a nice character, the cats were cute too! 

Would definitely recommend."
19539	5241773	10.0	10.0	47352134	"There was a great level of communication with Louis and Kevin as soon as the booking was accepted and it just got better from there. We were able to schedule a time for me to come by and check in and the atmosphere was super inviting and warm. We had a really great conversation about things that have changed in the neighborhood since I used to live near the city and I was given some places to look into that I had forgotten about in the past.

The location of their house was really great too as I didn't need to use the bus at all and just walked around to every where I wanted to go. It was also a really quiet neighborhood and the other guests that were staying in an adjacent room were really fun to talk to as well. Overall I had a very awesome experience here and would stay a second time if I'm in the area again."
19540	5241773	10.0	10.0	47533070	A great location, a clean room with towels for the bathroom, and two kindly and gracious hosts.  Kevin greeted my husband and I warmly, then helped us figure out some museums and restaurants we might be interested in visiting.  He was also able to show us to some off-street parking, which was a huge benefit.  I greatly enjoyed visiting with the two cats, but if you are not a cat person, it is easy enough to avoid them by simply closing the bedroom door.  The living area included a wide variety of local magazines to help you plan your visit.  Many thanks to this lovely couple for a welcoming stay!
19541	5241773	10.0	10.0	47622857	Our hosts. Kevin and Louis were gracious and made us feel right at home. The house is in a lovely residential setting and the room was tidy and neat. It was obvious we had access to common areas as well. Our hosts provided a map with suggestions of things to see. The walk from the house to downtown was all downhill and took us 30 MINUTES, sightseeing all the way. I bet ride back to the house was inexpensive. Our host were descrite, but available when we needed them. All in all, everything meet our expectations.
19542	5241773	10.0	10.0	48015638	They are wonderful and friendly hosts. Their hospitality is amazing as well as the room they provided. Would definitely stay here again
19543	5241773	10.0	10.0	48092331	We met Louis and Kevin on our arrival and they welcomed us into their home like we were good friends paying them a visit. The home is quaint and in a nice neighborhood with lots of places to eat and things to do. The bed was comfortable and the hosts supplied us with coffee in the morning. I would definitely stay in Louis and Kevin's home in the future.
19544	5241773	10.0	10.0	48223017	I had a wonderful experience staying with Louis and Kevin in their beautiful home. They were very welcoming and provided places to eat at and visit. The bedroom, bathroom, and common areas were clean and tidy. The house is located in close proximity to many delicious restaurants, bars, and shopping areas. I would definitely recommend staying with them if you are lucky enough to find an open date with them!
19545	5241773	10.0	10.0	48496206	Our stay with Kevin and Louis was everything we hoped for! As our first time AirBnb stay ever, we where amazed by the warm welcome of Kevin. He told us about Seattle and all the sights we could see. Drinking a beer with Kevin and Louis near the fireplace, although it was warm outside, is a real testament to the warm people that they are. They also gave us a lot of tips on our yet to be started road trip down south. We really recommend staying at Kevin and Louis!
19546	5241773	10.0	10.0	49974778	I loved my week with Kevin and Louis!  Their lovely home is in a quiet street but close to the bus and cafes etc.  They made me welcome and answered my questions regarding sightseeing.  They made my stay in seattle even more enjoyable.  Thanks guys.
19547	5241773	10.0	10.0	51200850	Louis and Kevin were wonderful hosts! They had great advice about things to do in Seattle, and their place was warm and welcoming, and the perfect home base for exploring downtown Seattle.
19548	5241773	10.0	10.0	51426046	"It was a little bit like coming home, or visiting (new) old friends. These guys are terrific hosts, the house is impeccably clean and the bed is the most comfortable I've ever enjoyed away from home. 

Already looking for my next excuse to go back to Seattle!"
19549	5241773	10.0	10.0	52269857	Very warm and welcoming home, with the friendliest kitties in town. Kevin was very clear and concise about the room, the keys, and the amenities. He recommended neighborhood eateries (I enjoyed Cafe Presse and Manmoosh) and had a very handy map I used to navigate my various meetings.
19550	5241773	10.0	10.0	52609506	These guys make traveling to check out a new city easy! I arrived around midnight and they had an easy plan for me to get in with their instructions sent prior. When I talked to them in the morning, they even provided me with their suggestions on nearby restaurant's and places to check out. Great location to check out capital hill and was easy to walk everywhere. I appreciate them allowing me to stay at their house!
19551	5241773	10.0	10.0	53072841	"Louis and Kevin were gracious hosts and their house is really comfortable and quaint. I appreciate the time they took to make sure everything was comfortable and how they gave me a lay of the land when I first arrived. 

My visit was pretty brief so I didn't speak with Louis and Kevin too much, but they were very pleasant and their cats are adorable. I would recommend staying with them for anyone visiting the area.

Great location, very comfortable, and rather laid back. Thanks gentlemen! "
19552	5241773	10.0	10.0	53225454	Great people, great location, great times! Louis and Kevin are very welcoming, everything is in walking distance and they have great tips. Recommended!
19553	5241773	10.0	10.0	54247933	I cannot say enough about Kevin and Louis. They were extremely helpful when I arrived and gave me a full breakdown of the neighborhood and city after learning I was looking to move to Seattle. Kevin and Louis make you feel as if they've known you for years. From offering a glass of wine by the fire or just chatting with their friends, you will not find more hospitable and kind hosts. On top of that, the house was cleaned everyday. They also have two of the most friendly cats you'll ever meet. (Give the gray one, Sam, a little attention and he's your best friend until you leave.) I could not ask for better hosts, and would try to stay with Kevin and Louis every time I visit Seattle.
19554	5241773	10.0	10.0	54350427	This has been my very first Airbnb stay and Louis and Kevin have set the bar extremely high because they have been such wonderful hosts. They could not have been more helpful and kind.  I was in town to look for more permanent housing and their advice was invaluable. Also, I had been out in the cold rain all day and thus it felt so good to sit down in their comfy sofa by the fire place with a glass of wine, chatting with them about our lives. The house is lovely - full of old world charm. My room and bath room were very clean, and the coffee in the morning was freshly brewed and perfect. When I left, I was ready to face the rain again with a much better plan for the rest of my day, and in a way better mood. Thanks again!
19555	5241773	10.0	10.0	54863370	"Louis and Kevin are such wonderful hosts, they opened their home to us with absolutely amazing warmth and welcoming.

They always found time to say hi and sit down and chat by the fireplace, and show us around their lovely garden. They were always helpful and open to give suggestions about places to see in Seattle.

The room is warm, comfortable and clean. Although the bedroom doesnt have a private bathroom, that wasn't an issue as the bathroom was always kept well equipped and clean. The house is perfectly located, everything is a walking distance away, with access to public transportation.

As we were ready to depart and leave on our way, Louis and Kevin gave us such warm goodbye, it truely felt as we were leaving two friends behind. Anytime I am in Seattle in the future, I plan to see the opportunity to stay at their place."
19556	5241773	10.0	10.0	54993078	I had reserved both bedrooms for my trip to Seattle, please see my other review.  This host is fantastic!

they live in a beautiful house with a spacious clean room and toilet. the area was just magnificent in downtown Seattle. 

without a shadow of a doubt , i will return to this beautiful city and staying with Kevin and Louis made me realize how beautiful this town is as well as its people ...

till we meet again :)

19559	5241773	10.0	10.0	55907442	Louis and Kevin were so welcoming. They made some great suggestions for things to do in Seattle, including bars, restaurants, and must-see museums, buildings, and places (one local pro tip: do the Sky View Observatory instead of the Space Needle). The neighborhood was fantastic -- our first night, we bopped around from bar to bar, all in walking distance, and had a lot of fun. Their house is beautiful and charming, and the bathroom and our bedroom were comfy and clean (we also thoroughly enjoyed the company of their two friendly cats, who are willing to snuggle with strangers). It was lovely to sit by the fire and have a glass of wine with Louis, and I really enjoyed chatting and getting to know the hosts. I would absolutely stay with them again and recommend them highly!
19560	5241773	10.0	10.0	56325952	Louis and Kevin were very kind and took time out of their day to make a map for us to go out. They had a fire going at all times in the living room and made sure we were comfortable at all times. They even set out an impressive coffee station where even my best friend that doesn't like coffee had the option to get hot chocolate. 
19561	5241773	10.0	10.0	56842701	Kevin and Louis are awesome! They were very gracious welcoming us into their house, and made us feel right at home. They have everything you could possibly need under their sink for toiletries which was nice, especially if you forgot anything! They kept the house at a comfortable temperature. It's nice that the front door locks on the way out and that we had the option to lock the door to our room as well. Their house is in a PRIME LOCATION if you don't want to be right by downtown. They have tons of shops and food places around them. There were also tons of bars around if you want to grab a nightcap! Getting anywhere from there house was easy because we could just walk to pine and catch a bus. Only $2.50 for a fare that transfers for up to two hours!! And if public transportation isn't the most fun for you, downtown, pioneer square, and the needle are all 100% in walking distance, and the walk is nice, with lots of cool stores and things to look at along the way. Also getting to their house from the airport is a breeze if you take the light rail. Also their cats are adorable. Our stay with them as first time airbnb users has been amazing! They really set the bar high for our future trips.
19562	5241773	10.0	10.0	57038086	We loved staying with Louis and Kevin. The room was nice and clean, the house was cozy, and their cats are so cute :) They gave us advice about where to go for dinner, sightseeing etc. Would love to go back :)
19563	5241773	10.0	10.0	57375403	Louis & Kevin's place is really a nice one. The house is warm, cozy and thoughtfully arranged and decorated, everything will make you feel like home.  The location is very good, with a lot of cool places nearby as well as good restaurants in the quiet neighborhood. It's also very close to most of the major attractions, we walked to most places without taking the bus, but if you want to, the bus station is also near. We enjoyed our time with Kevin and Louis who are very accommodating, gentle and helpful. They gave us good advice about where to visit and eat and we really enjoyed the short conversations with them everyday. The two cats are super cute and friendly, playing with them is a great fun. I would definitely recommend this place.
19564	5241773	10.0	10.0	58475679	"I couldn't have asked for a better first experience with airbnb. 

Kevin and Louis are easy going, down to earth people who have their system so simplified it goes beyond refined. 

The house itself is cozy with everything you need: comfy bed, clean sheets, bathroom dedicated to guests, coffee outside our door. The cats are a bonus, and bonus bonus, they love attention. 

The location can't be beat; everything you can ask for is just blocks away. 

Our last minute request was responded to very quickly and communication was a snap. 

These guys are pros!! Thanks! "
19729	4577542	10.0	10.0	25373842	I thought this was a great deal for what you get at this place!  a whole private apartment to myself with a full kitchen and VERY comfortable & large bed.  It was somehow quiet and cozy-feeling even though we were smack-dab in the middle of Capitol Hill, went to a couple great restaurants and bars within less than 3 blocks from our door.  And we really appreciated that it comes with a parking spot right next to the gate, made it easy to load heavy bags in and out!  The place was modern and clean but also really comfortable and accessible with lots of places to put away our stuff and also plenty of room to sit and hang out.  This was only a quick visit but I'll definitely book here again for my longer stays in Seattle when I need a home base with laundry & everything we need to bring home & prepare groceries, and close to bus lines & stores.  Thank you very much for such an easy and comfortable stay in Capitol Hill!
19730	4577542	10.0	10.0	25525813	Great location! Great house! Great hosts! Had a wonderful experience and will definitely book again for a fun weekend in the city.

19732	4577542	10.0	10.0	26792149	Place was clean and comfortable.  It was spacious and quiet. I was staying for business travel and local provided great access to restaurants and night life options.  Would definitely consider staying there again
19733	4577542	10.0	10.0	27169205	I cannot say enough positive things about Jessica and her amazing flat! Her place is somehow even cuter and cozier than it appears in the pictures. I felt so comfortable the whole time. Everything is so well laid out and is stocked with everything you'd need. It's in a fabulous area of town that's walkable to multiple grocery stores, bus lines, and approximately a jillion restaurants and bars. It was really easy for me to just walk to the grocery store to get what i needed for the next day or 2 and restock as needed. Despite this close proximity to everything, the place was super quiet and peaceful-- no loud neighbors or late-night bar crawlers. Also Jessica was super responsive and got back to me right away about any questions I had.  I definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance.
19734	4577542	10.0	10.0	27514977	Great place in an awesome location. The space is well decorated, welcoming, clean and comfortable. It was centrally located and walking distance to many great eateries. I would love to stay here again.

"
19739	4577542	10.0	10.0	31926024	"Very adorable home.  It seemed as though a lot of love and thought was put into every aspect of it. The listing and the neighborhood were as described.  There were a lot of restaurants and bars in walking distance.  Everything was clean and Heather (Jessica's management person) was very responsive when we reached out to her.  The person who was listed in the book (Kathy) was not as helpful so I would just keep all communications with Jessica or Heather if you need someone.

Just a couple of minor issues during our stay.  The toilet seems prone stopping (as noted in the house rules book) so you should expect to do some toilet plunging during your stay (not the best way to spend a vacation).  There was a disassembled fan that seemed available for us but it was missing a piece. The TVs gave us problems throughout our stay too.  All very minor.  I would recommend this place nonetheless.  Maybe just plan to potty elsewhere :)."
19740	4577542	10.0	10.0	32509333	The place is really nice; very cozy and modern. The bed is huge and the kitchen has all the important tools. Very close and easy to get downtown. We arrived earlier and it was possible to put the luggage inside before check in time. Heather was really nice and available for questions and help; definitely recommend and hope to come back :) 
19741	4577542	10.0	10.0	33767955	"I enjoyed my stay at Jessica's place during our trip. Her home is exactly as described and pictured. Everything is accessible at this location, which makes it really convenient and there are excellent recommendations provided as well. 

The only issue I came across was similar mentioned by previous guests as well. We had some difficulties with the toilet during our stay. Aside from that everything else was great."
19742	4577542	10.0	10.0	34824075	The apartment was just as described/pictured and was clean and comfortable. The decor is tasteful, with lovely local books, votive holders, and pictures. The location is perfect, close to many restaurants, cafés, and parks. The kitchen has everything one would need to make a delicious meal from one of the neighborhood grocers or farmers markets. The patio/garden was a peaceful and private oasis in a busy area. We were visiting our daughter at a university a few blocks away, and appreciated the alley parking spot. It is in a vibrant neighborhood, so be warned that it is noisy at night.  There are also stairs both to access the apartment and inside, so might not be best for someone with mobility issues.  Heather, who manages the apartment, was helpful and responsive as we planned our visit. The price is comparable to the nearby hotel we usually stay at, but we were much more comfortable and relaxed at Jessica's apartment.
19743	4577542	10.0	10.0	37284616	The apt was great. We would highly recommend and would stay there again when we're back in the Seattle area. Very prompt responses to our questions prior to our stay. The apt was very clean and looked just like the pictures. It was also hugely helpful to have a parking spot in that neighborhood.
19744	4577542	10.0	10.0	44747593	"Die Unterkunft war sehr schön und genau so, wie auf den Fotos und wie beschrieben. Die Wohnung war geschmackvoll und eingerichtet und es war alles vorhanden, was für einen schönen Aufentahlt nötig ist. Sie lag ruhig im hinteren Bereich des Hauses und der private Garten war wie eine Oase in der Großstadt.
Die zentrale Lage war sehr gut und man war schnell zu Fuß bei vielen schönen Restaurants und Shops. Capitol Hill ist ein wirklich toller Stadtteil um Seattle und seine Bewohner zu erleben und um seinen Aufenthalt zu geniesen. Die Erreichbarkeit mit dem Auto war auch ohne Probleme und sehr schnell möglich. DownTown war auch schnell und einfach zu erreichen.
Während unserem Aufenthalt war Jessica sehr bemüht. Nachdem die Wettervorhersage ""heiße Tage"" mitteilte lies Jessica uns sogar eine Klimaanlage bringen.

The host left a book of information for us, plus small touches throughout that really made our stay welcome. Check in was smooth, although we had a late flight out and there wasn't any flexibility for a late check out. We parked on the premises and it was easy in and out. We already talked about booking the place again next time we're in Seattle!"
19746	4577542	10.0	10.0	46263948	"My boyfriend and I stayed at Jessica's for 5 days, and her house is amazing. Great location and very quiet. The pictures are 100% accurate. It was so nice to come home after a busy day and relax and kickback on the comfy couch, or sit and look at the garden. It was so nice to walk a few blocks to Trader Joe's and the co op to buy food and cook in the amazing kitchen. There is a awesome Bluetooth speaker that has really good sound. Nice to be able to listen to some tunes while chilling out. Our stay was great, and I would recommend to stay here!
There were a few issues, the smoke detector was beeping because the battery was low. We contacted Pillow and they had someone over and replace it in a few hours. This is no fault of the property, I wanted to mention it because Pillow did such a good job of responding and fixing the issue. The internet was a little wonky, but we eventually got it to work on our own, just reset the router and pressed a button on the front. The binder with restaurants and suggestions for places to go was helpful, we made it to a lot of them. Def go to skillet! Hope to stay again at Jessica's when we come back to visit."
19747	4577542	10.0	10.0	46693768	"The place looks just like the photos but you can't see the great high ceilings or feel the character. Good location. We used Ub@r for transportation mostly but there are a few buses right outside the door or you can walk. We had a problem when we first arrived, sent a message and it was taken care of before I arrived back from my mani-pedi with a hot stone massage a few blocks over. 
We would stay here again in the future"
19748	4577542	10.0	10.0	47192489	The place was exactly as described, in an ideal location and the parking was such a nice bonus.  My fiancé and myself were there for her birthday weekend (she used to live in Seattle) and this was the PERFECT place to stay.  Everything was fantastic, I would absolutely recommend this place, and will be looking to book it again the next time I travel to Seattle.  Checking in was seamless, there was a great guide book of how everything worked (in the house) and recommendations of places to go - which we didn't need as my fiancé was a local for years, but if you are visiting from out of town I would see it as a huge perk.  The house was clean, neat, and more than enough space for the two of us.  
19749	4577542	10.0	10.0	48318070	The listing was clean and comfortable and super well located for a lot of great bars restaurants and other fun!
19750	4577542	10.0	10.0	48942625	"I've had a wonderful stay at Jessica's place in Seattle. I went on a long trip to several parts in America and in Canada. However, Jessica's place was the first one I went on that trip and the best among all in various ways. At Jessica's I had the most amazing time with my boyfriend. It was just so fit for two of us and we talked about how we would want a house like that someday.  The agency had everything perfectly prepared for us and I LOVED how clean the place was and how it had everything I needed to cook him nice dinner(much more than I had imagined actually. with all kinds of seasoning and herb). It felt as if we were in a very fancy hotel because they had a little packet of shampoo set on the bed with neatly arranged towels. 

Seriously, it was so much more than what I had expected from airbnb. I definitely want to stay at Jessica's again in the future. It was just that good. "
19751	4577542	10.0	10.0	49232556	"This cozy house made my stay in Seattle a very pleasant and rememberable experience! The location is very convenient and at the same time away from noise, the host is always trying to help more.
Appreciate and highly recommend!"
19752	4577542	10.0	10.0	51028498	The property description was accurate. Nice neighborhood.
19753	4577542	10.0	10.0	51621068	Jessica's home was wonderful. The lay out was great and I really enjoyed staying within walking distance of the Capital Hill area.  I would recommend it to anyone. 
19754	4577542	10.0	10.0	52726792	The apartment was welcoming and cozy. The kitchen had everything we needed and although we didn't stay too long to cook in the kitchen we would have loved to! The living room was comfortable and the bedroom was everything we needed. There was a cute balcony where you can see the rain fall and feel the breeze.  The bed was very comfortable as well and so spacious! You won't be disappointed when you arrive.  I loved that they had a dryer and washer available. The bathroom was fully stocked as well with shampoo and conditioner just in case you forgot your own. It was a nice touch.  I would love to stay here again when I return to beautiful Seattle. Not only was the apartment great but it was in the perfect location! We walked everywhere. 
19755	4577542	10.0	10.0	53342906	Jessica's place was great! It was clean, comfortable, and in a great part of town. The back yard was especially nice and cozy. Perfect for sitting and enjoying the morning. I would definitely stay here again.
19756	4577542	10.0	10.0	53983727	"We loved your place, the area, and the convenience to walkable restaurants. Your house is beautifully maintained, cozy, and private ... It really exceeded our expectations. 

My husband was not on board with the whole Airbnb idea so it took some coaxing. This was the perfect place for our first Airbnb experience.

Thanks you!"
19757	4577542	10.0	10.0	54594742	This home was nothing but adorable, welcoming, clean and it was just simply perfection. The location is perfect for seeing all of what Capitol Hill and the rest of Seattle has to offer. It was close to many great spots for dining, bar hopping, shopping and an additional for a nice stroll to a park or to see the city. I love this home and would recommend it to anyone who is interested! It is 100% and I had a great stay. 
19758	4577542	10.0	10.0	55809652	Easy check in (you're given the code two days prior) and the apartment was exact as described. Great location and walking distance to many restaurants and bars. Would stay here again!
20128	3024336	10.0	10.0	14297714	Fantastic house in a great location. Very close to public transportation and lots of great places to eat nearby. It's a very comfortable home and having 1.5 baths is great. Camille let us use her washer and dryer which is an added bonus and we optimistically brought too many summer clothes and not enough cool weather clothes. She also had a lot of fantastic tips of where to eat. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
20129	3024336	10.0	10.0	14626811	The townhouse is clean and modern as shown in the photos.  We were able to fit our compact car in the garage which made it more convenient. The place is in a fantastic location with many great restaurants within walking distance.  Other than occasional noise from people leaving pubs at night, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place.  Camille was quick to respond to any question I had for her and gave us tips on where to eat in the area.
20130	3024336	10.0	10.0	15048555	"For a first time user of Airbnb, I couldn't have had a better experience. Camille will go out of her way to settle any unknowns that may pop up for your trip. Her beautiful home made my trip greater in magnitude than I anticipated. The pictures in her listing don't do it any justice. Whenever I can visit Seattle again I will most definitely consider her place of stay. You will surely say ""we're home"" when you arrive at the front door after a full day of experiencing Seattle. Bonus: a bar with Bocce ball around the corner!"
20131	3024336	10.0	10.0	15684416	Camille was absolutely amazing! She not only provided her wonderful home to us but left us with detailed instructions for everything we could possibly need.  In addition, she left us with a list of some wonderful places to try nearby.  She was easy to get a hold of and was really quick with responding.  She was incredibly accommodating to all my needs and requests.  The home was very clean and well maintained and it was in a fantastic neighbourhood.  I would strongly recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay close to DT Seattle.  I will for sure be contacting Camille when I return to Seattle one day!
20132	3024336	10.0	10.0	16088973	The listing was beautiful! The beds were soft and comfortable and the kitchen area was stocked with anything we would need to cook during our time there. The neighborhood was full of little corner stores and lots of bars for the evening. Camille was attentive and responsive with any questions or issues we had throughout our stay. Wonderful host! 
20133	3024336	10.0	10.0	16558115	Listing was just as described, and just what we wanted. Beautiful and comfortable home, helpful hosts, and great neighborhood
20134	3024336	10.0	10.0	17448014	We absolutely loved staying here. The neighborhood was so interesting and convenient to everything we wanted to do, the space so comfortable and cozy, the host do accommodating: they thought of everything, right down to great coffee and great neighborhood recommendations. Thank you, thank you.
20135	3024336	10.0	10.0	17948257	"La casa se correspondía a lo anunciado. Era preciosa, bien equipada, bien situada y bien comunicada. 
La verdad es que nos sentimos como en nuestra propia casa
El barrio era muy moderno y lleno de alternativas interesantes.
Fue un acierto escoger esta opción para visitar Seattle."
20136	3024336	10.0	10.0	18315562	Me and my friends stayed here over the weekend and had a blast! The area is very accessible to walkways so we walked to downtown seattle everyday (30 minute walk). The house is very cute and tidy. The mattress on the couch is also so comfy! Also there are so many great restaurants nearby. The population of this area is mostly students since it is close to the university but that's what we enjoyed most. The nightlife is also very alive :) recommend staying with Camille. 
20137	3024336	10.0	10.0	18570915	"The apartment was lovely, clean and well equipped. The location was perfect for access to Seattle U, Capitol Hill and for walking down town.
Camille was really friendly, helpful and welcoming.
I can't recommend it enough!"
20138	3024336	10.0	10.0	18875695	"Wow, my experience with the house and Camille were amazing. I was in town for PAX Prime and I didn't want to pay up the wazoo for the hotels in downtown. No way, dudes. No way.

The space is true to the pictures posted and it wasn't difficult to find. You can take the Link from SeaTac and transfer onto the bus to reach the house. No biggie. If you want to go into the city, walking is plausible but if you walk back, you have hills to climb. Haha.

The neighborhood has the college vibe going on because Seattle University is right there. So are the bars and restaurants. Sometimes it gets rowdy at night with those whippersnappers, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

As for Camille, she was spectacular! She was very accommodating and so nice. She went out of her way to help me out every time. I don't think I could thank her enough.

All in all, great place, great host. I highly recommend her.

"
20139	3024336	10.0	10.0	19271197	"Let me start off by saying that communication with Camille was very easy and the response was almost immediate. I never had to worry about getting information regarding the home or the reservation. Check-in and check-out couldn't be easier.

The townhouse is beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice! It's very modern and tasteful with a lot of unique touches that really make the place feel warm and inviting. I was in town for a volleyball tournament, and this townhouse was the perfect place to relax after a long, tiring day. I spent many nights on the patio enjoying the ambiance.

In terms of location, it's in an ideal spot. I was able to walk to Capitol Hill within 10 minutes and be around lots of restaurants, shops, and nightlife. Even better, it's like 2 blocks away from the frozen custard place! It's close to several bus lines that go to downtown, but you could easily walk that as well. It's also 1 block from Seattle University, so if you're child attends school there, it's also very convenient when you are visiting.

I would highly recommend Camille's home for your travels. Whenever I'm in Seattle, this will be the first place I look. Hopefully it'll be available, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's booked."
20140	3024336	10.0	10.0	19691481	"Camille was a great host!  This was my first time using airbnb and she made the entire process easy from check in to great things to do in their neighborhood.  The apartment was perfect for what I needed - was a great place to relax when not out exploring Seattle.  There are so many great restaurants all within 3 blocks including some of the best sushi I have had.  

Camille made sure everything was smooth during check in and the entire stay, even letting me leave my bags after I checked out since I had a flight much later in the day.  She had coffee ready to be made for the mornings and a full list of must sees.  I will definitely stay there again when I come back to Seattle."
20141	3024336	10.0	10.0	20083743	This place is fantastic! The pictures and description sold me on the listing and I was not at all disappointed. Camille is a fantastic host. She left great suggestions for places around the neighborhood, all sorts of directions for the house and even left her favorite local coffee for us to drink. So close to everything you want to do on the Hill without the bustle. Great, quiet neighborhood. Couldn't be more satisfied and hope to book with her again when I go back to Seattle. 
20142	3024336	10.0	10.0	20502353	"Wow, I can't think of a better place to stay while in Seattle. Camille's home was incredibly beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. 
As comfortable and stylish as the digs are, the location is the real winner. It is a very easy walk to almost anywhere in the city, including Pikes Place, the Space Needle, downtown, and to about a million restaurants, shops and bars. 
While it can be overwhelming visiting a new city for the first time and trying to figure out where to eat and what to see, we walked around like seasoned pros based on Camille's recommendations. 
I have a new favorite city, and I can't even imagine looking elsewhere if Camille's place is available! "
20143	3024336	10.0	10.0	20926699	Communication with Camille was easy and friendly. The house has an excellent location. The space was as described and we feel comfortable at the house. Everybody enjoyed the time we had in Seattle. 
20144	3024336	10.0	10.0	21225094	We had a great stay at Camille's place. The apartment is located right by capitol hill and there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Walking distance from the downtown too - especially the downhill leg! The apartment is well laid out and very roomy. The flat was exceptionally clean and well prepared for our stay. Bed was very comfortable and also a proper double sofa bed. Balcony was an added bonus too.
20145	3024336	10.0	10.0	22617116	Camille's property was amazing. She left us brownies and a list of great spots to check out while I was in town. The location of the property couldn't have been better. It is literally walking distance from  no less than 20 restaurants/bars. Couldn't ask for a better stay!
20146	3024336	10.0	10.0	23481860	This apartment is even more impressive than on the pictures. The couch was probably the most comfortable one we've ever enjoyed. The decoration was very nice. We didn't meet the host, but she left us a list of highlights in Seattle and other instructions concerning the apartment. The neighborhood itself is not extremely exciting, but it's close to downtown. We can definitely recommend this place.
20147	3024336	10.0	10.0	24444055	Camille has a beautiful house and we had a great time staying there. We had everything that we could need, including some bonuses like delicious specialty coffee! It was also helpful to be able to park in the garage. My favorite thing about this house was the walking distance to Elysian brewery on Pike. We would definitely stay again. 
20148	3024336	10.0	10.0	26718957	This was by far my favorite Airbnb experience! Camille's place is beautiful, impeccably clean, and in an amazing location. Camille was incredibly communicative and helpful with everything. She left us a list of her favorite local places and some local coffee to try out... so thoughtful! Both of the beds are super comfortable and many restaurants, bars, and shops are within a short walking distance. I highly recommend staying here if you come to Seattle and hope to stay again myself one day.  
20149	3024336	10.0	10.0	28742387	Camille was very friendly and helpful at any point of time, and made everything a lot easier for us. We loved their apartment with its nice decor and great location, in addition to it being neat and tidy. Camille and Gaelen even left us their favorite coffee beans (which we enjoyed)! Would definitely check if it's available next time :) 
20150	3024336	10.0	10.0	29936174	Camille's home was a fantastic place to stay. It's located in a great part of the city. It's very comfortable, spacious, and easily accessible. Booking with Camille was smooth and she had everything perfect for our arrival. 
20151	3024336	10.0	10.0	32600185	This property is well located and was clean and comfortable. Camille was very easy to deal with and communicated all the details we needed. Everything was as promised. Thanks for a great stay!
20152	3024336	10.0	10.0	34456186	Beautiful home in a great Cap Hill Location!  We arrived to a personalized note from Camille with all the information we would need to use the wifi, TV, etc.  Even though the temperatures were in the 90s during our stay, the home managed to stay relatively cool which was nice.  Everything we needed was easy to find and the checkout procedure was way easier than some other AirBnBs I've rented.
20153	3024336	10.0	10.0	35194064	My mother and sister and I travelled to Seattle for my son's graduation from Seattle U.   We stayed at Camille and Gaelen's airbnb which was PERFECT!   It was just one block to the University where my graduating son and his brother stayed in the dorms.   The place is just adorable!   So comfortable, and unique!   We waked to everything - wonderful restaurants, Trader Joe's.  
20154	3024336	10.0	10.0	35798480	Camille was a great host! My friends and I really enjoyed our stay and it was walking distance to a lot of eateries/bars. It wasn't too far from all the touristy spots either. Camille also provided us with all the necessary info we needed to get around town and if we had any questions, she was just a text away. Definitely recommend staying at her place when visiting Seattle.
20155	3024336	10.0	10.0	36578792	"Camille has a lovely home in a perfect location for seeing and getting around Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle.  Parking was even available across the road.  The apartment is very spacious and has a great kitchen and bathroom!  Camille is very friendly, the check-in was effortless and we had everything we needed and more.  Thanks also for all the leaflets and tips for things to do nearby! :)
"
20156	3024336	10.0	10.0	37456828	"Camille was very helpful and friendly. This was my first time using airbnb.com for a stay, she made it so easy and stress free for me. The condo is extremely clean and nicely furnished. The full kitchen allowed us to shop at the neighborhood safeway for basic groceries to cook and enjoy homemade meals. The bed downstairs in the living room was so comfortable. The location for us was perfect! We walked to local restaurants and bars each day and all the ""tourist"" stuff we wanted to see was a quick 10-15 min drive. We enjoyed our stay very much."
20157	3024336	10.0	10.0	39042468	This space was wonderful - great neighborhood, and even bigger than it looks in the photos. We really enjoyed our time here. 
20158	3024336	10.0	10.0	39913647	We had a great time in Seattle while staying at Camille's place. The location was amazing and the place was clean and comfortable. Camille communicated everything very clearly and promptly and I would definitely love to stay at her place again the next time I'm in the beautiful city of Seattle!
20159	3024336	10.0	10.0	41085777	"Camille was a wonderful host and we loved our time in this modern home! The extra care she took in approving us to stay, to us only meant that she cares deeply about her home.  We felt very welcome with the list of places she enjoys visiting, maps and tour books, and the couch turned into a bed (that you never would have thought was a couch after the restful sleep it provided.) We found ourselves needing nothing that she didn't already have available for our use. Although we got along without a car, she provided the garage door opener in case we needed it. Capital Hill was a short walk and further on you could get to downtown Seattle. We got around the city by walking and using Ubers - which were great! 
"
20160	3024336	10.0	10.0	42121485	I could not have asked for a better first-time Air BnB experience. Camille made everything very easy. From simple and detailed instructions to get into the apartment to a great welcome letter with a list of things to do in the area. Camille's home was in a great neighborhood with easy access to the whole city. Also, the home was even better than the pictures. I had no issue with this listing. I would definitely recommend, Camille is a professional!
20161	3024336	10.0	10.0	43246088	"We had an awesome time here. We were kind of high maintenance with early check in, but Camille was completely accommodating. The neighborhood is great. Good for walking and a good central location to get around on public transit. I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. 

Camille gave us a great list with local restaurants/shops to visit. Highly recommended. "
20162	3024336	10.0	10.0	44131077	This home is stellar. The place is very charming and extremely clean, well appointed and comfortable. The beds are fabulous and we slept very well. Camille has a sweet place!  We've stayed at a lot of airbnb's and this place has an excellent balance of personal charm and anonymous luxury. If you're used to trolling airbnb for the perfect place, then you'll know what I mean. If you're newer to airbnb, then just trust me: this place is a gem. Aside from the kickass kitchen, lovely common space, comfortable beds, squeaky clean condition, and darling outdoor space, it's located in a ultra cool area just walking distance from everything cute about Capitol Hill. Can't recommend this place more. Thank you very much Camille!
20163	3024336	10.0	10.0	45382557	Listing was excellent! They left a lovely detailed note for us with instructions + recommendations of local food, and some great coffee to indulge in. Everything was well kept and clean, the house was pleasant and in a great neighborhood. Overall great!
20164	3024336	10.0	10.0	46301742	Camille's duplex apartment was comfortable and clean. Our favorite feature was the balcony, which overlooked a quaint, leafy street. We also took advantage of the garage which, as the host notes, can only fit a compact car. The location is convenient, with plenty of food and drink options nearby.
20165	3024336	10.0	10.0	47847536	Camill'a place was roomy, modern, and very close to all the action in Caphill. The garage parking was a great convenience, though street parking is easy to find. Highly recommended!
20166	3024336	10.0	10.0	48772689	What a wonderful experience! We booked the Sparkling Modern Seattle Home because of its great airbnb reviews and are absolutely happy with our choice. The apartment is situated in a quiet side street close to Pike and Pine Street and offers everyhing we (two couples) could wish for. Two comfortable beds, a fully equipped kitchen and a beautiful bathroom with hot water and fresh towels. The location close to downtown is superb. We went for dinner in Cascina Spinasse which is only two blocks away. Best pasta we ever tasted. Long story short: you don't have to look any further. Book this place and you won't be disappointed! 
20167	3024336	10.0	10.0	51501348	"Our stay was amazing! Awesome town home in a beautiful neighbourhood. Lots of bars and places to eat nearby which is ideal! We also were able to easily walk downtown and Uber/Cab anywhere else we needed to go. 

The place had everything we needed and was very clean/organized when we arrived. We didn't get to meet Camille but check in was easy and smooth. Would definitely stay again! "
20347	7093738	10.0	10.0	44459473	"From our first enquiry about staying over at Ted’s I gathered that he would be a great host and he certainly was. He was quick to respond to questions and very accommodative regarding check-in and checkout times. Upon our arrival he went the extra mile to assist with our luggage, I really appreciated that! 

The house itself is as described: modern, clean, spacious and very well equipped.
Our room had one of the most comfortable beds. I loved the layout of the bathroom (Master bedroom).

Ted’s house is centrally located, a 10-15 minute drive to and from major attractions. 
We decided to not rent a car and to see more of Seattle by making use of public transportation (bus and UBER)-found it to be more cost effective plus it saves you from the hassle of having to pick and drop off a rental ☺. The bus stop is right outside the house – we used it to go downtown as well as to the light rail station, which took us to the airport.

Given Ted's hospitality and our comfortable stay, we highly recommend his place. "
20765	1961671	10.0	10.0	10830863	Sasha's home was perfect! We arrived a bit early and had the pleasure of meeting Sasha and Alex, they where very pleasant and inviting.

They were very helpful in providing information on local entertainment and tourist attractions. Their home was a 10 min cab away from the heart of downtown so it was very convenient for us. The neighborhood looked very nice and felt safe. 

I would definitely recommend their home for anyone planning a trip to Seattle."
20772	1961671	10.0	10.0	24410982	Great place; great location. Wonderful house to spend a quiet family Christmas. Good dining/coffee options within walking distance and easy access to downtown via bus. The house is beautiful and well maintained. The whole experience was great! 
20773	1961671	10.0	10.0	27394306	We stayed 3 nights in Sasha's home and it was absolutely perfect!  Sasha did everything she could to make the home inviting and had anticipated everything we would need to know about the house (loved her sticky notes all over telling us where things were!).  We took care of her two cats while there, which was an added bonus for us!  The neighborhood is great with coffee shops, boutiques and restaurants within walking distance.  We took Bus #3 to downtown area as well as to catch the light rail to the airport.  Wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks Sasha and Alex!
20774	1961671	10.0	10.0	27536443	"Wow! What a fabulous house and excellent hosts. the cats made me feel right at home :) 

Sasha and Alex provided everything we needed and explained everything clearly. The house was more than big enough, I highly recommend it for a couple of couples or a family. Lots of space, light, clean, well-stocked, and in a super cute neighborhood. Street parking was easy and we could walk to the cute bakery around the corner for latte and pastries. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us! "
20775	1961671	10.0	10.0	33092655	My sisters and I stayed here with my young baby for a weekend trip to Seattle. Sasha was very easy to communicate with from the beginning and the house was exactly what we had hoped for. The rooms were all very comgortsble and cozy, the kitchen is perfect if you want to cook and the dining area is just beautiful. We spent our evenings sitting in the front room chatting, however, there is a super cozy basement living room if you want to watch a movie and relax that way instead.  The neighborhood is darling and the local restaurants and shopping areas were so charming. Sasha was kind enough to leave us a list of things to do and places to see, which was so helpful with choosing where to eat, etc. We fell in love with her home, the neighborhood and the weather and cannot wait to come back. I would definitely stay here again. 
20776	1961671	10.0	10.0	39911558	This house was lovely. Very clean and more than enough room for 4 people. Beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Must be prepared to love and care for cats. 15 minute ride from downtown via Lyft. Walking distance to adorable Madrona shops and restaurants. 
20777	1961671	10.0	10.0	40734794	This was a terrific house at a terrific location! The house is beautiful and clean. We couldn't have found a better location for entertaining our friends from Spain. I would highly recommend this location for your next stay in Seattle.
20778	1961671	10.0	10.0	41953777	Great Air BNB experience.  Sasha made us feel right at home, the house was great, and we loved the neighborhood and location.  
20779	1961671	10.0	10.0	45384006	We absolutely loved Sasha's house. I rented the house for my wedding week and had my best friend and sister stay there with me. The place is very spacious and clean and has pretty much anything you'd need. We cooked dinner a few nights, were able to do laundry and not to mention the neighborhood is cute, safe and close to some yummy restaurants. They had a great backyard which I wish I could have used to between being busy with the wedding and the crazy rain, we just admired from the deck. (:  
20780	1961671	10.0	10.0	45926641	This is a wonderful home, gracious host, and above expectations!  Home is clean, comfortable, and it is in a great neighborhood.  Highly recommend staying here!

20782	1961671	10.0	10.0	49458743	Great host! Sasha was communicative and very helpful for giving us tips and place recommendations. The house was so charming, clean, and cozy! It was a pleasure to stay with their cuddly and friendly 2 cats! 
20783	1961671	10.0	10.0	55283770	The house is awesome and comfortable. And it is really easy to find. My friends and I had a good time in it.
20784	1961671	10.0	10.0	57642405	Wow this was an amazing home. Incredibly cool hosts with the best cats of all time. So happy I was able to go to this home 
21478	7037291	10.0	9.0	42044033	It is a very nice place. I can hardly any shortages. It is definitely a valuable and leisured place even for long time vacation. 
21479	7037291	10.0	9.0	43286770	"Great Guy, Great environment, really feel like home, I had one week there and felt I was there for a long time, just really worth book with him if you are going to get a room through Airbnb in seattle downtown area.


"
21480	7037291	10.0	9.0	43680330	A charming home surrounded by an absolutely beautiful garden area. The location was perfect for me while I worked downtown for a few days. Although, my schedule didn't allow for me to meet Doug in person, his welcome notebook and hand written post-it-note made me feel at home from the start. The personal towel bar, the robe and the toiletry kit added a nice personal touch. 
21481	7037291	10.0	9.0	44175814	"I am sorry to comment late. I stayed there from on 20, Aug until 23 Aug with my friend.
He was very friendly and gave some tips so that we could travel perfectly. Even though he was absent when I arrived in his home, he made a guide book that made guests easy to read the rule.  
The location was so convinient that we could go around well-known landmark. The bus stop for downtown where it took just 2min by walk was right behind his house, so to get to downtown it takes just 10min. Also, the room was same with the room in the picture. it was so cozy room and quiet guests could sleep fast. Bathroom was very clean so if even women stay his house, it will never happen that they complain.   Avobe all things, what I striked my fancy was his personality. he was very kind and repectful to guests everytime.
I really appreciate Mr. Doug making our awesome trip!
"
21482	7037291	10.0	9.0	44356153	Doug's home was lovely. This was our first time doing a single room with a shared bath. We've always rented an entire home, but our stay was less than 12 hours so it didn't make sense. This was a great experience. I think staying in someones home makes the stay cozy and warm. Doug corresponded with us prior to our arrival to make sure he was home when we arrived. We ended up arriving late evening, there was plenty of street parking. He took the time to sit and chat with us and made sure we had everything we needed. The bed was divine, he had set up a luggage stand in the closet and offered kimonos as robes. His whole house was filled with beautiful Asian art. We hope next time we have time to enjoy his beautiful garden, he's a landscape architect. We will definitely stay with him again.
21483	7037291	10.0	9.0	44470768	Wonderful stay! Doug was so flexible with our arrival time and very accommodating. Close location to downtown! Comfortable bed and such a nice place!
21484	7037291	10.0	9.0	44696417	We enjoyed our brief stay on King St. It's an  interesting home with unique art and a fanatastic outdoor space.    Doug is very knowledgeable about the area and the helped with suggestions about dining and our upcoming trip to Olymipic National Park.  Will definitely stay there again.  Thanks Doug!
21485	7037291	10.0	9.0	44823773	Great room with a really comfortable bed.  Doug and his niece were both really warm and welcoming and gave us great tips to explore around the city.
21486	7037291	10.0	9.0	45129614	Could not have been a better experience. Doug was a great guy - friendly and accommodating. The room was great - clean, comfortable and had everything I needed.  
21487	7037291	10.0	9.0	45400100	Sweet house. Doug is a good and responsible owner. But the location is a little far from the transportation,especially for us no driving visitors.
21488	7037291	10.0	9.0	46297341	"My boyfriend and I stayed at Doug's for 7 days. It was great! Doug wasn't there, unfortunately, but let us know with time and left very detailed directions on how everything worked. He also left very helpful suggestions for travel around the city. Doug's niece Havala was extremely nice and accommodating during our stay. 

If we ever head back to Seattle, we'd love to stay here again. "
21489	7037291	10.0	9.0	46908677	"Simply awesome. We loved the house for its beautiful furniture, the neighborhood for its safety and relative ease to everything. We practically walked to the international district each day!
Great host, will definitely return."
21490	7037291	10.0	9.0	47840259	We spent the weekend at Doug's house. It is a very beautiful house with a stunning garden! We didn't have a car so the location was great because it was only a 20 minute walk to King Station and then it was a short bus ride into downtown. Although our time was short, we really enjoyed the house. The room very clean and comfortable!--Doug is a very kind person! He was also very helpful and knows many great places to eat! I recommend staying here and if we do get the chance we will come back.
21491	7037291	10.0	9.0	48905849	"Doug and his niece were extremely gracious. Starting with spiting their dinner with me on arrival (really considerate as I'd bee traveling for 40 odd hours at that stage). Very nice family - nice to chat to when they were around but with plenty of space around the house also. ....word of advice though don't gem em baked good to return the favor. They're literally and figuratively allergic. :-D

In terms of the house it's really well maintained in an established area. Really surprisingly close to downtown considering how quiet it was. I walked down to a Sea-hawks game one day and was there in less than 15 minutes. So have to say a superb location for that and heading into the heart of downtown. Nice Vietnamese and Chinese restaurants around too.

Basically superb host in a really convenient and surprisingly quiet part of Seattle.

21492	7037291	10.0	9.0	49990296	"I had a wonderful experience in Seattle and Doug's home was a big part of it!  His place was even better than I imagined. The home was beautiful, clean and inviting. The room was neat and cozy! I loved the bed! It was so comfortable that I spent the first hour of my day just laying in it not wanting to get up. 

The gardens around the house were beautiful! I loved sitting outside and relaxing in the yard. 

The neighborhood was very cool! It was in a very diverse area of the city and it literally took me 15 minutes to walk downtown. 

Doug was also very friendly and great to talk to when we did run into one another.

I plan on visiting Seattle again and would love to stay in Doug's place when I do. 

"
21493	7037291	10.0	9.0	50112989	Nous sommes restés une nuit chez Doug. Le quartier est très sympa et proche des transports en commun pour rejoindre le centre de Seattle. Doug est disponible et répond à toutes les questions rapidement. La chambre est propre et Doug met à disposition serviettes de toilette. Le petit bémol est le manque d'isolation de la fenêtre qui laisse passer tous les bruits extérieurs et le froid.
21494	7037291	10.0	9.0	50633271	Excellent room and location to downtown. Host was incredibly accommodating and helpful. We had lots of privacy and felt very welcome to come and go as we please. I did not meet Doug in person as he was away during our stay but he was able to be reached easily if I would've had a problem. Neighborhood is safe and bed is comfortable! I highly recommend this place.  It is well worth your money!
21495	7037291	10.0	9.0	51135208	Perfect!  Great location, sweet house with lots of interest. Very comfortable and enjoyable. 
21496	7037291	10.0	9.0	51410529	The room was great! Had everything we needed, very comfortable and welcoming. The bed was extremely comfortable. All around a great stay and  location!
21497	7037291	10.0	9.0	52943515	I was in need of a place to stay on Halloween night. I booked the room just a couple of days a head of time and Doug was very quick to respond and provide all the needed information to enjoy my stay.  I arrived in the late evening to pick up keys. I returned to the house after midnight, was able to enter the house with no problems, outside was well lit and there was enough light in the house to easily navigate my way through. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. I was able to easily find towels and use the bathroom in the morning. I had packed enough, but there were extra toiletries if needed. I left the house at about 9am feeling well rested and ready to go. Great first time experience using AirBNB and would recommend this location to friends visiting Seattle.
21498	7037291	10.0	9.0	53316093	The host canceled this reservation 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
21499	7037291	10.0	9.0	54045967	The King Street Retreat was excellent.  Very comfortable and clean.  It felt very much like a home away from home. 
21931	7429207	10.0	8.0	43974640	Brilliant host. Very easy to deal with and made us feel very welcome. The house itself was beautiful. 
23154	708774	10.0	10.0	3082551	As advertised, a clean very central apartment with all the amenities provided.  A bargain at the price.  Quiet, comfortable with good and easy parking.  All instructions were clear and the building was everything advertised and more.  I would stay here again without hesitation.
23155	708774	10.0	10.0	3186563	Apartment was very clean - exactly as pictured.  Great location!  Easy parking, walking distance to convenience store, coffee shops and restaurants.  Short drive to nearly all areas of interest. If looking at the map and nervous about being so close to the highway, don't be!  During our 8 day stay, we never heard the highway (or any noise from the neighbors).
23156	708774	10.0	10.0	4010334	Apartment was just as advertised and worked well for our family of four. Location is only a few blocks from the east side of Lake Union- a great neighborhood for walks and runs. We never met our host, but William was quick to respond to any questions we had and went out of his way to return some items we'd accidentally left behind.
23157	708774	10.0	10.0	4885950	"We had an excellent stay on William's property.  The home is in incredible condition, and it looks EXACTLY the way it does in the photos, which we really appreciated.  William was very responsive and easy to communicate with.  All instructions regarding our stay (regarding parking, internet use, location of keys, etc.) were extremely clear and accurate.  
All of the appliances / amenities are brand new/great condition, and the home has everything one might need.  It was very easy to feel right at home here during our stay.  
Also, location of the apartment within Seattle is fantastic for those who are trying to experience a fun, convenient authentic Seattle neighborhood."
23158	708774	10.0	10.0	6430083	Very well appointed and in a great location for exploring the Capital Hill area. Although close to the freeway, you can't hear car traffic unless the windows are open. Easy on and off I-5. Clean and cozy with everything you need for a long weekend!
23159	708774	10.0	10.0	7185983	The apartment is great. Perfectly clean and lovely style. We did not meet William but he has a very simple method to let you in and fulls the house with small details to make your stay great!
23160	708774	10.0	10.0	7895803	My friends and I stayed for a long weekend for a wedding and we could not have been more comfortable! Very clean, private, and well appointed with amenities without being too cluttered with stuff. Conveniently located near stores, restaurants, and public transit. There was also plenty of off-street parking though we didn't have a car. William was very helpful and professional. I preferred staying here immensely over getting a tiny hotel room and would definitely stay again upon my next trip to Seattle. 
23161	708774	10.0	10.0	9185827	My mom and I stayed here for a week while we were in town apartment-hunting for my relocation to the area. This apartment was everything that the posting and the reviews indicated and was the perfect spot for us to stay. Arrival information was great, and it was easy to get access to the apartment. It is incredibly clean and nicely decorated. It is a garden-level apartment, but we heard almost no noise from outside. It was super-convenient to get around town, and had easy access to I-5.  We had my car, and there was always a place to park onsite, so we never had to search for parking.  We did not take the bus while we were there, but it is only two blocks away.  It had all of the necessary components to make us feel at home for the week, and we were sorry to have to leave. Thanks for letting us stay!
23162	708774	10.0	10.0	9293145	The apartment looked EXACTLY the way it is shown in the pictures.  It was very clean and nice and my mother, who is the harshest critic of cleanliness, was perfectly content. .  And even though it is very close to I-5, you cannot hear the traffic.  The only issue we had was the upstairs neighbors who played loud music until 12:30 AM on Friday and Saturday night-- that being said, it was the weekend. During the week, there was not a noise issue.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again. 
23163	708774	10.0	10.0	10654250	I stayed at this garden level apartment for 1 month while I looked for a permanent home in Seattle (just moved to the city).  It was a perfect location, super clean and looked EXACTLY like the pictures.  William responded to any questions within minutes and was very helpful.  Parking was easy and walking to public transit took less than 5mins.  Would definitely recommend this place!
23164	708774	10.0	10.0	10746024	We had a great stay in this cool and comfy apartment. The apartment felt very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the location was ideal for getting around the city.  Parking was fairly convenient when a spot was open on the property. The only drawback we found was the loud music that the upstairs neighbor played late into the night on the weekends. That, and the smell of smoke upon entering the apartment building. Luckily, the apartment itself always smelled fresh and clean, and for that we were thankful! We would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for an affordable and clean place to rest your head while in Seattle! 
23165	708774	10.0	10.0	11246253	"Phenominal stay!   A++++ accommodations.  William is the perfect host by providing lots of information before, during, and after the stay. The apartment is FULLY equiped (kitchen and bathroom too!), and I was not lacking any creature comforts.  The apartment was also pristine and incredibly clean.   The pictures are spot on and no exaggeration.  It was extremely quiet at all hours of the day and night, and the neighbors were friendly (if I saw anyone at all).  Since there are only 4 apartments, it is extremely private.

The location is perfect as it is walking distance to the water, great restaurants for any meal, and a market.  It is located just over a bridge to UW and Seattle is a 10 minute ride by car or public transportation. Off street parking was available at all times, but William generously even provided a parking pass for on street parking if needed.

I cannot thank William enough for making my trip to Seattle memorable!!  :-)"
23166	708774	10.0	10.0	11709701	We had a great stay, great ovation in Seattle.
23167	708774	10.0	10.0	13061392	"The apartment was exactly as described, very clean, well furnished and a great place. William left lots of information about the neighborhood/city if you're not familiar with the area. We lived just a stones throw from this apartment for 6 years and it was great to be back in the 'hood. As one other reviewer said, on the weekend you could here neighbors play music which wasn't a big deal for us at all; wassn't that loud. We were also impressed that there was no noise from the 5 freeway which is what we would have expected. We had a terrific stay and look forward to staying here again in the future!

23168	708774	10.0	10.0	13508875	This lake union apartment was amazing. It's in a great location, close walk to a mini park on the water, amazing cafés, a mountain bike park under i5, close to Capitol Hill and more. The apartment was clean and cute and exactly as advertised. I would rent this apartment again in a heart beat. The Murano glass Italian light fixture was beautiful!
23169	708774	10.0	10.0	14530978	Cool and comfy is right! The apartment was private, clean, well stocked and easily accessible. It's a great place to use as a home base while in Seattle for pleasure or business. William was prompt with all his communications and provided detailed and efficient information on everything the area had to offer and any questions that may arise. 
23170	708774	10.0	10.0	14842940	Easy to check in and in a great location.  The place was clean, comfortable and as described in the overview.  Internet worked great and I had no problem logging in.  The only drawback is it's location on the basement level makes it a little loud in the morning while upstairs tenants are leaving.
23171	708774	10.0	10.0	16452826	Coordinating the reservation of this great apartment was seamless and easy. William provided great details to me, making check-in breeze. I didn't need anything throughout my stay, but if I had, I'm confident the host would've been of great assistance. The location of the apartment was wonderful. Close to great restaurants, safe neighborhood, some convenient stores close by, and close to a bus stop. And when I mean close, I mean within a 5-10 minute walk! The apartment itself was clean, comfortable and welcoming. Another plus for us was having a washer and dryer, since we were traveling with a baby. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great place to stay in Seattle!
23172	708774	10.0	10.0	18875193	I loved this place! Extremely clean and well maintained. Property looks just like the photos. I received an email with all the information I needed and no issues accessing the property. It's very close to I5, which is convenient, but it made no noise issues either. I will definitely stay here again. 
23173	708774	10.0	10.0	19201020	"William made us feel welcome on our trip and gave a lot of good information about local attractions, restaurantes, cafes and bars. The listing was accurate and the place was just as pictured. It was indeed cool and comfy and a great location close to a lot of different things to do in Seattle. 

The neighborhood was close enough to the downtown area to take a longer walk or short bus ride. The apartment was in a very nice quiet neighborhood close to lake union. A great place to walk around and explore or take a short bus, uber, lyft, car2go ride to surrounding neigborhoods like Fremont, Capitol Hill and the University area. "
23174	708774	10.0	10.0	22228447	I stayed here for a month and was completely happy with my decision! Everything worked perfectly, the apartment was quiet and peaceful, and I enjoyed using the kitchen, which was well stocked with utensils, pots/pans, etc. There's lots of storage in the bedroom, which is really helpful for longer stays. When a maintenance issue arose, William was on it and it was fixed in a matter of hours. I enjoyed the neighborhood and the easy commute to work in the SLU neighborhood. Totally satisfied and would definitely return. I also appreciated the detailed instructions received well in advance about all the aspects of the apartment, how to get in, and parking. A+
23175	708774	10.0	10.0	23207434	My husband and I needed to spend 12 days in Seattle, we could not have asked for a better place to stay! The location was perfect for us as it was less than 10 minutes from the places we needed to be. The neighborhood was perfect, quiet, great food and drinks. Everything about the apartment was as listed on the website, very comfortable , clean and parking was never an issue(huge plus). We will stay here again anytime we are in Seattle.
23176	708774	10.0	10.0	23428192	This is a great apartment in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. Close to downtown and easy to get around via public transit. Voxx Coffee down the street is great.

He helped us and even allowed us to stay a tad longer so we didn't have to wait in a coffee shop a whole afternoon for our flight!!! I had the chance to meet him when we were about to leave and William was very very nice! We really enjoyed the apartment and you can't beat the location! We took the bus every day to go downtown but we also walked there it was fabulous! Highly recommend it

An overall perfect experience! "

It was a great place for me to stay on a business trip, but would have been large enough for a couple, too. William provided all of the information I needed, and it was easy to check in and out on my own. The building was quiet.

Eastlake is a great neighborhood with plenty of food options within walking distance. Make sure to take a walk along the lake!"
23182	708774	10.0	10.0	33381923	The apartment was exactly as advertised. It was very clean upon arrival. The neighborhood is close enough to everything and has a quiet, residential feel.

23183	708774	10.0	10.0	33807702	Great apartment, exactly as advertised - modern, stylish and in superb condition. Was an excellent base for trips to downtown Seattle and UW, with regular bus routes on the doorstep. Some really good coffee / food at the cafes nearby in Eastlake too.

23190	708774	10.0	10.0	42864733	We had a great time staying at William's Eastlake apartment in Seattle! He was extremely diligent, organized, and responsive with all our communication, plus shared some great recommendations that helped make our first visit to Seattle really memorable. The place was exactly as advertised - really clean, comfortable, cozy, and cutely decorated. Very true to the pictures. The location was also great. Eastlake neighborhood is cute with a couple of great spots for coffee and brunch, and a very short drive to all the fun stuff in Capitol Hill and downtown. Would definitely consider staying there again and would highly recommend to others. 
23191	708774	10.0	10.0	43752231	"A truly superb holiday apartment. It had everything we needed for our stay.  Location was brilliant - so close to the lake. Coffee shop a short walk away was a pleasant stop off.
Arrival instructions were brilliant- they left nothing to chance!
Would always want  stay here when visit Seattle. 
Thank you for having us "
23192	708774	10.0	10.0	45271009	William's place was just as described: clean and comfortable, not to mention thoughtfully laid out and conveniently located. The place itself was immaculate and tastefully furnished. William thought to provide all the little things including toiletries, condiments, coffee, tea and even Tupperware! This was my first airbnb experience and staying here left a great first impression. William was very responsive and provided all the information we needed for our stay. All in all a perfect stay in Seattle.
23193	708774	10.0	10.0	46139140	Beautiful apartment. Very clean. The instructions William provided were great. We really appreciated the list of restaurants that were in walking distance. We found the bed a little uncomfortable for our taste- a bit squeaky- but everything else was great! The location was quiet and safe and close to everything we wanted to see. Kitchen was fully stocked which came in handy when we heated up some leftovers! 
23194	708774	10.0	10.0	48931552	Fantastic  !!! Immaculate apartment , lovely neighborhood . I enjoyed this more than a hotel stay . My only other experience with air bnb was a terrible one , so I was wary of trying again. All of the hotels in the area were booked , so I had no choice but to try (website hidden) thankful I did ! The place was clean , new , and centrally located . It was even better than pictured. Extremely comfortable bed , roomy living room and kitchen , all complete with necessary amenities. William was the perfect host - quick to respond and extremely helpful before our stay , and left us alone to enjoy our time while we were there . Would stay here again in a heartbeat , and am now looking forward to other air bnb experiences . 
23195	708774	10.0	10.0	49322704	"I could not recommend this place enough! Bill was great to work with and the place was fantastic. We could tell that there had been a lot of care and thoughtfulness put into the amenities, instructions, communication, and design- it was really perfect for guests.  We did not have any issues with noise or the upstairs neighbors as other reviewers had mentioned.

Our favorite part was the location! After spending each day in the city and/or high traffic tourist spots, it was so refreshing to escape to a slightly quieter and less congested feeling location. We loved that we could still walk to coffee, dinner, drinks, etc where we were staying- the neighborhood was great! And, while we enjoyed being away from the busier areas, we loved the close proximity to everything we wanted to do. We were easily able to walk to get to downtown each day.

Highly recommend!"
23196	708774	10.0	10.0	50188229	"The listing was just as described. The instructions for finding the unit were perfect. The location was great for short Uber rides to downtown or any other district in the Seattle area. I loved the layout, cleanliness, and attention to detail of the apartment and would love to stay there again. The kitchen was amazing and great for buying groceries to prepare meals to save a couple bucks during your stay. William even provided a parking pass which was perfect for my sister to come visit. On top of that William went to the trouble of providing a great list of local (walking distance) eatery's and a great ""to see"" guide.  Thank you so much William!!"

23199	708774	10.0	10.0	54643498	The place was just as described and it was spotless. Check in was super easy and the stay was great. William was very accommodating. 
23200	708774	10.0	10.0	54970992	The photos for this listing are very accurate. The place was clean, in a great location, and very quiet at night. Only a 5-10 minute walk to South Lake Union. I would definitely rent again and recommend to friends and family. Overall very satisfied. 
24973	7324993	10.0	10.0	49273835	Bryan was an amazing host and his place is great. I was in Seattle for a week for business and after a long day at work, coming back to his home with a beautiful view was the perfect way to end the day. Bryan was also very attentive, checking up on me throughout my stay, and was quick to answer any question I had. I will definitely reach out to Bryan again when I'm in Seattle. I highly  recommend. 
24974	7324993	10.0	10.0	51174328	Listing description was very accurate. Key was at coffee shop couple blocks away. Worked great
24975	7324993	10.0	10.0	52138342	Bryan was a great host, very accommodating and responsive. His apartment was clean and centrally located. 
24976	7324993	10.0	10.0	52448848	Bryan's apartment is great. I was in town for work and it was a great place to spend a couple quiet nights. It's a great modern building, the apartment is comfy and it comes with a wonderful view - especially from the roof! Check in and out were seamless and convenient. Bryan was totally helpful with all, including an evening text to get wireless access. I look forward to staying again for work or pleasure.
24977	7324993	10.0	10.0	53694097	"While I would not describe the apartment as ""luxury"", it was adequate and the location and views from the apt and especially the roof more than compensated for any lack of luxury. We spent evenings on the roof even in November as there are several overhead heaters and a fire pit. Public transportation was great from this location, amenities were nearby. We (baby boomers) enjoyed being in the midst of an international group of millenniums who were very friendly. We felt the whole experience was great."
24978	7324993	10.0	10.0	54376573	Lovely view.  Great location.  Be aware that third person will sleep on a couch.  No Cable TV, but free internet.  Clean and Pleasant.
24979	7324993	10.0	10.0	54657830	Great location. Very easy to get to and a quick walk to the places that we wanted to go. The rooftop was also great with views of the city and space needle. The space is small and cozy but we'll appointed and modern looking. Definitely a great place to stay.
24980	7324993	10.0	10.0	54899118	"This was my first time and Seattle so finding a good location to stay was important.  The apartment was safe, secure, clean, quiet and comfortable.  The view outside the living room room is wonderful, only to be outdone by the amazing rooftop garden/patio.  Location was ideal; a short walk to the Space Needle, Lake Union, Pike's Place, and numerous bars, restaurants, and coffee shops literally outside the building.  We opted not to rent a car and used uber for our ""longer"" trips (20 minute ride from Sea-Tac, five minutes to Queen Anne's).  When we did need to rent a car, there was a Budget Car Rental Location a TWO minute walk away. Communication with Bryan was seamless, simple and excellent!  Next time in Seattle, I will be staying here again!  "
24981	7324993	10.0	10.0	55089062	"Despite it being a holiday weekend, Bryan made a point of being available for questions and assistance. The location is amazing. It's within walking distance of literally anything you'd want to see in DT Seattle. Anything else is a short taxi or bus ride. We especially liked that it was minutes to the Space Needle area. We had tickets to a play there and enjoyed the walk both to and from the venue.

The view is fantastic, just as the picture conveys. It was lovely seeing this view both in the day and at night. What a treat.

The location could feel sketchy for some people. It's located pretty close to what maybe a halfway house or something like that. There were plenty of people walking around who might be living there. We felt safe though and even interacted with other people who were friendly and appeared to live nearby. You should know there is no off-street parking and most on street parking is metered all hours of the day I believe. That was an unfortunate surprise.

As far as the apartment is concerned, it's far from ""luxury"". Our biggest challenge was with the bed. The bed is not at all comfortable. It's one of those Scandinavian designs with the slats underneath supporting a very, very thin mattress. The slats kept falling out from the railing, causing the super-thin mattress to sag. The pillows were equally bad, giving no head support. All of the furniture in this place follows this trend: uncomfortable and cheap.  

A powerful aroma not unlike cologne dominates the lobby area. In the apartment itself, two ""fragrance balls"" located at the front door fills the apartment with a strong perfume smell. If you're smell-sensitive, you may want to put these balls in a plastic bag, which we did. There is a large TV in the apartment, and an internet connection, but nothing else. We were unable to figure out how to watch anything. Although you can navigate on the TV (using the remote) to the Internet, there is no keyboard on the remote so you can't log in to your favorite service. Nor could we figure out how to stream from our computers to the big screen. We felt this lack of usability was a major tease.

As a result of the poor sleep we had the first night, and everything else described above, we decided to bag our stay and move to a luxury hotel, with a killer bed, and suite-size room, which we got super cheap because it was Thanksgiving weekend. Despite the wonderful view and perfect location, we will not be staying here again, unless the problems detailed above are resolved."
24982	7324993	10.0	10.0	55438779	Loved the condo! Great location - we really enjoyed Belltown. Getting around by walking or Uber was a breeze. Bryan has a Magic Bullet in the kitchen which is a great idea. The views were wonderful! Very clean place, perfect size for two people! Great restaurants nearby. Loved it! So impressed with KeyCafe. Picking up and dropping off key was a breeze, and the cafe has great lattes! I have already highly recommended Bryan's condo to everyone! 
24983	7324993	10.0	10.0	55770628	The room was great and had an incredible view! It was very very clean and comfortable. The location is great within lots of restaurants and bars near by, plus downtown is only a couple minute walk. I will always try to stay here when coming to Seattle. 
24984	7324993	10.0	10.0	56393333	Bryan's condo was even better than we expected! The photos do not do that view justice. He made it very easy to pick up the keys at our convenience and even arranged an early check-in for us. He was very responsive to our questions and very helpful throughout our stay. Will definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle! Thank you Bryan! 
25039	7035498	10.0	10.0	39890160	The place is flawless.  Super convenient and close to tons of interesting parts of Seattle.   I would definitely recommend it, my one reservation was that there was a management company handling the property which required a complicated agreement in addition to airbnb and dealing with them was a bit impersonal.  I understand I was the first stay so maybe they will be able to work that out.  
25040	7035498	10.0	10.0	40181569	The studio was very clean and comfortable and most importantly close to everthing!
25041	7035498	10.0	10.0	41006288	John was a very helpful host and quick to respond. The studio was very clean when we arrived. It was exactly as advertised: close to the major landmarks of Seattle, spacious yet cozy, and clean. There's a Whole Foods close by and if you want to take public transportation, especially to explore the other neighborhoods of Seattle, there are many bus routes that stop within a block and Westlake station is just a 10 min walk.
25042	7035498	10.0	10.0	41467698	The place was nice. It's a cool older building (not really old, just compared to some of the newer stuff popping up in Seattle). The location & neighborhood is great!
25043	7035498	10.0	10.0	41675725	We loved the house! It was set in a peaceful area of town but only a short drive to a small market and pub. We would definitely stay there again! 
25044	7035498	10.0	10.0	42442923	My wife and I greatly enjoyed our stay in this jewel of an apartment.  The location was perfect; situated about half a mile south of the Needle and in the midst of several good restaurants. There is a small grocery store nearby and a donut/coffee shop next door -whether that temptation is a good thing depends on your level of self control :) the unit itself had everything we needed: a kitchen,  washing machine,  nice bathroom,  sizeable closet (with wooden hangers! ), and comfortable bed. Netflix and free wifi were a nice touch as well.  John was a great host.  He responded promptly to every request and was extremely helpful. We look forward to our next stay in this jewel box!
25045	7035498	10.0	10.0	42633181	"John and the ""Jewel Box"" were a true gem, Being a hotelier this was my first AIRBNB and the city was full and overpriced. The studio was comfortable, clean and secure. The location is prime. Thanks John and Jewel Box."
25046	7035498	10.0	10.0	42937610	Everything was described. A perfect location for all we wanted to do. Walked to a Hawks game. Restaurant choices galore. Absolute pleasure. 
25047	7035498	10.0	10.0	43661430	"A great place to stay while visiting Seattle! Very central location downtown. Plenty of cool places to go nearby for food and drink. Walking distance to the Space Needle / museums and also the aquarium / Pike Place / the ferry.

The apartment was plenty big for my gf and I. More affordable than all the hotel rooms we looked at as well.

Clean, quiet...we'd stay here again!"
25048	7035498	10.0	10.0	43842476	The studio is ideally located and was very clean. I had a nice stay.
25049	7035498	10.0	10.0	44561834	John was an amazing host who answered all emails promptly. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location. This was our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't be happier with our hosts and the apartment. Thank you for making our Seattle stay such a  great one! 
25050	7035498	10.0	10.0	45117597	I really enjoyed staying there. There were everything that we needed. There were manuals about the house and I could find everything that I wanted to use easily. 
25051	7035498	10.0	10.0	45711768	"The Jewel Box was sweet, emaculately clean and well appointed and in a hip neighborhood. It looked just like it did in the Airbnb photos and was close to great restaurants and the ferries. John thoughtfully left a welcoming note and a basket of snacks to enjoy.  These were really lovely touches. 

Also, the Jewel Box is on the ground floor so it made getting in and out with luggage easy. 

My two recommendations are if you're a light sleeper bring an eye mask, and *make sure* to read the instructions for getting into the Jewel Box before arriving. It is an elaborate entry process and not one you want to figure out tired and late at night. 

Also, the third party hospitality manager who manages this property has a 24 hour customer service line. If you call and get disconnected a couple times, keep trying. The customer service representatives are helpful and have good customer management skills, like patience."
25052	7035498	10.0	10.0	46291011	This could not have been a better location for us. We were able to walk everywhere and it was a real pleasure to be without a car. The space is well appointed and beautifully decorated. There are clever details everywhere, including cell phone and iPad connectors inthe bedside drawer. The kitchen has all the right equipment for food preparation and service. We didn't really feel the need to cook with all the fine restaurant fare nearby, but it's all there in the kitchen-- plus washer/dryer and dishwasher. The generous closet accommodated all our luggage and provided enough hangers and space for our stay. We were so comfortable that we could easily enjoyed this space for a month or two!
25053	7035498	10.0	10.0	46835634	So incredible! Best stay I've had yet at an Airbnb :) went above and beyond-- the place was perfectly clean and was right next to my favorite donut shop! Surprisingly quiet at night for being so centrally located!
25054	7035498	10.0	10.0	47287507	What a great place to stay in Seattle! John's studio is carefully and thoughtfully designed to give you a really comfortable, home-away-from-home experience. Though it's a studio, we never felt like space was tight. Loved the location, though I won't ever admit how many times I went next door for donuts. 
25055	7035498	10.0	10.0	47986886	"My husband and I had a lovely few days staying at The Jewel Box. Perfectly and centrally situated on 5th Ave, it was a pleasant stroll to Pike Place Market (10 minutes). Lots to see and do in the immediate neighborhood - great restaurants, bars, and shops. Also very close to the Space Needle. 

The condo itself is in a nice, clean, and quite block. We rarely heard any of the neighbors. It felt safe and secure. The condo has everything you need - comfy bed, bathroom essentials, kitchen is fully stocked. John also had some nice touches - a welcome card, some coffee in the freezer, and some snack foods on the kitchen counter. Perfect! 

Everything was organized and spotless. The instruction binder had everything you could need for your stay in the condo, including step-by-step instructions for washer/dryer, Internet, if issues who to contact. 

We had a few questions while in Seattle. Pillow and John were very responsive and helpful. We loved Seattle, love The Jewel Box, and will be back for sure. Recommend The Jewel Box, 100%, without any reservations. Thanks John!"
25056	7035498	10.0	10.0	49067917	I spent 2 nights at the Jewel Box, and it was exactly as advertised and exactly what I was looking for -- very nice accommodations and very conveniently located. There was even a bountiful basket of snacks and goodies and handwritten welcome note, which made it feel like coming home. You will hear some city noise even though the windows do not face the street, but that comes with being in the city and was never a problem. No complaints, I would happily stay there again.
25057	7035498	10.0	10.0	49301272	"This space is located in a great neighborhood within walkable distance of both the Space Needle and Pike Place market (we walked to both while we stayed there).  There is a Top Pot coffee and doughnut shop right next door and other restaurants and small grocery stores within 2 blocks.  The space is arranged efficiently with all the amenities you might need.

Our reservation was accepted quickly and professionally and the entire process went very smoothly.  The place was very clean when we arrived with a very well organized and helpful guidebook along with plenty of maps and guides for out-of-towners like ourselves.

We were glad we chose this location and would recommend it to anyone else looking for a great place to stay in Seattle."
25058	7035498	10.0	10.0	49794810	The place was great.  Seemed brand new.  Very clean.  Plenty of room.       Great location-walked to everything-such as Seahawks game, Elliott Bay on Fuget Sound to ride the ferry to Bainbridge; Pike Place Market; Chihuly Art Exhibit, etc.  John was awesome too!  We had a small issue that was mainly due to my mechanical incompetence and John handled it promptly and then followed with a very kind gesture to my wife and I.  We recommend this place highly.  Thanks John!!!!
25059	7035498	10.0	10.0	50892803	"The rental was clean and convenient. The hosts provided coffee, snacks, and a welcome card written specifically for us.  In addition, the hosts had a binder of great info about the apartment, what to do, where to go, and what to eat. We felt comfortable the moment we settled in. The website provided simple and easy instructions for getting into the rental, checking out, and even helpful tips for parking. We had a great time in Seattle, made even better by the hospitality John showed us. 
Thanks John!"
25060	7035498	10.0	10.0	51166120	John was a great host.  There was a hand-written note for us when we arrived.  He left some snacks for us since he knew we were getting in late.  The apartment is exactly as described.  The neighborhood is perfect fore exploring downtown Seattle and Belltown.  Would definitely recommend. 
25061	7035498	10.0	10.0	51444551	"John was an excellent host. The Jewel Box was a great, fun little space from which to easily explore Seattle on foot. Highly recommended!!

And the lite treat basket was a lovely surprise. Thanks, John. "
25062	7035498	10.0	10.0	51723658	How happy we were to find the Jewel Box situated close to the Seattle Center and downtown shopping. It made walking pleasant and convenient. We loved our ride on the monorail from shopping to Seattle Center. Great restaurants, pastry shops, the Cinerama and a wine/cheese shop were all within a block. The apartment was in beautiful condition, clean, well-maintained and comfy.  The kitchen is well-equipped and the bathroom perfect. Truly, we wanted for nothing during our stay. Thanks, John!
25063	7035498	10.0	10.0	52525757	"Our experience at  "" The Jewel Box"" was relaxing, amazing and fun.  The location of this property is centrally located to Seattle's ""Best"" things to do! The eateries in the area are beyond delicious. The host leaves recommendations in the manual and they are all spot on. I suggest walking and exploring the neighborhood in all directions so many places to grab tea and treats. 

My only suggestion would be bigger bath towels and a mat when stepping out of the shower as you stepping on to tile. 

The other thing was the storage of luggage. The next group doesn't come til 3:00 & that would have been perfect to catch the train for our flight. As the Westin luggage is storage is done at the front desk, not the garage as stated.

We had an excellent time in Seattle and love coming back to ""The Jewel Box"" every evening. "
25064	7035498	10.0	10.0	52878388	I had a great time at the apartment it was nice and clean and everything was in 10 minutes walking!! So much good food and it was awesome.

25066	7035498	10.0	10.0	54454175	This is my second time staying at the Hip Flat and it was the perfect place from which to do my business with Microsoft. About a ten minute stroll to the office and close to easy groceries and good restaurants. The place has everything you need to be comfortable for a week or more. Highly recommend!
25067	7035498	10.0	10.0	54987838	The Jewel Box was wonderful. GREAT location! Everything is within walking distance. The apartment was clean and cozy. John and Pillow were very attentive and made my stay easy. I'd stay there again without a second thought.

25069	7035498	10.0	10.0	58623227	"John's place was the perfect stay for my short trip to Seattle. It's a well cleaned, stocked, and situated little studio right in the middle of everything I wanted to do in Seattle. I was able to walk to most places, which is a big plus for me! 

John was an excellent host with great food suggestions and detailed check in and check out instructions! This unit is on the first floor so occasionally you can hear some noises from the street but between my long days of exploring Seattle and the comfy bed; I barely noticed it. Will definitely try to stay here again when back in Seattle!"
25189	1472532	10.0	10.0	6522160	Just loved this apartment. The building is a brand new construction in the heart of downtown. The apartment looks great and has everything we needed during our stay. The rooftop deck has amazing views of downtown and waterfront. This is an ideal place to stay, if you want to experience Seattle. I stayed in both of Neha's apartments in this building and my experience with Neha was just fantastic.
25190	1472532	10.0	10.0	6572110	"The unit is in a new apartment complex conveniently located in Belltown. Very easy walk to all the top attractions in Seattle. I think we were only the second guests in the unit. It was clean and comfortable but needs ""warming up"" in terms of making it more homey and welcoming and less ""hotel room"" like. I spoke with Neha about this and she said she would be working on it. 

Neha met us and let us into the apartment right on time. 

The complex had a great workout room that we didn't get a chance to use unfortunately but will be a nice plus for thosethat aim for a workout. "
25191	1472532	10.0	10.0	6607344	My wife and I made a last minute reservation with Neha. Her communication is incredible! I would recommend her apartment to anyone looking for a brand new place to stay in a great part of the city. Thanks again Neha!
25192	1472532	10.0	10.0	6695281	"We had a wonderful stay at Neha's apartment in Belltown.  The apartment felt like a luxury hotel room - bright, exceptionally clean, and fully furnished. 

We needed to park our car for the few days we were in Seattle and Neha was very accommodating in arranging a parking spot in the garage. 

The apartment is very close to downtown and Pike's Place.  Some great restaurants in the neighborhood too.

Only downside was that the Hemp Fest was happening while we were in town so it was a tad noisy on Saturday and Sunday night but much quieter on Monday night."
25193	1472532	10.0	10.0	6772792	I loved the Location of This Brand New Apartment. It was Clean and quite. Perfect for my business trip.

Safe and clean. Building managers are very helpful. Great do park across the street for good dog/people watching.
Thanks so much, we had a great time."

25197	1472532	10.0	10.0	7250210	"The location is very convenient and the parking garage is extremely handy since Bell street was closed due to road construction during our stay.  It was very noisy during the weekday, which mean sleeping in wasn't really an option but when it's done, it'll look great! Just bad timing for my trip.     

The apartment is walking distance to a lot of great places to eat, drink, shop, and just hang out.  Roof top deck has nice view of the water, as well as the Space Needle.  The washer/dryer is also a great convenience so you can minimize your packing.

25198	1472532	10.0	10.0	7368949	This apartment worked out great for our family of three!  The building (hence the apartment) are brand new and the apartment is nicely furnished and was very clean and inviting.  While we didn't get a chance to use either, the exercise room is very well appointed with brand new equipment, and the rooftop deck has amazing views with comfortable seating and a couple of gas grills.  True to the listing title, the apartment sits right between Pike Place and the Worlds Fair location (think Space Needle, EMP museum and Chihuly Gardens) and was an easy walk to either location as well as from the Westlake station (the station the airport train ends at).  We arrived by air/train, but on the one day we wanted to get out and explore a bit, there were three ZipCar locations within blocks that had plenty of available vehicles.  To sum it up, it was a great place to stay, Neha was a great host,  and I would highly recommend it to others!
25199	1472532	10.0	10.0	7516147	I really enjoyed this place, great location both for walking and public transport, check in/out was very smooth and the place was exactly as advertised. I would stay here again . . .

25202	1472532	10.0	10.0	8212775	"Great experience in Seattle!  The condo offers all that it suggests and was in a great location for the conference we attended.  The building is new and beautiful.  Its central location near tourist attractions, the pier and the conference center was ideal.    

As for our host, Neha was quite attentive to our requests and put up with a lot of questions early on.  Answers came promptly and concisely with never a concern.  Wifi was great in the room and the utilities were excellent.  Parking was tight, but convenient in the building itself.  

No question, we would stay again at the same place without a second thought."
25203	1472532	10.0	10.0	8381849	The room was really nice and Neha was always available when I had a question or concern. We would definitely stay there once again.
25204	1472532	10.0	10.0	8430033	I had a pleasant stay at this condo. It's very modern in an equally modern building, much is walkable and there are good bars/coffee shops on adjoining streets. Didn't have a chance to take advantage if the rooftop view, which would have been great as the apartment faces a wall if an adjoining building. 
25205	1472532	10.0	10.0	8510158	This was a wonderful place to stay, clean and well kept. Very convenient, and many small stores, convenience markets, and restaurants very close by. Could easily walk to both the Pike Market and Space Needle areas. Highly recommended.
25206	1472532	10.0	10.0	8618022	Awesome, clean apartment in a great downtown location. I would definitely stay here again. 
25207	1472532	10.0	10.0	8648915	This was a great place to stay if you want to be close to Pike Place Market. I chose this place so we could avoid driving much and it was perfect.  The furnishings were very nice. Very comfortable bedding and furniture.  Neha was very helpful with instructions.  I'd certainly do it again!!
25208	1472532	10.0	10.0	8714601	"We had a great extended weekend stay at this condo.  The location was very good: within easy walking distance of downtown and very close to some exceptional restaurants.  In addition, we flew into SeaTac and caught the light rail transit to the end stop and were then about a 5-10 walk to the condo: saved on the cab fair and acquainted us with the neighborhood.  The place itself was clean and very suitable for our needs and accurately represented in the photos. The Belltown area is being revitalized, but some of the seedier aspects can still be experienced - no big issues but you do need to be aware when out after dark :) 

Neha was very helpful and attentive through the whole process and responded to my emails quickly and efficiently.  She was eager to share her ""local"" knowledge, recommending some wonderful places to eat and pointing out the special happy hour deals that could be found.  She was very accommodating to our schedule and arranged for us to drop off our bags before the official check-in.  I would certainly stay here again on a future trip."
25209	1472532	10.0	10.0	8737522	The apartment we stayed in was just as described. Very clean, comfortable, and with great amenities. Having a well priced parking on location was a great addition. Neha was very communicative which made the stay very smooth.
25210	1472532	10.0	10.0	8808547	The place was just as described, centrally located and very clean. Neha was very responsive to all of my questions. The parking garage came in very handy so we didn't have to hunt for parking in downtown Seattle. Great experience overall!
25211	1472532	10.0	10.0	8949610	It was a nice location and we really enjoyed our stay.  I recommend staying here.
25212	1472532	10.0	10.0	9017799	"Neha's place was just perfect for our holiday in Seattle. Check in and access to the building was simple, the listing was super clean and organized, and the view from the roof terrace was breathtaking!

The space was big enough to host my parents for dinner (4 ppl total) and the kitchen was equipped for cooking. We also had access to paid parking, which was a real life-saver given how hard it is to find street parking in Belltown.

Thank you for making our stay so effortless and enjoyable!"

25215	1472532	10.0	10.0	9188493	Neha, was very easy to work with, communicated exceptionally well, and made my stay easy. I had a last minute overnight trip for business and in a very short window Neha worked with me to make the trip effortless. The apartment was very comfortable and had all the amenities I could have hoped for. Compared to what you would pay for 1/3 the space at a hotel in downtown Seattle Neha's place was a bargain. 
25216	1472532	10.0	10.0	9349106	We had a nice nine-day stay at Neha's apartment, which is new and centrally located.  Construction on the street outside made getting in and out a small challenge, but once we figured it out it was fine.  The cozy 5th floor unit is fine for one or a couple, and is well-furnished and comfortable.  We never actually met Neha but she was responsive to emails and a call.  Overall, a very good experience.
25217	1472532	10.0	10.0	9564965	Great place, great location and Neha was a great host. Would definitely stay again. 
25218	1472532	10.0	10.0	9766950	"Neha was very helpful and easy to work with.

There was no toaster in the unit; Neha went out and bought one for me.  Much appreciated!

It's good to know ahead of time that access to the parking is in an alley between 2nd and 3rd off battery. It's an unmarked garage door.  Bell street is closed, so be prepared for that. A good thing, keeps it quiet.
The keylock to get into the building is very unusual.  It's to the left of the door in the wall; a special slot, separate from the standard front door key hole.  I had to call Neha to figure that out after some frustrating minutes.
Overall, a great place-quiet, light, well-furnished.  I'd recommend a dresser for the unit or shelves in the closet at some point for those of us with longer stays.
I hope to stay there again!  Highly recommended."
25219	1472532	10.0	10.0	9810091	"As a host myself, I have to be honest and transparent.
Niha's place was: clean, Ikea modern'ish, and is a STUDIO.

The bed/bedding is of poor quality (both main bed and futon). Amenities in the kitchen are sparse, not even a wine glass. I would also recommend, at a bare minimum, to Niha, 'include soap'.

Overall, Niha's place, represents moderate value. 
"
25220	1472532	10.0	10.0	9858570	Neha was super accommodating for us. The unit was clean, warm and welcoming. We plan on staying here again next time we are in Seattle.

Loved having the Roku box for a relaxing evening after walking around Seattle all day.

The location was perfect - we couldn't have asked for better!"
25223	1472532	10.0	10.0	10192078	I would return to Nehas condo in a minute! Great place to stay and the people were wonderful. And thank you Neha for accommodating us while we waited for our flight. Had an awesome trip. Highly recommend staying here.
25224	1472532	10.0	10.0	10268603	"Neha was a FANTASTIC host.  She was very accommodating and considerate.  For example, I told her I was flying in very very very late and she stayed up to buzz me in at 2AM.  It was also snowing when I was there so she offered to let me check out a little bit later if necessary.  

The apartment is in a great location in a new and modern building with roof access.  Very close to Pike's Place and the Space Needle.  However it is about a 40 minute ride to the airport via cab.  Next time I will try to use their train system to save money on that end, If you have the time I would go that route because the unscheduled cab ride was 50 plus tip.

Anyway, everything you need is inside the house: towels, blankets, extra blankets, extra pillows, shampoo, hair dryer, kitchen utensils, television, wifi, etc.  Like I said, everything you need!

Thank you Neha!  Will be back soon 3"

25227	1472532	10.0	10.0	10504905	Great location to downtown and beyond. On the corner to a coffee shop, mexican restaurant and pub with artisan pizza and craft beer - all non-chain, local establishments! Perfect size for a small family. We'll be back for sure.
25228	1472532	10.0	10.0	10578596	Neha was a very nice host, who didn't mind when I called her directly after the door buzzer call box inadvertently called the wrong host. The place worked very well for my family, even our 6 week old daughter found it perfect. Would recommend this place and stay here again without hesitation. 
25229	1472532	10.0	10.0	10754360	We had a great stay at Sid and Neha's place!  We booked a room with them for two nights after our flight to the east coast got cancelled at the very last minute.  The Instant Book process was simple, quick, and efficient, and Sid was very gracefully on hand to answer our questions about finding/entering the apartment.  The apartment has excellent amenities, is in a safe space, and has a very comfortable bed.  We enjoyed our stay here and felt very much at home.  Would definitely book with Sid and Neha again if we come back to Seattle!  Thanks so much!
25230	1472532	10.0	10.0	10821281	This apartment was brand new and in a great part of town. It suited our needs perfectly! Everything was clean, and it was nice knowing there was a full kitchen available if we needed it. We ended up using the washer/dryer, as it was wet all week in Seattle! Sid & Neha were very prompt with getting back to us with anything we had questions about. Thank you for a great stay!
25231	1472532	10.0	10.0	10918106	The apartment is bright, modern and cozy. Access into the building and lock box was a breeze. The location is great and within walking distance of restaurants and bars. Although we were only at the apartment for one night, we really enjoyed our stay. 
25232	1472532	10.0	10.0	10988301	"We had a great stay at Sid and Neha's place – it was right in the middle of everything and they were even courteous enough to let us check in early when our plans changed. We walked everywhere and didn't miss having a car a bit. 

The toiletries and in-unit washer/dryer were a nice touch for a longer stay in Seattle. Would absolutely stay here again or at another of Sid and Neha's properties!"
25233	1472532	10.0	10.0	11109402	Sid and Neha's apartment is true to the photos and description!  We were looking for a place to stay in which we could get around without a car.  This was perfect for our 3 day visit to Seattle.  We used the lightrail from Seatac to Westlake (last stop), and walked about 10min to the apartment.  Upon arrival we had a bit of a snag getting into the building but we recovered and from there it was smooth.  Our apartment was clean, full of amenities, and well lit with natural sunlight.  There were plenty of extra linens, closet space, and the mattress has a memory foam topper. As for the neighborhood, we were excited to see so many options of great restaurants, coffee shops, bars/lounges, and much more.  Everything was was within a 1-3 block radius.  We enjoyed Bedlams 90's vibe coffee shop accross the street from the apartment building. We also had a great dinner at Local 360 which is one block away.  Sid and Neha recommended some places to get oysters which did not disappoint! Pike Place, City Target, and downtown shopping was also close like everything else.  We did walk to the Chihuly Gardens and Space Needle, all in 15min.  All an easy city walk with no hills!  I highly recommend staying at this apartment if you would like to have a urban experience with Seattle charm! We met so many friendly and helpful locals!  Thank you Sid and Neha!
25234	1472532	10.0	10.0	11131346	"Great location - lots of restaurants within walking distance. We dined at WASABI Bistro & Japanese Lounge and enjoyed loads of fresh sushi during happy hour. After dinner, we spent some time on the rooftop terrace watching the sunset, and the ships glide across the water. 

Starting the moment we walked in the foyer we felt at home. The upbeat music in the bright foyer, fast elevator…

The one bedroom apartment was neat, clean, and comfortable! Sid and Neha thought of everything - simple and tasteful decor, dishes/cooking pans, Seattle-specific magazines, Roku TV, wifi, plush towels and toiletries, comfy bedding with privacy curtains, etc. 

Highly recommend - we will certainly stay here again next time we visit Seattle! "
25235	1472532	10.0	10.0	11172124	The cute 1bdrm apt is centrally located and in a modern, high tech building.

We've completely fell in love with the city and looking forward to staying with Neha and Sid during our next visit!
25236	1472532	10.0	10.0	11279830	This is in a great location! So close to everything! Restaurants and grocery/liquor stores, and shopping. In walking distance to the market, and the Space Needle. But honestly the walls are so thin in the apartment. And the trash shoot is right next to the door, so if you enjoy gotten woken up at all hours of the night, this place is defiantly for you. Other then the thin walls and loud noises all night keeping you up this place is great.

25238	1472532	10.0	10.0	11395164	Great location, easy walking distance to a lot of main attractions, the financial center, and lots of restaurants and bars.  The place itself is clean and good sized.  There was a kitchen and washer/dryer, but we didn't stay long enough to use it.  The building is brand new, with a view deck and gym in the lobby.  Overall, the place worked out great and I'd stay here again.  The only negative thing I could say is that we were told to use the buildings intercom system to get a hold of the host at arrival, no one answered, so we had to wait a few minutes for someone else from the building to let us in to the lobby to get the keys.  On the other hand though, we needed somewhere to store our bags for a couple extra hours at departure, I called the host and they responded right away and were able to help us out.  Overall I was very happy with the place and would stay again.

Great views from the comfortable roof deck! Neha was available to help with any questions at a moment's notice. Recommend Macrina bakery on 1st Ave for breakfast and/or lunch and The Mix Martini Bar, around the corner on 2nd, for martinis and small plates. 
If you have a car, the garage is very safe and convenient."

The large bathroom was quite nice. My only comment -- the kitchen is minimally appointed in terms of gear, so if you intend to cook a lot, it could be you might not have everything you'd want.  Other than that, an overall great place. I'd highly recommend this location!

25250	1472532	10.0	10.0	12947335	We had a great experience at Sid and Neha's apartment. It was clean, modern, and in a great neighborhood. Most main Seattle attractions are within walking distance. Checking in and out was fairly easy. We had a slight learning curve with the electronic key, however Sid and Neha were available to answer any questions quickly. The roof top deck also had a beautiful view.

25252	1472532	10.0	10.0	14153989	This place was amazing and couldn't be located in a more perfect area! I stayed here while I was in Seattle to attend a conference at the Bell Harbor Conference center and this was a quick 10-minute (or less) walk from there. The space itself was perfect and had everything I needed (great bed, kitchen, and workspace). Oh, and the WiFi was perfect as well. Check-in was easy and Sid was super available via text and phone when I couldn't figure out how to work the key (you have to turn it counter-clockwise). Next time I'm in Seattle, I'm definitely checking to see if this place is available! If you visit, make sure to spend some time up on the roof!

I didn't use the gym or roofdeck as planned, but they're there and quality. The apartment is compact, quiet and has all the things you'll need for your stay.

I'll stay there again."

The interior of the condo was very modern and comfortable, with all the kitchen, laundry, and bathroom amenities one could ask for. Checking in was a little complicated, but much of that was due to our late arrival and a problem with my phone. The check-in process was very smooth, and the directions were easy to understand.

We would definitely recommend a stay here, and hope to be back soon!

The apartment was clean, and comfortable. We also had a parking spot for just $15 a day.
We loved going to the roof patio featured in this picture. There's plenty of seating and a great spot for morning coffee or an evening drink.

25263	1472532	10.0	10.0	19722568	What a great location. Close to restaurants, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, and shopping. The rooftop deck is a major plus for relaxing.
25264	1472532	10.0	10.0	19821447	This was a perfect place for our short stay in Seattle.  Great location.  Friendly host.
25265	1472532	10.0	10.0	20081247	We stayed for 4 nights in Sid and Neha's apartment. The apartment itself is very cool and stylized as is the building itself with a pool table and packman machine in the common area. Being able to checkin late was also a bonus. The shared rooftop area was excellent and although there was other people using it it was never full. The downsides would be the bed was too soft and as someone with back problems I ended up sleeping on the couch by the forth night. The biggest problem however is the other occupants in the building on two of the four nights there were loud arguments/fights going on in the hallway outside the apartment. Also the area around the flat; bell street/2nd street isn't the safest. Obviously these are things sid and Neha can't control but it's worth bearing them in mind when booking the flat.
25266	1472532	10.0	10.0	20276165	We stayed from Sept 23-27.  The place is clean, nice and the location is the best (my boys love the 'game' on the 1st fl)!!! We checked out the roof and it's very nice! Everything is walking distance (tourist attraction, Ride aid and restaurants). This is our first time exp with Airbnb and our first visit to Seattle. Will def stay again if we visit Seattle. ** no AC (don't need one and don't use the heater either!!  the weather is so nice!!). Thank you Sid & Neha!
25267	1472532	10.0	10.0	20487373	The location is absolutely fantastic! Would definitely stay here again. This was my first time using Air bnb and my experience has been really positive. The apartment matches the photos provided and we felt very safe staying here.
25268	1472532	10.0	10.0	20594132	Excellent location, clean condo, and all the expected amenities.  The rooftop terrace gives an incredible view of the city! Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in downtown Seattle.
25269	1472532	10.0	10.0	20987900	Excellent location right in the middle of everything.  Amazing views from the rooftop deck.  The space was clean and comfortable, and everything we could've asked for during our stay in Seattle.
25270	1472532	10.0	10.0	21077687	Our stay was great. The location and accommodations were wonderful for the value. Checking in and checking out we're very easy. Never got to meet Sid or Neha but they communicated very well via phone. I would recommend this place and stay here again.
25271	1472532	10.0	10.0	21171835	Awesome bachelor spot to book in a good location for Seattle action. Didn't spend too much time in the room but it had more than enough to accommodate.
25272	1472532	10.0	10.0	21333466	I arrived a bit early, while te apartment was still being cleaned, but Sid buzzed me in so that I could leave my bags and go exploring. The place is very cool--cheerful, well-equipped, spotless. It was a little smaller than expected but not cramped. Fantastic location!! We could easily walk to all the main downtown attractions, The rooftop deck (pictured) is a big plus.
25273	1472532	10.0	10.0	21462489	Great place!  Sid and Neha were super nice and let me drop my stuff off early.  
25274	1472532	10.0	10.0	21509681	"I had a wonderful stay at Sid and Neha's place. Their condo is warm and comfortable and in an awesome location. 

The building is new and the no smoking group hour the bldg is a plus. New amenities, parking available and a comfortable bed make for a easy time. 

The place is located at the heart of Belltown which gives to immediate access to great restaurants and shopping, Key Arena and downtown. It also gives you quick access to Great neighborhoods like Ballard and Queen Anne which I love just as much. 

I highly recommend this place for a party of one or two who are looking for  a comfortable stay and the heart of Seattle. 

Sid and Neha are great AirBnB'ers - great communicators and easy to follow instructions for arrival, stay and departure. "
25275	1472532	10.0	10.0	21589611	Sid and Neha's place was exactly what my roommate and I were looking for. It was cozy, comfortable, and so conveniently placed I couldn't believe it. The rooftop alone was worth the entire trip and I would love to go back the next time I'm in Seattle. 
25276	1472532	10.0	10.0	21818288	"This was our first Airbnb booking.  Sid and Neha had simple instructions for entry.  Condo was clean.  We loved being in Belltown.  Close to all of downtown.

25277	1472532	10.0	10.0	21939977	"We thought the unit was clean and convenient.  It is a walker's paradise. 

One of the things that is important to us when traveling is being home away from home.  Comfort is key to the success of our rest and relaxation.   While the building is new and clean with tons of modern touches-it did not suit our personal preference as one of our favorites.
The place would be excellent for a younger crowd as the furniture and bed decor spelled ""college student"" not middle aged couple. 

We were able to do a lot of walking and sightseeing without the need for a car.  We would recommend our younger friends to stay at this place."
25278	1472532	10.0	10.0	22011328	Great one night stay in Seattle- the place was clean and comfortable when we arrived, and Sid was very gracious and accommodating with our requests to have a slightly earlier check-in and out.

Shorty's bar and a couple of other restaurants and bars just around the corner.
One bed appartment with good to sleep on fold away couch in living room, no doors to seperate bedroom from living room and kitchen, but that did not bother us.
Washer and dryer in spacious bathroom.
Very nice shared lobby with pool billiards, TV and well equipped gym!
Also very nice roof top with BBQ and Spaceneedle view."

The location is great - walking distance to lots of cool bars and restaurants, Pikes Place Market, the Space Needle and museums, etc. Getting in and out was smooth - Sid has that process down. 
25284	1472532	10.0	10.0	23198203	Absoulutely beautiful and cozy little apartment in a quaint newly developed area. Very streamlined check in/out process, as well as a nice upstairs deck! Would definitely recommend it to anybody wanting to stay close to downtown and Seattle Center, and in good traffic a short ride from the airport!
25285	1472532	10.0	10.0	23591409	This is a nice little apartment very conveniently located. With the instant booking, setting this up was a breeze. Sid sent me all the instructions. I had a question about the keys and he was super prompt in responding to me. Couldn't ask for more. I would definitely stay there the next time
25286	1472532	10.0	10.0	23820592	"This was my first time staying at an Airbnb in the Seattle area, I've always stayed at hotels near my office downtown. The apartment is in a convenient location surrounded by neighborhood restaurants and bars; and a quick walk or taxi into downtown. I'm a light sleeper and this unit was quiet -- I did not get woken up once by elevator noises or hotel doors opening and slamming shut :) The wifi was a breeze, the linens and towels were ready for me when I arrived, and the unit was clean, bright, and cozy. I had a question about access to the building and the host was very prompt to respond. I was even able to catch Monday night football during my workout at the building's gym! Would stay here again and definitely recommend this Airbnb listing.

25287	1472532	10.0	10.0	23943321	The place is in the perfect location and we had a great time in Seattle!  The apartment has everything you need including a collection of Seattle books, maps, transit info, etc...  I plan to rent this place again on my next trip to Seattle!
25288	1472532	10.0	10.0	24404340	"Great location, apartment, and communication!

Contact with Sid was easy through Airbnb, and he answered my questions about the listing.  Once my booking request was accepted, I received a message with detailed instructions for the stay.  A copy of the check out instructions were also printed in the apt for easy reference.

The location is great!  A short walk to either Pike Place Market or to Seattle Center (where the Space Needle, EMP, and Chihuly Garden are located).  There are several restaurants and bars close by.  The apt is also next to a bus line, and parking is also available (for a small fee).

The apt is well kept and clean.  The bed has a memory foam top, making it soft and inviting.  There is a large bathroom with washer/dryer, which can be useful for longer stays.  Having an apt with fridge, stove/microwave was ideal for a trip over the Christmas holidays, when many restaurants are closed, and having new/modern appliances is very nice.  A large screen tv with hulu provided convenient entertainment.

The windows look over an alley between buildings, but I don't go on trips to stay in the room.  A rooftop deck is available, for those desiring a view (personally I'd recommend instead a short ferry ride across and back for a great view of the skyline).

25289	1472532	10.0	10.0	24738032	The apartment and its location were perfect.  Short walk to many restaurants, Pike's Market, Ferry Terminal, yoga studios, Seattle Center, etc.  Enjoyed the gorgeous roof top deck for viewing New Year's fireworks.  Will definitely stay there again when next in Seattle. Sid is very accommodating and responsive.
25290	1472532	10.0	10.0	24935348	Sid was very accommodating. We rented a car last minute and he gave us a parking spot for the night. We arrived very late in the night and Sid was attentive even at such a late hour. The apartment was central to all spots of seattle. We had a lovely time and felt right at home. There was no body wash or shampoo and conditioner, be prepared to bring your own. The washer and dryer was a nice feature after a week of traveling.  
25291	1472532	10.0	10.0	25159460	The apartment was clean and modern. The deck on the top floor of the building was nice and had an excellent view, though the room itself had a view of an adjacent hotel. The parking garage space was easy and convenient to purchase from Sid, who also readied the room early for us. 
25292	1472532	10.0	10.0	25269492	We had a good stay at Sid's Dowton flat!  Sid was a personable host, quick to respond to e-mails and very accommodating throughout our stay.  The flat was excellently located (easy walk to restaurants, downtown and public transit; a superb location for our meeting at the Conference Center), very clean and well-stocked.  A great, no-frills, modern option for 2 to 3 people.

It was a beautiful space and the location was perfect. We timed it, and it literally took us just 5 minutes to walk to Pike Place Market. The apartment was also walking distance from a number of great bars and restaraunts. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle.

He was also very accommodating with our late checkout request as well as with storing our luggage before our late afternoon flight out.

The apartment was clean, well-appointed, and exactly what we needed. The central location is perfect: there are great bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and shops all within five minutes walking distance, plus Pike's Place Market was not even a ten minute walk away. I would definitely recommend staying here on anyone's next visit to Seattle."
25299	1472532	10.0	10.0	26439329	Super clean, nice apartment. Great view from the rooftop and on a very nice road, a short walk from everything (bars, pike place, etc). Building is brand new, very secure, all amenities were covered and very easy to check out and in. Thank you!
25300	1472532	10.0	10.0	26517887	My stay at Sid's place was perfect. The room was comfortable and, as these short stays are so much about location, the neighborhood was awesome. I enjoyed walking throughout eclectic Belltown, and a big plus was the secure parking garage and the dynamic rooftop.
25301	1472532	10.0	10.0	26766023	This was a wonderful experience. Everything was just as described and the location was wonderful! We really enjoyed going up to the rooftop and looking at the gorgeous view of the city at night!

25303	1472532	10.0	10.0	27350693	"Sid's place was the perfect spot for my first time in Seattle.  We were able to walk everywhere with ease and enjoyed many restaurants and bars close to the apartment. Check-in was very easy and the apartment was clean, comfortable and full of light.  Although we did not take advantage of the amenities within the building, it was great to see the pool table and work out area downstairs just in case we wanted to use them on our down time. 

I highly recommend heading up to the roof top for a great view of the water.  It was nice to sit out there at night and watch the sunset. I ended up renting a car during my stay and took advantage of the parking within the building.  Sid made it very easy and gave great directions.  Overall I had a great experience and would highly recommend Sid's place for your Seattle stay.  Thanks again, Sid!"

25307	1472532	10.0	10.0	28062878	Host was very accommodating and welcoming! The place was more than we had imagined, and it made for a memorable overnight getaway on the day of our wedding.
25308	1472532	10.0	10.0	28209975	"The location was nice. Very close to Pike's, bars, and good restaurants. The washer and dryer were a big plus! The parking spot was also a nice perk. However, we found that the availability for linens and towels (1 towel, 1 wash cloth per person) was limited, kitchen supplies were also slim pickings (example, no filters for coffee maker), and a no response with a question concerning the parking spot was a bit disappointing. More positive notes, check in was a breeze, and the building has a pool table, foosball, and ping pong.

Not necessarily a place for those who want to head to Pike's and throw together a meal in the apartment. We did leave an oyster shucker for the place so if they're available, and you're up for the shucking, head to the market, pick up some Kumomoto oysters and get to shucking. Yum. Over all an ok experience."
25309	1472532	10.0	10.0	28458454	Super glad I chose to stay in this apartment. It was my first time visiting Seattle and this place couldn't have been in a better location. True to the description, all of the major attractions in the area are a short walk from the apartment. It was super clean and cozy as well. Sid was great - quickly responded to my emails and made the whole check-in / check-out process a breeze. Very glad that this was my first Airbnb & first Seattle experience.
25310	1472532	10.0	10.0	28543020	Great host. Nice place. Very comfortable bed. Occasional issues with neighbors noise level, but overall a very positive experience.

25312	1472532	10.0	10.0	28969954	My girlfriend and I were only there for a night but Sid's place was as described. The neighborhood was next to a great coffee shop and some awesome restaurants and bars, so driving was definitely not necessary. It was a very quiet space with a great view and we would definitely stay there again given the chance. Definitely great place with a very gracious host. Thanks Sid. 
25313	1472532	10.0	10.0	29157944	"Many thanks to Sid for very clear arrival instructions including the light rail from the airport.

A fantastic location plus a very clean and well provisioned apartment. The buses from 3rd avenue can take you all over (get yourself an Orca card for great value) or stroll downtown. For the evenings that we had an early night, having Netflix was very much appreciated too. Some lovely places to eat very close by.

Our first stay through Airbnb and a very happy one. Thanks again Sid - brilliant!  Sarah & Paul."
25314	1472532	10.0	10.0	29660624	Sid was super accommodating to our entire trip.  The location is great to downtown, the convention center, space needle and pike market.  We had a great time!
25315	1472532	10.0	10.0	29830142	This was my first time in Seattle and it was fantastic! The apartment was right in the heart of the city, and I was able to walk to all of the great tourist spots (Space Needle, Pike Place Market, etc.). I didn't even have to rent a car (although parking is available). The room was very clean, and the roof deck was amazing. Too bad the weather was a little to chilly to enjoy it; I can't blame Sid for that though!
25316	1472532	10.0	10.0	30040879	Excellent location. No problems. Having the parking there was great. 
25317	1472532	10.0	10.0	30571080	Sid was very accommodating during our stay in Seattle. The apartment was located in a very convenient location for out of town guests.  If/when we visit Seattle again we hope the apartment is still available.

Easy walking distance to the Market, Space Needle and within 30 minutes walk of the sports stadiums.  We had a blast - wish the weather was just a bit warmer to have enjoyed being up on the roof - that view is exceptional!"
25319	1472532	10.0	10.0	31642377	Very nice apartment in nice area. Roof terrace is a great place to watch the sun go down. Very walkable.

25321	1472532	10.0	10.0	32082943	And friend and I went down to Seattle just for a day for a mariners game, and we decided that we would try out airbnb for the first time, and let me tell you, that we will only be staying at Sid's place from here on out. It was better than we expected. It was perfect. Checking in was so easy and simple. The place has great parking. The room was extremely clean and comfortable and the location was on point. I would HIGHY recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in the emerald city. 
25322	1472532	10.0	10.0	32313920	"This apartment is such a gem! Check in was quick and easy. The apartment was so clean and tidy. Was within walking distance of so many great restaurants and coffee shops.

25326	1472532	10.0	10.0	33530156	Sid was great. We had a great time in Seattle and was even able to take advantage of the roof deck. Great location! Recommended! 
25327	1472532	10.0	10.0	33677505	The check in instructions were quite extensive and we were a bit nervous about something going wrong. However, Sid's detailed explanation was so easy to follow when we actually got there, we were both really impressed at the ease and accuracy of the actual check in process. We absolutely loved the top floor rooftop deck. Wonderful to sip cocktails and enjoy the view. The location was excellent, there were lots of places to eat and drink on surrounding blocks. Close walk to Pikes, the Space Needle and we even walked to a Mariners game which was nice and easy and took about 30 minutes.  The apartment is quite a bit smaller than we were imagining from our interpretation of the pictures, but it didn't matter much since we were out and about most of the time. We did use the kitchen for cooking breakfast which had all the utensils and such for cooking a mean. Also, Sid has a Roccu so we could watch, Hulu Plus and Netflix. This was cleaver. I also really appreciated that Sid had an option to pay an additional parking spot rental fee per day to park in the closed underground garage in the building. This really made things easy on us and feel like our car was safe the whole time. That was a major plus. My husband says he may stay in a hotel next time for a but extra space, extra towels and a more comfortable bed. All and all, we had a wonderful time and Sid's apartment worked great for our needs. I really appreciated how quickly Sid always got back to me. It was always within 24 hours. P.S. The sheets felt like heaven!
25328	1472532	10.0	10.0	33965944	Sid's place was super easy to stay at! Check-in and check-out was flawless.

Definitely will try to stay there again.

The apartment was very clean and had a nice kitchen and a spacious bathroom.  Wish we could've stayed longer.  It's also just as advertised, five minutes away from Pike Place Markey and literally steps away from some cool cafes and restaurants.  Would love to stay here again next time."
25331	1472532	10.0	10.0	34518909	A perfect way to experience Seattle! The location is just unbeatable. We were able to walk every and didn't have to worry about a car. It was also right around a ton of coffee shops and restaurants just off the crazy tourist traffic of Pikes Place so you really got to experience Seattle as if you truly lived there yourself. The apartment was perfectly neat and tidy and the building was awesome, we enjoyed a couple rounds of ping pong before we went out every night :) The host was awesome, even staying up until the wee hours of the night to buzz us in since we flew in late. Thanks so much for a great stay!

Sid was kind enough to call and let me know that he was able to get the place ready for us, even though we were asking to check in almost 3 hours early. The lock box for the key was easy to use and the studio was spacious and comfortable for the two of us. 

The bathroom was huge and the shower had an adjustable shower head, so I was able to pump up the water pressure a bit. My friend took a long bath after all the walking day two and loved the tub!

There is a little market across the street, so we were able to get a few things we needed quickly and Biscuit Bitch is a great breakfast spot on the same block.

Overall, it is a great location - I felt safe walking around, it's pretty and easy to walk to all the local attractions - we did the Space Needle, waterfront, Wakefield Mall and downtown all by food - the only place we took an Uber to was the Stadium Tour (which was only $16 one way to get there - so not too shabby).

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a sleek, comfortable place to use as a jumping off point for exploring downtown Seattle on foot."
25333	1472532	10.0	10.0	35308433	Great place at a great location! The apartment had everything we could have asked for, and is within walking distance of pretty much everything you'd want to see in central Seattle. Clear instructions made checking in and out absolutely friction-free. Superb experience overall!
25334	1472532	10.0	10.0	35390768	"Great location!  Just a few blocks from Pike's Market.  Awesome restaurants in the neighborhood.  Staying here we felt like ""locals"". Check-in was exactly as described and hassle free.  The unit is well equipped with a fantastic roof top view of the city. Parking is available in the bottom of the building but with this central location you really don't need a car. We only stayed one night but look forward to staying a bit longer on our next trip to Seattle."
25335	1472532	10.0	10.0	35539839	"Great location and apartment and photo's were 100% accurate.
Sid made the process very easy with clear instructions.
Apartment was spotlessly clean and had everything we could have asked for.  Great place to stay."
25336	1472532	10.0	10.0	35695378	"The apartment building is ideally located for leisure at all times of day. In-unit laundry is a lovely luxury for this cozy apartment. Views of the city on the rooftop are unforgettable. 

Sid was technologically accessible before and throughout my stay. I highly recommend this home away from home. "
25337	1472532	10.0	10.0	36652577	Overall, we had a great. stay.  The apartment is in a great location and has fantastic rooftop and nice gym. We also appreciated how accommodating Sid was with our check in and check out.  For us, the only downside was the Tempur-Pedic style bed was very soft and we woke up with some neck/back pain.  However, not sure if this has been a problem for others since we are used to sleeping on a firm mattress. 
25338	1472532	10.0	10.0	36947204	"Just amazing!  This place is in the most perfect location!  Seriously!  So close to everything Seattle has to offer!  You are within walking distance to darn near everything!  I think our favorite feature in this apartment (and we had many) was the rooftop deck!  What a view!  There is a great restaurant downstairs that has a fun Happy Hour and right around the corner the other direction is a yummy little biscuit place.  

Apartment was very clean and well stocked.  Sid was great with communicating and worked with us on an early arrival.  

I think the only issue might be the soft mattress, but that is purely individual.  I certainly wouldn't count that as a negative because someone else might find the mattress too firm or just perfect!

We happened to be visiting Seattle during a time when they were getting hotter than normal temperatures and no rain for quite some time.  Since this is not normal for Seattle, most apartments, homes, stores, restaurants, etc. do not have air conditioners.  That is the case with this apartment; and since there are only two windows that open and they do not allow for any flow of air, it was pretty warm (hot) in the apartment.  There is a fan in the living room area, but was just not enough to cool the apartment down.  I must say, I bet that had we mentioned this to Sid, he would have probably brought another fan in or something.  He is really good at responding to your requests.  We were just there a short time, and didn't feel like bothering him at our weird hours!  (the breeze up on the gorgeous roof top deck will cool you off!!! or downstairs in the main lobby area; it is chilled pretty well with AC there).        

We didn't need to use a parking space, as we did not have a car.  We walked everywhere or used Uber.  

Honestly, if you are ever in Seattle and need a place to stay...I would say PICK THIS PLACE!  Location is superb, roof top deck is gorgeous, amenities are amazing, restaurants and bars are abundant, owner is available and always willing to provide helpful information!     "
25339	1472532	10.0	10.0	37547116	Great location and apartment!   Sid was very responsive and helpful throughout the stay.  Walking distance to a number of awesome restaurants.  
25340	1472532	10.0	10.0	37834911	"Convenient, very nice, and clean.

My girlfriend and I spent 3 days in Seattle and stayed at Sid's condo.  This place is just cool.  The building is clearly brand new and the amenities are sweet.  There's a gym, game lobby, and a gorgeous roof terrace overlooking the city....and that's before you even enter the condo itself.  

Sid's place is modern yet comfortable.  It is very clean and only about a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market.  Also, there's a great restaurant/bar attached to the building that has some killer Moscow Mules (only $5 from 4-7 and 10-12 M - F).  

Sid was very responsive and his instructions were clear and easy to understand.  

Restaurant Recommendations:  Rocco's just around the corner on 2nd ave., Top Pot on Blanchard and 5th Ave for doughnuts (Obama's eaten here - good or bad thing depending on your preferences), and El Borracho near Pike Place Market ($1-$2 tiny tacos and $4 margaritas.  Try the Carnitas and the $2 Steak taco..yum).

Summary:  Clean, cool, convenient, great host, great location.

I would recommend Sid's place to anyone and everyone"
25341	1472532	10.0	10.0	38369905	Wow - the rooftop terrace was lovely - even better than the photos! A shaded area with comfy seating and fabulous view of the harbour. We spent lots of time in the Pike Place market area which was an easy walk away - bought lots of amazing food - and spent time in the cool bistros as well. Loved the pub right on the ground floor - 60 beers on tap! Sid was so helpful with directions and the flat was perfect - spotlessly clean and perfectly located.
25342	1472532	10.0	10.0	38694999	"Sid was easy to work with. He provided all the detailed information we needed to get in and make ourselves comfortable upon arrival. Afterward, he checked in to be sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was very comfortable for the two of us. There were plenty of maps, guide books and magazines to learn more about Seattle. Everything was very clean and orderly. We had all the supplies we needed. The washer and dryer were especially helpful since we had just come from a week of camping and hiking. 

The rooftop deck was my favorite aspect of the apartment. The weather was beautiful so we got to enjoy it almost every night. There were lots of interesting restaurants and attractions within a short walk. One of my favorites for breakfast was Macrina Bakery which is just a few blocks away. 

We enjoyed our visit very much! It was delightful."
25343	1472532	10.0	10.0	38862752	Sid's apartment was exactly as advertised, clean and comfortable. He was very accommodating about an early check-in, which was very nice after an early morning of traveling. Can't wait to return to Seattle and stay in his your place again!
25344	1472532	10.0	10.0	39272081	My boyfriend and I stayed at Sid's apartment for three nights and had an amazing time. The apartment is comfortable and clean, and had everything we could have wanted or needed. The TV had Netflix, which was great, and the wifi worked perfectly. The location is absolutely amazing! Everything is walkable and there are tons of great cafes and restaurants right in the neighborhood. The building felt very secure, as did the parking. Sid was a fantastic host - very accommodating and helpful, even when we asked to check in a bit early :) Would highly recommend! 
25345	1472532	10.0	10.0	39434878	Adorable apartment with an amazing rooftop. I wish I got to spend more time there as it was in a wonderful location with a fitness center. Wish there was more parking options but I was late to reply to the parking request so I guess thats my fault!
25346	1472532	10.0	10.0	39730688	Sid was a wonderful host.  He was extremely helpful with everything we needed for our trip.  He was easy to communicate with and took the stress out of our travel.  We loved the apartment and Belltown area.  Staying here really gave us more of a feel like we were at home.  Location, location, location!  It is close to everything that we wanted to see and we saw everything that you would want to see in a short 4 day trip.  I would recommend Sid's place to anyone looking for a great apartment in a great area.  Thank you for making this a pleasurable experience!
25347	1472532	10.0	10.0	39903172	Sid was very accosating with us needing to check in early. Great bed!
25348	1472532	10.0	10.0	40705762	Sid's apartment worked out great for our stay in Seattle.  We didn't rent a car while in town, so the location was very convenient as we walked everywhere from Lake Union on down to Safeco Field - along with all of the amazing restaurants, bars and shopping within very close proximity.  The apartment was very clean and has all of the creature comfort amenities ranging from a kitchen to washer and dryer - making it feel much more homey than typical hotel options.  Sid was also very responsive and able to assist with all of our questions.  We will definitely reach out to him again next time we're up this way!
25349	1472532	10.0	10.0	42274149	Sid was great and super responsive when we had a question about the parking. We had no problems getting in and felt super secure inside. The location was perfect; so close to any and everything you would want to do in downtown Seattle. The apartment was exactly as described, well furnished, very nice kitchen, large bathroom, nice sitting space in living room. We truly enjoyed ourselves and hope to stay here again the next time we visit. I highly recommend Sid and his wonderful home. Thanks so much for sharing it with us!
25350	1472532	10.0	10.0	43499520	Great set up and easy check in process.  
25351	1472532	10.0	10.0	43675297	Sid's place was Fantastic.  Everything was as described and we had a great time downtown.   
25352	1472532	10.0	10.0	44277058	Our stay was excellent.  The check-in and check-out was easy and the place was exactly as described and pictured.  The location is great.  It is near lots of trendy restaurants and a short walk from downtown Seattle.  Sid is very responsive and accommodating.

25356	1472532	10.0	10.0	46464980	Wonderful time spent in Gene's apartment! Great location, apartment has everything you need and is very clean. Gene was a great host, very responsive and helped me out with some extra requests! If you are looking for a great apartment and host, don't look any further! 
25357	1472532	10.0	10.0	46590880	We had a great stay at Sid's apartment! He was super accommodating regarding early luggage drop off and late check out. The bed and pillows were so comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed. Loved that there were lots of extra pillows. The roof top deck was fabulous. We ate dinner and watched the sunset and also had early morning coffee up there listening to the seagulls. Perfection. 
25358	1472532	10.0	10.0	47240746	Location was great, very central. Easy access to transportation as well. The place itself was clean and resembled the pictures. Definitely a small space. I would call it more of a studio than a 1 bedroom. The bathroom was huge which was nice. Honestly the size wasn't an issue because you spend so much time out exploring the city. One of the best features was the roof top deck. Great views and very relaxing after a long day of walking. I'd stay here again. Thanks Sid!
25359	1472532	10.0	10.0	48058201	This apartment was fantastic! We loved the location. There is a grocery store right next door which was perfect. We didn't have car so this apartment was great because we could walk everywhere. The apartment was nice and clean. The roof top deck was great to go up and see the city. Would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle. 
25360	1472532	10.0	10.0	48676124	Had a wonderful time at Sid's place. Great location, close to everything. Condo had everything we needed, the perfect base for our adventures. Sid was very helpful and we would definitely stay again.
25361	1472532	10.0	10.0	48984554	The place is very clean. It has a well-equipped kitchen. And we could use the washer, which is great. One minor problem: as we are leaving the city in the evening, we have nowhere to store the luggage ( Sid said he could let us drop our stuff till 2pm). So if you leave late in the day, you might want to talk to the host before you make the booking. But overall, we enjoyed our stay. Sid was very responsive and helpful.
25362	1472532	10.0	10.0	49759631	"What an incredible experience my wife and I had staying at Sids wonderful condo on the corner of 2nd and Bell. The home is modest and modern and has all the comforts and convenience you would expect from any hotel except Sids place is right in the middle of Belltown and provides the comfort of home as you experience Seattle as a local might.  
The rooftop patio is as the photos appear and if you happen to have a car, then there is a convenient underground parking garage available to you (for a nominal fee that is)  
Belltown -  honestly if you can't find a place to eat, drink or hangout that meets your fancy within 2 blocks of the front door then I would say you might not like stuff because this area is bustling with world cuisine and whatever entertainment your hearts desire. . 
So anyway with all that being said our experience was amazing and I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else while in Seattle."
25363	1472532	10.0	10.0	50453951	Great apartment! Clean, cozy, as described. Convenient to everything. Little dicey outside the building at night but otherwise great spot. 
25364	1472532	10.0	10.0	50757672	We never met Sid but talked with and corresponded several times. He was pleasant and his instructions were clear. The apartment was clean and well located. Pikes Market was a short walk away, the Amtrak station was just over a mile away, and there were a number of interesting watering holes in the neighborhood.
25365	1472532	10.0	10.0	52842590	The flat is a lovely space, a good size for single traveller or couple. The coffee in the flat was lovely, perfect for a morning brew, and the coffee machine provided was the perfect place to make it! The Macrina Bakery just a block away made a wonderful weekend brunch, but I'd suggest finding somewhere else for weekday breakfasts. The Belltown Pub has good beer and I recommend the Belltown Burger! The apartment is well situated for the Seattle Centre (10-15 mins' walk) and Pike Place market (5-10 mins' walk). 
25366	1472532	10.0	10.0	53173950	"Sid proved to be a great host. He left me very clear directions and instructions, both before I got there and after I was inside the little condo in the heart of Seattle's downtown restaurant district. 
The bed was delightfully comfortable! The kitchen was more than adequate but all I did was make tea because there were too many restaurants to try - all around me! "
25367	1472532	10.0	10.0	54000742	Sids place was great. It was a central location that made it easy to get anywhere in the city. The space was comfortable and homey.

25370	5900224	10.0	10.0	31391854	Rachael's condo location was amazing, it is close to everything.  The building was clean and safe and the pictures very accurately depicted the space.  Rachael also provided many good restaurant recommendations and was a very gracious host.  I would definitely stay here again.
25371	5900224	10.0	10.0	34071369	Rachael's apartment was absolutely perfect. Belltown is a great location. Her apartment is walking distance to some really nice cafes and restaurants-- especially Shiro's, which was the best sushi we've ever had. Rachael was very accommodating, allowing us to check in earlier so that we didn't have to walk around with our suitcases. Her apartment was immaculately clean and was ideal for two people. We would definitely stay here again. She is a great host and always replies promptly if you have any questions. Thanks Rachael :)
25372	5900224	10.0	10.0	34309486	Rachael was very easy to reach to communicate with before and during the stay. She was accommodating and patient with my questions and check in time. She gave us a list of activities we should try to do, attractions we should visit, and her favorite restaurants.

Very clean, cozy, and conveniently located. Would definitely recommend her place when visiting Seattle! 
25374	5900224	10.0	10.0	37340845	Rachael's place is perfect! My husband and I LOVED the place itself. Super clean, beautiful decor, and a perfect view of the Space Needle. The building itself is also gorgeous. It has a courtyard on the third floor which is perfect to relax in. The building also has some amazing restaurants attached to it. The place is ideally located within walking distance to all the attractions, which was perfect. Rachael was the perfect host. Our flight was delayed, and she was completely understanding. She left detailed instructions for us, including restaurant/bar recommendations, etc. By far, the best Airbnb experience that we have had! 
25375	5900224	10.0	10.0	39922596	Our experience in Seattle was amazing, and we couldn't have stayed in a more convenient location. The condo was really nice and had all of the amenities we could have hoped for.

25378	5900224	10.0	10.0	49281802	Rachael's place in Seattle is the absolute best way to see the city! Walking distance from Olympic Sculpture Park, the Space Needle, Pikes Place Market, and of course all the great places in Belltown. The space itself is practical, with fantastic views of the water and the Needle. Rachael made sure the front desk was able to buzz me in, and her instructions were clear and included some great recommendations of local places to eat and drink. I would 100% stay again if I ever travel back to Seattle, just a great space in a prime location. 
25379	5900224	10.0	10.0	49550252	"What a fantastic place and location! My wife and I were looking to stay in a cool part of the city that was within walking distance to everything. This location lives up to it's name as you can walk tot he best spots in Seattle and it has fantastic views.

Rachel was also a great host. Her place is very clean and she recommend some of her favorite place to visit and eat. Two of the restaurants, Shiro's and Macrina's Bakery, are attached to her building and are both fantastic. I highly recommend staying at this location!"
25380	5900224	10.0	10.0	50458468	"Rachael's apartment is perfectly situated within walking distance to everything you would want to have ease of access to in Seattle. Her place was immaculately clean and so well-decorated, with beautiful little details that made the home feel so lively and full of character. Her ""best of Seattle"" sheet is spot on. Shiro's Sushi downstairs will blow your mind. We had an amazing stay and we would stay here again."

27790	7116795	10.0	10.0	39663442	Booking was simple and Debbie responded very quickly to all my questions. 
27791	7116795	10.0	10.0	40782103	"Debbie was great!  She was responsive and even extended our stay one night when we needed it last minute!  She gave us some great suggestions on where to go in Seattle - attractions, restaurants, tours, etc.  

The apartment was very clean, like new.  And, I know Debbie took the time to add a tv at the last minute as well.  The place slept 5 - comfortable queen size beds in two rooms plus a twin size futon in the living room, perfect for a child. Plenty of towels (Debbie even brought more!)/fresh linens and everything you needed in the kitchen.

The apartment was also quiet, it's downstairs/removed from the main street.  It does have a bedroom window that faces the alley which got noisy on trash days/sometimes in the late evening.  Apartment was warm (we were there in late July) but Debbie had two fans for each bedroom.  My only real complaint was the washer/dryer.  This was the first leg of a two week vacation and we wanted to do some laundry along the way.  It's a combo/washer dryer that 1.) had a tiny capacity and 2.) the dryer didn't really work - never dried clothes and clothes ended up smelling bad.  We only put very few clothes in (as instructed) but it still didn't work well.  No biggie though - we ended up leaving the clothes out to hang dry which was fine since it was warm/summer.

I would definitely recommend this apartment - very nice amenities, clean and close to everything (Pike, Space Needle, etc.). And, for extra $$ there is a parking spot out back - which we needed and came in very handy!"
27792	7116795	10.0	10.0	41178485	Very easy check in, Great location.  An overall great experience
27793	7116795	10.0	10.0	41793112	Our family had a wonderful time at this condo and we would recommend to anyone looking for a place in downtown Seattle within walking distance to anything needed. The unit was clean and has a well laid-out floor plan. Debbie was an excellent hostess and checked in a few times to make sure we were settled in. The unit is also next door to a great donut and coffee shop!  
27794	7116795	10.0	10.0	42202663	Great location.
27795	7116795	10.0	10.0	44463022	Good location but the room is basement of the apartment.  Some problems comparing to the price.  
27796	7116795	10.0	10.0	44920931	Debbie was great, very responsive. Pictures were accurate, no surprises upon arrival. This basement apartment was recently renovated. Very well appointed, and super comfortable. It was perfect for two adults and two teenagers who didn't want to share a bed. It is close to both downtown shopping and pikes place market. Great restaurants within a block. Highly recommend for travel with family. 
27797	7116795	10.0	10.0	46638609	"Debbie was very welcoming and gave very clear and helpful instructions about everything. She also gave us very detailed information about the apartment and close by attractions. 

The apartment itself was very nice. It's a good size and is very clean and nice. It gets a little musty, but opening up the windows just a crack helped a lot. "
27798	7116795	10.0	10.0	47005641	"The property was spot on as Debbie described!  The unit was beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  As a foodie, I was able to walk to/from Pike's market with some fresh seafood and produce to make a  couple gourmet meals.  For non-chef folks, there are endless eateries all within a few blocks.  

Although I wasn't able to check in early, Debbie had arranged for a place to leave luggage while I enjoyed the day walking around.  She was also very responsive with a minor TV issue.  I'm looking forward  to another stay here soon!  The price, location and amenities are unbeatable for a group of 4.  Thank you, Debbie for a great stay! "
27799	7116795	10.0	10.0	49154682	Apartment was as described and Debbie was great to work with.  Had a great week and location is one of the apartments best feature.  Would defiantly stay there again.

31262	7517684	10.0	10.0	45808660	Terry was really prompt to reply to our questions, and quite a friendly host. He gave us great recommendations for places in the city. His flat has amazing views and the location can't be beaten. Room and bathroom were spotless. 
31263	7517684	10.0	10.0	46396015	This apartment was perfect for my friend and I.  We didn't have a car, so the location was ideal for walking everywhere.  The place was clean and had all the things we needed for our stay.  Terry Logan was so easy-going, we felt very comfortable hanging around for our afternoon snacks and drinks in between our adventures.  It was like it was our own place, even when he was there!  The listing details made it all sound so welcoming and we definitely felt that way staying here.
31264	7517684	10.0	10.0	46621946	Terry's condo is right next to Pike's Market. You literally go downstairs, and are in the middle of downtown Seattle. We loved the modern open floor plan. Big windows open to the Seattle cityscape. Parking is a challenge, but you expect that in any modern city.
31265	7517684	10.0	10.0	47365253	We had great experience stay in this place for past 10 days!! First of all, the location is perfect!

I know I'll be hitting up Terry next time I come to the Emerald City

It's easy to get everywhere and surrounded by great restaurants and lots of happy hours! Logan was a great host and very accomodating. He was also easy to get in touch with and very friendly. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle! 
31271	7517684	10.0	10.0	52048794	We loved staying at Logan's place for our 3-night stay in Seattle. His apartment was clean and the room was spacious enough to accommodate two guests and our belongings. The building location is extremely convenient and accessible by public transportation from the airport. We also enjoyed the beautiful views of Puget Sound from the high rise. 
31272	7517684	10.0	10.0	53290830	Very nice apartment in a convenient location, especially for out-of-towners. Logan was a great host and very welcoming. While you're in Seattle, be sure to try a Seattle-style hot dog with cream cheese and caramelized onions on it!
31273	7517684	10.0	10.0	53760854	Neighborhood and apartment were as described. The host was there to let us in and very helpful and accommodating.

31274	7517684	10.0	10.0	56464197	If you're ever in Seattle and in need of a place to stay, Logan's got the spot. His space was perfect for a mini vacation, right in the heart of Seattle and walking distance from everything. The location is not the only thing to rave about, the building itself was beautiful and included some great perks. Logan was a lovely host.

31955	1251707	10.0	10.0	36757555	We has a nice stay at The Camlin in Seattle. The studios are different sizes because it's a historic hotel, we ended up in the smallest one but it still fit all our needs.
31980	7763613	10.0	10.0	45868398	Angela was great! She met us to check us into the apartment and make sure we had everything we need. The location is prime, and walking distance to Pike Place and Capitol Hill (about 10m each way). The addition of a parking spot was a huge plus as we drove up from Portland. I would highly recommend anyone thinking of visiting Seattle to stay at Angela's place. I certainly will on my next visit!
31981	7763613	10.0	10.0	46216772	"We were in Seattle for just a day, so we really didn't want to spend time driving around and searching for parking. This apartment was a perfect fit for our needs as it is in a prime location: walking distance from Pike place market and a short 5 minute drive from the space needle.
Angela greeted us at the apartment entrance and showed us our parking spot in the garage. She then gave us a walk through of the apartment. Honestly, we didn't really use much of the amenities but everything looks as advertised.  Angela made us feel very comfortable and welcome.
If I were to visit Seattle again I would not hesitate to stay here once more."
31982	7763613	10.0	10.0	47513784	"Angela was an excellent host--prompt correspondence, flexible, timely and very friendly. She gave us some info about the area and offered to answer ?s during our stay if we needed.

the condo was clean, comfortable and exactly what we needed. 

I would gladly stay there again and/or recommend it to friends. "

On our arrival, Angela was there within 5 minutes to let us in and help us park the car in the garage. The apartment was lovely and had everything we needed. there is a small store nearby which was handy for supplies.
31987	7763613	10.0	10.0	51511982	A great Seattle apartment. Convenient location and much larger and roomier than the photos suggested (easily accommodated 2 couples). Steps away from great coffee, cider and beer - what more could you need! The rooftop patio was an amazing bonus - perfect for wine at night and coffee in the morning. Thanks Angela!

31991	7763613	10.0	10.0	53347524	The condo was comfortable, clean, and in a great location-- really close to Belltown, Cap Hill, Starbucks Reserve, and downtown. There was a minor hiccup when we arrived-- we couldn't get in touch with Angela to access the building which was a stressful way to start our trip, but otherwise had a good stay.

It was a perfect location to walk downtown and close to many good restaurants, bars, cafes, etc. Angela was very accommodating with some special needs with my group and always responded promptly. Thanks for a great stay!
31995	7763613	10.0	10.0	56394259	"As our first time visiting Seattle, Angela's place made the perfect location for us to see and do all the touristy things around the city. Everything we could ask for was in a 15-30min walk. We tried to walk as much as we could if it wasn't raining - typical Seattle experience!

Her home was stocked with everything you could need. I even forgot my shampoo, but of course, she had that covered as well! I also loved visiting during the holiday season since she also had the place decorated - complete with a Christmas tree! Felt very homey."

31997	7763613	10.0	10.0	57386567	Great location- near Pike place market. Everything we need is provided. Warm, comfortable and safe. The only thing is that we were woke up by some loud noise from the heater every night. The house is clean as a whole except some few dusts on the sheets.
31998	7763613	10.0	10.0	57726806	Angela was great! And her place was unbelievably convenient. Definitely a perfect place for central city living with the comfort of home.
36164	6747473	10.0	10.0	35177877	Wonderful apartment, great location, great host although we didn't meet Erica her friend gave us a great showaround and told us how to find the parking.  The rooftop deck and amenities were an unexpected bonus in the lovely Seattle weather.  I'd recommend this property to anyone interested in downtown Seattle.  We'd visited with our son and the layout was perfect for three people.  It's 10 minutes walking distance to the soccer arena in one direction and to Pikes Place market in the other.  Even the space needle is only a 25 minute walk away.
36165	6747473	10.0	10.0	35422663	Erica was very easy to work with and made sure we had all the details covered for our stay in Seattle. She arranged for us to get into the apartment earlier than check in time since we were coming in from a cruise. Her friend met us at the apartment with the keys, showed us around the apartment, and gave us some advice on visiting Seattle. The apartment was clean and comfortable and had all the dishes, toiletries and WiFi/cable needed. They even had everything needed to do laundry. The rooftop lounge area was amazing! Great views of Seattle plus a place to print boarding passes, etc. We loved playing shuffleboard and pool. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go besides the airport which was just a cheap Uber ride away. We would definitely contact Erica again when we visit Seattle for a place to stay!  
36166	6747473	10.0	10.0	35746323	"My expectations were met.  
Apartment was very clean. Host was pleasant, accommodating and punctual. 
Roof top space has a great view of Seattle and Elliot Bay.  
Garage space a plus.
If you are okay with Pioneer Square this is a nice place to stay. "
36167	6747473	10.0	10.0	36216998	Erica arranged for a personal greeting and tour by Rahn, who couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. The place seems brand new  - spotless and modern - yet in an ancient city block. Who doesn't love that? Easy access, elevator, rooftop terrace with a spectacular view of the sound, friendly neighbors and old pub right across the street. The location - on the edge of Pioneer Square and the downtown business district - made it a great place for my business trip and evening decompression.  I would happily stay here again.
36168	6747473	10.0	10.0	36445384	"I feel so lucky to have found such a nice apartment only a few weeks from booking. This apartment is as described and so much more. My friend and I decided to book Erica's apartment as a last minute getaway and it was probably one of the best decisions of our trip. Erica responds quickly to texts and upon arrival I didn't get a chance to meet Erica but was greeted by her friend who was very welcoming and friendly. Gave us good recommendations for places to visit. The apartment is clean and neat. There's a rooftop with an amazing view. It's literally walking distance to everything - pike market, waterfront, and even the space needle if you're down for the bit of distance. We mainly used the car to get out the city for our morning hike that was an hour out from the city. The only thing is we happened to be there for pride and didn't realize the street the parade it was going to be on was right by us which made it a bit difficult to maneuver around if you have a car and trying to get out and back can be a little difficult, but also good if you want to attend like such events because you won't have to look for parking thanks to the open parking spot Erica has available for you. The parking spot is in a garage also opened to the public to pay for which closes at 2:30 am and opens at 10 am or something like that in the morning, but it's nothing you have to worry about because the garage opens if you have the pass that Erica provides regardless of what the rules may be to the public --definite plus. The location also makes uber/lyft trips relatively cheap if you're going around in the city. The apartment is perfect for 2-3 people, but I would keep it up to 3 max. Erica was very accommodating to my schedule and made things easy for us. And her friend was also available by text if we needed anything. My friend Don's words ""I'm only gonna come back to Seattle only if I can stay here again."" I would definitely recommend Erica's apartment to others and book again if I have the chance. Thanks for everything Erica!"
36169	6747473	10.0	10.0	36749302	This was a great stay in the perfect location! Just a few minutes walk from Pikes Place market and the ferries, the location was great. The room was nice with helpful amenities and the rooftop experience was great. The rooftop terrace provided a great view of the water, the sunset, and came equipped with an outdoor grill, full kitchen, pool table, and plenty of seating. I would highly recommend this listing based on the price and location.
36170	6747473	10.0	10.0	38069777	"
Our stay at Erica's was very enjoyable. A very nice, neat and clean apartment. There's a lot of toilet amenities and kitchen utensils provided, you can basically just move in. 
And the rooftop area in the apartment was amazing, almost 360* view of the city, pool table, lounge. It's a pity we didn't get to meet Erica, but her friend Sage was very friendly and informative. We'd definitely stay at Erica's if we travel to Seattle again.

36171	6747473	10.0	10.0	38530832	"This was such an amazing experience. Erica was delightful, responsive, and understanding ( I initially requested the wrong dates!!). When we arrived to the home, we were greeted by her friend, Rahn, who was friendly, helpful, and made us feel comfortable. He also gave us his contact info in case we needed anything for the duration of our stay. So great! 

The place was perfect. Great view, open spaces, and ideal for 2-3 people. I'd have to say the rooftop was the most incredible. We spent the majority of our time looking at the view, watching the sunsets, or lying out next to the water feature. It was beautiful! "
36172	6747473	10.0	10.0	38866792	Had a great trip! Erica and her friend were very easy to work with. The location was fantastic and the condo was very nice - very walkable area and close to the water. I would definitely recommend this owner and property. 
36173	6747473	10.0	10.0	39198531	My husband and I stayed here for our one year wedding anniversary. It was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. It's a couple blocks away from the waterfront, a short walking distance from Pike Place, near many great places to eat and drink, and has an incredible view on the roof top. If you are looking to experience Seattle, this is the perfect place! 
36174	6747473	10.0	10.0	39464911	We LOVED this apt. Wonderful location in between Pioneer Square and Pike Place market. Gorgeous apartment and very clean! Super comfortable bed and a washer/dryer. Highly recommend staying here!

Host:
5 stars
Although we didn't get to physically meet Erica, she stayed in constant communication with us and made it very easy to check in and out. Her friend was very helpful, friendly and accessible.

Apartment:
5 stars
This apartment is brand new and modern. Also somewhat secretly has the best view in town. Guests have full access to the rooftop - a game room, dog run, gym, yoga room (!), lounge with full kitchen,  and outdoor lounge that has full view of Puget Sound and the Seattle Great  Wheel. Loved the new decor, free (!) parking, and security.

note:bathroom sink is oddly tiny, like the size of a bar sink. Not a big deal whatsoever.

Location:
5 stars
This is in the financial district 1 block away from the harbor and central to everything. 98 walkscore is absolutely true. Famous Top Pot doughnuts on the 2nd floor = bonus.

Value:
5 stars
The location alone is worth the price. Factor in the brand new building, rooftop access, gym, game room, new everything...easily the best deal in town. "
36176	6747473	10.0	10.0	40334707	The host was great gave us recommendations on places to go eat and things to do. The apartment was clean and we had everything we needed.

36177	6747473	10.0	10.0	41214924	"WOW! Is all I can say.  Erica met us at the entrance to the building as we arrived.  She gave us the keys and showed us how everything works.
I could not possibly be happier with my experience in Seattle.  Erica's place is a few blocks from Pike Place Market, the Ferry to Bremerton or Bainbridge Island, the Waterfront, etc.
The place was everything my wife and I could have hoped for and more.  It immaculately clean, had everything you could ask for, and Erica went above and beyond to make our vacation the best!
I would stay there again in a heartbeat, and would highly recommend it to any one considering a stay of any length in Seattle.
Thanks Erica!
Thanks Shellie!

The whole building is new and has great amenities like the gym, yoga room, and the rooftop views are amazing. We spent time chilling on the roof enjoying what may have been the nicest days and nights of the summer. It's easy to walk everywhere from the apartment. We even had a cute street fair on Post Alley our first night. 
We are a couple traveling with our adult daughter. The apartment afforded us a comfortable space for three. Hope to come stay again one day. "

The location is great. It is also very central in Seattle, so you can walk to the Pike's Place market or to Pioneer Square, and it is minutes by bus or car to most other neighborhoods in Seattle. The only issue with the Downtown area is that it is mostly office workers and other tourists there. If you want to stay somewhere more ordinary Seattle residents live, you might want to look at a different neighborhood.

The apartment was very clean and had all the essentials, more than you would get in most hotels. The building has a great rooftop with views of the city and the bay."
36182	6747473	10.0	10.0	43553663	We had a great experience at this airbnb. It is in a convenient location and the building is very nice. I would recommend this to others.
36183	6747473	10.0	10.0	43963900	"First off, the place is beautiful as advertised. Very new, clean and well-maintained. It has everything you need to enjoy a comfortable and safe stay. It's also walking distance from almost everything in Downtown Seattle (Pike Place, Safeco field, Waterfront, bars and restaurants).  And even though it's in the thick of everything, it's surprisingly peaceful and quiet when in the room. Communication with Erica was excellent. She is very quick to respond and made sure we were taken care of. We didn't get to meet Erica, but her partner Zev welcomed us when we got there and showed us around the place. Super cool guy and was also very quick to respond to my texts before and during our stay. The parking spot is in a separate structure just a short walk away. Not the prettiest building in the world and getting in and out was a hassle going up and down 4 floors in a tight area, but having the spot was definitely a convenience since it also had 24 hour access with the key card. Didn't need to take it out much anyway since we walked or cabbed it 90% of our trip. Word of advice... when you're not spending time out and about in the beautiful city of Seattle, YOU MUST MAKE USE OF THE ROOFTOP. Zev said it was the best view in the city, and we agree. Went up there during the day and night, enjoyed a few drinks, and even watched the Safeco field fireworks show from there. You can even hang in the game room and play some pool or just hang out. The other people that stay/live there are pretty chill too.  Thanks Erica and ""Wolf""! haha!! We will definitely be looking to book here again if we return to Seattle!"
36184	6747473	10.0	10.0	44916538	"Great location and as other reviewers pointed out, an amazing roof area. The only knock (as others have said) is the small bathroom sink.

36185	6747473	10.0	10.0	45598373	What a great first-time experience on Airbnb! Erica has certainly set the bar high. From the warm (and late-night) welcome we received from Zev- who showed us where to park, took us up to the impressive and fully equipped apartment, and was available for any request or question we had- to the stunning rooftop views and ideal location that was steps away from anything and everything one would need to enjoy this quaint city, we couldn't have kicked off the start to Labour Day weekend any better. 
36186	6747473	10.0	10.0	46095243	Erica's place was wonderful and perfect for our stay.  The apartment was spacious, clean and well-equipped.  The rooftop was amazing and offered great views overlooking the water.  The apartment is very convenient to several tourist attractions and there is a great doughnut shop adjacent to the building.

36196	6747473	10.0	10.0	52807042	Erica and crew were great.  They let us into the apartment early in the day so we weren't stuck in that weird hotel limbo time where you've checked out of one but can't check into another yet.  When we met Don, he went over everything that the apartment had to offer, made some suggestions on things to check out, and made sure that we knew that we could contact him or Erica if we needed anything or had any questions about anything.  They were both great hosts, and the apartment was fantastic!  The views are no joke, and there is tons of great stuff to do with in walking distance within the area.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I ever make it back to Seattle.

I didn't  have my key card with me and happened to ask the receptionist at the desk to swipe me up the elevator. He asked me if I'm a resident and I said no, I'm renting through Airbnb. He then proceeded to tell me that it was illegal to have Airbnb residents in this apartment. 
The next day we got a letter at the unit mentioning the same. In the evening Erica called to ask if we can move to a friends place that night as the building management wanted to do a walk through of the apartment the next day early morning. Since I was with my mom I told them it would be impossible to move that night but we could leave early the next day before the walk through and that I would need a days refund. Don came the next day early morning to pick us up, gave us the refund and dropped us at the light rail station. Erica did not even in check in and her phone was turned off when I tried to call her.
I have used Airbnb many times before. But this experience has made me wary of using it again. I'm not sure if the building policy changed after I rented this apartment as it had really good reviews . I would appreciate if Airbnb would make their policies stricter and verify the people who lease apartments. I would be wary of renting any place from Erica again.

36198	6747473	10.0	10.0	54227719	Thank you for hospitality and for allowing us to make a last-minute reservation!  The apartment is modern, charming (I like exposed concrete, etc.), new, and very clean.  There were towels and soap and the option to do laundry as well.  The bed was firm which is perfect and allowed for a great night sleep.  Great location.  I'll definitely try to stay here again.

36203	6747473	10.0	10.0	58363127	Great location to experience Seattle.  Right by Pioneer Square,  within a short few blocks from the waterfront attractions and Pike Place market. There's a lot of places nearby to have a nice dinner with your familyor a beer at the Irish pub across the ally. The rooftop patio has an amazing view of the Sound.
38983	1252147	10.0	9.0	5777692	Erin, Vince and their cute dog Tucker were absolutely fantastic! Their cozy apartment is located only a few blocks from a bus stop; it's a short easy ride to downtown Seattle, really convenient. Make sure you save a day to walk by the water in West Seattle. Alki beach is beautiful, best views of Seattle's skyline! We couldn't have stayed at a better place while visiting Seattle, Vince and Erin were great hosts, they gave us the best advice about the rest of our trip down the West Coast, from hotels, to restaurants, to car rentals. The room was big and clean and really comfortable. They made us feel like part of their family, if we ever find ourselves back in the West Coast we most definitely will contact them!
38984	1252147	10.0	9.0	6096386	Fantastic hosts with lots of good tips on exploring Seattle.  Bed very comfortable and house super clean.  Thanks Erin and Vince! 
38985	1252147	10.0	9.0	6883620	We had a wonderful time at Erin & Vince! We felt home 900km away from our homes! West Seattle is a great area it takes 20 minutes to downtown Seattle and you can use bus or the water taxi from which you can see the skyline of Seattle - a must see!! They were great hosts and gave us super recommendations for our travels along the west coast! It was so cozy and very clean! We loved our stay at their house! That's how airbnb is meant to be!!! 
38986	1252147	10.0	9.0	7442172	Thanks Erin and Vince - and Tucker! Thoroughly enjoyed my stay - wonderful, comfortable accommodations. If I am back in the area, I will definitely book again.
38987	1252147	10.0	9.0	7542790	Erin and Vince were very nice hosts. They picked us up from the ferry terminal wich was really convenient. They were really helpful in telling us interesting things about Seattle and what to see. Their house is really nice and clean.
38988	1252147	10.0	9.0	13396763	Erin and Vince are charming hosts. The room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable. We had a great time! 
38989	1252147	10.0	9.0	14057162	"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great! Erin and Vince are such great, nice people. Enjoyed my conversations with them and they have a lovely home, I was very comfortable. I would definitely stay with them again. West Seattle is a great area and so easy to get to downtown. 

I LOVE SEATTLE even more now! 

Thanks Again Erin and Vince!! "
38990	1252147	10.0	9.0	14323368	"Erin and Vince were lovely hosts! This was my first Airbnb experience, and I have to say, it couldn't have been better. They made me feel completely at home while I was there, and even helped me plan out some fun things to do while I was there (sadly, only for a weekend).

I would definitely stay there again next time I’m in Seattle.

Thanks E&V! Oh, and Erin, BTW, I just made the Moroccan-Spiced Bean Dip from your book. Sooooooo good! I’m eating it now "
38991	1252147	10.0	9.0	16280508	"My stay with Erin and Vince (and Tucker) was absolutely delightful. The space was very clean, comfortable and quiet. The location is very convenient - close to bus lines, grocery stores and other services. The kitchen was spotless (with room for me, which was really nice) and morning coffee was a treat. On top of the place, Erin and Vince were gracious and welcoming hosts; I was nervous about a room rental but was so pleasantly surprised by the mix of social time and quiet time (and look forward to staying in touch with my ""host family"").  Finally, their corgi Tucker is a hoot - he didn't make a peep during most of my comings and goings, and if you follow Erin & Vince's coaching you'll win him over and be treated to snuggles.  All in all, highly recommended!"
38992	1252147	10.0	9.0	16579912	Erin and Vince make the perfect hosts! My mom and I stayed with them for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. We felt welcomed and comfortable, loved their house and suggestions of things to do, and would certainly return!
38993	1252147	10.0	9.0	17544333	This was our first BnB experience and we couldn't have had a better one! Vince was such a wonderful host making us feel welcomed and at home very quickly. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. We had a rental car so it was easy to get into downtown Seattle for here. We stayed out of the house most days till after dinner but the time we were at the house was relaxing and just what we needed! Their dog Tucker is sweet as can be and he might do some tricks for you - if you're lucky! 
38994	1252147	10.0	9.0	17975851	"Erin and Vince were absolutely great hosts. They are both very welcoming, funny, and easy going. They have given us advice on what and where to go, offered their kind help by driving us to the bus and have just been extremely nice. They are both very intersting people, and in my opinion that's also an important part of airbnb- getting to chat and to know, a little, the local people in the place you're off to. 

The room and the apartment in general were great: great location (single bus that goes to all the main attractions in Seattle in a 5 minutes walk), beautiful apartment, very comfortable room, 
what else could you need?

I forgot to mention Tucker, their ever so cute dog!
We would definitely recommend them for future travelers! 
Thank you for a wonderful stay in the beautiful city of Seattle
"
38995	1252147	10.0	9.0	18138213	Erin and Vince have a beautiful home in West Seattle. Immediately on arrival Erin was warm and welcoming and totally cool. She offered us some advice on where to go and let us know that we could make us feel at home. Vince was busy most of the time we were there but when we did meet him, he was just as sweet as Erin. The bedroom was kept very neat and the bed was a really beautiful hide-away Vince had made. Their dog was staring contest champion of the world!
38996	1252147	10.0	9.0	18578719	"One of our best airbnb experience!!!Erin and Vince were wonderful hosts and amazing people.
The room was bigger than on the picture, cosy and comfy. We really felt at home. The neighbourhood is quiet and we needed that after a noisy stay in San Diego :-) 

We took once the taxi boat to go to Downtown (you need to walk 5mn to a bus stup and from there there is a free shuttle bus that drives you to the taxi boat). From the same bus stop, you can directly go to downtown and it will take you more or less 20mn.
For us, travelling every day to and from downtown was not a big deal when you know what we have once we arrive ""home"".

All in all, we highly recommend this place!"
38997	1252147	10.0	9.0	18949971	I just can't say enough nice things about my stay with Erin & Vince! Their place is immaculate and inviting, and the location in West Seattle puts you close to a variety of shops and restaurants, Lincoln Park and the Ferry to Vashon Island. It is also a great base from which to explore the amazing variety of Seattle neighborhoods. Erin and Vince were generous and hospital, making sure my coffee needs were met each morning and my towels were spanky clean, providing local advice on my day's activities, and sharing a lovely dinner with me on one occasion (Erin is an accomplished chef, who has put out a lovely book. Ask about it!)They even kept me entertained by having their corgi, Tucker, perform a repertoire of cool tricks for me. Did I mention that Vince helped me cart my 50 -pound suitcase to and from the car and up and down the stairs? I really feel these two embody the spirit of Airbnb, sharing a part of themselves as they shared their home. I would definitely recommend this place to others. P.S. The bed is really comfy! You may need to set an alarm!
38998	1252147	10.0	9.0	19231795	"This is our first Airbnb experience and it couldn't be better. Erin and Vince are very welcoming hosts. They gave us great recommendations on restaurants and sight seeing places. Besides, the house was really nice: the room is clean, the living room is fantastic, and everything looks just like the photos they posted, even better! For people who travel with a car in Seattle like us, the location couldn't be better. The community is pretty and nice. It was just 15-mins drive to downtown Seattle. We can go to everywhere around Seattle easily and enjoy a home-like town in West Seattle at the same time. 
We feel warm and comfortable during our stay. It was really nice to share the valuable time with Erin and Vince. By the way, Tucker the smart puppy was superb!"
38999	1252147	10.0	9.0	19637297	Erin and Vince are absolutely charming hosts who have turned their spare bedroom into comfortable accommodations in super cool West Seattle.  Their hospitality and friendliness made us feel totally welcome, like honored guests in their home, and Tucker the adorable Corgi is a bonus.  They were able to give us helpful tips on restaurants and ferry schedules, and the house always smells delicious with Erin's prep for cooking classes!  We would definitely stay with Erin and Vince again.
39000	1252147	10.0	9.0	22511284	Our hosts Erin and Vince were very friendly. Place was clean, tidy and good overall. Bedroom felt little small because of the computer table and two office chairs. Bed was decent for a convertible bed but squeaked little as you twist and turn. Bathroom and toilet were good. If you just need a place to crash at night this would fit the bill because you won't be able to hang around after 10am as they also use the room as an office after 10am, so just know that. 
39001	1252147	10.0	9.0	28428949	This was our second time staying with Erin and Vince, and we were welcomed like old friends.  Their home is lovely, clean and comfortable in every respect.  We love West Seattle, so location couldn't be better.  Highly recommended!
39002	1252147	10.0	9.0	33459470	Staying with Erin & Vince in Seattle was such a wonderful experience. As soon as we walked in the door on our first day, the two treated us like old friends and were so welcoming and kind. We especially loved learning about Erin's adventures as a chef, and hanging out with their adorable corgi Tucker. During our many chats they gave a myriad of great Seattle recommendations, from restaurants to transport to activities. Their ideas enhanced our Seattle experience, particularly Erin's suggestions of gluten-free-friendly restaurants! The private bedroom we stayed in was very nice and had lovely light every morning. Also, the shower pressure in the bathroom was glorious! Erin & Vince gave us the freedom to use many of the amenities throughout the home, including the gorgeous living room (with TV, Hulu, Netflix, etc.), kitchen and outside grill (the latter of which we didn't take advantage of but should have). We loved the beautiful West Seattle neighborhood around Erin & Vince's home, and it was not too far from any place we wanted to go. It was so nice to come back to their clean, cozy home every night -- it was the perfect place to relax and wind down from the day. Upon departure, they kindly gave us a copy of Erin's fantastic cookbook, which we can't wait to use and will always remind us of our Seattle trip.
39003	1252147	10.0	9.0	33964197	Vince and Erin are SUPER friendly, lovely people. The room we stayed in was big, airy, with a lovely comfortable bed. The house is gorgeous, beautifully decorated with a cosy, homey feel. We loved chatting to the hosts, and wished we could have stayed longer to follow all their great recommendations for Seattle. We DID follow some, and had a fantastic time. Had a delicious bacon and egg breakfast (spoilt) with vanilla coffees. An absolute treat staying with you, thank you both for having us.
39004	1252147	10.0	9.0	34805464	Staying here was one of my best AIRBNB experiences so far! Erin and Vince were very nice and accommodating. Erin even let us try samples of some of her gourmet food products. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. It was also nice to stay in a quieter neighborhood with easy bus access to downtown Seattle. Would definitely stay here again! 
39005	1252147	10.0	9.0	35244325	"Erin and Vince were simply amazing. This was our first trip to Seattle and we couldn't have asked for better hosts and place to stay. They were so hospitality from the very beginning. They helped us with directions with public transportation, recommendations on where to eat and things to do. They also have a corgi named Tucker who is a character haha.

Their home first off is very welcoming and inviting. They gave us full access to everything and made us feel comfortable. And since Erin is a chef, we got to sample some of her treats, including her tea and lavender & lemon sorbet she made (so good). The room was comfortable and spacious, and they always had fresh towels for us everyday. 

We stayed there for 4 nights and it felt like home. On our last night there we ate at their friends restaurant Marination Mai Kai (really good) and ended up watching the season finale of Game of Thrones with them. 

Erin and Vince really make you feel welcomed and feel like family. Thank you guys and Tucker for a first great AirBnB experience :)"
39006	1252147	10.0	9.0	35513076	I'm an Airbnb host myself, so I can clearly see that Erin and Vince have the gift of hospitality and really enjoy hosting. I agree with all the reviewers that their home is beautiful, immaculate, and comfortable. I'd like to add that it's also very quiet. But the highlight of my stay was getting to sample what Erin had made that day -- grilled apricots topped with mascarpone cheese and almonds, drizzled with lemon verbena gastrique! And I got a singed copy of her cookbook!
39007	1252147	10.0	9.0	35960241	"Erin and Vince are awesome, Erin is a great chef and she could not only make fantastic food on her own, she is also a very good adviser on restaurants based on your requirements. The juice she made is so tasty, and thanks so much for the English muffins you prepared for the breakfast. 
The house is very warm and clean, it gives you a home-like feeling. The neighborhood is also very nice, plus its only walking distance to different beautiful parks.  
"
39008	1252147	10.0	9.0	36714926	"The house rule of ""notify us if you'll be out after 10pm"" can be surprisingly difficult to comply with. For example, when you have a dinner event scheduled for 6:30... will you be out after 10pm? It's hard to say. And if your phone dies, well, then you just look like an inconsiderate person. And be aware that bus travel from the downtown area takes 30 minutes minimum, so if you're going to be out past 9:30, then you won't be back before 10. Unless you're in Ballard, then it'll take an hour.
Besides the stress of trying to know what time I was going to be out each evening (and the desire to be a good guest), our stay was quite pleasant. 
Erin & Vince were very hospitable and accommodating, the location is close to bus access and the neighborhood shops and restaurants.  
The bedroom is only a few feet down the hall and separated from the hosts' room by a bathroom. The house is very quiet and easy to sleep in, although you will find yourself tiptoeing back to the room if you're out past 10. And since the bathroom shares a wall with the host's bedroom, you'll probably rather sleep dirty than risk a shower that wakes the host. And the dog might bark if it hears you, so that increases the stress of being quiet at night.
If you don't plan on being out at night, this is a fantastic place to stay and I'm sure you'll enjoy the wonderful company of two obviously amazing hosts. Otherwise I don't think that the layout of the home is accommodating for people who wish to come and go after hours while not disturbing the host."
39009	1252147	10.0	9.0	37494435	"Our hosts were very friendly and understanding. The house was absolutely immaculate, the pillows ridiculously comfortable, and there were lots of good, current magazines available for us to choose activities in the city. 
We needed a safe, soft place to sleep and a place to shower. They provided this as well as a welcoming environment. Of course, Tucker was adorable, and good company. Will look into staying here again next time I'm in (website hidden) - West Seattle is so very friendly and clean, with plenty to do and see, without the grime and grit you find in downtown Seattle. (Not that I mind getting a little dirty to have a good time!) "
39010	1252147	10.0	9.0	38175713	Erin & Vince were great hosts and the room was super comfortable. It was easy to come and go from their place and make it downtown by bus in 20 minutes. It was also great to explore the neighborhood of West Seattle and Alki Beach.
39011	1252147	10.0	9.0	38438769	Great location!  It was our first time using AirBNB and it really couldn't have been better.  My husband and I were a little hesitant, mostly afraid of being a bother.  Erin and Vince went out of their way to put us at ease. Their home is very nice, very clean, and the location really couldn't have been better for access to Seattle.  We took Erin's suggestions for both the water taxi and a tour of Seattle's underground, and both were terrific!  I really enjoyed chatting with our hosts a few times and think Erin and I would be good friends of we lived on the same neighborhood.  I can highly recommend staying at their home. Thank you, both, for your hospitality and thoughtfulness.  The breakfasts were such a help, too, and I appreciate your efforts to provide what worked for us, specifically.  It was wonderful meeting you, and should we come that way again we'd love to stay at your place.
39012	1252147	10.0	9.0	39116957	Erin and Vince are a lovely and welcoming couple. Very comfortable place to stay, I slept amazingly. Nice to stay out of the chaos of the city but a bus, ferry, or taxi ride from Alki beach or downtown. Erin and Vince were around when I arrived and when I left to make me welcome, show me around, and for interesting chats.
39013	1252147	10.0	9.0	40277455	"Erin and Vince were kind hosts - Erin even picked us up upon our arrival in West Seattle (which was above and beyond because it was earlier than our original check-in time).  Their home is incredibly clean and the kitchen was a great space to prepare our breakfasts each morning.  The guest bedroom is quite cute and the mattress is incredibly comfy.  Erin and Vince communicated clearly before and during our stay.  Although the bathroom is shared, they would let us know when they needed the bathroom each morning so we could make plans accordingly.  My husband and I are pretty communal people, so sharing the kitchen and in-kitchen dining area worked well for us, but may not be ""ideal"" for those wanting more privacy.  

Erin was quite gracious - picking up English muffins, peanut butter and bananas for our breakfast, sharing her tomato appetizer with us, and making fresh coffee each morning.  She also gave us fresh towels daily and had several maps of the area for us to use. 

The bus stop is about a 10 minute walk from their home and the ride itself takes about 20 minutes (into downtown Seattle).  

Erin even cleaned our breakfast dishes one morning as she hadn't emptied the dishwasher yet.  Again, she goes above and beyond!

We had a lovely time exploring Seattle and it was so nice to have a warm, comfortable place to and each evening!  I would recommend staying with them if you have an opportunity.  "
39014	1252147	10.0	9.0	40849774	Room was very nice, very clean space.  Hosts were awesome, had a great time in Seattle!

To share the bathroom with them was so easy and never a problem. Tucker, the dog, was well behaved and trained. Seattle was easy to reach by puplic transportation. 
We had a wonderfull stay, friendly chats and a fun eveining with Erin and Vince and I would defintely recommend their home and would love to stay there again! We met  some terrific people in Seattle! Thank you!
"
39016	1252147	10.0	9.0	46936256	Erin and Vince were incredibly kind and generous. They easily make you feel at home in their beautiful space. I had a short, but enjoyable stay and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable place in West Seattle.

39402	6748502	10.0	10.0	39103615	"Great home, great view, great neighborhood and most of all, great host!

Ian is happy to answer all questions prior to my arrival (please give him at least 1-2 days to respond).  He is super-accommodating with towels, soaps, and linens; he and his girlfriend will even check your space while you're away (just like hotel service; if you prefer more privacy, though, just ask) to restock toilet paper and so forth.  They're constantly working to improve the space (a real mattress instead of an airbed), which is already far better than I'd imagine it would be.  And they're CLEAN ... even though they have a dog (awesome pet) on premises and I'm very sensitive to pet dander, I experienced zero issues during my entire stay.  Very thoughtful host.

Remember: Please be respectful of the house and the hosts and their rules (Ian didn't have many, though, since he's very easygoing), as always, and you'll have no problems here!

LOCATION:  Awesome!  It's between Sea-Tac airport and downtown Seattle, so you won't have to go as far as other places to find it.  And if you're renting a car and plan to explore other parts of Washington (such as the Cascades or Mount Rainier) besides the city of Seattle, this West Seattle neighborhood is ideal!  Plenty of free parking on the street, access to stores and late night places (most of Seattle closes down early, I've learned), cheaper gas stations ... you won't ever feel gouged compared to if you're staying near downtown.  That said, I can be over the bridge and at Seattle Center, Pike Place, Chinatown or any of the other major tourist spots within 10-15 minutes (at least, outside of the work rush hour).  Parking downtown may take you a little more time, but that has nothing to do with this location.

Many thanks to Ian and his household for making my first AirBnB experience in Seattle an top-notch one!"
39403	6748502	10.0	10.0	39345444	Ian and his wife have a beautiful home in a great location. The floor even in 98 degree heat was nice and cool. You have your own entrance to come and go. It is close to everything you could possibly need in West Seattle, yet on a nice quiet street. I would definitely stay here again. 
39404	6748502	10.0	10.0	40368042	"Ian's home is beautiful, with great views. It's within walking distance of the bus stop and 7-11, which was very convenient, since I chose not to rent a car while in Seattle. 
I loved the fact that I had my own entrance to the house. The bed is very comfortable, and there was some space and hangers in the closet for me to hang some clothes, as well as space in the cabinets. 
There is no TV or clock radio in the bedroom, which makes it very quiet and peaceful.  The half bathroom downstairs was clean and well stocked with towels, soap and T. P. 
    I did feel a little weird going upstairs into the bathroom to take a shower, but once the shower is completed downstairs that won't be an issue. 
Ian was very accommodating with the check in process, allowing my sister to pick up my key prior to my arrival. Very nice! 
This was the perfect place for me to stay, very comfortable and reasonably priced. I highly recommend staying here. 
"
39405	6748502	10.0	10.0	52676479	Ian was very welcoming and accommodating. Being new to the city, he invited me to a few get togethers and events which I really appreciated. The house is gorgeous and on a hill so the deck has an amazing view of the city. The garden area with the pond is a very peaceful and relaxing area.  The space downstairs is a basement so it doesn't have much natural light and it does get cold (which was great during the hot days I was there for),  however it is quite a large space. 
39406	6748502	10.0	10.0	55393134	This was my first time using Air b and b and it could not have been better! I just moved 2,000 miles and needed a place to stay for about a month while I got settled. Ian made my transition to Seattle extremely easy and calmed several of my fears. Ian is extremely welcoming and is focused on making you feel as 'at home' as possible. On top of making me feel welcome in his home, he was always giving me excellent ideas for places to eat, take my dog or grab a beer. At the end of the month it was difficult to leave such an ideal situation!
39841	7763298	10.0	9.0	42482073	Jennifer was very welcoming and responsive. I arrived a bit late and was kindly greeted by her. She was kind enough to let me check out later than the scheduled checkout time. The room was very spacious and clean with a balcony. There are two nearby rooms with guests coming in and out occasionally but overall it is quiet. Would recommend to others.
39842	7763298	10.0	9.0	42968714	Jennifer met us at the door when we arrived, was very friendly, gave us the keys and showed us to our room.  The room was amazing for the price: very spacious, comfortable beds, nice little balcony, large bathroom.  Everything was very clean and there was bottled water left for us.  Apparently, we could have used the kitchen if we wanted, but we really were only there to sleep.  I think we would have had to walk through the family's living area in order to use the kitchen, which may have been a little awkward.  Unlike a hotel, there is a no shoe and no food rule while staying there.  This makes it a little inconvenient, but I'm sure it helps with wear and tear.  There is also no TV, so bring your own entertainment if that matters to you.  The street is very narrow and parking was a little tricky our second night because the car parked in front of us didn't leave a lot of room, so we ended up having to park in front of the gate, which didn't leave a lot of room between the car and the gate.  The house is in a convenient location, just off of I-5 and only about 7 miles from downtown Seattle.  Overall, this is a great place to stay, especially for the price.  I would definitely stay here again:)
39843	7763298	10.0	9.0	45352415	Very straight forward, the room we stayed in has all general amenities such as shampoo and toothpaste and if u forgot they supply towel, also clean and tidy.  If u need to stay in a private room with convenient access this place is a pretty good one.
39844	7763298	10.0	9.0	45632555	It was nice and easy to stay there...using the washing machine n check-in at any time helped us a lot
39845	7763298	10.0	9.0	45860902	Fantastic place to stay! Jennifer always replied immediately and was very welcoming. The place was exactly as described. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the Seattle area!
39846	7763298	10.0	9.0	46795895	"Everything and everyone seemed very open and welcoming.  The room was very cozy and a ton of space for any luggage and moving around.  I enjoyed my stay for sure.
Only about 5-10 from inner Seattle. Then, being out of Seattle little more, it was easier to drive around in a new area along with getting out to attractions outside of the city.
The only downside was needing to do street parking a few days, just because of the amount of people staying at the time.  The street parking is a bit precarious; a bigger car would have made it difficult to street park near the apt."
39847	7763298	10.0	9.0	47084203	"We (two couples) enjoyed our two-night stay very much! The room is VERY spacious with a lot of natural lighting and a lovely balcony with a table and two chairs. We never actually met Jennifer but we did met her daughter, 9-year-old Cindy, who was just a wonderful little host! She showed us around the whole house, told us the house rules (VERY reasonable: no shoes inside the house, no eating in the bedroom but you can use the kitchen/dining room, and quiet time after 10:30 pm), and handed us the key... she was so adorable! Don't be alarmed, she was under the care of a lady but she mainly stayed in the kitchen and didn't speak much English so Cindy ran the show :) 

Jennifer had left water bottles and indoor sandals for us in the room. I texted her to see if she had an iron and it appeared at our doorstep when we got home later that day (along with an ironing board). The bathroom was equipped with a hair dryer, shampoo, body wash, toothpaste, four towels, and four glasses. There's a HUGE walk-in closet and another smaller closet in the bathroom as well. I also texted Jennifer the day of our check-out to see if we could leave our luggage there so we wouldn't have to haul it around town with us and she was very accommodating and allowed us to leave it in her living room until later that day. 

LOCATION: we found it to be very convenient, right off the i-5 and a short 15-20 min drive from downtown attractions (depending on the time and where you're going). Not having to worry about crossing downtown on our way back to the airport when we left was a plus too since this is on the Southern side of Seattle. The streets don't have sidewalks and are narrow so you sort of have to park your car either close to the bushes across the street or on top of where the side-walk would be right in front of their gate. No parking in the driveway is allowed. It honestly wasn't bad at all though. "

Thanks for having us. It is good."
39849	7763298	10.0	9.0	49246318	Jennifer's place was very nice, clean and spacious. Han and I felt welcomed and very comfortable there. It was close to the bus line and access to the kitchen and laundry were convenient. Thank you!!
39850	7763298	10.0	9.0	50193700	房东没有见到，一切自助，房间大而宽敞，浴室干净，出门也比较方便。性价比较高。
39851	7763298	10.0	9.0	50666080	We got to meet with Jennifer's cute daughter. The room is really clean and has a nice view. I love it. I go Seattle pretty often. Will definitely stay here again. 
39852	7763298	10.0	9.0	52230116	The house and neighborhood were exactly as described! We were greeted by a young girl while trying to open the key box. Other than that we didn't have a lot of in person meetings with anyone from the house. The room was clean and home-like. The room was also very spacious and comfortable for 4 people, or even more to stay in. The bathroom was also clean and very nice with two sinks, perfect for our group. There was also a spacious closet and balcony!
39853	7763298	10.0	9.0	52945587	I would definitely recommend this place for a small group of individuals looking to visit that area of Seattle. Jennifer is very responsive once you make your booking. The private room was just as nice as some hotels. A well decorated, spacious, colorful room with all the items you need to relax.
39854	7763298	10.0	9.0	54191072	This was an awesome place to stay! Very friendly people and a very welcoming atmosphere!
39855	7763298	10.0	9.0	54289274	It was an amazing huge space...surprising given that it looks like a small house from the outside!  We loved our stay.  Clean, comfortable, and quiet.
39856	7763298	10.0	9.0	55935473	Very spacey and clean room !! I will definitely recommend friends and family to this house if they are visiting Seattle
39857	7763298	10.0	9.0	56320343	Jennifer's place is very clean and cozy, we had a good time staying there. Jennifer is very thoughtful even tho we never had the chance to meet her. There were bottle waters  in the room for the guest, blow dryer in the bathroom drawer (which is very awesome!!) Thank you Jennifer!  
39858	7763298	10.0	9.0	56812018	謝謝你們親切的招待,房間就像照片裡的ㄧ樣乾淨寬敞又舒適!地點也很好離公車站不遠交通方便!很喜歡這次的旅行 :)
39859	7763298	10.0	9.0	57371308	The host is very helpful with our questions and requests. The place is big and clean and it is only 15 minutes away to downtown. I will definitely go back if I visit Seattle again in the future. 
39860	7763298	10.0	9.0	58007223	My stay was very pleasing and enjoyable due to the spacious room. The pictures that are presented are an accurate depiction of the room. The host was accommodating as well because he provided toiletries when the supply was low. Overall, I was pleased with my experience!
39897	41401	10.0	9.0	85048	"Pina is simply the best!

She adds little touches on your arrival that make you feel very welcome, and she is charming!

The place is very comfortable and has easy public transport wherever you want to go in the city. The apartment has every comfort of home.  We saved quite a bit of money by cooking the meals there.

She adds little touches on your arrival that make you feel very welcome.  All summed up... she simply went above and beyond to make our stay a good one.

Highly recommended!



"
39898	41401	10.0	9.0	91220	Our stay was great. Pina was very welcoming and did she whatever she could to make our stay as pleasant as possible!  
39899	41401	10.0	9.0	105282	Pina was the best, she was very accomidating to our needs as well as respected our privacy. The accommodations were simple but everything we needed. The place is very convenient to all attractions in and around Seattle. Right on the transit line. The price is very competitive and for the money we could have not done any better. If returning to Seattle I would certainly check with Pina again.
39900	41401	10.0	9.0	109496	Pina's place is very comfortable and she is a great host.  A pleasant place and close to downtown Seattle.
39901	41401	10.0	9.0	137463	The host canceled my reservation 49 days before arrival.
39902	41401	10.0	9.0	139590	Wonderful hostess! Pina's place had all the amenities of home. Pina was very helpful. The apartment was so much better than staying in a hotel! Good location and easy I-5 access.
39903	41401	10.0	9.0	145252	Pina was very responsive and easy to work with. Due to the snow and the busy holiday week, I didn't get to see her accommodations myself, but my father said it was perfect for his visit. I'll keep Pina in mind for future visitors.
39904	41401	10.0	9.0	214967	Pina's place was perfect for our month long stay in seattle. There was plenty of privacy but she was around when we needed something and had lots of good tourist tips for us. The apartment is lovely and spacious and she even stocks it with cooking basics and snacks on your first day. The location is pretty ideal for venturing into the city although I would recommend having a rental car. Whenever we travel to seattle again we would definitely stay with pina again!
39905	41401	10.0	9.0	232736	The apartment is very well equipt complete with plenty of coffee, milk and cereal to get us started.  Everything was clean, nicely decorated and in a pleasant neighborhood.  Although the location is not close downtown Seattle, it is on a bus route that links with the new train to all city points.  It would work best for people with a car, however.
39906	41401	10.0	9.0	344221	"Property just right for one or a couple for an extended stay.  

Great hostess, charming, considerate and warm. "
39907	41401	10.0	9.0	468486	We stayed at Pina's suite in August 2011 for a few days... My hubby and I were welcomed by an amazing host and beautiful suite. It was charming, clean, and very cozy. It was also an excellent location!! We loved checking out the cool artist community in Georgetown, which was just a quick drive away. I would stay here again in heart beat! 
39908	41401	10.0	9.0	4902196	Outstanding, private apartment.  Pina is a marvelous Hostess!  Clean, fully furnished with kitchen, bath, cable, Wifi and even washer-dryer.  Great location that enables easy access to downtown.  Nearby markets and great neighborhood.  Walking distance to Georgetown and many community parks and trails.
39909	41401	10.0	9.0	5418628	Pina's home was perfect. Thank you!
39910	41401	10.0	9.0	6194139	Stayed here for the month of July.  Wonderful apartment and the kindest host.  You will not regret staying with Pina :) take care all!
39911	41401	10.0	9.0	6394653	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Pina. We were in Seattle visiting or daugher (who lives 5 minutes away) and this was an ideal place for us. The space was comfortable and had everthing we needed including clothes washer and dryer, which was very helpful. We would stay here again. 
39912	41401	10.0	9.0	8212061	Pina is absolutely incredible, both as a host and as a person. She respects your privacy but is always there when you need help or advice. She made our stay very pleasant and helped us get started in Seattle easily. The apartment is well furnished and has plenty of room. Will definitely recommend to everyone.
39913	41401	10.0	9.0	8881705	Pina was very kind during my stay in Seattle. The place is very comfortable and has everything you would ever need! I thoroughly enjoyed my month there and really felt at home. Thank you Pina!
39914	41401	10.0	9.0	10129843	Pina is very warm & welcoming and a real people person. The MIL suite is decorated nicely and has everything you need, making you feel right at home. The location is central and has quick access to many different areas of the city. I would recommend this charming home.
39915	41401	10.0	9.0	10402249	Started with handshakes left with sad hugs. Piña is a grand hostess, makes you not want to leave! Place is cozy and private, nice community and quiet just like the ad says, worth the money and the time. I wish I could live there! New customer and new friend!
39916	41401	10.0	9.0	12397022	My wife and I stayed with Pina during my wife's medical school (email hidden) hospital.  The hospital is only a 5 minute walk from Pina's place which was tremendously convenient, and there are other nearby locations that make this area walk and bike friendly (fruit stand, green space, Chief Sealth Trail).  The 60 bus stops close to the property and will take you into downtown.  It was a delight staying with Pina - she's super friendly, relaxed, and very responsive.  The arrangement in the suite is well-thought out with a particularly nice open plan kitchen / island area next to the living space.  We couldn't have hoped to find anything more suited to our needs.  If ever we need a short stay in this area again, we'll be sure to contact Pina.
39917	41401	10.0	9.0	16701276	"Pina was a wonderful host and this was a great place for my small family to stay during my internship. We were there for three months, and never had an issue come up with the apartment. If I ever find myself visiting Seattle again I will definitely see if this space is available. The area is very pretty and we enjoyed living close to multiple parks and a fruit stand.

If I had any complaint it is that the internet is slower than I'm used to, but this is mostly due availability in the area. For most people it shouldn't be a problem."
39918	41401	10.0	9.0	18791329	"The description is perfect, ""Home away from home"" I used to live in Seattle and staying at Pina's was like feeling at home. The apartment is clean, comfortable and convenient to most parts of town. Pina is there if you need her with a smile or leaves you alone to your privacy. I would recommend these accommodations for a ""home"" in Seattle."
39919	41401	10.0	9.0	23435340	"Pina was a lovely host.  She left us homemade muffins as well as juice and the refrigerator had some basic condiments as well.    The kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pans, etc. and I was very happy to have  a washer/dryer. 

The apartment is very warm and welcoming, is nicely decorated (by Pina!) and furnished and we felt at home immediately.  While this is technically a basement/garden apartment, it did not feel like it. 

The house is on a main street so it has good transit service, but there is no street noise in the unit.  The location is also very central to Seattle so it is a good jumping-off point to areas north, south, east and west via major interstates/highways.  There is also a biking/walking trail a half block away.  

Both the bed and the couch/futon were very comfortable, the linens were nice and there were plenty of extra pillows, blankets, etc.

We stayed for several months and were very happy.
"
39920	41401	10.0	9.0	30398804	Stayed 2 months with Pina during my initial visit to Seattle.  I needed a place near the VA hospital and this was  perfect.  Pictures on website were exact. This place is clean and huge for one person.  Pina is nice and friendly. She was available to answer any questions.  I recommend this place to anyone coming to Seattle. 
39921	41401	10.0	9.0	36167506	Pina was such a welcoming hostess!  She accommodated our family for 2 months, engaging in delightful conversations with us and our kids, inviting us to gatherings she hosted, and was readily accessible to answer questions when they arose.  The MIL apartment was quiet, ample space, clean, well-stocked kitchen and very comfortable for living in, especially with the addition of the relaxing yard.
39922	41401	10.0	9.0	39759737	Pina was a wonderful host!   She was easy going and very friendly, her mother in law apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for a month stay.  Easy access to the #60 bus that dropped right in front of Swedish Hospital for work,  great grill to cook dinners on and a nice cool apartment on the hot Seattle summer days!  We will certainly keep in touch when back in the area!  Many thanks!
41513	3208330	10.0	9.0	14174502	"Staying with Tiberio was awesome.

Where do I start?
- maybe it was the yummy breakfast that he cooked each morning
- the great conversations on a variety of topics
- the super comfortable bed
- the beautiful kitchen (check out the vegetable garden or the chicken coop!)

My stay with Tiberio was a 5/5, I highly recommend it.  His cooking was delicious (I had the pleasure of trying out his nettle pasta - yum!), his company was fun and communicating with him was easy.

"
41514	3208330	10.0	9.0	14837382	Staying with Tiberio was a pleasure. He was a very warm and welcoming host, the room was comfortable, and the neighborhood safe and walkable. Access to bus within a short walk but also free street parking if you have a rental car. If you like to cook, do take advantage of the beautiful well stocked kitchen, gardens full of green goodness, and fresh eggs. If you don't like to cook, no worries, just sit in the kitchen and hope that he will be cooking for an event as you get to be an official taste tester until you literally cannot put another piece of food in your mouth. Anything we needed, whether advice on great places to visit, a forgotten hairdryer, or an extra pillow, Tiberio accommodated. We came to Seattle to visit our daughter and in the course feel we found a true friend, twice the reason to come back. Lots of love to you, Tiberio, think you found your calling, xoxo - Theresa + Joe.
41515	3208330	10.0	9.0	15011618	"Our experience with Tiberio and his house in Ballard was just great. My wife and I stayed there for a couple of nights so we could tour around the breweries and enjoy the weekend. 

The house is really impressive. It is very clean and decorated with interesting pieces. The host is a chef and an artist and both of these professions are displayed prominently. The bedroom and bathroom that we used were upstairs and the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and the shower worked fine. 

The house is very conveniently located with easy access to Fremont, Ballard and downtown Seattle. We didn't take our car from the street parking hardly at all since it was easy to walk or take the bus to most of our destinations. 

We hardly saw our host during the stay. As a matter of fact, the only time we saw him was as we were leaving in the morning on our last day to drive back home. We didn't really spend much time at the house outside of sleeping. That being said, he was very accommodating  and was sure to help us with whatever we needed. There were eggs from his chicken coop for breakfast and coffee and bread was available as well. Tiberio is very friendly and I am sure he would have been fun to hang out with if we were at the house more, but we were more interested in going out on the town together, enjoying our weekend away from home. 

This was my first experience with Airbnb and I am very satisfied. I would highly recommend staying with Tiberio. I felt at home in his house and was very comfortable.
"
41516	3208330	10.0	9.0	15346651	Awesome host, passionate about food and life. We are lucky to get a chance to taste his cooking. It's simple and beautiful. Quiet, yet convenient location with downtown just 15mins away. I would love to visit Seattle and stay at here again.
41517	3208330	10.0	9.0	16561907	"Great knives... ;)

Tiberio is the consummate host. He really could run his own B&B and tries tenaciously to give that experience to his guests. The room was just great, very cozy and comfortable. The bed was high quality and really comfortable, there's also a dresser and closet, which was convenient. 

The ensuite bathroom was very clean and perfectly adequate. Tiberio provided big soft towels (but no face cloths; he's European, so bring your own if you use them) body wash, shampoo and blow dryer. And he had this liquid hand soap which just smelled heavenly and made me smile every time I used it. I should've gotten the name... 

There is a great washer/dryer and good Tide soap and Downey fabric softener was provided, which I really appreciated. Tiberio does not skimp on anything. He's quality all the way, and that is massively evident when you see his nearly commercial-grade kitchen which is just fabulous, and where I spent most of my time, especially to do my work. This is the dream kitchen I could only hope to have and I took home a lot of ideas -- especially to get better knives...lol.

Tiberio is super active and camps and hikes a lot, as I gather most Seattlites and Washingtonians do, so I didn't see him too much, but had interesting conversations with him when I did. He always asked me if I needed anything. He's good about responding to texts and very attentive. I asked him if he had a clothesline. I didn't really need it, but within 2 hours, he had put up a clothesline for me in the back yard. I needed index cards and came home and found a pile on the table. Tiberio is very relaxed and laid back and pretty much lets you run with things.

This was my first experience using Airbnb and it couldn't have been better. I generally don't feel comfortable staying at other people's homes, yet I felt completely comfortable here and Tiberio was an`instant friend. Every night I left school tired and weary, I truly felt like I was going ""home"" and not just to some strange temporary place. My schedule was rigorous so I really appreciated that aspect of the experience. 

   "
41518	3208330	10.0	9.0	16847189	"We had a wonderful stay at Tiberio's place. So far the best in our trip! The atmosphere in the photo's is really there. It is beautifull! Decoration and colours chosen with much uttermost care. Not only the room but also the patio is an enjoyable place to stay. Tiberio is a very kind and helpful host and made us feel very welcome. A pitty we didn't cook with him, but he wrote a beautiful book, so we could see what we missed, LOL.
The location is not very near to the center, but with the nearby busstop (3 min. walk) you can directly get to the center of Seattle for just 1$. We could also use the bicycles to visit the nearby premisses."
41519	3208330	10.0	9.0	17063884	My three friends and I traveled to Seattle to take in the sights and enjoy the North Pacific Coast.  We arrived hours before our check-in time but this didn't throw Tiberio off at all.  He gave us a quick tour of the place and then recommended two great breakfast places nearby: the Dish Cafe and Senor Moose.  This is when it pays to be hosted by an airbnb chef!  There is one queen sized bed in the private room and the other half of our quartet stayed in the basement where there is a full sized bed and futon available.  The house has lots of plants (both the front yard and integrated into the living space directly) and the fresh eggs directly from the hens was a novelty. We would usually go out early and return late so we didn't get to see much of Tiberio but he made us these amazing chocolate-covered cherries and a saffron cheese custard, both lovely gestures and delicious to boot. Street parking on the block was never a problem and the location near Ballard and Fremont was a bonus after our initial desire to stay near downtown Seattle for the tourist loop.  All in all a great experience.
41520	3208330	10.0	9.0	17235721	"I loved my time with Tiberio in his lovely home.  

The Place:  The kitchen is FANTASTIC!  It's a huge culinary kitchen with all the bells and whistles.  He did not have a class while I was there, but he cooked in it and just watching him was pretty cool.   It truly made my stay an exciting/unique experience.  My room was on the 2nd floor.  I had a full bathroom all to myself.  It was all very clean and he left instructions for everything just in case.  The wifi was super fast and it is decorated nicely.  There is plenty of parking in the street and easy to get to. He has put a lot of thought into making things comfortable for his guests. 

The Host:  I love Tiberio.  He is one of those people that instantly you want to be friends with.  I was traveling alone and needed some suggestions on the area.  Tiberio not only suggested a few things but he also took me out with him one of the nights.  We road his scooter to downtown and looked at art, went to the park and ate at a local Turkish restaurant.  (The best I've ever eaten).  He knows just about everyone in the city so we were never without company.  He made my vacation, really.  He set me up on where to go next on my road trip and called a few host friends.  I'm so glad I stayed here!  Not only did I have a blast, but now I have a friend in Seattle.  :-)

Communication and Check-in:  Tiberio confirmed my booking within an hour.  Leading up to my trip Tiberio sent me a few text messages to prepare me for the trip, suggestions, check-in info, etc.  I got in after 10pm at night.  Tiberio gave me a lock box code to get in and left the light on.  His house was easy to find even in the dark.  "
41521	3208330	10.0	9.0	17693179	Tiberio is an amazing, interesting and wonderful host. On our first morning, we woke up to the smell of coffee and fresh bread, and once up and about we had the most intriguing first conversation which made us feel completely at home with Tiberio. He expressed warmth and generosity to our kids as well. The rooms were spotless and the atmosphere relaxing and fun. Our last night was capped off with a cooking class in Italian food with friends and Tiberio made sure that the atmosphere was relaxed and the food scumptious. Thank you Tiberio. We will be back. Love Berit, Aksel, Elizabeth & Ritchie
41522	3208330	10.0	9.0	17884202	"Seattle is a great place to visit, and this trip my friend François and I were treated to a home away from home with Tiberio. Tiberio's hospitality was genuine and relaxed. It included some food, a glass of wine, and an impromptu cooking lesson. 

The house and its bedrooms and bathrooms is very clean. You share the space with Tiberio but it is big and bright. 

The neighbourhood is safe and leafy. A short 1/2 block walk to the bus stop gets you on a quick 20-25 bus ride to downtown. Downtown late? A $25 taxi ride (tip included) brings you home if you're out past midnight. 

We didn't take him up on it, but there are bikes to ride and parks nearby. The Fremont neighbourhood is fairly close.

Tiberio is a chef, he is social and there is always something happening in the house, whether is preparing for a big catering gig or a fellow chef dropping by for a chat.

Thank you Tiberio for a great time, we will be back! 

Bill & François"
41523	3208330	10.0	9.0	18120140	The listing was accurate, we loved the neighbourhood. We are very self sufficient and loved the kitchen and fresh eggs but I think many people booking a b and b would think the host would be there to do breakfast. It was well described and I think accurate.
41524	3208330	10.0	9.0	18283228	This was our 1st experience staying in an airbnb home and it was a wonderful one. We were not fortunate enough to meet our host. However he sent very welcoming emails and was very accommodating regarding helping us out with a second sleeping space. He offered fresh eggs from his hens which we did not stay long enough to take advantage of.  Room was very private, clean and I loved the windows. Having an attached bath was a bonus.  I would definitely stay here again.
41525	3208330	10.0	9.0	18417026	What a beautiful, welcoming home! My partner and I so enjoyed our stay in Seattle, in part because of this lovely house. Tiberio is a chef and an artist. Cannot rave enough on how much I adored his home. 
41526	3208330	10.0	9.0	18736495	Staying at Tiberio's was absolutely wonderful. The place is impeccable, super welcoming, spacious, and private. He is definitely my go-to person in Seattle no questions asked. 
41527	3208330	10.0	9.0	18991891	We had a great time at Tiberio's house. We didn't spend too much time at the house, but the area was perfect, it was close enough to downtown but far enough away from the traffic and bustle of the downtown area. There are a lot of nice restaurants and parks near the house. Parking was easy to find on Tiberio's street. The room was exactly as described and felt private as it was on the top floor. Tiberio wasn't home the whole time we were there, but he made everything very easy to find and arranged others to be available in case we had any problems. Overall it was a great place to stay and was exactly as described. (I was happy to see there was a hair dryer in our room, which was convenient because I had forgotten mine!)
41528	3208330	10.0	9.0	19292415	Tiberio is the warmest, kindest host we have ever met! The room was exactly as pictured and his home is very beautiful. Lovely neighborhood within walking distance to shops, pubs and restaurants. Tiberio made us feel at home right away; He even cooked us breakfast with fresh veggies from his garden, and fresh eggs from his hens - quite a treat!! If you're looking for an engaging and warm B & B experience, this is definitely the place. 
41529	3208330	10.0	9.0	19684575	We stayed at Tiberio's house in Ballard for 5 days this past week.  Our stay was outstanding.  From the moment we arrived, we had seamless service and communication with Tiberio; the room was clean and comfortable and we had an abundant selection of breakfast items including free-range eggs from his chicken coop.  The highlight of the trip was hanging out with Tiberio himself.  He's a generous and gracious host.  Each day we had a lovely engagement with Tiberio including great conversations, taking us for a beautiful morning hike at Discovery Park, a 5-star breakfast, and a Italian cooking and conversation class one evening.   He even drove us to the Clipper Ferry terminal on our way home.  We will definitely be back next time we're in Seattle. 
41530	3208330	10.0	9.0	19952671	Tiberio's home is just as cool as it looks on the listing. Tiberio was warm and welcoming, and we felt very comfortable there. And you can't beat the fresh eggs! They don't come any fresher. The Greenwood neighborhood was great, shops and restaurants nearby, and easy access to the rest of Seattle. Was able to avoid I-5 for most of our stay.
41531	3208330	10.0	9.0	20111639	Tiberio's house was as great as him! It felt like home the moment we arrived. The room is nice and clean with a private bathroom and you can use the awesome kitchen. If you are lucky you will be able to taste Tiberio's cooking, he's a great chef. He also gave us lots of useful tips on the city. Great Airbnb experience!
41532	3208330	10.0	9.0	20258708	Tiberio was warm friendly and the perfect host.
41533	3208330	10.0	9.0	20342885	Tiberio was just great. Very cool space. We got in a bit late and my wife was tired so she went to bed. I was hungry and tiberio was kind enough to whip up a little pasta for me. It was delicious. Very nice guy! Made a great breakfast the morning we left and we were not expecting that. I would recommend his home for sure.
41534	3208330	10.0	9.0	20580090	My older parents and my mobility impaired husband and I had a WONDERFUL stay with Tiberio! His house is a rebuilt masterpiece, creative and inviting. Tiberio himself is SO wonderful, warm and friendly and WHAT A COOK! If you can have him cook for you then do so- watching him cook is like watching a dancer and the food is amazing. He went outside to pick the veggies right before he cooked them and he let me pick the eggs from the chicken coop my self. Fresh is best! I wish we had been there for a cooking class, my father would have loved that. If I was a teacher of ANYTHING food related I would love to host a class there, the space is custom built for food and large groups. Tiberio is a wonderful artist with a great book out on food and life which my retired minister father and my mom loved to look through, and our copy sits beside me now. His artistry shows through the whole home and he does most of the work him self, a true craftsman/artist. My husband and I stayed up late chatting with Tiberio after my parents went to have a wonderful quiet nights sleep in their big upstairs bed with private bathroom. Tiberio waived the 'shoes off' policy for my older parents, which was nice. My parents had never even conceived of something like Air BnB and they were very impressed with how fun it was. We discovered Tiberio even fished with a friend of ours, small world! Prepare yourselves for a fun night of stories and celebration if you want, or like my parents did you could just crash early ahead of a big day of travel. Stay as long as you can and enjoy this wonderful man and his lovely house. 
41535	3208330	10.0	9.0	20829749	"Tiberio is a gracious and catering host that will make you feel right at home in his beautiful idyllic home nestled in one of Seattle's nicest neighborhoods.  A culinary wizard, he has created an amazing kitchen/living space where nothing is wasted and everything is in reach.  One of the highlights of our trip was sharing an evening of culinary exploration with our host, who is not only a great cook but a generous and warm human being.  He tempers his outgoing personality with a courteous respect for your privacy, making sure you feel comfortable and relaxed.
The room was clean and the bed cozy, a very nice base from which to explore the surrounding area which is chock full of excellent eateries and cafes.  We will definitely stay here next time we visit Seattle."
41536	3208330	10.0	9.0	20972501	Tiberio was a very walm, welcoming host! We were able to have a flexible check-in time, borrow his bikes (with helmets and locks) to cruise around the city, and slept very comfortably in the private upstairs room. The kitchen is just as amazing as it looks in the pictures and the water pressure in the shower was awesome! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!
41537	3208330	10.0	9.0	21310326	"I needed a place to stay that was relatively close to my friend's place (couldn't stay with her since she has cats). Tiberio's place was perfect! The room and bathroom were VERY clean. Neighborhood was quiet and I felt safe walking around.  Plenty of restaurants, shops, bookstores and, of course, coffee shops in the Greenwood and Ballard neighborhoods. 

Tiberio was very welcoming and just has a great energy about him. I wish I had time to utilize the kitchen and take advantage of the fresh eggs but I had a pretty busy schedule. I will definitely stay at his place again next time I'm up in Seattle."
41538	3208330	10.0	9.0	21541312	Tiberio has a lovely home.  It is as beautiful and creative as the photo suggests.  He cooked us a breakfast of eggs, roasted pumpkin squash and and a side salad with tomatoes from the garden.   I would love to stay with Tiberio again.
41539	3208330	10.0	9.0	21897459	"We received a warm welcome by Tiberio that showed us the place, it was simply perfect for us. A big, fully equipped and comfortable open space kitchen with nice couch next to the window for your last glass of wine. Tiberio leaves fresh eggs from his chickens every day, or if you prefer you can pick them up directly from the coop. Rooms and bathrooms are really clean. Really nice neighborhood at  only 10 mins from downtown and 5 mins from greenlake. Tiberio is really nice and loved to share with us his amazing recipes, including wild mushrooms he pick up everyday from the forest. He had good suggestions about things to do. Him and his place exceeded our expectations. If you want to be in a quite, clean and quality place near to main Seattle attractions...that's the place to be.
"
41540	3208330	10.0	9.0	22030493	 Both Tiberio and his place are warm and unique.  He's an incredible chef and it was wonderful to  watch him cook, watch him teach others and get to try his yummy food.  His place is full of personal and creative touches both in culinary and interior design.  A thoughtful host, Tiberio has been meticulous in setting up his place as an inviting bnb experience to remember.    
41541	3208330	10.0	9.0	22677935	My stay with Tiberio was so wonderful! Guest room is private and clean and comfortable. Location is good for public transportation so you don't need a car and he gave great directions from airport. He is very welcoming from the minute you step into his lovely home and an added bonus is he's an amazing chef! I would recommend staying there if you are going to Seattle.
41542	3208330	10.0	9.0	32629537	Staying at Tiberio's home in Seattle was truly a wonderful and adventurous experience. My partner and I were in town to visit some friends and we needed a place that was comfortable and convenient. It was easy to jump on the bus on 8th Ave to head into downtown. Coming in from Canada, we arrived quite late. However, Tiberio was very flexible and welcoming. We were greeted with some delicious food that Tiberio prepared: smoked geoduck, smoked scallops, and a delicious lentil stew. The bedroom was spotless and very comfortable. Again, we were greeted with more snacks! Chocolate with nuts, home-made meringues, and scrumptious dried figs. Wow. Later we bumped into our host and he showed us his chickens and invited us to harvest some eggs the next morning. Again, Tiberio fed us with delicious treats: moist lemon cake, and home-made kombucha. Out of all of our stays with Airbnb, we've never had such a wonderful experience. Thank you Tiberio!
41543	3208330	10.0	9.0	33265043	"Tiberio lives in a quiet, classic Seattle neighborhood; lots of fun houses to look at, close to bus, and easy walk to neighborhood shops.   He has made an amazing transformation of his own home, and the photos only begin to tell the story - wonderful!  Tiberio is a very welcoming and warm person, fun and interesting to converse with, very creative, very knowledgeable - especially concerning anything ""food"" - he also is very respectful of privacy.
Tiberio obviously goes the extra mile with preparation for guests - the house is very clean and tidy.  Also our room had a beautiful bouquet, comfy bed, and a very special tray of home made treats to welcome us.  Tiberio is  very creative with reuse and repurposing which is a delight to notice - he is also a forager and we witnessed the entire wood table you see in the picture covered with morels!!  Thats alota morels!!  He made us a delicious midnight snack of the most perfect Morel Carbanara ever, and then taught us how to make it, as well."
41544	3208330	10.0	9.0	34089797	Tiberio was incredibly gracious. He provided us breakfast, great conversation, and shared some wonderful stories. He invited us to a dinner party with his friends! Just an incredibly warm, cheerful person. The house is beautiful and in an incredible location. We were able to easily get around and enjoy all of Seattle. Of the many AirBnB's we've stayed at, this is easily one of the best. Tiberio is simply an incredible host and a joy to be around. 
41545	3208330	10.0	9.0	34347671	"Do not hesitate to book this place! Tiberio is a REALLY cool guy. He was very friendly and eager to share his passion for good food! He even cooked us an amazing lunch on our arrival.

His home is conveniently located near downtown Seattle and is one of the most unique Airbnbs we've ever seen. 

I wish we could've stayed longer! Hopefully we'll get the chance to stay at his place again next time we're in the Seattle area."
41546	3208330	10.0	9.0	34801134	"Tiberio is absolutely fantastic. We had an excellent experience. The room is very private, on the top floor around a staircase. Incredibly unique culinary experience, given that Tiberio operates a cooking school and urban farm out of his home! He was more than willing to let us try out anything he happened to be making, and often left delicious ""treats"" for us to sample. Very convenient to public transport, and has bikes available to his guests! Honestly, I can't recommend Tiberio enough!"
41547	3208330	10.0	9.0	35226883	Our stay with Tiberio was an excellent experience.  Tiberio was a gracious host and made us feel comfortable.  He was very helpful with questions on where to eat and what to do.  His place is in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to a great little shopping/eating area.  Tiberio's house was immaculately clean and the room was spacious and private.  I think the best thing about staying with him was his interest in us feeling comfortable.  I was impressed that he asked what he could do better or how he could improve our experience.  I know if I ever go to Seattle again I want to stay at Tiberio's.
41548	3208330	10.0	9.0	35408966	"Amazing amazing Tiberio. Wonderful host, excellent chef, great friend (also has green thumbs).
My husband, my 2 year-old son and I stayed for two nights at Tiberio’s beautiful, clean, interesting and cozy house. We really wished we would have stayed longer. He was so generous even to offer us to use his king sized bed in the master’s bedroom for he was worried for my son to fell off the bed upstairs, but the bed was big enough and comfortable. Also, Tiberio let my son pick up the eggs from the chicken coop (my son loved your chickens), made us delicious dinner with fresh veggies from his garden and fresh eggs from the coop and... (I could list up all the menu, but it will be long), shared great conversation with his company,,,, Ah! lots to say, but my heart is full with happiness. Everything happened at Tiberio's was perfect.

Thank you Tiberio, we love you (and we will be back)

Kanako, Sergio & Shintaro"
41549	3208330	10.0	9.0	35821592	Tiberio wasn't able to be there when we first arrived due to a friend's emergency, but he left clear instructions and had let us know in advance.  His home is colorful and comfortable, and well located.  We enjoyed our stay there very much and would recommend it to others.
41550	3208330	10.0	9.0	36378536	Tiberio is a great, friendly, very interesting host with many interests, accomplishments and stories to tell. Nice quiet clean room and bathroom on their own floor. Woke up each day in quiet neighborhood with basket of fresh eggs from his chickens (quiet) to make breakfast in an amazing,  unique kitchen.  Bus into downtown Seattle 1 block away.  Really nice town along Greenwood Ave. 3 blocks away. Can walk to Enterprise car rental.  Took amazing day trips to Paradise in Mt Rainier NP and to Hurricane Ridge in Olympic NP. Highly recommended! 
41551	3208330	10.0	9.0	36824351	We had an Amazing time and Tiberio was so thoughtful and gracious! We had everything we needed and his location is perfect! 
41552	3208330	10.0	9.0	37394102	"Tiberio was a great host! His home is beautiful, he is obviously very passionate about the art of cooking.

I would highly recommend staying at his home!"
41553	3208330	10.0	9.0	38175655	Tiberio's house was one of the most interesting, creative places I have ever stayed. He has transformed his home into a culinary experience!! Thank you for offering this place to visitors of the great city of Seattle. We were sorry that missed meeting you! 
41554	3208330	10.0	9.0	38925346	"We loved everything about Tiberio's! Including Tiberio! The house is amazing... Full of character, yummy snacks (love the Kampucha!), and thoughtful touches (like the prosecco & treats at our arrival for our anniversary!). The neighborhood is a foodie capital and Tiberio's bikes made it easy to get around!  We will be back for sure!!
"
41555	3208330	10.0	9.0	39295451	"First my communications with Tiberio had some Italian exchanges so that was fun, but then he started addressing me as ""darling"" and ""dear"" and that was odd since we didn't know each other. But then somehow there was a lot of miscommunication because he said he wasn't going to be there but that a friend would meet me. When I got there there was no one and I sat waiting in 100 degree heat on the porch. When I finally got a text back (thru airbnb) I had already left the porch and gone to find dinner. I returned in the dark and the house was all dark. I had to figure out the key system and let myself in. All the windows were shut tight and it was boiling inside. No fans in sight and no AC. The room, especially at night, does not look bright and cheery as it does in the pix. Black linens and black curtains make it very goth seeming. And pictures of things on fire on the walls. It was creepy being there alone and very hot without fans. I saw no one for my whole visit. And the location without a car would be very far from most anything."
41556	3208330	10.0	9.0	39733994	The house inside and out is colorful. We were greeted by a lush vegetable garden in the front yard along with the tallest of sunflowers. We did not meet Tiberio during our visit but we did talk briefly with Dario, who was quite pleasant and gave us a tip for a sushi restaurant. The room was comfortable and we sampled fresh eggs one morning. The location is convenient to several different neighborhoods.
41557	3208330	10.0	9.0	40628380	"Tiberio is a great host! He made us feel at home the moment we arrived and also for the rest of the trip! The bedroom is clean, well decorated, and very comfortable and offers total privacy as well with its own bathroom. Room stays cool at night if you keep the windows open during the summer and Tiberio also got us a fan for the room before it got hot outside (high of 90 during the day). 

The kitchen is great and has a lot of character. There was also some breakfast foods and fruits for us in the fridge, which was wonderful! 

Dario (other housemate) also gave us a lot of great suggestions on places to see and see in the city, which were spot on! There are also bikes at the house which you can take, which we took full advantage of! 

Overall I highly recommend staying at Tiberio's house. You'll love it! "
41558	3208330	10.0	9.0	40998553	Tiberio was the BEST! When we first arrived, he invited us to drop our bags and try out all of the amazing food he was preparing. The following days were full of a great sleep in a cozy room, more good food, and plenty of entertaining conversation. Neighborhood is continently located. Parking is easy. Highly recommended. Thanks, Tiberio! 
41559	3208330	10.0	9.0	44537695	It was great experience in staying at Tiberio's. He is very warmful and kind in improving guests' travel experience. If you enjoy cooking and having party，Tiberio is a very nice choice！
41560	3208330	10.0	9.0	45530844	Tiberio is awsome! as well as his house! I will definitely recommend to my friend who want to travel to Seattle.
41561	3208330	10.0	9.0	48424530	"I booked Tiberio's place for my employee Bryan, who had this to say, 
""I had a great time staying at Tiberio's house. It was walking distance for everything I needed during my stay. The freshly picked pears were an added bonus.""

Bryan did note that this is definitely a ""unique"" spot (and host), both with a lot of personality. He enjoyed the flavor, but it may not be for those seeking a less colorful, more ""generic"" experience."
41562	3208330	10.0	9.0	48794031	Tiberio's home was not only beautiful but full of a great energy. He was welcoming, friendly, and full of great stories. The neighborhood was perfectly situated between Phinney, Wallingford and Ballard... with loads of tiny book shops, cafes, unique stores... it was a perfect get away in a quiet neighborhood still close to everything! Having a private bathroom was nice too. The best surprise was Tibero cooked a dinner for us, which was divine, and we exchanged stories about travel and life. Would definitely return here. Cheers and thank you!!!
41563	3208330	10.0	9.0	49072774	The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
41564	3208330	10.0	9.0	49840819	Tiberio was an excellent host. He was very welcoming and checked in with me to make sure that I had what I needed. One night he even invited me to eat dinner with him and his friends. The meal he prepared came from the food he grew in the garden. The food was great and the company was very pleasant :) . The place itself is very creatively decorated, very clean, and in a nice, cute neighborhood. You will notice all the artistic touches from the front porch, to the inside, all the way to the backyard. Even though the street looked full of cars, I never had an issue finding parking, regardless of the time of day or night. There is a cute little park down the street that was great for yoga and hula hooping. The neighborhood also was very safe to walk in (As a woman travelling alone, I found that to be very important). I would recommend this place! Enjoy your stay :) 
43057	958475	10.0	9.0	4790503	"When we arrived at the Annex, everything was arranged as it was listed on the website.  The entrance was locked with a keypad entry and automatic light for convenience and safety at night.   The first thing I noticed was how spacious the kitchen was, and fully stocked with an array of spices in addition to a collection of beautiful clean dishware and cooking equipment.  The kitchen was equipped with everything I needed to cook meals during my stay, as well as some additional perks (tasty little cookies that were provided by the owners, coffee, cooking oil). The bathroom was impeccably clean and had a neat little tub with floors that were always warm, basic toiletries, and clean soft towels available. The living room boasted a comfortable couch and a large window overlooking the sculptures in the backyard, in addition to the flatscreen TV with streaming Netflix, Pandora and Crackle movies. There was a nice gas fireplace which heated the room promptly when turned up.  The laundry room was shared with the owners in the nearby garage and was stocked with everything I needed. Since it was priced so competitively online I thought that when I arrived it would be a smaller place, but I it was spacious and comfortable, with large beds that were nicer than the one that I have at home. 
As hosts, Bruce and Shannon went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  The offered us a bicycle to ride as well as advice on local hangouts and grocery stores.   They were quick to offer their assistance at any time needed, and were even gracious enough to provide us with a sample of beer from a local craft brewery.  The last thing I will mention are the decorations within the apartment- Bruce and Shannon are obviously artists and as such have customized the annex with very unique décor, from the bedrooms to the bathrooms, this place is covered with cool things to look at and explore.  I can’t stress enough how happy I was to have found the place, it was definitely the best value in town. If you want to stay in a unique, comfortable apartment with a central location and generous owners who ensure the happiness of their guests, look no further and book a stay at the Studio Annex!
"
43058	958475	10.0	9.0	4969193	"Our accommodations were clean and cozy! The decorations are unique in that they are a composite of ""retro country"" with a Texas flavor. The furnishings include a complete kitchen and all accessories, with a little extra in ""emergency"" food if needed. This apartment is truly a delightful place."
43059	958475	10.0	9.0	5044485	Bruce and Shannon's apartment was absolutely wonderful.  You can tell that a lot of love was put into it.  Every time I came in I noticed a unique detail that I hadn't before.  I loved it.  They also have an immense knowledge of the area and are active in the community.  They gave us so many pointers on places to go and things to do.  It was great.  We couldn't have asked for better hosts.
43060	958475	10.0	9.0	5227953	Bruce and Shannon were great hosts! We had an amazing time and a fabulous studio to stay in. The rooms and kitchen were a pretty good size, considering this is a studio. The beds were quite comfortable. Overall, the studio offered all the amenities from home. You will love it!!
43061	958475	10.0	9.0	5316213	Studio Annex was absolutely wonderful! Fascinating and comfortable. Bruce and Shannon were very nice and helpful. We enjoyed our stay immensely.
43062	958475	10.0	9.0	5454324	"Thank you Bruce & Shannon for being such great hosts and you're place was the perfect place for our 1st experience here on Airbnb.  You're place was in a great location, private, unique in more ways than one and very accommodating.  It had everything we needed and it really felt like a home away from home.  We will definitely be back to stay at your place once we come back to Seattle and recommend it to anyone who is wanting to visit because it is just simply awesome!  We appreciated your offer to let us stay another night free of charge because of the emergency appendectomy surgery that my girlfriend's sister had to endure on her vacation!  Thankfully everything went well and we didn't have to cancel the rest of our trip.  We are thankful for your understanding and will remember your kindness.  Hope to see you again sometime in the future!

-Chris, Stacie and Carisa"
43063	958475	10.0	9.0	5730487	"Staying at the Studio Annex was an amazing, relaxing, memorable experience.  I've put off writing a review because it is hard to say enough good things about the apartment and the hosts!  Every inch of the apartment is designed with creativity, and the word ""pristine"" doesn't adequately convey how perfectly and immaculately it is maintained.  Bruce and Shannon have thought of everything, as well -- including a mid-century cooler and picnic blanket, ground coffee in the larder, and a smattering of DVD's, in case one needs to cocoon one evening.  The beds were very comfortable, and I am a picky sleeper.  We stayed for 8 nights, and we loved taking our coffee at the outdoor table which offered enough privacy we could take our coffee in our pj's.  (And the bubbly water feature was very relaxing.)  The al fresco dining area was so pleasant we brought lunch home some days to enjoy the apartment further!  One morning was crisp and too cool to coffee outdoors, so we took our coffee inside, in front of the fire, which felt very luxurious.

The location can't be beat.  We walked to the International District for exploration and meals, the bus was nearby, and it was a very short drive to the airport.

I can't recommend the apartment or the hosts enough.  Bruce and Shannon are incredibly talented, creative, and generous people, and if I am ever returning to Seattle -- which I hope I will -- I plan on staying with them again."
43064	958475	10.0	9.0	5909181	We had a wonderful time staying in The Annex!  Everything about it was comfortable, inviting and wonderfully decorated. Fantastic proximity to Capitol Hill. We would stay there again in a New York minute!
43065	958475	10.0	9.0	5986365	Great home base for our adventures in Seattle. The suite was very clean and exactly like in the pictures (great decor).  Lots of little extras to make our stay comfortable.
43066	958475	10.0	9.0	6088952	"This place was great! Bruce and Shannon were super quick to respond to all my many questions of where and what before our trip. While we didn't see much of them after our first meeting (and only then because we had arrived earlier than our appointed time while they were still cleaning and preparing the place), there were enough thoughtful details throughout the place that showed them to be very gracious hosts.

The coded access was convenient and everything we could need was provided - towels, toothpaste, soap, wifi and kitchen stuff. I love how they posted a detailed guide for the house and provided travel brochures for Seattle.

The place would definitely be big enough for a family of 4 or even 6 (the 2 of us were comfortable though). The location too was perfect. It was easy to find just off the freeway and fairly convenient by bus to get to town and where we wanted to go.

Last but not least, the artistic elements were a great introduction/welcome to the creative culture of Seattle.

All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend Bruce and Shannon's studio."
43067	958475	10.0	9.0	6263198	Far Above and beyond what we were hoping for. Thank You, Bruce and Shannon, for an awesome stay! This place was absolutely perfect for the four of us (my husband and me, his brother and girlfriend). It was well kept with great decor and interior details. We cooked breakfasts and dinners in the kitchen which was stocked with spices. It was an easy walk from the light rail to the house with blackberry bushes in bloom along the way. Everything about this place was exactly what we wanted, and we are excited to stay here again when we make it back to Seattle! 
43068	958475	10.0	9.0	6344833	We LOVED staying at Bruce & Shannon's house during our stay in Seattle.  We (family of 2 adults & 2 kids) loved how cool & funky the space is; it seemed like we were constantly discovering something we hadn't seen before in the house. The house is PERFECT for a family, couple or even girl's get away. It was immaculately clean, kitchen was stocked well and there was even a bottle of Bruce's homebrew waiting for us in the fridge.  Bruce & Shannon are great hosts!
43069	958475	10.0	9.0	6487780	Bruce and Shannon were fabulous hosts! The apartment was incredibly well appointed,clean and with such thoughtful detail to the traveler's every need. The beds were very comfy. Really, this was the perfect spot for our family to spend a terrific week on Seattle. 
43070	958475	10.0	9.0	6934168	Wonderful! What a gem of design, comfort, cleanliness and quality. Amazing kitchen amenities-even spices. 5-star towels and bed linens. Bruce and Shannon's place is a trophy for the AirBnB concept. 
43071	958475	10.0	9.0	7137970	"Thank you Bruce and Shannon! Our stay at your place was all we expected and more and would certainly stay there again. Beds were as comfortable as your other guests stated previously. The close proximity to downtown was great. We enjoyed having all the comforts of home. Your creativity throught the place was admired by all of us! I will and would recommend your place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!
Thanks again for everything,

43072	958475	10.0	9.0	7188318	The house is incredibly well-designed. you will love the place if you like vintage-style-house. It was the most stylish  house.. :) and they were quick and nice.
43073	958475	10.0	9.0	7329216	Bruce and Shannon's home is absolutely beautiful. Its photos don't do it justice. Its location was nice and close to downtown. We would definitely recommend this home to anybody visiting Seattle. 
43074	958475	10.0	9.0	7560264	Everything I envisioned and more! An excellent collection of vintage furniture and decor, making for a unique home away from home experience. The heated tiles on the bathroom floor was a pleasant surprise as well. Very charming annex and neighborhood. Hopefully you get greeted by their adorable dogs as well! 
43075	958475	10.0	9.0	7733882	"From the moment I stepped into Studio Annex, I felt at ease, for both Bruce and Shannon were there to welcome me with warm smiles.

Bruce and Shannon have done a great job of creating a beautiful and comforting space that's filled with character. My friends and I all felt at home. So much in fact, that we stayed in and relaxed a little more than we should have. And I was super impressed that they had everything set up for easy recycling, and eco-friendly supplies. No other host has had any of that available before.

So in all, I would definitely stay again! Thank you Bruce and Shannon!"
43076	958475	10.0	9.0	7923542	Had an amazing time staying at this house! It was perfect for the four of us and hosts had everything all set for us. Will definitely be staying again when we go back up to Seattle. 
43077	958475	10.0	9.0	8190175	What a cool place!  As soon as I walked in I really loved the feel of the Studio Annex.  Given that I'm from Texas I enjoyed the touches of home that was found through out the place.  It had all of the comforts of home as well.  Shannon and Bruce were always around to help with anything we needed or to answer questions we might have.  Although the international district isn't far I still found it very convenient to have a car, but I'm from a place where I'm used to having a vehicle.  It only look 5 to 10 minutes to get to downtown which was perfect and it was a great location to get in and out of Seattle to do some exploring around Washington State.  I will absolutely stay here again next time I'm coming to Seattle.  Thanks guys for a wonderful stay! 
43078	958475	10.0	9.0	8351641	"The annex is a great place to stay in Seattle! My boyfriend and I stayed for a week and were very comfortable. Even though it's south of most things to do in Seattle, the distance is not far at all and the house is very easy to reach from the highway. Most parts of town are within a 10-15 minute drive.

Bruce and Shannon are very professional and have thought of most things a guest could ever need (including a first-aid kit and emergency toiletries in the bathroom). They're very hands-off hosts, and the annex has a separate entrance so you feel like you have a private space, and you are not intruding on the hosts' home. 

The heated floor in the bathroom is a nice touch, and the gas fireplace is also great to relax by after a busy day. "
43079	958475	10.0	9.0	8839146	This place is amazing. The fireplace, full kitchen, and stocked bathroom and bedrooms were all so comfortable. Bruce and Shannon are great hosts, and have thoughtfully included emergency sewing kits, extra toiletries, and even some great reading material (books on Klimpt and Picasso!). Bruce was also very helpful with tuning up the bikes we took out, and pointing out some different sights to see around their place. It was also really easy to take the bus/light rail to and from the airport. This is an incredible place to stay in Seattle!! 
43080	958475	10.0	9.0	8982156	The rental was clean, comfortable and artsy. There were a lot of supplies stocked for personal care in case someone forgot toothpaste, toothbrush etc. There were plenty of blankets and comforters and some food items such as coffee and oatmeal. If I need a place to stay in Seattle in the future, I will definitely look to see if this place is open before checking elsewhere and would recommend to others.
43081	958475	10.0	9.0	9112210	"Just to say that the decoration of the apartment it is even better than the pictures, home sweet home. You are really close to Seattle Downtown. Bruce was really helpfull. In the house you can find everything that you would need to feel like home, even bike to ride to Seattle. 
If I return to Seattle, I will stay there again.

"
43082	958475	10.0	9.0	9763673	My husband & I could not have been more impressed! This space is amazing!! We will definitely be back. This was our first airbnb experience. Our friends who live in Seattle were so impressed they wanted to check it out! There was more hospitality here than at most B&B's & we have been to a ton all over. I wish we could've stayed longer...Thanks so much Bruce & Shannon! 
43083	958475	10.0	9.0	9853959	"What a lovely experience! The pictures do not do the place justice. Anything and everything we could possibly need was at our disposal (and then some!). 

By mere fate/chance we had the pleasure of meeting Bruce and Shannon at their little Trailer Park market (its amazing, ask them about it!) and they are just as lovely and adorable as their home. If and when I ever get back to Seattle, this will definitely be my first choice! (Seriously, Bruce and Shannon - if you ever decide to rent, let me know!)"
43084	958475	10.0	9.0	9961123	The Studio Annex is a great place to stay! It's very clean, cozy, and the decor is awesome. Bruce & Shannon were accommodating to our schedule and were kind enough to leave the lights on for us on the evening of our (very late) arrival. The private keyless entry was also very convenient. Bonus for you runners/walkers/cyclists out there: There is a great running path mere steps from the front door! I took it all the way to the waterfront and enjoyed a jogging tour through the neighborhood. You will not be disappointed with the Studio Annex! 
43085	958475	10.0	9.0	10001604	Wonderful value for this two-bedroom apartment in Central District. Hosts were welcoming and flexible, and were nice enough to text me to let me know about items I'd left behind. Fireplace and TV in the living room nice treats. Interesting aesthetic and care devoted to the set up.
43086	958475	10.0	9.0	10179082	my boyfriend and our two friends stayed in this awesome suite for the weekend. it was conveniently located in a quiet neighbourhood - only a ten dollar cab ride to downtown! the place itself is decorated immaculately. very americana, right up our alley. there was ample space for the four of us. everything which was necessary for a bed and breakfast was provided - all the toiletries, netflix, coffee, etc. we never met Bruce and Shannon, but with a keypad entry, check in and out was seamless. definitely would stay here again!
43087	958475	10.0	9.0	10345876	Bruce was very friendly and quickly responded during my stay with questions about location. The apartment is central to bus and train lines, beautifully decorated, and very clean. 
43088	958475	10.0	9.0	10426301	Bruce and Shannon were wonderful hosts. Not only did the house have all of the amenities, but the the hospitality was above and beyond. Our car got broken into on the street and Bruce and Shannon helped to clean the car of glass and bandage our broken window. Very nice people.
43089	958475	10.0	9.0	10875859	I don't think we could have found a better place to stay in Seattle. Super quiet neighborhood located minutes from downtown, complete with excellent amenities and wonderfully creative decor. Our luggage was lost by the airline our first night, so the emergency cabinet stocked with toothbrush/paste and other necessities really came in handy. There's also a really cool paved bike/running trail just down from the place that leads to full views of the downtown Seattle area as well as various parks and playgrounds. We can't say enough good things about our experience at this artistic hideaway. Will definitely be the first place we look next time we plan a visit to Seattle.
43090	958475	10.0	9.0	11218135	The Seattle Studio Annex was amazing. My roommate and I could not believe how cute and comfortable the set-up was. There is nothing to be critical of here. The price, hospitality, and aesthetic were all really above and beyond the expectations that we had. I only wish I had had more time in town to just relax here, but attending a conference made that difficult. At any rate, when we were able to be at the Annex, it was very relaxing. 
43091	958475	10.0	9.0	11310355	This is an awesome spot in the heart of Seattle! Besides, Bruce and Shannon are great hosts. They really want to make of your stay an unforgettable experience!
43092	958475	10.0	9.0	11997371	This was a real find.  The two bedroom apartment was very comfortable, artistically decorated and every need had been anticipated. We enjoyed our stay, the space was private while our hosts were ready to accommodate us if we needed anything.  Having the availability of a washer and dryer was another plus. I give them the highest marks.
43093	958475	10.0	9.0	12331481	What a cool apartment!  Bruce and Shannon have done a spectacular job decorating this 2 bedroom apartment with funky/cool/interesting 'antiques'.  We cooked a few meals while staying, and were pleasantly surprised to find the kitchen very well stocked with the essentials.  We used the bus (bus stop is a very short walk away) and light rail to downtown, which was fairly convenient.  Overall, this was a great place to stay!
43094	958475	10.0	9.0	12832241	Our group of 5 had a great experience staying with Bruce and Shannon. The space was exactly as advertised, and the location was very convenient. Will definitely stay with them again next time we are in Seattle!
43095	958475	10.0	9.0	13073408	a great and comfortable place to stay, in a nice residential neighborhood. the place was spacious and clean. not too far from things you want to see in the city. we had a rental car, though, so i can't say for sure how easy it is to travel via public tranpo or by foo. but this was a fabulous apartment, and i would definitely stay here again. 
43096	958475	10.0	9.0	13280908	Great house! Bruce is very nice and helpful. Great stay.
43097	958475	10.0	9.0	14338800	The Annex was beautiful, just like the pictures. The host was very accommodating, and very kind. I never felt uncomfortable or unsafe. I would love to stay here again.
43098	958475	10.0	9.0	15034005	The apartment was very clean, safe and easy to find. Location is very convenient to get to the ball fields, downtown and space needle.
43099	958475	10.0	9.0	15311110	The rental was exactly just like the photos. We loved how unique the place looked. We felt like every corner we turned there was something neat and different. The place is well stocked. They thought of everything from umbrellas, to toothbrushes, and even have several map guides/magazines. This place was close to everything - pretty much a 10 - 15 minutes drive to anywhere in Seattle. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back again.
43100	958475	10.0	9.0	15868999	"Bruce and Shannon are great. We only saw both once each, and they were both wonderful hosts. So in terms of feeling like we had our own space we definitely did. 

It's a clean, inviting space. Lots of towels! :) We were there during some hot days so it was warm in the unit our first couple of nights - even with windows open and fans running, but it wasn't unbearable. And the PNW doesn't get a lot of hot days like that anyway, so it's not a huge deal. 

I think for 5 it's a little squeeze - especially with one bathroom, but we managed well. I'm 5'10"" and the shower was barely tall enough for me, so if you're a much bigger person you'll be bending down to take a shower. 

The location is fairly convenient to the Convention Center where we were at - 10 minute drive. There was street parking for free, too. 

All in all, a solid stay, although probably most suited for less people. "
43101	958475	10.0	9.0	16144012	Bruce and Shannon were great hosts.  While I didn't meet them (too much to see and do in Seattle!), they checked in during the stay.  The place is clean and very comfortable.  If you rent a car for the weekend, street parking was no problem at all!  I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay here.
43102	958475	10.0	9.0	16539426	The space was just as pictured!  What a lovely little spot  that had everything we needed.  We met Bruce and Shannon right when we arrived and they were so nice!  The house had plenty of towels, kitchen utensils and space for the three of us.  We were within minutes of the stadiums which was convenient since we had mariners tickets.  There was plenty of street parking available and a nice little path for walking/running right around the corner.  We would definitely stay again!  
43103	958475	10.0	9.0	16711228	My 3 friends and I had a great stay at Bruce and Shannon's place. My friend and I arrived early Monday morning and Bruce was accommodating when it came to storing our luggage. He provided us with information about what was around and directions to get there. The place was clean and well kept. Highly recommend staying here!  
43104	958475	10.0	9.0	16974090	We had a great stay with Bruce and Shannon.  They were helpful, but everything was prepared so there really wasn't any need to bother them.  The apartment is as fun as it looks in the photos.  Very creative and very cozy.
43105	958475	10.0	9.0	17262218	The annex was a great place to stay. It was very comfortable and Bruce and Shannon seemed to have thought of everything guests could want. The place is exactly as described. Getting around was easy. Would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. 
43106	958475	10.0	9.0	17554967	Finding and checking in to the suite was seamless, the hosts were easy to contact and left a binder with lots of info. We almost had as much fun exploring the artwork and antiques in the apartment as we did the city! The rooms were spacious and we had everything we needed, pillows, blankets, towels and a well appointed kitchen, although all we used was the coffee maker :) The hosts even leave extra toiletries in the medicine cabinet, they obviously take pride in hosting people and think of lots of little details. The neighborhood is so quiet at night, sleeping was a breeze. I would highly recommend this suite for a stay in Seattle. One little note, when I looked at the property on a map I thought it was walking distance to downtown but when I saw it in person I realized the freeway is in between this neighborhood and downtown, so I would recommend cabs or buses to get downtown, it doesn't take long but it is something for travelers to consider. They also have bikes available to borrow (included in the rental) and Seattle seems like a very bike friendly city.
43107	958475	10.0	9.0	18000814	My daughter and I spent a week at The Annex. She arrived first and was greeted and checked in. The location is great. The neighborhood is quiet but there is a bus stop nearby and it was only five minutes to I5. Everything about the place is comfortable and welcoming. There was so much space compared to the hotel rooms we were considering. I would recommend it to anyone and would stay there again. 
43108	958475	10.0	9.0	18400699	We had a great stay at the Annex.  The neighbor hood was fine and the Annex is located within a 10 minute walk to public transportation. The studio is very cleverly decorated and well appointed. Our hosts were quite and unobtrusive, yet totally accommodating.  A fantastic deal.
43109	958475	10.0	9.0	19129827	Beautiful place, accurate description and the hosts were welcoming and friendly. 
43110	958475	10.0	9.0	19525660	Everything was wonderful! It was my first airbnb experience and I was very pleased. Bruce and Shannon were available, helpful and great resources regarding the city. The apartment was perfect. The location was convenient too. It was so nice to stay in a home as opposed to a hotel! I would definitely recommend the Studio Annex to anyone travelling to Seattle!
43111	958475	10.0	9.0	20002223	"The studio annex was the perfect place to stay while in Seattle! It was a short drive anywhere and fairly easy to find things in the area. 

I only met Shannon and Bruce very briefly but they were very accommodating and helpful! It was wonderful having so much privacy with the annex. 

We absolutely loved the quirkiness of the apartment! So much stuff to look at. This experience was 100% fantastic and we would recommend staying with Shannon and Bruce to absolutely anyone!"
43112	958475	10.0	9.0	20603307	This was a lovely place to stay. My friend and I stayed here for a week and really enjoyed having a full kitchen to cook dinner in and a cosy living room. It's a really unique space, beautifully decorated and furnished. The beds are enormous and comfortable, and the area is really peaceful at night. Both the bathroom and kitchen were stocked with little treats. The studio is about 15 minutes' walk from the Beacon Hill light rail station or 25 minutes from Chinatown. 
43113	958475	10.0	9.0	20831226	"What a wonderful place! Me and my friends decided to visit Seattle for my birthday this past weekend. We wanted to find a place relatively close to all the good spots like the Space Needle, Pikes Place and some night life. The photos of the place are exactly as described, but better in person! Every room had a personal touch, and me and my friends felt like we literally had anything we needed if we wanted to stay for a week or a month. It was also just down the street of a ton of restaurants and grocery stores. We were even provided detailed instructions for the accommodations, and definitely took advantage of the awesome bikes, which we took to a bridge overlooking Seattle and Safeco Field. There were also tons of pamphlets provided for additional things to explore in the city. I think my favorite part of this place was the touch of exploration everywhere in the house. The old school cameras on the fireplace were open to feel and touch, and the dresser in the room we stayed in had tons of drawers filled with random knick knacks that may have been left by other guests, or the hosts themselves. Each bed comfortable slept 2, and my friend who took the couch enjoyed being cozy by the fireplace.
The ceilings are a little low (I'm only 6'0 personally) and  everyone in my party would be able to touch the ceiling. It's not really a big deal, just something to note if your taller than me. 
Overall, we had an excellent stay here, and would definitely recommended anyone stay here if visiting the awesome city of Seattle. "
43114	958475	10.0	9.0	21234591	"The host was very friendly and helpfull with everything we needed.
The place was great, clean, clean, clean and everything we needed. 
It was super fun and a very welcoming place to stay. Would totaly recomend staying here if you visit seattle. not for from downtown and uber cab is cheep anywere you need to go. "
43115	958475	10.0	9.0	21473752	This was the perfect location for us since we were in Seattle to attend a training at the Pacific Medical Center Beacon Hill. We were a short walk to the training site. The Annex was comfortable and quirky.  There was always something to look at and play with!  The tile work was absolutely beautiful. Walking to the International District for great Asian food was a treat. 
43116	958475	10.0	9.0	21701545	"Whatever you are imagining about this place....it is even better!! My friend and I took a trip to Seattle during our fall break at law school. The set up could not have been any better. This is an amazing location and it has everything you could need and more! If given the opportunity to come back to Seattle, I will absolutely book my stay here again. 

I will leave you with this: fireplace + rain + fall = little piece of heaven! "
43117	958475	10.0	9.0	22017783	"We really enjoyed our time in Bruce & Shannon's studio flat. The flat was really beautifully and originally decorated with lots of wonderful antiques and junk - just our cup of tea. The beds were comfy, bathroom clean, kitchen had everything you could need and a lounge with a great entertainment system.
Bruce and Shannon were great hosts, sorting out any problems or queries - they even ordered us a taxi to the station when our phone didn't work.
Bernal Heights is a nice suburban area - very quiet. We didn't eat locally, mostly eating in the city before returning to our lair.
The only negative here is that it's a bit of a slog to get to transport to ferry you in and out of town. However, it's worth it to get this level of accommodation at this price in a city the size of Seattle.
We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Studio to anyone visiting Seattle."
43118	958475	10.0	9.0	22360820	Listing was accurate and in a great (email hidden)s were very accomodating.
43119	958475	10.0	9.0	22757562	Perfect place for our trip. Easy access to town by foot or by train. A great house that was very kindly stocked before our visit. Comfy and warm - a welcome place to return to after a day in the cold weather. 
43120	958475	10.0	9.0	23297322	It was a great experience living here at Bruce&Shannon's annex. The location is really convenient and there is really good dim sum place in chinatown near where the annex locates. Bruce gave a good recommendation for morning jogging also. Loved the thanksgiving break experience in Seattle.
43121	958475	10.0	9.0	24015834	Adorable apartment with fun decor, smooth booking process, great hosts. 
43122	958475	10.0	9.0	24588927	Cozy apartment close to downtown with great amenities. Hosts were very helpful and the beds were  comfortable. The decorating was very unique and we enjoyed our stay very much. We'll be back next time we visit our grand kids in Seattle ! 
43123	958475	10.0	9.0	24965926	This place is amazing! One of the best we've ever stayed at. Great location. Hosts were super nice and very attentive. We would definitely love to stay here again, to be honest we really didn't want to leave.
43124	958475	10.0	9.0	25355957	"Everything was as described in the listing.  Very comfortable and convenient.  The Light Rail and nearby grocery store were closer than I expected.  Also, nice to be so close to the Bike trail. 

Tom & Adrienne"
43125	958475	10.0	9.0	30184303	I stayed at Bruce and Shannon's place for about 4 months with a awesome experience! The annex comes fully equipped with anything you could need during your stay and more. Bruce was an excellent host and although I didn't have the pleasure of meeting him, he was always very accessible via phone and responds promptly to any issues or questions you may have. He also had family living above me who were also very helpful. The annex is just 2 miles from downtown in a neighborhood called Beacon Hill. Even though Beacon Hill isn't one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle, I never felt unsafe or had any issues of crime during my stay. This was important to me being a single girl and living alone. The annex sleeps up to six comfortably and you have access to Netflix, Hulu, wifi, etc. The only minor issue I had was finding a place for all my clothes and shoes as neither room had a closet. An issue I wouldn't have had had I of not stayed so many months. I highly recommend this unique collective place!

My wife and I had the pleasure to stay at 1514 17th Ave. S, an Airbnb located in  Seattle. We had never stayed in an Airbnb before but would not hesitate to do it again especially if this address were available.
Nestled in a hillside and just a healthy 20 minute walk through the park to downtown Seattle is where we found our comfortable and completely furnished two bedroom home.
Decorated by fans of the popular T.V. program, ""American Pickers"" this eclectic home will delight you, as it did us.
Comfortable beds, instant hot water and convenient washer and dryer, who could ask for more?
If this address is available, do yourself a favor. We were not disappointed and you won't be either.
 
"
43127	958475	10.0	9.0	31586687	Wonderful to spend time in Beacon Hill - light rail within walking distance of this beautiful residence. I was so comfortable there that I thought l was in a more fabulously decorated version of my own house. Loved having washer/dryer at our disposal- free soap no less. It's very quiet and clean and quirky. 
43128	958475	10.0	9.0	32119558	Your place not only was a great experience but offered more convenient's than expected.  The accommodations were superb and more than adequate, the kitchen no only was fully furnished but we had coffee, tea and little extras also.  The art surrounding us at every turn was a wonderful addition to our stay.  We found the distance to the light rail, walking trail and park easy to walk, and we looked forward to our daily walk to the light rail.  We are in our 60's so we're concerned that we would be able to hang, but never had any issues.  The local grocery  store was a real bonus and we visited daily. When we return to Seattle we will wait until we can stay with you guys again, it was the perfect location that after day one we called home.  We easily made it from our home away from home to all the tourist places in Seattle, Fremont and Ballard using public transportation.  Thanks for opening your home and we look forward to visiting you in the future. Our prayer are with you and your family.
43129	958475	10.0	9.0	32538993	Great place - highly recommended.  Well stocked and unique in a nice quiet neighborhood.  Great access to stadiums and downtown on lite rail.
43130	958475	10.0	9.0	33551593	This was our first experience with airbnb and it was delightful.  The studio apartment was engaging with it's funky art and amazing tile work with the added treat of sculptures outside that made us smile.  The kitchen is adequately furnished and we were able to cook a great meal with food we bought at Pike's Market.  We found walking to the bus at the Freeway/Ranier station a really easy way to get in and out of central Seattle.  We would definitely ask to stay here again if we were to return to the area.
43131	958475	10.0	9.0	34067611	Bruce and Shannon, along with their sister and her wife, were gracious hosts that provided me with everything I needed! The space was clean, well-organized, and very cozy! I would definitely book here again!
43132	958475	10.0	9.0	34287457	Great spot!. Loved the decorations and how quite the area was. Annex had everything you need for a short or long term stay. Bruce and Shannon made the experience very easy. If your planning a trip to Seattle, this is a top choice over a boring Hotel.
43133	958475	10.0	9.0	35201899	The flat was so charming.  A lot of care and attention went into the decor. Bruce ' s sister even told me that the tiles were designed by Bruce and Shannon.  The beds were very comfortable,  and the flat was very cozy. Bruce was available when we called with questions. It is conveniently located near downtown,  and is very close to the metro. We absolutely loved staying here,  and would without a doubt, stay here again.  Do yourself a favor and stay here!
43134	958475	10.0	9.0	35459772	We had a wonderful stay here! The space was comfortable and looked just like the pictures. It was also in a great location, not far from the Link train. 
43135	958475	10.0	9.0	35779184	We are so glad we had the pleasure of staying here. Brimming with collectibles and artistic charm this apartment is meticulously clean and perfectly well appointed with thoughtful might needs. We found check in easy and support easily accessible. We were close (by cab) to everything on our list throughout the city. It really felt like home. Would be a treat to stay here again. 
43136	958475	10.0	9.0	36366319	The apt was very cozy and welcoming. Very close to the both stadiums, Pioneere Square and Pikes Market. Even though we didn't spend much time here because we to busy site seeing, we did make great use of the living room after a day hiking in Mt. Reiner. All the cool vintage decor was a nice touch too. Nothing like sleeping in the bed of a Chevy. 
43137	958475	10.0	9.0	37284223	Our place was perfect for what we wanted...2 bedrooms, kitchen, and living room. We even had a place to do our laundry. Did not know what to expect because this was our 1st airbnb and they spoiled us. Hosts welcomed us then left us along unless we needed something. LOVED their art work took pictures and would have loved to have talked more about their creations. My daughter and I are the creative type so these extra things like art books and refurbished furniture was just want we liked. Even though it was hot for Seattle the basement apt. was comfortable with plenty of fans and you could not here anyone upstairs. Thank-you for the nice space Bruce and Shannon.
43138	958475	10.0	9.0	37838688	We stayed for about a week and loved it. We made use of the fans at night in the July heat, loved the water pressure in the shower, and most of all, that we were able to make healthy breakfasts and other meals in the well appointed kitchen. Thanks for making our first Airbnb experience a good one! 
43139	958475	10.0	9.0	39172410	The place was perfect! It was super clean and close to easy transportation to the city. Would totally recommend staying here.
43140	958475	10.0	9.0	39525050	We had a pleasant stay. It was roomy yet cozy. It was close to everything we wanted to do, and the host (Carri) was very helpful in giving us suggestions for restaurants. If there was anything of concern, I would say there may be some allergens, perhaps cat hair? Both my son and husband had allergic reactions and took Benadryl, which helped. 
43141	958475	10.0	9.0	39910058	This place was great - super funky, clean, and a great location. It had everything we needed. Would stay here again!
43142	958475	10.0	9.0	41189417	"Wonderful place! We arrived fairly late on check in day and were delighted to find lights on to welcome us. One of the first things we noticed was the coffee and other starter items which took some pressure off of figuring it all out first thing in the morning. The whole place was very generously stocked with countless amenities, more than we expected or even needed but appreciated since it went a long way in letting us know that Bruce and Shannon genuinely wished us a comfortable stay. We are a family of 5 and found there to be plenty of clean and fresh smelling towels, linens and pillows. There wasn't a thing that we would have wanted that we didn't find. We had limited but very friendly and informative contact with one of the care takers of the property who lives upstairs. Multiple contact numbers were provided so if anything was needed I'm sure a prompt reply would have come from somewhere. 
Loved the detailed binder including local sites, restaurants and directions to each recommended place. The walk to the link station was uphill and a little further than we had anticipated but it ended up working out great since it gave us exercise and an ideal opportunity to check out the neighborhood, architecture (new and old!) and the many wonderful wild blackberry bushes.
We found the annex to be very comfortable inside and out. There was a small covered outdoor table which was nice to enjoy a cup of coffee or a cocktail.
We definitely recommend Bruce and Shannon's Annex to other visitors to Seattle!"
43143	958475	10.0	9.0	42110601	The house was very conveniently located. The decorations were awesome...lots of artwork and vintage items. The only complaint is that the bed in the back bedroom was very noisy. I think this is because it was a platform bed and the platform was wood planks. At any rate, we would stay there again! Loved it!
43144	958475	10.0	9.0	44403442	If you want privacy and a central location this apartment is for you.  We did without a car for 2 weeks in Seattle taking light rail and buses everywhere. The apartment is about 1/2 mile from the Beacon Hill Station, an uphill walk but good exercise.  Bus schedules can be found in the apartment. The apartment is nicely decorated in what I call industrial eclectic and outside are tiny garden areas filled with playful sculptures. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen has everything you will need, even if you cook full meals.  A washer and dryer are located in a separate building only a few steps away.  We did not see a lot of our hosts but when we did they were friendly and inquired if we needed anything.  The only downside to the location is its proximity to a major highway (noisy outside).  Inside you don't hear anything.  And the proximity may be a plus if driving. Also the neighborhood might be described as transitional with a mix of nice condos and some rundown smaller homes, many undergoing rehab.  We did not feel unsafe  but some may not like the urban seediness of the area.  For us it was perfect.
43145	958475	10.0	9.0	46114093	"Great accommodation! We loved the way it was styled-it has heaps of character & is very homely. It was very clean & tidy & had everything we needed & more, including beautiful towels, linen & bathroom products, full kitchen & cooking facilities, tea & coffee, great entertainment system & hairdryer.
There was a listing of nearby places to eat & buy groceries which was handy as we didn't know the area. 
Our hosts were there when we had questions, and were helpful and very friendly. 
It's about a 15 minute walk to the train station & grocer, and a pleasant 25 min walk to the edge of the city. The ceilings are low and the shower is raised so the shower could be a bit awkward for anyone over 6 feet tall but there's also a bath. 
The Oak hotel/tavern nearby was a good spot for dinner.
I'd highly recommend this accommodation! "
43146	958475	10.0	9.0	48860965	"I booked accommodation at Bruce and Shannon's place for my parents who are currently traveling and don't have access to internet so I will review the stay based on what they told me on the phone.
The bed was extremely comfortable and the room was quirky, clean and interesting. They loved their stay in Seattle and having an apartment to relax in, in the evening made it feel very homely.
They said that the girls who rent the upstairs apartment were very friendly. Sorry I can't elaborate more. Regards Louise"
43147	958475	10.0	9.0	50075159	This Annex is absolutely adorable! I'd totally recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle who want to stay somewhere with some character. It is so cosy and full of lovely little surprise decorative items all over. Underfloor heating in the bathroom was a real treat! We found the place to be very well equipped with a lot more than we needed, even some chilled bottles of water in the fridge, and the whole place was really clean, tidy and thoughtfully prepared. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and access to public transport was really great for getting around the city. We were welcomed by the two ladies who live upstairs and had no hesitation about asking them if we needed anything, only all our needs were already exceeded, so we left them in peace. Thank you so much Bruce and Shannon for making our first airbnb experience so great :)
43148	958475	10.0	9.0	53125985	We loved our stay in this unit. It was clean, comfortable, and very thoughtfully set up, top to bottom, from the delicious coffee, bath products and loaner umbrellas provided to the cozy fireplace. The hosts were great at communicating and making us feel at home.
43149	958475	10.0	9.0	53486167	This was the perfect Airbnb for us! Parking in front was easy, they sent a key code for the door so we didn't need to coordinate a check in, the apartment is BEAUTIFUL and they had lots of nice amenities (snacks, roku, toiletries, etc). The apartment has a cozy, unique style and is perfect for a weekend getaway or longer stay. The neighborhood is quiet but only a $8-10 Lyft ride to the downtown area.
43150	958475	10.0	9.0	53757688	"Once we were accepted by Bruce and Shannon, they were quick to let us know the next step in the process. We were new to the whole system. Bruce answered all my questions, quickly and throughly.
  It was the prefect place to come home to every evening. The kitchen was well supplied with dishes, cookware and essentials at were needed to cook a meal. Which we did with items fresh from the Seattle Market. 
The beds were very comfortable. Bedrooms were interesting and fun. 
Our favorite item was the bathtub. Coming in every evening and slipping into the tub was a wonderful way to end the day. 
We were very pleased to see the neighborhood of the B and B. I grew up in the north end of Seattle and love the area. I was a little reluctant to stay in the south end, BUT once I saw the neighborhood and the area around the house, I was very comfortable and pleased. It is a quiet neighborhood with wonderful little houses. There is a park not to far from the house that has a breath taking view of downtown Seattle. Well worth the walk to see during the day and in the evening. 
Over all I would stay there again. It would be a great place to bring the family to, as there is room for 6 in the house. 
"
43151	958475	10.0	9.0	54247850	Really great place to stay as it has a lot of character loved all the unique furnishings. Is really close to the stadium very convenient to get to the sea the sea Hocking
43152	958475	10.0	9.0	55560004	Everything we needed plus more was readily available in the apartment.  Many compliments for the thoughtfulness and comfort, we felt right at home.
43153	958475	10.0	9.0	56303126	Bruce and Shannon's place was super cute and spacious. It was cozy with the fireplace and interesting artwork around the house. It was nice to have everything I needed to cook a couple meals while I was there.
43154	958475	10.0	9.0	57133653	"I had high expectations after reading the reviews and seeing the pictures and was a little afraid that they would not be met, but I was wrong. This place was absolutely adorable and the decor really inspired me to bring a little of their creativity home with me. The house was located in a great neighborhood. We had two wonderful meals just a short drive/walk away, one at Pippy's Cafe, a Korean fusion restaurant, totally delicious and different that your typical breakfast/brunch and another at Cafe Bengodi where we sat at a ""community table"" and met and chatted with two locals. 
Our main purpose for our visit was to go to a Seahawks game and this place was conveniently located close to the light rail stop. It was the perfect home in the perfect location for us. "
43155	958475	10.0	9.0	57633050	It was good experience at Shannon's house. Bery close to downtown and independent space.
45804	8743202	10.0	10.0	51668700	Room was comfortable, quiet, airy, bright.  Bed was comfy with great linens.  Location was terrific, 15 minutes from downtown, and our car was off the street.  Valerie was accommodating, anything we needed she was able to direct or help us.  Her children were over the top sweet and quiet.  My husband was very impressed.  We will be staying there again.
45805	8743202	10.0	10.0	52293991	Thank you, Valerie, for being such a warm and accommodating host!  The room was exactly how it is pictured and I felt very much at home. I  truly enjoyed my time in your beautiful place! 
45806	8743202	10.0	10.0	55549484	I came into town for a conference and needed a peaceful place to stay. This was an ideal spot for me.  The room was private, comfy and clean and I loved Valerie's cranberry muffins!
45807	8743202	10.0	10.0	56154429	Kind and accommodating hostess, comfortable, private room and bathroom on top floor. Cozy bedding and perfect pillows, so far, my favorite AirBnB experience!
46171	4708075	10.0	8.0	33203637	Catherine was the perfect host.  She made us feel welcome the second we stepped into the house.  It was immaculate and very homey.  We had the whole run of the place.  The property was a rental which was occupied by another Catherine who was equally hospitable.  We enjoyed talking with them.  Catherine not only gave us directions we needed for getting to the light rail but also drove us the various routes to get there.  She also offered us breakfast of waffles for the next day and even took us to the air port.  Best host ever.
46172	4708075	10.0	8.0	34344617	"There are two Catherines you will meet while staying here, and they are both amazing and fantastic women! 

My husband and I had just moved to Seattle and needed a place while we searched for an apartment. I don't think we could have gotten luckier! Their home is right by bus stops in Rainer Beach, the hosts are extremely comforting and sweet, and their house is so nice! The room you get is upstairs and has a comfy queen  bed and two chairs along with a dresser and a closet. They made us feel so at home! We had to cut our stay short because we did end up finding a place but we miss them and their home. This was a WONDERFUL introduction to Seattle!!"
46173	4708075	10.0	8.0	38829414	We stayed at Catherine's place for six weeks while my husband did an internship in the area. It was really a nice place, looks better in person than the pictures, the room had a lot of light. The room itself was nice, plenty of room plus closet and drawers. We had access to the kitchen and were sharing a bathroom with another person. Another Catherine lives in the home and she was wonderful and helpful. The host didn't live there but visits occasionally, has her own key. She was nice and cooked us waffles and gumbo, very hospitable. I would recommend this place as long as you're okay with being social. Best part was the  place was right on a few bus lines that take you straight to downtown Seattle.
46174	4708075	10.0	8.0	39353448	The host was very welcoming and offered us lots of tasty food. This was a last minute booking for us, and she was very accommodating. Seattle was oddly hot, but the host went out and bought a box fan just to make us more comfortable. The house looks as advertised and was clean. The neighborhood is about 15ish minutes outside of Seattle by car. The area wasn't the nicest, but that was our only complaint.
46175	4708075	10.0	8.0	39577052	Catherine was really welcoming, helpful, and full of energy. A pleasure to stay at her place. 
46176	4708075	10.0	8.0	39965960	Catherine was a lovely host! My friend and I enjoyed our stay in the room provided and would happily return. We were made some delicious waffles the first morning, and Catherine and Catherine were warm and friendly. The bus stop was just down the road which made our trips to downtown easy, and the neighbourhood seemed fine. Didn't spend a lot of time in the Rainier area, but next time we'll have to see the nearby Kubota Gardens which Catherine suggested to us! 
46177	4708075	10.0	8.0	42491047	Both Catherine's were very nice, social, and inviting.  The neighborhood wasn't great but it was near a very nice area with a pretty good pizza place that had a good view of the lake.  There was a small issue when I arrived regarding having someone there to let me in, but it was a happy accident because that allowed me time to explore the area on my motorcycle and what led to me finding a pretty solid pizza at a little joint down the road.  The house (and hosts) were very inviting and warm, and the room was very clean.  my only complaint about the room was the road noise due to being on a busy street and having to keep the window open because of the unusual heat wave.  Overall I very much enjoyed my stay, and my visit with the Catherine's, and will definitely stay here again.
46178	4708075	10.0	8.0	43167842	"Catherine was very welcoming. She answered all our questions, had some good tips and was very helpful. The room is nice and the house is just a few minutes from a bus stop and super markets. The bus ride takes a while, but the price is very accommodating for those looking for the ""Seattle experience"" without the ""Seattle money"" like ourselves. "
46179	4708075	10.0	8.0	44393043	Catherine is very kind. Wonderfully hospitable, introduced me to her family. She reminded me what real Soul Food tastes like. Thank you!
46180	4708075	10.0	8.0	44508782	Catherine was really nice! She was quite welcoming when we arrived and made us feel right at home. The home itself is very cozy. A nice dining room, a good kitchen, and two comfortable rooms upstairs. We only stayed for 1 night but would definitely stay here again when we're back in the neighborhood.
46181	4708075	10.0	8.0	45432425	Catherine was a lovely hostess. She cooked us a wonderful southern breakfast.
46182	4708075	10.0	8.0	49102914	My husband and I stayed at Catherine's for one month during our relocation to WA. It's always stressful to be 'in-between,' but we were lucky to pick the perfect place to spend that time! Our bed was comfortable, our closet had ample space for our extra belongings, the kitchen was well-equipped, and the location was great for travel both into Seattle and all points South/West. Catherine One (owner) was on top of her duties as a host -- we saw her every morning when she came to clean the house and set up for guests in the other room. Catherine Two was fun to hang out with over dinner and she was always bringing home treats for us to try. Both were warm, welcoming, generous, and flexible. This is a great, cheap place if you're just in town for the night, but I'd also recommend it to those who need something longer-term.
46183	4708075	10.0	8.0	50490576	nice host and warm house
49826	7809455	10.0	9.0	43002411	Bryan welcomed me on arrival and was a great host. My schedule was crazy so I was really just in to crash and out after a shower in the morning. The bathroom was large and clean with plenty of hot water and great towels. The room had a nice comfortable chair and a desk that I hadn't noticed from the add. The neighborhood was quiet and convenient. I had a car and there was plenty of on street parking.
49827	7809455	10.0	9.0	44225226	Nice neighborhood, convenient to the bus (we had no car). Very pleasant place for my son and I to stay. Loved the cats--and the family was nice and helpful! When Bryan realized the listing said a queen bed and it was actually a double, he made a separate bed available so my son and I wouldn't be crowded. A coffee maker in the room was thoughtfully provided. He also picked up both my son and I from the train station. I would definitely recommend this place and will stay here again when I return to Seattle.
49828	7809455	10.0	9.0	44477297	"Bryan had coffee in the room, which was a nice touch; I'm not a coffee drinker but I can appreciate that extra little bit of attention.  Towels and plenty of pillows were laid out and ample power allowed me to plug in laptop, iPad and a couple other things.  

Great room and attention to detail!"
49829	7809455	10.0	9.0	44981337	"Bryan is a very good host, he ' s very reactive and welcoming .
His family too .
we were comfortable in this private room and the bathroom was just next the door .
Rather practice ^^

thanks"
49830	7809455	10.0	9.0	45877110	Bryan and his family was gracious to host our stay for 4 night at their home located in a very multi-cultural yet extremely quiet neighborhood.  There are ample parking with easy access to major road leading into downtown.  It was great to enjoy soccer match on their big screen projector and you can totally feel the passion they have for the game!  We also had access to a great range and stove to prepare our meal when we didn't feel like venturing out for food.  The room is clean and spacious for petite Asian couple like our self.  
49831	7809455	10.0	9.0	46089749	We got there late and Bryan was there to greet us.  Nice historic neighborhood.  Street parking.  The room is clean, the bed is comfy, the bathroom is huge and big living room area.  I would definitely stay here again 
49832	7809455	10.0	9.0	46360387	We only stayed for a night, but Bryan was very helpful. The house is great and you can feel his passion for football. We had a good time at his place 
49833	7809455	10.0	9.0	46435420	Thanks for being really flexible with our schedule and hosting us. You guys did a great job with having a very clear set of instructions on how to get in and use the room. Thanks again!! Bedroom was very cozy and comfortable. 
49834	7809455	10.0	9.0	46554446	Bryan is a great  host.  when we arrived, he gave us a warm welcomed and also he gave us a pretty helpful list with closest place we could go in the neighborhood.  The room  and the bathroom were very clean,  and the bed was really comfy. Besides he allowed us to use one his bikes, it was very helpful.  we felt very luck y to have found nice room.Thank you so much for your help and letting us to stay in your house, we had a really great time. Definitely we recommended this place. 
49835	7809455	10.0	9.0	47181546	Great host and a great house! I stayed in the room for five nights with my girlfriend, and the room was well furnished and comfortable. Bryan and his family were nice and welcoming to both of us!
49836	7809455	10.0	9.0	48946632	Had a great stay with Bryan and family. They are very easy-going and helpful and my stay was pleasant and uncomplicated, just the way I like it. Also enjoyed watching the weekend soccer highlights with the family and learning about some teams and players I had not been following or a while.
49837	7809455	10.0	9.0	50022915	As described. We really liked the neighborhood and Bryan and his family were very respectful and friendly. Thanks a lot.
49838	7809455	10.0	9.0	50821656	La maison de Bryan est vivante et chaleureuse. La chambre est agréable et propre. Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Bryan et sa famille. 
49839	7809455	10.0	9.0	51438754	Bryan is a really nice guy! He picked us up on our way from the airport and drove us to the place. He was really informative, kind, and helpful throughout our entire trip. 
49840	7809455	10.0	9.0	52202384	We had a short but pleasant stay with Bryan.  We arrived rather late but Bryan was able to meet us and help us settle in.  The room was cozy and comfortable, easy access to the bathroom and backyard.  We had to catch an early flight and didn't get to spend much time around the house but it seemed very homey.
49841	7809455	10.0	9.0	52469031	Bryan was very commutative and made it easy for me to arrive very, very late.  I got caught up in informal business discussions and arrived long past my curfew.  The room was very nice.  I highly recommend staying with Bryan.
49842	7809455	10.0	9.0	52945839	This time I arrived early enough to actually meet Bryan!  As before, he was very accommodating and the room nice / comfortable.  Highly recommended. 
49843	7809455	10.0	9.0	53539854	Alyson was there to meet me when I arrived at her doorstep and showed me around her home; acquainted me with her kitchen and she had cleared 2 shelves in the fridge for my use. She also brought down to my room a coffee maker with coffee, cream and sugar. Bryan and Alyson were amazing open, friendly, trusting hosts with 2 beautiful children. The location of their home was perfect for my workshop and still close to nature; Lake Washington and Seward Park. I really liked having a backdoor to use coming and going from this home.
49844	7809455	10.0	9.0	55075562	Both my husband and I enjoyed our stay. We felt very welcomed and rested well in the space. I think we slept 10 hours both nights we stayed in Bryan's home. That was so great. Thank you!
49845	7809455	10.0	9.0	55626454	Again, as always, a very easy visit.  It seems that I have the entire lower floor to myself.  Very easy access and comfortable room.
49846	7809455	10.0	9.0	56918782	Bryan was a great host, providing us with the information we needed prior to our arrival and making sure we had all that we needed. Our stay was for only two nights and we were sightseeing a lot, so we didn't see the family much. Bryan gave us a ride to the light rail station when we left, which was really nice. The bathroom is shared, but it was always free and the bed is comfortable.
50651	5834820	10.0	10.0	31411606	We had a wonderful stay.  The home is very pleasant, comfortable and extremely clean and tidy.  Our room was very comfortable -- with twin beds, a desk and chair, a closet with space for clothes on hangers, and plenty of drawer space.  The bathroom is large and beautiful.  We had a couple of small requests and John and Carol were completely accommodating;  they also responded quickly to our e-mail.  We would definitely stay there again.
50652	5834820	10.0	10.0	34587111	"It was an excellent staying in Carol & John's beautiful lake side home!
The bed was so comfortable, neat and everything was as have described.
Thanks!!!"
50653	5834820	10.0	10.0	34832545	John and Carol were great hosts and took great care of my family. The room was organized and clean and the private bath was large and very nice. The house is just a block from the lake and has a beautiful garden. Most of all, John and Carol were very friendly people!
50654	5834820	10.0	10.0	35020083	John and Carol were beyond accommodating.  Their home is incredibly beautiful,  clean, and welcoming. The room is very clean and comfortable.  We left at 5 am because we had a race downtown to get to (they were so understanding about race preparation offering suggestions for appropriate dinner spots in the area as well as room in their fridge for our supplies). A note worth mentioning,  we tried to be really quiet as we were leaving,  and we accidentally slammed the bedroom door! It closes very easily and louder than we thought!  SO sorry John and Carol!  All in all...incredible location and beautiful home. Outside the downtown core so nice and quiet. We will definitely keep it in mind when we travel into town!
50655	5834820	10.0	10.0	35091885	Very nice neighborhood, hosts were wonderful. Beds were simple but enough room
50656	5834820	10.0	10.0	35442537	John and Carol were very welcoming to us. They have a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood close to Lake Washington.
50657	5834820	10.0	10.0	35527869	John and Carol have set the bar high for future Airbnb stays!  I stayed during a house hunting trip to Seattle.  They have a lovely home that is very clean, comfortable, and steps from Lake Washington.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom is HUGE!  Carol and John could not be two nicer people and I enjoyed our conversations and hospitality.  Highly recommended!
50658	5834820	10.0	10.0	35721083	"Carol and John were very welcoming! Their place is in a beautiful location right by lake Washington, but just a short drive to downtown. It is super clean and cute. Carol was an awesome ""foster mom"" who was beyond helpful and had a lot of advice on what to see in Seattle."
50659	5834820	10.0	10.0	35872528	We stayed 1 night at John and Carols House. The house is cozy and close to the beautiful Lake Washington. John and Carol are very kind and really good hosts. We enjoyed the conversations and the coffee in the morning. We hope we can come back to this nice place near Seattle. Thank you very much.
50660	5834820	10.0	10.0	36393588	John and Carol were fantastic hosts. They made arrangements to leave a key for us when we arrived so that we could get in before they arrived home. They have a simple but comfortable room they rent out, with a bathroom to yourself down the hall. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. They were delightful people that we found out we had some overlapping history with! All in all (it was really hot for Seattle that weekend!) a great stay, and when in need of Seattle lodging again we will definitely rebook!
50661	5834820	10.0	10.0	37715146	John and Carol were fantastic. They were extremely welcoming and helpful in pointing us in the right direction for Seattle and surrounding areas. They made themselves super accessible for us when we did have questions and were always eager to help. It was a real pleasure!
50662	5834820	10.0	10.0	37891315	Thanks John and Carol for a second stay!  Lovely home and great people.
50663	5834820	10.0	10.0	38109466	Carol and John were welcoming and replied promptly to our messages.  We checked in late the first night and they arranged an easy way for us to find the key.  Accommodations were clean with a spacious bathroom and the neighbourhood was absolutely beautiful (right beside Lake Washington).  The hosts were kind enough to have breakfast bread, tea, and supplies for us (but we didn't need them as we had made other plans).
50664	5834820	10.0	10.0	39252133	John and Carol are a very accommodating couple, they accepted my booking with relatively short notice. The house is nice, large bedroom and everything was very clean. Their neighbourhood is approx 2km from the main sky train route into Seattle and they have spectacular views of of the lake from their house.
50665	5834820	10.0	10.0	39772614	John and Carol's home is in a lovely, quiet spot near Lake Washington and close to downtown Seattle. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and comfortable, and John and Carol were great hosts! They provided a nice little breakfast, and lots of great tips on parking options and getting around via public transportation. We would definitely stay with them again!
50666	5834820	10.0	10.0	39975398	John and Carol provided a very comfortable place to stay in Seattle. Their home is in a safe and quiet neighbourhood by the lake. Bed and bathroom were in terrific condition. They are also the nicest hosts you'll ever meet! Both are very helpful and great to converse with. My only regret is that I couldn't stay there longer!
50667	5834820	10.0	10.0	40164223	"Johns' and Carols' home was lovely! It has beautiful hard wood floors! The bedroom was very nice with french doors leading to the back yard. The bathroom was over sized and very nice. Very quite at night. Nice neighborhood. A very nice view of Washington lake, just steps away. 
John and Carol are very nice. My daughter and I had a nice visit with them about Africa adventures.

50668	5834820	10.0	10.0	41497535	My dad and I stayed with Carol & John for one night on our recent trip to Seattle. Their house is beautiful and very well maintained and the room was even nicer than described. The bathroom is huge and everything was spotlessly clean. It was also nice having the porch off the bedroom to let the cool air in at night. We were happy to have time  to chat with both John and Carol during our stay, who are both very warm and accommodating hosts. Carol provided us with great directions and recommendations for our trip and in the morning we chatted with John who also showed us around their nice vegetable garden out back. They also have a cool apple tree with different types of apples and a plum tree, yum! I highly recommend staying at their place if you find yourself in the Seattle area!
50669	5834820	10.0	10.0	41988342	The place is awesome. The room in which we stayed was spacey and cool. The room opens into a backyard (pretty cool). There is a lake beside, but we did not get enough time to stroll along it.
50670	5834820	10.0	10.0	42299859	Carol made us feel very welcomed. She had our room ready and everything was very clean and organized. The listing description was accurate. Her home is beautiful and in a great location. The house is in walking distance to Lake Washington and nice local spots. 
50671	5834820	10.0	10.0	44074481	Carol was great and the location was amazing.  The location on the lake, in a historic craftsmen, in a quite neighborhood would be hard to beat anywhere.
50672	5834820	10.0	10.0	44247573	This was our first air b and b and it was fantastic! John and Carols home is beautiful and right beside the lake! Our taxi was about 20 mins to Safeco and we had a great stay! We were running late and Carol was in touch about the key as well forgot our passports and contacted us right away! Amazing hosts!
50673	5834820	10.0	10.0	44461450	The room was very clean and quiet.  The hosts were very friendly and helpful.  The room was exactly what I was looking for.

50675	5834820	10.0	10.0	50006894	It's a great pleasure to stay at John and Carol's house. The house is very close to Washington lake. It's within walking distance to Seward park. We had walked to the park, it's wonderful. John and Carol are very kind. Carol suggested us good places to go. She cooked breakfast and we had it together. The room is very clean. If you visit Seattle and have a car, this is an ideal place to stay.
50676	5834820	10.0	10.0	51488747	"John and Carol were excellent hosts. Their home is in a quiet upscale neighborhood a block  of Lake Washington. The location is great, just 15-20 minutes drive to downtown Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma Airport.
I recommend."
51698	8472954	10.0	10.0	49076401	My toddler and I loved staying with Liza! The space was very comfortable, and she and her partner are very friendly and helpful. They were very accommodating of a toddler, and very easy to communicate with. Highly recommended!
51699	8472954	10.0	10.0	50986858	"Liza and her partner have a lovely home, and they were so welcoming!
I traveled with my Fiance, and our two dogs, and it was a breeze staying with them.
While we were only there for a short trip (We never got to see them) Liza, was only a text away and even kept me updated about my dogs while we went to dinner! 
Would love to stay with them again!"
51700	8472954	10.0	10.0	55635799	My son and his girlfriend stayed at Liza's place for several days.  I booked the place for them but did not stay there myself.  According to them their hosts were very warm and welcoming.
55201	3352685	10.0	9.0	15597854	Allison was a very friendly and accommodating host. The house and location were excellent. It was easy to get to the bus to downtown and there were several nice parks within walking distance. 
55202	3352685	10.0	9.0	25301926	"My husband and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the ""Treehouse"", and all the comforts Allison had provided. Upon first walking through the door, we automatically knew we had made the right choice as where to spend a cozy, romantic weekend for our anniversary. We honestly never left till it was time to pick up our daughter! Allison even left us a bottle of yummy wine to add to our celebration! We will DEFINITELY go back as soon as possible!"
55203	3352685	10.0	9.0	27501938	"Allison was an excellent host. Leading up to our week in Seattle, Allison did a phenomenal job of providing information about Seattle, necessary logistics, and things that we were interested in doing.

Although we did not get a chance to meet Allison in person, she was extremely responsive to all of our needs/asks. The treehouse is the perfect getaway for a couple to experience Seattle. It is a short walking distance from the main streets of Capital Hill, or a quick bus ride on the 49. This treehouse is amazing and especially unique - I have never experienced an Airbnb that had both a piano and a record player! The treehouse was overall cozy - the bed was great and there was a nice fireplace to keep things warm. There is a small kitchen, so making a large meal could be a challenge, but all of the essentials are there. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend experiencing Seattle from this vantage point - it is a trip I will never forget! "
55204	3352685	10.0	9.0	28029809	We enjoyed our stay in the treehouse! The space was exactly as described. Allison was very accommodating. She was available if we needed anything but she also did not impose. Check in/out was a breeze.
55205	3352685	10.0	9.0	28195399	Very cool place to stay right in the middle of Seattle. Allison was very helpful. As a bonus the place is only a short drive from some of the best restaurants and nightlife in Seattle. 
55206	3352685	10.0	9.0	28812035	The treehouse was just as charming as it seems online.  Allison gave great directions for finding it and was incredibly accommodating in leaving extra pillows and blankets so that we could use the couch for additional sleeping space. It's not quite walkable to the bars and restaurants, but it's only a short Uber ride away, which we utilized with ease. We played records, tinkered on the piano, and enjoyed walking up among the trees! 
55207	3352685	10.0	9.0	29743814	Everything was great! enjoyed the piano and the record player. Peaceful treehouse with a nice view of the lake!
55208	3352685	10.0	9.0	30676492	The treehouse was just as described by Allison. It was a perfect place for my husband and I to stay while in Seattle for a couple of days. The neighborhood was very safe and was near the majority of sites we wanted to see while we were in town. 
55209	3352685	10.0	9.0	31217742	"We're from California and stayed the weekend here for our anniversary because it's been my husband's dream to stay in a tree house! It was absolutely adorable, and the location was perfect for our sightseeing plans. There is a full kitchen, so we made breakfasts there while listening to Aretha Franklin on Allison's record player. If you're planning to stay here, just remember it's a tree house so it's a little more rustic than a hotel. However, that's also what makes it so charming!

Allison as a host was very responsive especially during our visit there. "
55210	3352685	10.0	9.0	34454707	Allison was an amazing host. Her communication leading up to our arrival was great she answered all our question in a timely manner. This place was in a great location close to everything. There was everything you could ever need in a place. Allison even left a personalized not upon arrival. Can't wait to come back and stay again.

It is located in a great part of the city with lots diverse of things to do very close by. 
The bed was very comfortable and her apartment was incredibly clean. 
I would highly recommend staying there. "
62584	8926060	10.0	10.0	54549670	Jason is friendly, helpful and easy to talk. His place is great and definately is among the best in this price level. It's great experience to me!
62585	8926060	10.0	10.0	58112142	Jason's place was well located in a great part of town. The place was nice and access was very convenient. Would highly recommend.
63239	6387576	10.0	10.0	32488197	The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
63240	6387576	10.0	10.0	33183991	A lovely stay to be had at this location. The personal touches from Joe and Ronnimae made us feel especially welcome and cared for; something unique to airbnb travels. The space was secure and well stocked -- from house shoes to earplugs, Joe and Ronnimae make sure you've got what you need. We were looking for a private setting and found the space ideal. It would work well for traveling couples or solo travelers due to the 2BD layout. No need for a full kitchen in the heart of Capitol Hill -- and the hosts have an array of information about unique to-dos in the area. We'll be here again in a heartbeat!
63241	6387576	10.0	10.0	33488689	Joe definitely made us feel welcome.  He was very accommodating even when we were making the reservations the evening we wanted to stay there.  The room is as described.  We rented just one bedroom and then you share a great common space/ living area and bathroom if there is someone in the other bedroom.  It worked great. Love the extra touches…water, chocolate and popcorn!!!  And the walking map was invaluable.  Would definitely recommend this great place, in a great neighborhood, for great value!!!  The only challenge is parking …since his spots were already taken we had to find neighborhood parking which did work out after driving around for a bit. Seattle parking is a challenge period.  
63242	6387576	10.0	10.0	33732691	"What a great spot! Joe & Ronnimae have built the space to be like a two bedroom apartment with it's own separate entrance so I didn't feel like I was bothering them if we came in late. Each bedroom is locked and the spaces are shared. I think we even got pretty lucky with a nice ""flat mate."" They provided many necessities including tasty Tully's coffee for the morning, and a popcorn maker for late night snacking. The location was perfect for walking around to bars and restaurants in Capital Hill, Pike/Pine, Downtown, etc. Joe & Ronnimae had a parking spot available we were able to purchase at a very reasonable cost. Worth it. We recommend going to Tula's Jazz Lounge. Great fun!"
63243	6387576	10.0	10.0	33974891	"After one night at Joe and Ronnimae's Oasis, I contemplated extending my time in Seattle.  All superlatives apply.  These simply wonderful people have made every effort to create a welcoming and comfortable experience, and they have succeeded.  Best night sleep I've had in a long time. 

They care, and it shows.  Plain and simple.  Perfect.  

"
63244	6387576	10.0	10.0	34477772	"Joe and Ronnimae have an awesome private setup, with little touches that make your stay extra comfortable. Brownie points for:
- Clean linens + towels 
- Eye mask + ear plugs + water
- Keurig coffee maker in the shared living area
- Clean bathroom stocked with everything you might need

They've thought of every need that a traveller might have, including space heater in the bathroom, toiletries, a multi-point extension cable, and plastic slip-ons for wearing inside the house when it's raining.

They're also very amicable,  hospitable, and kind. They even got me a cupcake for the day of my birthday. I can't recommend them enough and will definitely try and stay with them the next time I visit Seattle. Plus, very convenient access to several awesome dining and drinking spots in the Pike/Pine corridor.  "

63248	6387576	10.0	10.0	36318326	We were only in Seattle for the last night of our honeymoon, but Joe made us feel so at home in this beautiful oasis. We were greeted with a gift and giving great words of wisdom about where to go and what to see. Joe and Ronnimae have been in Seattle a long time and are able to offer great advice about their beautiful city. We would recommend staying here to anyone considering a trip to Seattle. We hope to be back one day!
63249	6387576	10.0	10.0	36645684	Ronniemae & Joe were wonderful hosts & I appreciate their quick response & flexibility in hosting me last minute.

Joe was a wonderful host, welcomed us when we arrived and made sure we got settled and had everything we needed. We unfortunately didn't get to meet Ronnimae, but I'm sure she's great too! The location was awesome, right by Capitol Hill with restaurants and coffee shops very close. Also, was a reasonable 30 minute walk or short uber ride to downtown. For the great location and amenities provided the cost to stay here was reasonable (much better than the hotel options). Would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend!
63252	6387576	10.0	10.0	36994183	Joe was very friendly, made sure we had what we needed, and contacted us immediately after our departure about an item left in the room. The neighborhood is great, walking distance to everything in Capitol Hill.

63258	6387576	10.0	10.0	43624878	We didn't get a chance to meet Joe and Ronnimae as they were on vacation during our stay, but they were very responsive leading up to the trip and had someone meet us when we arrived and be available whenever we needed anything. The bedroom was cozy but the bed was extremely comfortable and the place is in a great neighborhood--full of restaurants and bars and an easy bus ride to downtown. It was a great place to stay and I would highly recommend!

Walking distance to just about everything, including downtown. The common space is shared, but that's clear from the description. Joe was happy to give us recommendations and help in any way possible. I only wish we could have stayed for longer!
63261	6387576	10.0	10.0	46278218	This was a great place to stay. The listing completely captured the spirit of the accommodations. Joe & Ronnimae really evoke the spirit of Airbnb. They are interested and available and made everything easy. It was a cozy place in a great location. Easy to get to from downtown and TONS to do in the neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend this place!
63262	6387576	10.0	10.0	46841190	My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the charming Oasis.  We got to meet Joe and he was a really helpful in providing us insight into the neighborhood and how to get around the city.  Next time we may not bother with a rental car.  We didn't realize how good public transportation was here!  Joe was very knowledgeable about music and we had a great time talking about our likes and sharing our observations about bands and cultures.  They were very hospitable and the room was very cosy / cute.  They provided us with bottles of water and Skittles, and having the little refrig,  Microwave, coffee maker,  and popcorn popper was a treat.  We would recommend them as host, and stay again if we need a place. 
63263	6387576	10.0	10.0	47137542	Joe and Ronnimae were fantastic hosts and we're super easy to reach for letting us into their place. Very welcoming and friendly. Their place is perfectly located in Capitol Hill just blocks away from some great bars and restaurants on Broadway and 12th St. The place is clean and quaint. I will definitely try to stay here again next time I'm up in Seattle.
63264	6387576	10.0	10.0	47246367	The location was absolutely perfect for us, being it was just two blocks for our son and daughter in law's small apartment.  We were able to leave our rental car parked at the house when we were visiting and they could walk to us to travel on day trips in our car.  The room was nice and the common area was great to relax after a long day hiking.  I was glad we were the not ones using that space during our stay.  I was not too keen on sharing a bathroom if someone had been booked in the other room.  Joe made us feel welcome in his home and they provided many amenities, if we had needed anything.  I was not expecting wifi access so that was a bonus.  The chickens on the property were interesting as well and very well behaved.  We would stay here again on a return visit to see family.
63265	6387576	10.0	10.0	48294075	We had a great stay, and the host was both welcoming and accommodating. He even sent us text updates about our room and other events going on in town during our stay. The property is secluded from the rest of the house, and on a very quiet street, but still a short walk form busy restaurants and night life. Couldn't have asked for a better location. It's a bit of a walk to the downtown/market area, but we walked it back and forth everyday with no issue. We would definitely recommend this property to others using Airbnb in Seattle.
63266	6387576	10.0	10.0	48944794	Wonderful experience! Spacious, beautiful room, centrally located. Joe was very welcoming and gave us a lot of great tips. It was a pleasure staying here.
63267	6387576	10.0	10.0	49152653	We stayed in Joe and Ronnimae,s place for a couple of days at the beginning of our trip. They were extremely nice and welcoming, even helping us to locate a bag lost by the airline.  They also had plenty of helpful tips and advise about the local neighbourhood, which is definitely the best location to stay in Seattle.  The flat itself is comfortable and private (we had the place to ourselves), and has all you need for a good stay. Thanks Cath and Rob
63268	6387576	10.0	10.0	49849116	Joe and Ronniemae's Oasis is a very charming spot! This was my first airbnb experience and it won't be my last! I loved all the small touches and consideration that Joe and Ronniemae put into their airbnb. Everything is labeled which makes it easy to remember where things go away, and there are plentiful seattle guides for every interest group available for reference. Joe stayed up late to show us in because we got in rather late, and he had lots of great suggestions on where to go and what to eat! All together a lovely stay! 
63269	6387576	10.0	10.0	50032217	Joe was extremely friendly and accommodating. He waited for me despite I was late to the check-in agreed time due to traffic and work commitments. Although I stayed for only one night, it was extremely comfortable. Joe was waiting for me, showed me around and had a great enjoyable conversation with him. The place was very spacious and comfortable, it had everything you could ever think of. He even very kindly blocked the other room for me so I could have the entire place. The location was great, close to many restaurants yet very quite in a leafy residential street. I really enjoyed my stay and I will certainly be back when im in town.

63274	6387576	10.0	10.0	54755190	I loved staying at Joe's place. The room and shared space are very comfy, and the location is great: very central, walking distance to downtown, just around the corner from restaurants and bookshops. Joe was super helpful with directions and advice for having a good stay, and George the St Bernard is a total sweetheart. I'd happily stay there again.
63275	6387576	10.0	10.0	55098459	What an amazingly, cozy place to stay while visiting Seattle!  Very charming, flexible, laid back host that was super personable and is very knowledgable about pretty much anything you need or want around the nighborhood.  Easy, short walk to amazing food and pubs.  Two thumbs up here and as my first Airbnb experience, I don't think I can ever stay at a hotel again! 
63276	6387576	10.0	10.0	56439695	"The location is perfect for exploring Capitol Hill and adjacent neighborhoods and it couldn't be more convenient for catching the bus (two stops with routes that took us everywhere we wanted to go literally within 2-3 blocks).  It is also within realistic walking distance to downtown, but honestly we never walked the trek because the bus is just so easy (and it was winter and slightly drizzly and cool).

The apartment is adorable and charming and Joe far exceeded my expectations for a host. He was easy to contact for any questions, gave us some great locals tips for the neighborhood, and offered ideas for what to do on off-weather days. The apartment had tons of great resources for what to do and how to get there in Seattle, everything is labelled and accessible (love that they posted the WiFi password on the wall), and we loved that they had the most up to date copy of the Stranger waiting for us! That's how we found out about an awesome bluegrass evening in Fremont. As always we just wish we had more time to spend there. It would have been the perfect place to curl up and read a bit, but we were always on the go.  I'm considering returning to the ""charming oasis"" for a February trip. Couldn't have asked for more."

Their home is beautiful and in a great neighborhood. Luckily for us, their home was very kid friendly as well and our two young boys loved their time there.
65893	7638689	10.0	10.0	47729441	We were kindly greeted by Dan who went over the house details. The home was very clean and quaint. The neighborhood was peaceful and nostalgic. 
67257	7418814	10.0	9.0	39863593	We had a excellent stay with Kelly and co. Everything was as described, and we found ourselves surprised by the quality linens, hospitality, and overall tranquility of the setting. We were there with our teenage daughters, and found the accommodations surpassed our expectations. Fresh coffee in the fridge was a welcome perk, and my husband faved about the toiletries! We especially loved spending quality time with Rocky the dog while we were there. 5 stars all the way! Thank You!
67258	7418814	10.0	9.0	40183068	"Kelly's place was just what we needed. It was clean, pleasant, in a nice quiet neighborhood, and only 5 minutes from Green Lake where our relative was living. We got to watch one of our favorite Netflix shows, the bed was quite comfortable...with lots of pillows. The kitchen had the basics you will need...we enjoyed a nice cup of tea. Walk-in shower that was perfect for me since I have a broken ankle. Kelly wasn't there, but the instructions were clear, and there were no problems at all. 
I highly recommend it, and will stay there again if I am back in Seattle. "
67259	7418814	10.0	9.0	40508195	We didn't have an opportunity to meet Kelly, but we were very happy with out stay. The place was very clean and nicely appointed (great towels!). It was easy to get to downtown. In addition Kelly left great instructions for restaurants within walking distance and other nearby activities. She even mailed us items we left behind. We highly recommend Kelly's place.
67260	7418814	10.0	9.0	41462673	"We had a great experience booking with Kelly. I ended up booking  the Roosevelt Roost for an employee who was in town for business and Kelly was great to work with. She was very understanding of our situation, quick to answer questions, and easy to work with.

Lauren (the guest) also had a great experience, so I wan't to pass along her feed back as well:

I wanted to thank you for your hospitality last week. It was a welcome change to not to stay in a hotel. Your recommendations on local restaurants and things to do was a nice touch. I travel to Seattle a few times a year and now have a few new favorite places to eat! 
Thank you!!"
67261	7418814	10.0	9.0	42435870	The listing description was exactly as presented, very nice, clean and quiet neighborhood.  We really enjoyed our stay, parking was tight but I believe that is the norm for the city.  Thank you for the coffee and chocolate!  
67262	7418814	10.0	9.0	43273869	"My husband, mother, and I stayed in Kelly and her husband's daylight basement for 5 days while we were checking out neighborhoods for our upcoming move to Seattle. It was fantastic! The space is spotless, and super comfortable. I was a little worried about having my mother on a sofa bed, but she was totally fine and slept great.

It's quiet and convenient - Kelly even leaves a book with a list/directions to local places for food, drinks, etc. There's a Whole Foods within walking distance, and the place is really convenient to freeways and getting around town. 

Finally, Kelly and her husband are so sweet! They were available if we had questions, but mostly just left us to our wandering about the city. And they have the cutest little dog, Rocco. We would definitely stay here again. "
67263	7418814	10.0	9.0	43808174	 Really enjoyed our stay. Kelly's place is super pleasant, immaculately clean and in a very nice location within easy walking distance of some great places for coffee, food or beer. Kelly was a pleasure to deal with -- very friendly and responsive. Great option for staying near the U-district. We would happily stay there again. 
67264	7418814	10.0	9.0	45125897	Kelly's place is awesome.  We love her neighborhood surrounded by trees and flowers. The grocery stores (Whole foods market & Farmers market), cafe, park, even U of Washington are walking distance. That is very convenient.  Everything we need to stay is there. We enjoyed sitting on a chair as feeling the fresh air and playing her dollable dog, 'Rocky' in front of porch. Kitchen is very confortable to cook. She prepared olive oil, spices, dinnerware, and many things to cook easily. Kelly and her husband, Patrick are so nice. They care guests sincerely. If we visit seattle to see our sons, we want to stay at Kelly's house again.   
67265	7418814	10.0	9.0	46168741	"My son and me had a great stay for one week at Kelly's. Kelly and her husband are perfect hosts. Very friendly and helpful. The apartment is exactly as described: spaceous, clean, well equipped. For a basement it is pretty light. Has it's own entrance and opens to the garden side. The neighborhood is residential and quiet, parking on the street easy.
All in all we had a great time and can highly recommend it."
67266	7418814	10.0	9.0	49337989	Kelly was so easy to work with - very accommodating. The apartment is wonderful - very spacious. The private, keyless access made coming and going easy and I never felt like I was disturbing anyone. As a 3-week renter, she gave me access to my own washer and dryer, as well as space to store my bicycle. Kelly was friendly and helpful with every request - even as small as me needing a vase for flowers I purchased at the market. The apartment is not completely sound-proof from the house above - I could often hear footsteps and voices, but nothing that ever woke me up or kept me awake. The location was awesome. Walking distance from anything I needed in Roosevelt/Ravenna and just close enough to the U-district for those special amenities. The bus stop is one block away, too, with direct access to downtown. I will certainly consider staying here on my next trip to Seattle. I highly recommend this rental - especially if you're staying more than a few days. The apartment is spacious enough for two to stay very comfortably (in a real bed) but definitely large enough to have additional guests visit for meals or study sessions.
67267	7418814	10.0	9.0	49905408	" Ravenna/Roosevelt Roost met all our expectations. Quiet, clean, comfortable, very well cared for. We were so happy to stay in such a nice apartment in a convenient neighborhood. 
"
67268	7418814	10.0	9.0	55113894	"The apartment was very nice, exactly as described. Everything was in great shape, well-maintained and very comfortable. Kelly was an attentive, flexible and super-helpful host. 

I live nearby, and we rented the apartment for my parents who were visiting from out of town. They want to stay there again, and I plan to recommend the spot to other out-of-town guests as well!

67402	5310503	10.0	10.0	27077678	Best deal in Seattle! Diana and her roommate  are friendly. The house is very clean. I love how orderly the house is. There is a Safeway in walking distance and a nice Latin American restaraunt across the street. I'd do it again if I need a place to crash.
67403	5310503	10.0	10.0	29332839	Diana was pretty kind :) Actually i couldn't see her a lot of time because of her personal stuff. But she explained all i need, and served comfortable spaces. Moreover i think the house was really nice. 
67404	5310503	10.0	10.0	30645590	Great host!
67405	5310503	10.0	10.0	31071006	I love this place. Really nice apartment, clean, neat, and light! Even it is a shared room, I have enough space. Diana is pretty busy. I enjoyed talking to her, smart and passionate.
67406	5310503	10.0	10.0	33194590	Honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I didn't spend much time there, but the time I was there I felt safe, comfortable (it's a very nice apartment: very clean and homely), and welcome.
67407	5310503	10.0	10.0	33612138	Diana was an excellent host. She reached out to me early and ensured I had directions and was registered to use her elock. Your phone is your key, so don't let your battery run out before you come home.  I was gone for most of the day and had very little interaction with Diana or her housemates, but they were all perfectly nice. The place was very neat and orderly and in a great part of town with easy access to downtown Seattle or Bellevue with very little freeway time needed. I would stay there again or recommend her to others.
67408	5310503	10.0	10.0	34029245	There is so clean and cozy room. I couldn't meet her, but everything was cleaned when I came back after day. It is little far from downtown, but it's easy to access.
67409	5310503	10.0	10.0	35567578	Diana was fabulous! The house was very clean and she made me feel so welcome! Thanks for the great experience!
67410	5310503	10.0	10.0	35873692	The house was extremely clean, comfortable and located close to different bus lines that'll take you downtown quickly. Diana was an amazing host and a very kind person. Thank you for everything!
67411	5310503	10.0	10.0	43574345	"This is a great place to stay if you’re ever in Seattle. Like people have already said, it’s a little far from the city, but only a little. Getting downtown was easy and it is a nice ride that goes by the University of Washington. You have access to the kitchen, along with pots and utensils, and there is Safeway pretty much right across the street. Diana was a great host; everything about my stay in Seattle was awesome.



"
67412	5310503	10.0	10.0	45178275	Diana is a friendly, welcoming host. We had a bad storm during the weekend I stayed and she kept me updated on where to find flashlights, etc. - so nice! Her house is comfortable and clean with plenty of space; looks just as pictured. There's a Safeway/Starbucks a couple of blocks away and downtown Seattle is a 20-30 minute bus ride. Would definitely stay again. Thanks, Diana! 
67413	5310503	10.0	10.0	45715070	"Everything about the listing exceeded my expectations, and it served as a great home-base for my first time in Seattle. The space is very clean, a bit larger than pictured, and fairly private for being a shared space. 

Diana is attentive and accommodating, but gives you plenty of privacy and freedom. Her positive attitude and friendliness made my stay a great one!"
67414	5310503	10.0	10.0	46207816	Diana is really cute and friendly. She cares about you. Good place to stay. The bed was really comfortable 
67415	5310503	10.0	10.0	49337158	ダイアナのお家は、写真の通りとても綺麗で心地よい空間でした。徒歩3分の所には値段的にも通いやすいスーパーがあり、いつもお世話になりました。彼女のキッチンには必要なものが全て揃っていて、購入した食材で心ゆくまで料理を楽しむことが出来ました。ダイアナは、物静かですが本当に親切で温かな女性です。
67416	5310503	10.0	10.0	49794523	Had an amazing time, though I wasn't at Diana's house that much I still enjoyed my stay there it was quite comfortable place to stay. I seriously loved it and the next time I visit this will be my first choice for places to stay.
67417	5310503	10.0	10.0	51507065	"I had a lovely time! The neighborhood is very quiet and I felt very comfortable walking around, even at night. 
Diana was a great host and I felt very comfortable in her home. I would recommend this home if you want to stay somewhere calm, clean and friendly. "
67418	5310503	10.0	10.0	52127423	Be sure to check the house manual for which apartment in the building it is -- the smart lock does not look like a smart lock from outside! The bed in the living room is just as Diana described it. It's conveniently located near several bus lines into downtown, and will be about a 30min trip available roughly every 15mins to get to downtown Seattle. Although I was rarely around so I didn't meet Diana in person, she was friendly and helpful in all of our communications.
67419	5310503	10.0	10.0	53577666	"Diana's place was perfect - I was in town for work and needed a place to get a good night's sleep. The house was clean & tidy, and very serene. Diana was very friendly and incredibly helpful, and really made sure I had everything I needed for my stay. Busing into town was a breeze, and the Safeway that's across the street made getting groceries easy, too.

Would definitely stay again!"
70048	8474584	10.0	10.0	49076064	Great experience!  Place was exactly as advertised.  10 minutes by bus to downtown.  Sonny was very prompt and helpful.  Will definitely stay here next time I'm in Seattle.
70049	8474584	10.0	10.0	53185787	Sonny was a great host. The apartment was beautiful and everything described. Anytime we had any issues, Sonny was just a text away and super responsive. I would recommend his listing to anyone visiting Seattle with a need for a comfortable, large space to stay. 
72761	4760181	10.0	10.0	24392336	We had a great stay at Felix's place. It was basically everything that you would want: clean, orderly, comfortable. Felix was leaving town the day we were arriving, but he was very accommodating and even dropped off a key for us at my sister's place. Felix was prompt about communicating things he thought we should know and replying to any questions we had.
72762	4760181	10.0	10.0	25057895	"What a great experience for a first time airbnber. I felt as if I was heading home to my own place at the end of each day. The location was very convenient and Felix kept everything very clean and organized. I was also just minutes away from the wonderful 24/7 Ballard Market if I ever did need anything. 

As a host, Felix was a very helpful and accommodating. A very laid back guy that truly enjoys meeting and offering recommendations to his guests (it was like crashing at an old buddy's place). On top of that, he has two adorable and well trained boxers that he brings out when he's home! 

All in all, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Thanks Felix!"
72763	4760181	10.0	10.0	25121804	"Felix was a fantastic host that was super friendly and welcoming. He definitely makes you feel at home and I really like how detailed the descriptions were prior to our arrival. We had to do a lot of communicating due to some delays, and he was very responsive throughout our entire stay. Overall he was really easy to talk to and it was nice that we were able to grab a quick lunch with him on the first day, during which he gave some great advice on what to do in the Seattle area. 

The room itself was nice and I liked the fact that the heater kept us so toasty in the freezing weather. There were more than enough blankets for the two of us, with an extra one sitting in the closet. Though we didn't use it much, the tv in the room was nice to have as well. The location was extremely convenient and we were able to get everywhere we wanted to go to in a short amount of time. 

Great place to stay if you're in the Seattle area! Oh and Felix's two dogs are the most adorable and lovable furry little animals ever :) 
"
72764	4760181	10.0	10.0	25256705	"A friend and I stayed at Felix place while stopping in Seattle during our roadtrip. He was an amazing host and made us feel like at home. The seperate room with it's own bathroom is very convenient and we could also use the kitchen and living room. The whole apartment was very clean and a good starting point to explore Seattle because the neighbourhood is really nice and the public transportation is close which makes it easy to get everywhere. Even though we stayed at his place during weekdays, Felix took the time to show us some nice places and gave us many recommendations where to go.

We had an awesome stay with the perfect host and can recommend him to everybody!"
72765	4760181	10.0	10.0	26002936	"I stayed for 21 days! The description is accurate.

The place is new, neat and clean and Felix puts in lot of effort to keep it that way. He is also tech savvy so the house is furnished with all gadgets you can think of.

The house is well connected to the city you can find restaurants and supermarkets close by.

Felix respects privacy and accommodates any level of interaction. He is also always reachable by text if he is not home. And if you are into dogs you are in for a treat cause you will find 2 or 3 :)"
72766	4760181	10.0	10.0	26222347	"I went to Seattle for business trip. 

I was planning to stay at Hotel. But I needed cozy place like home to relax and it was great choice that I stayed in Felix's house instead of hotel.

I got to say just one thing. ""Best!""
nice and clean house with great host!

I'm going to stay his house next year!

Felix was great about talking us through the different neighborhoods so that we could have a more authentic experience. He even drove us to Ballard so we could walk to the beach!

The room we had originally booked was actually being renovated while we were there, so we stayed in the larger upstairs room, which was just perfect for the 2 of us! I will say, although there were construction noises, they only started at a very reasonable time, and we were never disturbed. Felix was very generous about sharing snacks and beverages, and his dogs were extremely allergen-free and well behaved. I would not hesitate to recommend Felix for a future stay! "
72771	4760181	10.0	10.0	28839303	"Felix was a great host! He made me feel right at home. His place is very nice, new, clean and comfortable. His dogs are very friendly and playful! He showed me around the neighborhood which was great!

Felix was really helpful giving advice on neighborhoods, restaurants, and hikes to check out!"
72773	4760181	10.0	10.0	29833722	Felix was busy when we first arrived, but his friend Khloe greeted us and showed us our room and common living space of this attractive condo very conveniently located only a few blocks from our daughter's home and performance venue, both on Phinney Ridge. We soon met Felix, the dogs, and were made to feel welcome.  Felix introduced us to an impressive app (August Smart Lock) for access to his place and helped me install it on my iphone. Sweet!  Our busy schedule kept us out a lot, but we enjoyed our stay and would gladly return.
72774	4760181	10.0	10.0	30090155	"My boyfriend and I loved our stay with Felix! The room was downstairs with its own bathroom, incredibly soft sheets (double points), a sliding door to outside and a TV. Perfect little home-away-from home with some privacy. The space is just a hop-skip and jump from some of the greatest treasures of Seattle (take the bus anywhere and you'll be there within 15 minutes). 

Felix was a completely gracious host. He had snacks and coffee for us and gave us advice on the what-to-dos of Seattle. His two pups are to-die-for adorable and will become your new best friends. 

Felix gave us great conversations and a great space for our quick stay in Seattle. He was always prompt to respond with questions and made sure we were well taken-care of. 

If you're looking for a place to kick-back with a bit of privacy (or great conversations about the start-up world and beyond), I highly recommend Felix :) We'll absolutely stay again when we visit Seattle!"

If your in town for that, this is a great place to start ( or end up for the night hehe) We had our own downstairs living quarters along with bathroom. Simple room with bed and tv. What else do you need?  Very clean room. You can use his fridge if need be. His dogs were super friendly and did not disturb you in your part of the house, unless you allow them to. Shirt walking distance from public trasportation. I highly recommend this place. Thank you Felix for having us!
72783	4760181	10.0	10.0	32576195	Felix and his pups were kind and gracious hosts. Being international travelers without wifi/cell service in the States produced a separate set of challenges, but Felix was very responsive in ensuring that we had everything we needed to feel comfortable.

The room is lovely and the bed comfy. It's very private with all the right touches to make you feel right at home. 
His kitchen is stocked with snacks and tea and coffee.
His roommate and lady were very friendly and welcoming as well. AND THE POOCHES are darling! Great playmates with sweet kisses all around!

72791	4760181	10.0	10.0	34872027	Felix is readily available to share both his home and his passion for his town. Very accommodating and generous with his time. As a guest, you are treated like an old friend from college moreso than a stranger. The space is quiet and well equipped. I especially appreciated Felix's extensive hospitality. I would greatly recommend a stay in the private suite. The location is terrific to access park and neighboring downtown Ballard. Don't miss Slate coffee! Thank you Felix! You made my stay what it was!

The bed was super comfortable, the best one we stayed on while on our 18 day trip, also the room and bathroom were very clean! 

Felix showed us around thoroughly when we arrived and introduced us to his wonderful two boxers! They are super awesome dogs, love to be pet, but will also give you your space if you need it. We couldn't get enough of them! 

Felix was a fantastic host, he had friends over often during dinner time and urged us to join them in watching one of the NBA finals games with them at the house! He is very outgoing and great to talk to about things to do in the area. Just a cool laid back guy! 

If you're in the Seattle are I highly recommend staying with Felix! You definitely won't find anywhere better. So glad we stayed here instead of the city! "
72793	4760181	10.0	10.0	35486037	We stayed with Felix for three nights and had a great time. He is a wonderful host and has two adorable and super friendly boxers. Felix made sure that we had everything needed, provided us with lots of great tips on where to go and how to get about, and even organized our transfer to the airport. Our flight went at 5 am, which means we had to get picked up in the middle of the night. Everything went very smoothly.
72794	4760181	10.0	10.0	35669291	Felix is an wonderfully gracious host. His taste in coffee is impeccable, and the room itself was clean, bright, and very private. It was about as optimal as the experience could be.  
72795	4760181	10.0	10.0	36210196	The apartment was great on the lowest level. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. The walk to the main strip in Ballard (where the yoga studios and restaurants are) was about 20-25 minutes. I needed a blow dryer and was promptly met with one upon request. This location is also not far from public bus transportation. Felix and Khloe were also very nice and welcoming.
72796	4760181	10.0	10.0	36884233	"We enjoyed our stay with Felix immensely!  Felix & Chloe were very welcoming and helpful.  We happened to be visiting during a heat wave, and the air conditioning unit in our room was AMAZING!  The room had everything we needed:  a private bathroom, a sliding door to the patio, and was also nicely tucked away on the bottom floor.  It was really a wonderful stay.  Also, we enjoyed Felix's boxers, Kai & Karma.  They were so sweet and well-mannered! 

If you have any questions about Seattle or the surrounding areas, Felix is your guy.  We've been interested in moving to Seattle for a while, so we had a bunch of questions.  He was very patient and informative :)

Stay here!  It was in a great location, a great value, and great people (and dogs)!"
72797	4760181	10.0	10.0	37468082	We really enjoyed our stay at Felix's place. It's in a great location for getting downtown, with a bus just outside. Felix made sure we had everything we needed and was keen to suggest ideas for where to go. The place was reply clean and the snacks were great to have for making sure we didn't go hungry. Felix's dogs are fantastic fun and very well natured and I really wanted to take them with me when I left!Many thanks, Felix!
72798	4760181	10.0	10.0	38124597	Our trip started out nice with easy access to the room thanks to the door lock app. Felix was out of town when we got there but arranged for his girlfriend to welcome us. The room was very simple and just what we needed. The air conditioner is the room felt so nice. The TV was a good size and had plenty of channels, perfect for winding down at the end of the day while getting comfy in the extremely comfortable bed with soft sheets. Although we didn't really take advantage of it, having complimentary coffee and snacks in the common area helped us feel more welcomed and more likely to go upstairs. The dogs were totally kickass and it was nice to be greeted by them. The house was extremely close to a coffee shop and a pizza place, perfect for getting coffee in the morning or getting a snack throughout the day. It was pretty quick getting anywhere we needed to go with Uber, no matter what district it was in. All in all I would definitely recommend staying at Felix's place. 
72799	4760181	10.0	10.0	38611883	Felix was super nice and handled everything through text very efficiently before my arrival.  I arrived later due to my flight being delayed but because of his smartphone connected door lock i didn't need to worry about waking anyone in the house to let me in.  The door was super convenient and allowed me to come and go without worrying about keys.  His place was a quick walk from main Ballard dining and bar area and was really convenient.  
72800	4760181	10.0	10.0	39081850	We felt very comfortable at Felix's home.  It is located in very safe Seattle neighborhood.
72801	4760181	10.0	10.0	39671192	We loved staying at Felix's place. Him and his girlfriend Kloe were very friendly and welcoming during our 5-night stay.  They had great suggestions of things to do and places to eat around the city. The suite we stayed at was downstairs (still fully above ground) right off the main entrance. It was clean, with modern minimal finishes & felt private. We highly recommend this place!
72802	4760181	10.0	10.0	39932999	Felix was super friendly and helpful! The space was private and and clean and the location was great too! 
72803	4760181	10.0	10.0	40361554	Felix was very helpful and friendly. He had some great suggestions for Seattle and really made us feel at home! Very comfortable bed. 
72804	4760181	10.0	10.0	41091983	Felix was out of town, but his partner was very gracious and welcoming.  The quarters were bright and clean. I had no trouble finding his home, and getting around was easy. Ballard itself is an interesting part of Seattle, and the Ballard Locks should not be missed. Did not get a chance to know the two boxers, but they are impressive.
72805	4760181	10.0	10.0	41851941	Felix gave us a quick tour and key.
72806	4760181	10.0	10.0	42431733	Charles and I had an amazing time staying at Felix's! He was away while we were there, but he was extremely accommodating and easily accessible by text. His girlfriend Khloe and adorable dogs were there to meet us, and they were all absolutely wonderful. We fell in love with the dogs and it was so hard to leave them when they gave us those puppy dog eyes! Khloe herself was so sweet and we felt so comfortable being there. She gave us suggestions on places to go and helped us out with any questions we had. The room was exactly as described (even better), and we were so glad to get there after a long day of travelling. To be able to just shower and rest in that clean & serene room was heaven. The AC was a lifesaver as it was pretty hot out during our trip, AND it made no noise - which was great. We enjoyed watching a bit of TV before bed, and the complimentary coffee and tea in the morning was awesome. The room was very private, the house was very comfy and clean, and we truly were so glad we chose to stay there. We will definitely book again with Felix next time we're out on the west coast! 
72807	4760181	10.0	10.0	43051735	Felix was a wonderful host! He made every effort to make my friend and I feel at home, and was incredibly welcoming and friendly. The room was exactly as described on the listing, and was clean and very comfortable.  Felix had great recommendations on dining and coffee shops in the area, and was very communicative via text/phone whenever we had questions. Thanks Felix! 
72808	4760181	10.0	10.0	43799167	Felix and Khloe are wonderful, welcoming, and friendly hosts! The house is clean and the room is very comfortable! The dogs are super fun and friendly, too!! I felt right at home using the kitchen and dining room (snacks, tea/coffee/water, cereal and bagels provided!!) The A/C is such a lovely bonus given the unusually hot summer Seattle has been experiencing. Location is very central - in Ballard, close to Fremont and Magnolia neighborhoods, 10 minutes to downtown, and easy access to I5. Easy parking right in their driveway. I would definitely stay again!!
72809	4760181	10.0	10.0	44477137	Everything about my stay was absolutely wonderful! Felix, Khole and all the animals made my stay so welcoming and fun! With all the tips Khole gave me I felt like a local. The bedroom and bathroom are clean and quietly situated off to themselves. The free snacks and coffee were a treat and everything was just FABULOUS!! I will definitely stay again if I can the next time I visit Seattle!
72810	4760181	10.0	10.0	45273512	"Staying with Felix was fantastic. From the moment I arrived in Seattle (and Ballard), I felt welcome and right at home. Felix hooked me up with a great location for happy hour oysters, and gave me a wonderful tour of the local spots.

The location is great - about a mile/15 min walk from downtown Ballard; and 10-15 min Uber to downtown Seattle. I will look to stay with him again on my next visit for sure. Thanks Felix!"
72811	4760181	10.0	10.0	45967244	"We had a wonderful time in Seattle! Felix's place was just as described in the listing. He was very good about communicating with us prior to arrival and made the process very simple. The suite is very private and located down a small flight of stairs immediately upon entry. Everything was clean when we arrived and we had access to a closet, full bathroom, TV, movies and a small patio with a table & chairs. He provided us with plenty of extra towels and linens as well. The room also had a wall unit a/c and space heater so that we could adjust the temperature in the room as needed. 

The location was great, close to the city and other cool neighborhoods that had good spots to eat. Felix was awesome about providing us with suggestions on food and activities. As we were staying over the weekend, he also frequently welcomed us to join what he was doing. 

Overall great experience. We loved Seattle and would definitely go back and stay with Felix! "
72812	4760181	10.0	10.0	47283450	"Felix was a fine and welcoming host. The apartment was clean and comfortable, the rented room was nicely separated from common spaces for privacy, and Felix made snacks available in the kitchen.  Felix and Khloe were both friendly and happy to answer questions about the area. His boxers were great, too!

The area itself is good--relatively quite, but close to lots of restaurants in Ballard, close to public transit, and a short drive or bus ride away from downtown."
72813	4760181	10.0	10.0	48133650	Felix was a fantastic host, hands down. No problems whatsoever. We arrived and found the accommodations just as described - if not better considering the (very) comfortable bed and TV situation. He greeted us and chatted with us about neighborhoods, nightlife, etc. which proved helpful. The iPhone app used to open the door was also great and easy to use. Totally recommended for anyone looking at Fremont/Ballard adjacent. 
72814	4760181	10.0	10.0	48888975	Kloe welcomed us and introduced us to the three dogs and other guest who was staying there.  She made things in the kitchen available to us and was amiable.  Our room was small but comfortable and adequate .  The bed was comfortable (low for some folks maybe),  The bathroom was fine although the sink drained slowly.  Good shower! The room was quiet and there was a nice TV.  It was a good stay and we definitely recommend it.  One must enjoy dogs.  They are friendly and fun and well behaved.  A big plus for us since we love dogs!  Definitely would return.
72815	4760181	10.0	10.0	50806424	We had a lovely stay at Felix's place. The room was clean, comfortable, and private. The common areas were clean and lovely, and the coffee and snacks were a sweet touch.The dogs were wiggly and amazing! Felix was prompt to text back and had lots of great recommendations for us. The neighborhood was quiet and safe, with some great shops and restaurants a 10-15 minute walk away. In general, though, we got around via cab and bus. 
72816	4760181	10.0	10.0	51218508	I could not have had a better experience here with Felix. The neighborhood was gorgeous and the location is not far from anything you need to get to in Seattle. During the week I was in Seattle on business and had work to do. Felix accommodated me and gave me space to get what I needed to done. The basement room is very private and Felix didn't come down there once. On the weekend, he invited me out with his friends, and took me to all the known spots in Seattle. He is a natural host and clearly wants his guests to enjoy themselves and have a great time. On my last day him and his girlfriend Chloe ordered us chinese food and we watched some walking dead. The cost of staying here is very competitive to everything else in the area, and the quality of the stay is outstanding. I would not only recommend this to everyone who is looking at its listing, I will most likely return in the winter for some snowboarding with Felix. 
72817	4760181	10.0	10.0	52173425	Felix was fantastic! He welcomed me when I arrived and made me feel right at home. He also texted me some during my trip with recommendations on things to do and to ensure I was having a great time. I spend a lot of my time just walking around and exploring the neighborhood and had a great time.  The room itself was as described, nice bed and sheets, nice hot shower and small back patio for stepping outside.
72818	4760181	10.0	10.0	52790226	Felix was a great host! really relaxed and open. We got along pretty well and he was kind enough to show me around the neighborhood restaurants. The room was clean and cozy and it was very easy to feel at home there. The dogs are super nice and incredibly well trained and polite (...you know some dogs go nuts). All in all great time and I will definitely try to book Felix's place next time I'm in town. 
72819	4760181	10.0	10.0	54927138	I had a fantastic stay at Felix's place. His house is very clean with great amenities and a beautiful view! Loved using the Kevo app he had set up for his guests as well as his gracious breakfast bar setup. He was a perfect host and I couldn't have felt more comfortable. Side note: his dogs are awesome and super friendly. I just relocated to the Seattle area and Felix gave me some great tips for the area and even some restaurant recommendations I'm looking forward to checking out soon. Couldn't recommend his place more!! Thanks so much for the hospitality. 
72820	4760181	10.0	10.0	55403842	We stayed at Felix's place during the Thanksgiving week and Felix decided to visit his family for Thanksgiving so we never met him.  There was a miscommunication between Felix and his girl friend so when we arrived no one was home.  Fortunately Felix had hidden keys in a couple locations so, with Felix's directions via cell phone, we were able to get in.  The best thing for us was the location in Ballard.  The room was small and clean with an attached private bath.  The bed was a low profile  design so there was no place for two people to set down and have a conversation in the room.  Usually there was on street parking available within 1 block of Felix's place.   
73354	2761092	10.0	9.0	40023923	Amy's space was absolutely charming. My sister and her girls stayed here, and Amy made sure they felt right at home. The pictures do not do justice to what a cute home this is. I will definitely rent from her again the next time I have guests in town.
73355	2761092	10.0	9.0	40378868	A friend and I rented Amy's place during a roadtrip up to Seattle. Amy was marvelous! She was very hospitable and even kept an eye out for a FedEx package that we ended up needing to mail at the last minute. She was great at staying in communication and answering any questions! She provided a list of things for my friend and I to see during our stay. Would definitely stay here again! 
73356	2761092	10.0	9.0	41009494	My sister, son and I stayed at Amys for one night. We loved the comfortable atmosphere she has created in her home and would definitely stay here again. Everything we needed was provided and the place was very clean and comfortable. Much nicer than staying in a hotel.
73357	2761092	10.0	9.0	41822417	Amy was an outstanding host, she made sure we always had what we needed and was able to help us when we needed an iron which was a huge relief. She also had a very organized and clean house with sticky notes all over that helped us with random, but necessary, facts or tidbits. She responds to any text within the hour or right away. I am very pleased I was able to stay here and would recommend anyone to stay with her. Thank you Amy
73358	2761092	10.0	9.0	42443099	We felt we had everything we needed for our trip. Admittedly we came to check out the local nightlife and we were not disappointed. She gave us a list of local pubs and eateries which we enjoyed. This next thing may seem trivial, but she also provided us with purified water. It was the little things that made this place great. Thanks Amy!
73359	2761092	10.0	9.0	42610804	Not too bad! Rental car was great to have, we were in downtown Seattle in no time. The space was cozy and modest, but without a proper kitchen or laundry. Amy, however, was more than happy to open the separating door and let us use those amenities, and invited us to eat the Indian food she had just brought back from a catering job. The main drag that the house is located on is quite noisy, but Amy left us some earplugs to accommodate for that. She also set us up for breakfast, coffee, and a nice shower. The space had everything we needed.
73360	2761092	10.0	9.0	42905276	The place was clean and well stocked. Loved the quirky charm and great location. Amy was great to interact with. Would definitely stay again.
73361	2761092	10.0	9.0	43277638	Amy is a sweetheart, very accommodating and available if anything requires attention or if you have any questions. The house is adorable with a lot of character and a fun, artsy feel (you can tell a lot of thought and creativity went into the decor). Fantastic location, will absolutely use again!
73362	2761092	10.0	9.0	43703070	"Amy was a fantastic host.
Appertment is very unique. 
Everything was perfect"
73363	2761092	10.0	9.0	44014623	Great little house! Loved the neighborhood and easy to get to from the freeway.
73364	2761092	10.0	9.0	46038316	The place was great and the hosts were very generous. 
73365	2761092	10.0	9.0	46540450	Oh amy is a fantastic gardener. We never actually met, but, we loved staying at her house. 
73366	2761092	10.0	9.0	46677457	The host is helpful overall. Home decoration is decent and delicate. The only thing is the location as it is right next to busy traffic. It is a bit noisy at night. It would be better also if kitchen can be opened up to use. 
73367	2761092	10.0	9.0	46945070	Amy and husband were very nice. Place was very clean and comfortable. Convenient location to freeway and nice neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again. Everything we needed and more.
73368	2761092	10.0	9.0	47398825	it was so perfect to stay durng our trip so that it was very convenient to go airport. the house is very confortable for us to stay and it was very clean.
73369	2761092	10.0	9.0	48571918	It was an amazing place to stay. Love the corky decor:) Beautiful view of mountains! Great location to catch the bus for downtown. Can't wait to visit again
73370	2761092	10.0	9.0	49469725	"Amy and Eric were wonderful.  They made it easy to find the house with emails and texts.  And they had everything organized so we didn't have to wonder what light switch turned on what (as it is an old home and they are quirky LOL).  House rules were clear and concise. Everything was as described, so there were no surprises!
The beds were comfortable and so were the pillows. :)  And we loved the little lights in the rooms and outdoors.
They made us feel very welcome and even had popcorn and breakfast bars available for us.  What a great experience to stay in this home.
We loved staying at this home and would do so again!  One of my favorite places to stay in this area."
73371	2761092	10.0	9.0	50334987	Amy's house was very clean and cozy. She put a lot of thought into making sure I had everything I needed. There were snacks, tea, coffee, cocoa, ear plugs, and notes everywhere making sure I understood the little quirks of her house. She provided restaurant recommendations that I was able to use during my stay. Her space was large, and I am glad I stayed here.
73372	2761092	10.0	9.0	51825327	We had a wander full stay. So many thoughtful touches, like tea and essential oils! Kind helpful hosts. Good location in a walkable neighborhood. Beautiful space. I miss it already!
73373	2761092	10.0	9.0	56950776	"We had a wonderful experience ! Amy made us feel so welcome, the home is very comfortable and full of character. 
We would definitely recommended Amy's home to anyone looking to stay in Seattle !
Thank you for everything, you and your home are amazing !"
73760	8645226	10.0	10.0	49952834	Ronda is a wonderful and heartly host. She replied within minutes to our request when we were desperately looking for a place to stay. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed our stay very much, and recommend Ronda's place to everyone looking for a clean and quiet and safe location with easy accesse to public transport to downtown Seattle. We would definitly stay there again.
73761	8645226	10.0	10.0	50255260	I recommend Ronda. Her place is great. Nice location and nice host.
73762	8645226	10.0	10.0	50715177	I had a wonderful stay with Ronda. She is such a warm and welcoming hostess and made sure that I had everything I needed. It was a plus to get to spend some time with her beautiful family and pets!
73763	8645226	10.0	10.0	51643649	"    Ronda was waiting for me though I had to check in quite late. She introduced me to her dog and cat and gave me hints on how things worked in the house, bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom is smallish yet the accommodation quality and location was great for me, especially given the attractive rental rate and flexible cancellation policy. And, she invited me to freely utilize the living room. Though Ronda is quite new as an Airbnb host, she is getting the hang of it rapidly and made herself always available in person or via text and cell phone.
    Neighborhood is sweet and a short walking distance to stores, restaurants and bus stops. I twice in the morning walked to an excellent bakery/coffeeshop then on to a bus stop to hook up with my family on Alki Ave.
    "
73764	8645226	10.0	10.0	52434594	Rhonda is a friendly, accommodating hostess eager to ensure I had a great visit. The property was described accurately, comfortable, and located just off the main street where several great local restaurants could easily be found.  It was also just across the bridge from downtown Seattle-making it easy to get in and out of the city.
73765	8645226	10.0	10.0	52862219	Staying in West Seattle with Rhonda was such a great experience.  She made our stay warm and welcoming (as her description states) and I would love to go back to stay another time.  
73766	8645226	10.0	10.0	53231498	Great stay and amazing hospitality. Perfect location with many options for food.

73768	8645226	10.0	10.0	53586573	AWESOME host. I was only there one night, but Ronda helped me feel at home. Great accomodations and a great neighborhood to be in. I hadn't explored West Seattle, but there were plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance. HIGHLY recommend this place. Thanks again, Ronda!!!
73769	8645226	10.0	10.0	53730982	Ronda was an amazing hostess. She was kind, caring, accommodating and compassionate.  I had the misfortune of fracturing my tibia while in Seattle and she went above and beyond to take care of me when I got out of the hospital.  Although her sole responsibility was to host me, Ronda proved to be a godsend in a time of need.  I recommend her to anybody!!!
73770	8645226	10.0	10.0	54762806	"Ronda is very welcoming and  enthusiastic, and the room is so nice and comfortable.
So I recommend Ronda highly."
77240	3986793	10.0	9.0	18701063	Fang is a great host, her house is very clean and light, in a nice part of town. Her service was impeccable, we received all the info we needed right away as well as towels and keys, we didn't need to ask one single question! I'd definitely stay again, her place was very relaxing after days of hiking in the Olympic national park
77241	3986793	10.0	9.0	18928094	It was quiet and very comfortable, she provided coffee and tea (which I didn't use), towels (which I did use), let me know any rules right away. Plus, she's on the edge of a beautiful park that leads to a small beach.

The house is located in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood that provides a real sense of peace and privacy while still having all the amenities one could want close at hand.

77248	3986793	10.0	9.0	22574462	This spot was perfect! The entire experience was seamless. Basically, we found out we had a chance to spend and extra night in Seattle, we contacted Fang, and the rest was easy. The place was EXACTLY as pictured/described, it is super quiet, the garden as gorgeous and you can check it out from the shower. The house and room is super clean, and a par drive to downtown Ballard. We would definitely stay here again!
77249	3986793	10.0	9.0	32026983	I had a great experience staying at Fangs home. She was there to greet me the moment I arrived and gave me a nice walk through of her home.

We will definitely be booking with Fang again.
77252	3986793	10.0	9.0	33013221	I enjoyed staying at Fang's home. It was clean and comfortable. Our room was just what we needed for the night, including some chocolate! Her boyfriend stayed the night. She let us know after we had settled in, but we didn't even see him, so he didn't bother us at all. It was a nice neighborhood.

Her happy and smiling face brightened each day and her helpful suggestions made getting around Seattle easy and fun. I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to experiencing her charming hospitality again. I will surely recommend her to my friends and relatives traveling to Seattle. One more thing, a beautiful, quiet and peaceful garden just outside the back door gave me the feeling of being on a meditation retreat. It made me want to linger and relax in the inviting atmosphere.

77725	1796302	10.0	10.0	8707726	Susanna and Patrick are great!  They provided me with everything I would've needed, in addition to giving great recommendations about places to see.  I was traveling by myself, but I felt very safe and comfortable in their home; it was nice to have a separate area so we didn't run into each other too much, but it was also nice to chat and get to know them.  I was lucky enough to catch a clear sun rise one morning on their private roof deck, a view that should not be missed!  I would definitely stay with them again the next time I'm in town.

Susanna's hospitality was nurturing and attentive to whatever I needed.  And their lovely home calmed my nervous anticipation.  Their sweet dog Ruu (who guests can meet if they chose) gave me the most polite and warm doggie greeting as well, so I got my dog fix while missing my dog back home.

The room and adjacent bath were clean and comfortable -- everything I needed -- and warm and cozy during a December cold snap.  Very reliable Internet. The house is an easy walk to the wonderful shops and restaurants in charming Fremont.  I would love to stay here again."

Her home is lovely, her pets are sweet, and her local knowledge is impressive.

I'll certainly plan my next trip to Seattle around Susanna's availability. I can't imagine staying anywhere else!

77740	1796302	10.0	10.0	10849968	I arrived wet and bedrangled after a 4 mile urban Seattle hike. Susanna ushered me in, dried my wet clothes. The house was lovely.

The place itself is beautiful, super-clean and the bathroom in particular (thanks to a sizeable shower) feels almost luxurious. You have the lower floor all to yourself, have your own set of keys and can use the kitchen: if you're looking for a a ""home away from home,"" this is it. I'd definitley stay here again. "
77743	1796302	10.0	10.0	11251360	My sister and I stayed with Susanna and Patrick for two nights and had an absolutely wonderful time.

The Freemont area has so many interesting places to shop, eat, hike, etc.  Everything I needed was provided and more so!  I believe I have found the place I want to stay for all my visits to Seattle in the future!  With a new grandbaby in the area, I plan to check in quite often.  Thank you for this great experience!  I feel I made new friends in these two folks and that makes me very happy!

77753	1796302	10.0	10.0	12330461	Such a wonderful first experience with AirBnB. The surrounding neighborhood was most excellent, and just around the corner were so many interesting places to eat and enjoy the unique Fremont neighborhood. We relied mostly on public transportation and the stops were just a jaunt away. Susanna and her husband were great hosts - but Royko the cat was furrily charismatic! A++, would AirBnB again.
77754	1796302	10.0	10.0	12477197	Susanna and Patrick were fabulous hosts! They gave TONS of recommendations for where to eat and visit and were flexible when we arrived later than we planned. I also really enjoyed having the privacy of the whole bottom floor and their friendly kitties to keep us company. The neighborhood was beautiful and nearby many neat restaurants and Seattle attractions. We had a wonderful time and would book with them again.
77755	1796302	10.0	10.0	12845120	We had a lovely time at Susanna and Patrick's. We enjoy staying in different Seattle neighborhoods when we go down for overnight visits from Bellingham. Susanna and Patrick's location in Fremont was ideal, and they steered us to a great restaurant for dinner. We had the entire lower level of their beautiful home to ourselves -- it was extremely comfortable, quiet, and cozy with lovely furnishings. We would definitely go back!
77756	1796302	10.0	10.0	12974478	My husband and I have been in many homes around the world, and Susanna & Patrick's place was one of the best. Susanna understands how to make her home a restful and welcoming retreat for travelers visiting Seattle. Their home was clean, visually attractive,  and comfortable physically and socially. An added bonus was the level of privacy with the lower level set aside for guests. The location was fun for accessing some of the interesting neighborhoods in Seattle, and walking to most places you might need to go. We plan to stay here again when in Seattle! 
77757	1796302	10.0	10.0	13143561	We had a great time at Susanna's house. It is a convenient location--  close to bus lines to downtown and walking distance to all of Fremont's attractions.

Susanna was very kind, flexible and helpful. Great coffee too.  Thank you! 
77758	1796302	10.0	10.0	13199269	"Susanna was very friendly and we enjoyed talking with her. She gave us

We really liked her place and would DEFINITELY go back. It is a nicely furnished room with a window opening out to nice shrubs, and birds singing outside. The bed is comfortable and everything was clean and light in color.  The bathroom was also very clean and new.  We had coffee and bagels in the morning. It was a comfortable and pleasant experience.

77759	1796302	10.0	10.0	13232755	Susanna and Patrick were terrific hosts for my very brief stay.  I didn't get to their home until late at night, but they were up and waiting and helped assist me with my suitcase up the stairs and then down the stairs into their guest quarters.  The room was just right and the sheets were super comfy.  I was able to find very thing I needed in the bathroom and was able to travel to my morning appointments in downtown very easily.  The home is located very close to Seattle center and I was able to navigate easily to find their home late at night.  I will definitely book more nights there in the future and hopefully get to know Susanna and Patrick more!  Thanks for the wonderful hospitality!

77761	1796302	10.0	10.0	13328140	"This AirBnB was quite amazing. Honestly Susanna would be awesome at running a bed and breakfast because that was how our stay felt. Of the two other places that we stayed at this was by far the best in terms of house and host quality. 

Susanna was very prompt with communication and met us at her house once we arrived. She was very accommodating as we had to drop off our luggage early. The home is a beautiful modern duplex that is wonderfully decorated. The photos are very accurate. The room is in a small basement with its own bathroom so it is very private. There is a beautiful large window and an interesting selection of books. The bathroom and bedroom were very clean.

The location of this AirBnB is north of the Seattle Center and in the Fremont area. It's in a perfect location as its the next street over from a bunch of restaurants and coffee shops including Cafe Vita and Paseo (famous cuban sandwich place). The bus stop is very close (about 4 minute walk) and Bus 5 will take you virtually the entire length of the seattle downtown. Therefore if you wanted to go to pike's place, the space needle, aquarium, international district, etc. this line takes you close to all of them. The zoo and the Fremont market are also both within walking distance ( 10-15 minute).

Patrick and Susanna are genuine sweet people who were a blast to stay with. They even provided breakfast and cookies for snacks! I would definitely stay here again. "

But we did arrive early enough to meet Susanna and felt very good about her arrangements.  She also provided an extensive list of restaurants and other highlights of the neighborhood.  We will definitely check with her about staying again on any future trips to Seattle.
77763	1796302	10.0	10.0	13692097	Susanna took great care of us when we stayed in her beautiful home.

I should also note that Susanna and Patrick have three very nice pets: a friendly old dog; a nice but shy cat who mostly stays upstairs; and a second cat, Royko, who is THE WORLD'S FRIENDLIEST CAT. Honestly, all he wants to do is be your best friend. "

The location is great and just a block away from coffee shops, a local grocery, and a variety of restaurants as well as the bus lines to take you into Seattle.  Susanna's was just a few blocks away from my daughters home, the perfect location for a 3 week visit to see my new granddaughter!  I will certainly be back again soon!

The rental is a bedroom and bathroom in the private downstairs area with shared common areas and kitchen. We had plenty of privacy and everything worked as it should. This house is conveniently located within walking distance of both Wallingford and Fremont ""downtown"" areas which have great shops and bars. Additionally, Vif wine and coffee bar is right around the corner and has some of the best espresso and pastries ever. Paseo is nearby and supposed to be great. Check out Theo, Brouwer's, and Revel down in Fremont and fresh IPA radlers at the Grizzled Wizard in Wallingford. So much to do, so little time..."

Gastgeber. Selbst unsere recht späte Ankunft am Abend war kein Problem.Das Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend, mit ausreichenden Parkmöglichkeiten und kurzem Weg zum Highway. Susanna spricht sehr gut Deutsch .Dies ist besonders schön für Alle, die ihr Schulenglisch schon etwas vergessen haben."
77781	1796302	10.0	10.0	19257998	Really couldn't have asked for a better host! Susanna thought of every possible amenity we could have needed.  She also had some recommendations for nearby restaurants that were spot on.  You can't beat this location either--walking distance to virtually all of Fremont, close to Ballard and easy access to the highway. The room was quiet, clean and very comfortable.  We also really enjoyed our cat friend who visited us periodically throughout our stay--what a sweetheart! Would absolutely recommend this listing to others!
77782	1796302	10.0	10.0	19352269	Susannah is was an amazing host! She is flexible and accommodating and I felt very at home in her space. 
77783	1796302	10.0	10.0	19463461	We really enjoyed our Seattle experience. Susanna and Patrick are wonderful, informative hosts. We enjoyed their neighborhood as much (or more) than downtown. Thanks y'all!
77784	1796302	10.0	10.0	19562164	"Susanna and Patrick were so awesome and hospitable! Susanna even bought gluten free bread for my celiac needs :) And their pets were so sweet too. The room is downstairs with its own private bathroom (bonus!) and the hosts' provided shampoo/conditioner and other bathroom amenities, which was super thoughtful.

Great location - we enjoyed the Fremont area the most in Seattle. There's a fun Sunday market and vintage mall nearby, plust a ton of restaurants and a tasty little gluten free, vegan bakery! 

Would definitely go back!"
77785	1796302	10.0	10.0	19796396	Had an amazing stay. The roof was a very nice treat and Susanna did a wonderful job making us feel welcomed. This was my first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have gone better. Would highly recommend this place especially since it's in the Fremont district which is a great neighborhood for eating,  drinking,  and vintage shopping. The thing i loved the most was that she had a guide for must dos while in Seattle which helped us determine what we should really see.  Thanks again!
77786	1796302	10.0	10.0	20229922	I spent 9 days at Susanna and Patrick's, and had a great stay. Susanna, Patrick, and their furry friends are lovely, easy going, accommodating, and I truly felt at home. The room and bathroom were comfortable and clean, there were plenty of towels, a hairdryer, shampoo etc. I was welcome to use the bread, bread spreads, spices, tea/coffee and the like. The house is quiet, and very close to a local shop as well as the heart of Freemont, which is a funky/artsy, vibrant area. This was the seventh time I used AirBnB in my travels, and although all the experiences have been very positive, Susanna and Patrick really went an extra mile as hosts - HIGHLY recommended!

77791	1796302	10.0	10.0	21515336	We had a wonderful experience here. Susanna and Patrick were terrific hosts who made us feel very welcome. They even left me some chocolates and a birthday card on my birthday. The apartment is conveniently located near public transportation and is also in walking distance from a couple of great neighborhoods (and Gas Works park). All-in-all a wonderful place to stay! 
77792	1796302	10.0	10.0	21656681	"Susanna was a fantastic host! From the moment I booked with her, she has been super helpful with suggestions, directions and so much more. Fremont is a wonderful little neighborhood with plenty of gems to explore. Go see the troll, trust me.

The bed is soft and warm. The view from the roof deck is breathtaking. The shower is hot. In short, the place is a gem.

My only gripe is that I couldn't stay longer!"
77793	1796302	10.0	10.0	21792822	Wir hatten eine wundervolle Zeit bei Susanna und Patrick mitten im künstlerischen Fremont und trotzdem unglaublich ruhig gelegen. Unser Zimmer war traumhaft, gemütlich und mit einem super bequemen Bett und eigenem Bad ausgestattet. Das Haus ist mit so vielen wunderschönen kleinen Details ausgestattet, dass man sich von der ersten Sekunde an zu Hause fühlt. Bessere Gastgeber als Susanna und Patrick kann man sich nicht wünschen. Beide haben uns während unseres Aufenthaltes weit mehr mit Tipps geholfen, als man das normalerweise erwarten kann. Die Lage des Hauses ist perfekt, mit Auto und Bus leicht erreichbar und trotzdem super ruhig und sicher. Wir hoffen sehr, noch einmal das Vergnügen zu bekommen, bei den beiden übernachten zu dürfen. Besser geht's nicht!!! Und Susanna spricht so perfekt Deutsch, dass wir fast vergessen haben in den USA zu sein!!!! Schade, dass unser Aufenthalt nur so kurz war.
77794	1796302	10.0	10.0	21949382	Susanna and Patrick were very welcoming.  Though we arrived closer to 11pm than 10pm (as scheduled), Patrick was there to greet our cab at the corner and direct us to the house, and Susanna gave us a tour of the kitchen and the downstairs where we stayed -- and made sure we were settled in before telling us goodnight.  The accommodations were exactly as described, and we felt well situated.  If you want to stay in or visit the Fremont area of Seattle, you couldn't find a more convenient location than this -- just a block off Fremont Ave and close to many restaurants and shops.
77795	1796302	10.0	10.0	22296153	"Our stay with Susanna and Patrick was delightful- like staying with my own adult children, only without the issues! We felt right at home and very comfortable. Came in early one evening, hosts were out, so we made a martini, turned on the gas fireplace and curled up on the couch with a good book and a couple of cats.
 
Our room and bath were private, quiet and everything we needed was provided, including lots of Seattle visitor information.  The location of the house is terrific.  Nice neighborhood with lots of neat shops and good restaurants close by. Street parking was always available and easy access to downtown and highways  made getting around simple. 
  We look forward to staying here again in the future when we come out to visit our family.  Felt just like home!"
77796	1796302	10.0	10.0	22569676	We had a wonderful time staying in Fremont at Susanna and Patrick's! Susanna was super hospitable and helped us with directions and looking up hours of operation for sites we wished to visit.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and we slept like babies. We liked having the kitties around for cuddles and appreciated the organic coffee, coffee cream, bread and bread spreads for breakfast.  Susanna even left a beautiful birthday card for my girlfriend which was much appreciated.  She also gave us an ice pack so we could take perishables home to Canada.  Overall it was a lovely experience and I would totally recommend this space. Thanks Susanna and Patrick! 
77797	1796302	10.0	10.0	22756799	Our stay at Susanna's was great. She accommodated us last minute even when she had a lot going on. Her pets are very friendly (especially if you enjoy cat cuddles!) the bed was extremely comfy, the neighborhood is great, and she even left us chocolates on our pillows. She has an amazing view from the balcony as well :) highly recommended! 
77798	1796302	10.0	10.0	22809368	"Fabulous location, pleasant hosts. Almost as described. At the risk of differing from other reviews, we felt a bit misled by the prospect of having the “bottom floor of our home to yourselves,” combined with the sense of spaciousness given by the photographs (of the “shared” area). After all the hunting we did on the airbnb site, the description/photos did not prepare us for having to squeeze into a such a small space. This may be a flaw in airbnb expectation-management advice to hosts.

The bottom floor actually available to us was, simply, a small (cramped) bedroom— bruised shins from a jutting bed frame, and no place to turn around or set anything—and, certainly, a nicely-appointed bathroom. Clean and comfortable, but the only place to relax was on the bed, making a hotel option much more preferable. Susanna was quite preoccupied with work at the time of our arrival, so actually using the “shared” space on the main floor was not an option (which serves as Susanna’s workspace as well). We felt quickly relegated to the bedroom downstairs. Disappointing, given our hope to relax, stretch our legs, and get some reading in before a busy evening in Seattle.

Last thought: don’t plan on sleeping in—the early morning clatter (7 a.m. both mornings) of the (admittedly sweet) dog on the hardwood floor, directly above our bedroom, was not ideal. 

We realize that a critical review might make us seem difficult (risky on airbnb profiles), but in our defence, we are pretty easy-going, well-travelled, love Seattle! and have hosted many guests in our own home over the years."
77799	1796302	10.0	10.0	22831389	Delightful! What a wonderful couple, so welcoming and hospitable. The home is lovely with everything you need, within walking distance of the coolest part of Seattle. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Thank you for all of the sweet touches (especially the birthday card!) and great recommendations. Can't wait to stay with you again soon.
77800	1796302	10.0	10.0	23126898	Susanna and Patrick were very kind and responsive to any questions we had. Their home was in a very convenient location and well stocked with any amenities we may need. Would recommend for anyone wanting to stay in Fremont! 
77801	1796302	10.0	10.0	23217232	Susana was out of town when we stayed in her space, but she coordinated everything, and everything was smooth! The space is cute, comfortable and clean, which are definitely the airbnb 3c's as far as I'm concerned! We loved staying here, and would definitely recommend it! 
77802	1796302	10.0	10.0	23362915	"The location was excellent. Susana was most thoughtful in every aspect including providing slippers, robes, travel necessities like a shower cap, etc.  We felt welcomed and cared for.  I would recommend her beautiful house to anyone wishing to visit Seattle. She left provisions for a continental breakfast and it was not only convenient but essential to get our day started. 
Thanks Susana for making our stay so great!"
77803	1796302	10.0	10.0	23680288	"Susanna and Patrick have a beautiful home in a very convenient spot in Fremont. Communication was great and Susanna was always easy to reach when I needed to ask a question. Right from when we reached the front door, we were warmly greeted, given a brief tour and thorough walkthrough of the amenities. We were shown to our room on the lower floor of their home along with a private bathroom. 

Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and well kept, with clean linens. A couple of nice touches in the bedroom, were the chocolate on the pillow and pitcher of water on the nightstand. She also provided a handy guide to Seattle highlights (which helped us dicover the excellent Espresso Vivace) It was very nice to find a relatively firm bed here, as other airbnb rooms that I've stayed in have had relatively soft beds. They also made coffee and breakfast available to us in the kitchen. 

Street parking was surprisingly easy to find nearby and there was easy access to highway 99 nearby, making downtown Seattle a mere 10 minute drive away. Much of of the Fremont district (great food, drinks, markets) was also easily walkable or a short drive away. The street is quiet, so there wasn't any audible noise from cars in the bedroom, yet the house is situated with convenient access to the highway. 

Susanna also went out of her way to make it a point that we got a chance to see the beautiful view of Mount Rainier and the cascades from their rooftop deck. It definitely was a great view from up there. and you could even see most of downtown Seattle and the Space Needle. 

Finally, their two cats were friendly (I forgot their names), but the male grey and white one was super friendly and really loved attention, but the female brown and white cat was a bit shy and would mostly run away from us. 

I'd definitely look to Susanna and Patrick's place first, the next time I plan to visit (website hidden);dr: great location and views, welcoming hosts, clean and cozy home, easy parking, friendly cats"
77804	1796302	10.0	10.0	24066908	Awesome place in Fremont. It was my first time in Seattle, Susanna and Patrick were super nice and welcoming. They had great suggestions for my short stay there. Lots of great spots within walking distance. Was not disappointed in any food I had in the Fremont area.
77805	1796302	10.0	10.0	24661990	Susanna and Patrick were wonderful hosts. They made us feel at home and gave us the scoop on the local scene and surrounding neighborhoods. Having coffee and simple breakfast items for the mornings was a plus too. Rue and his feline friends made us feel right at home as well. If you are looking to stay in Fremont, this is a great place!
77806	1796302	10.0	10.0	25105407	"Susanna is sooooooooo nice. When we reached her house, she not only explain all the detail of the house, but also showed us the popular attractions around the Seattle. The day we arrive, the Mt Rainer is hardly see. Susanna is so nice, she text us when she saw the Mt Rainer is able to see through the clouds. If you are a dog and cat person, you will definitely love the house. They have a 14 year old dog ruu and a two cats. Ruu is so friendly and the boy cat is also as friendly as a dog too. 

If I have chance to go back to Seattle, their house is definitely i would choose again."
77807	1796302	10.0	10.0	25147656	We had an amazing stay at Susanna's. She was extremely accommodating, and the room was very comfortable. The house was clean, and the pets were friendly. The Fremont area is beautiful, and the house is only a short walk to some great shops and restaurants. We took her advice and visited the Fremont troll!  And we took one of her suggestions for breakfast... the Silence Heart Nest. It was delicious. Can't wait to visit Seattle again!! 
77808	1796302	10.0	10.0	25255413	"The room was very comfortable as it comes with a lot of privacy. Susanna does an amazing job preparing for my nephew and I, which makes us feel at home. Her bathroom is very clean and also provides extra necessities next to the washing bowl for the guests' use. She evens prepares tea bags, trail mix, water and even reusable bag for grocery shopping in the room for us, so thoughtful! Her house is amazing organized and clean with the company of 2 cats who act like dogs and an old dog which still has the energy to come up to you and say hello. Her house is very close to many attractions in Seattle such as the Troll under the bridge, downtown, and Space needle. It is also 2 blocks away to THE 2ND BEST Sandwich place that just reopened (So Good!! Tips: call and keep calling until they pick up to make a phone order and walk to pick up at the time they tell you to save the 30 minute waiting on the street). Also, totally worth checking out the coffee shop and the cookbook store within minutes away from Susanna's place.
Overall experience of the accommodation was very pleasant and comfortable, if I ever come back to Seattle I would definitely visit Susanna's warm & welcoming home."
77809	1796302	10.0	10.0	25299702	Susanna and her husband were very welcoming. They offered to help me with my bags and gave me a tour of their home. The offer you access to their kitchen, food, and tea. The room is clean, comfortable, and makes you feel at home. I enjoyed the privacy of the basement floor with my personal bathroom with a fantastic shower. If I had any questions or suggestions for a place to eat or to see, they were eager and accessible. The TV and WiFi were a nice addition. They have the channels listed near the bed like a hotel and readings to discover Seattle. I really felt like I was staying at a quaint bed & breakfast in a townhouse. Lastly, before I left for my flight, Susanna left a goodie bag with snacks for my travels which was a welcomed gift. Overall, Susanna and her husband are great hosts who enjoy having people stay with them. I wish I had more time to perhaps share a meal and talk. She is well traveled and  a sincerely engaging person. I would come back to stay in this room when I am in Seattle again. 
77810	1796302	10.0	10.0	25376086	Susanna is an outstanding host! Her home is absolutely lovely in the perfect location! Every detail was attended to and I could not have felt more welcome. Highly recommend!!
77811	1796302	10.0	10.0	25473998	Wir erreichten Susannas zu Hause abends. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen. Susannas Deutsch ist wirklich sehr gut und sie liebt es dies zu sprechen :) Wir fühlten uns schon beim Empfang sehr wohl. Das Zimmer ist wie auf dem Foto, sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Auf dem Nachttisch lag eine Liste, wo man die wichtigesten Details über Seattle erfahren konnte, zudem stand frisches Wasser parat. Auf dem Fensterbrett stand ein Korb mit diversen Karten von Seattle und Sehenswürdigkeiten. Wir hatten ein eigenes Badezimmer, dies war ebenfalls sehr sauber. Susanna zeigte uns ihr schönes Haus und die Dachterasse mit wunderschöner Aussicht. Es war wirklich sehr angenehm :) Danke vielmals für die liebevolle Gastfreundschaft von Euch beiden und vielleicht ein anderes Mal :)
77812	1796302	10.0	10.0	25603268	Perfect location with convenient public transport and great food right around the corner. Patrick was the perfect host. Greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel very welcome. The room was clean and cosy with really thoughtful welcoming touches... The cats and dog greeted us but did not intrude.

77815	1796302	10.0	10.0	25920605	Susanna and Patrick are great hosts. The room was very nice with lots of amenities, and in a great location in Seattle! New visitors will find lots of information about local activities, and walking distance to good food/bars.
77816	1796302	10.0	10.0	25943876	Staying at Susanna's place was my first experience with airbnb. She was a very gracious host and the room and house was exactly as described. Very positive experience. Susanna was warm and friendly and the space was clean and homey. Would definitely recommend.
77817	1796302	10.0	10.0	26202465	"My flight ended up arriving 3+ hours late and I didn't make it to their house until after 10:30. Susanna was quick to respond to my messages as I was letting her know that my flight kept getting pushed back later and later.

The bedroom and private bathroom are downstairs and are very comfortable and quiet. Their gray cat is probably the friendliest cat I've ever met and he hung out downstairs with me for a while after I arrived. They also have a very friendly dog who enjoys having the back of his neck scratched and stepping on your feet. Bonus points if you see the calico and get her to come up to you.

It was raining (it's Seattle, so yeah) the morning after I arrived and Susanna loaned me an umbrella so I could go out and explore Fremont for a little while before transferring to my hotel for the night.

This was only my second AirBNB stay, and it was excellent. Definitely recommend them and would certainly consider staying again.

Uber ride to my hotel a few blocks from the market was about $10 if you want to get a ride into town from their place."
77818	1796302	10.0	10.0	26236979	Had a very last minute request to stay with Susanna & Patrick.  They graciously accepted and allowed my girlfriend and I to stay the evening in their AMAZING house with their AMAZING pets.  Very cozy bed, got great sleep. Private bathroom was wonderful as well!  Only got to chit chat a little bit but both hosts were so easy to talk to and very interesting.  I would stay here again in a second!! FULLY RECOMMEND!! 
77819	1796302	10.0	10.0	26348541	Susanna was an amazing hostess - super friendly and helpful. We booked very last minute and she accepted our request within 5 minutes, and we also arrived much later than expected on a Sunday night and she stayed up and even chatted with us a bit once we got there. She helped us find a restaurant/bar that was open late and answered any questions that we had about the area. Speaking of the are - Fremont is awesome!! Super close to a bunch of cool breweries/bottle shops and great restaurants (Vegan and gluten-free options abound!) and only a 10 minute ride into the city (cab fare was super cheap also). All in all a great experience :)
77820	1796302	10.0	10.0	26464272	I felt very welcome at Susanna and Patrick's home from the moment I arrived - very warm and welcoming people.
77821	1796302	10.0	10.0	26642914	My boyfriend and I had a great Seattle trip, thanks in large part to Susanna and Patrick's hospitality!  They couldn't have been nicer.  They made check-in and check-out very easy, and in addition to all the amenities offered in their  home, they provided an extensive list of the many things to do around Seattle – many within walking distance of their home.  We didn't know much about Seattle prior to our visit, and we certainly lucked out with the location of this Fremont spot, and the abundant street parking made it easy to hop in our rental car and explore the rest of the city.  Their cats were very friendly, and wound up not being an issue for our allergies.  The room was clean and suited all of our needs...we would highly recommend this space and would be happy to stay here again if the opportunity presented itself!
77822	1796302	10.0	10.0	26841099	Susanna & Frank are very nice & considerate, they provided me with very detailed information regarding transportation, and recommendation on places to see, entertainments & restaurants etc, also snack & tea are provided, I even found chocolates under the pillow, Susanna also sent me Chinese New Year Wishes, they are so sweet : ) And their dog & cats are very friendly, one of their cat even slept with me at the night when I arrived : ) Moreover, I like the decorations in the house. During my stay, I made myself at home also enjoyed good privacy in their house. 
77823	1796302	10.0	10.0	27011228	Susanna and Patrick were excellent hosts, and their townhouse in Fremont was absolutely lovely to stay in. We were worried about disturbing them because our flight into Seattle didn't get us to their place until close to 2am for check-in but they were super accommodating and gracious about it! And the day after our late arrival Susanna made sure to personally check in with us to make sure we had everything we needed to be fully comfortable and that we didn't miss out on any info due to our late arrival time. Their 3 pets (1 dog, 2 cats) were so friendly and cuddly and brought extra joy into our stay. And the accommodations themselves were very spacious, our room and bed were super comfortable and we had our own bathroom with a spacious shower. Their townhouse location also made it super easy for us to get almost anywhere in Seattle, it was only a single bus ride to downtown and at worst a 10 minute Uber/Lyft ride to another neighborhood. Their immediate neighborhood was also great to explore: we ate at 2 restaurants within walking distance of the townhouse that we really enjoyed. Thank you Susanna and Patrick for a great stay!
77824	1796302	10.0	10.0	27151003	I love staying here! Susanna is a fantastic host, who considers every detail to make her guests  feel comfortable and welcome. The space is great! Super private and in a wonderful location. I highly recommend and would love to stay again!

Her home is charming, newer construction so quiet and comfortable, but traditional style with artistic touches throughout. Our room is comfy and the bed first rate. Did I mention the toast, coffee, jam?

Susanna provided a written listing of nearby restaurants and made recommendations we will be trying today; there are many within walking distance. Our plan is to your the Fremont neighborhood before moving on. Right now I'm writing this in their living room while the aging dog and two mellow cats snooze nearby.

So...barring allergies to lovely pets or challenges with stairs please make this your home away from home."

77829	1796302	10.0	10.0	27946742	Susanna and her husband Patrick were delightful to stay with. I really enjoyed the effort they put into making me feel welcome, including a fresh pitcher of water and a typed-up guide of their favorite things to do in Seattle. Their home is spacious but cozy, and the room had a comfortable bed and its own bathroom. The best part of staying here was definitely talking with the hosts, though - they are extremely friendly and we shared some great conversation over coffee that they made the morning that I left. I would highly recommend this listing, and would absolutely stay with them again in the future!

The room and bath are great, along with all the privileges of the house.  I highly recommend Susanna in every way possible! She and Patrick, and the pets,  have become my second family in Freemont! I wouldn't stay anywhere else!  Ellen Hayden
77831	1796302	10.0	10.0	29092903	Susanna and Patrick were wonderful hosts! They were extremely helpful in guiding us where to explore and what to do throughout Seattle. They made sure our stay was comfortable the entire time we were there. The room and bathroom were perfect and clean, exactly what you're looking for when traveling. Fremont is an awesome location, so close to the city by a quick bus trip and so many cool places in Fremont which is all by walking distance. Definitely recommend staying at Susanna and Patrick's whilst visiting Seattle! 
77832	1796302	10.0	10.0	29613241	"Susanna and Patrick were wonderful hosts in lovely Seattle!  My girlfriend and I had a private bedroom and bathroom in the lower level of Susanna's home, but were able to enjoy the kitchen, living room, and rooftop deck (with stunning views of Mt. Rainier) at our leisure.  Overall we found the accommodations more than met our expectations. 

Susanna provided us with much-needed information about Seattle and the surrounding neighborhoods.  Fremont is a lovely part of the city with a few fantastic restaurants and cafes within a block or two of Susanna's home and a whole lot more a short walk (0.5 miles) down the hill.  Having a rental car definitely helped get around the city, especially if you're looking to explore the downtown area and other parts that are a bit far from Fremont. (Hint: avoid lot parking - we found it relatively easy to find street parking and it was a lot cheaper).

And the pets! Susanna and Patrick have two cats and a dog, and they're all lovely animals.  Expect to become very close friends with their grey and white cat, who spent a good amount of time downstairs with us (he's one of the nicest cats you'll ever meet).

Overall we loved our stay in Seattle.  Three days simply wasn't enough time for us to see everything we wanted, but we did as much as would could and loved every minute. "

You barely notice their pets, but all of them are friendly. I'm allergic to cats but haven't had any problems.  the view from the deck is awesome. Enjoy it while eating your sandwich from Paseo's ;-)
It's one of a couple really good restaurants in this neighborhood.  There are two bus stops nearby. So even without a car you can get around pretty easy. Next time we come to Seattle we definitely want to stay there again."

77841	1796302	10.0	10.0	31880088	Our first time using Air bnb and I am so glad I had chosen this location with Susanna and Patrick (along with their adorable pets)! From the start, communication was smooth, quick, and easy via text messages. Upon arrival, Patrick greeted us and gave us a tour of their beautiful home. Everything inside and outside the home was exactly like the pictures shown on Susanna's profile. Susanna, Patrick, and their pets were friendly and made my boyfriend and I felt welcomed throughout our stay. Can't thank them enough for their hospitality! Wonderful host!!

The bad: the WiFi is a little slow.

I would certainly stay with Susanna again!"

77845	1796302	10.0	10.0	33267069	Our 1st Airbnb stay feeling a bit anxious about staying in the same space as the host.  Anxiety gone..  Our bedroom suite with bath on lower floor, and main floor shared with Susanna and Patrick who pretty much staying in their upper loft most of the time making it feel as if the entire house were to us Solely.  Susanna very attentive, and fast responses to all communications.  Our hosts really helped make our stay as private as possible.  Guests with pet allergies carefully inquire.  Cats don't like closed doors.  
77846	1796302	10.0	10.0	33768294	Staying with Susanna and Patrick was wonderful! Susanna is a fantastic host with a lot of knowledge about Seattle and the surrounding areas to help guide us on our trip. She is very prompt in answering any questions or addressing concerns and is more than gracious. It was clear from the beginning that our comfort and convenience was one of her main priorities. We didn't get to spend a lot of time with Patrick but the little time we did get to spend with him was delightful. They are very kind and their pets are so cuddly- I considered taking one of the cats home. ;) I would recommend them to everyone I know! 
77847	1796302	10.0	10.0	34024665	Our first experience with AirBnb was very pleasant, all thanks to Susanna and Patrick. Susanna was very easy to talk to and she made sure we were comfortable from the beginning. Unfortunately we didn't see/meet Patrick, but we did meet their kids (dog and cats). One of their cats was so friendly; he joined us in our room quite a few times. They have a lovely home. The location was very convenient to everything we wanted to see. I would definitely stay with them again and recommend them to a friend.
77848	1796302	10.0	10.0	34220081	"We had such a great time in Seattle thanks to Susanna and Patrick. 
It is obvious that Susanna has a lot of experience with guests, she takes care perfectly of travelers needs and provides everything you might need. Moreover there is a lot of useful information provided in the Welcome Guide that she hands to guests. 
Their lovely house is conveniently accessible by public transportation. We had the basement with a private washroom almost completely to ourselves. We could use their kitchen, the living room and the patio, which has a great view over Seattle, as well. I only wish we had spent more time there!"
77849	1796302	10.0	10.0	34524003	Susanna and Patrick were so nice! Had a wonderful time in Seattle and felt really welcome. The bed was one of the most comfortable I ever had, the public transportation is really close and there are a lot of nice restaurants nearby
77850	1796302	10.0	10.0	34763043	Susanna and Patrick made our first airbnb experience very lovely! The house is located in a serene neighborhood in Fremont, close to everything you'll ever need. There are wonderful restaurants, popular tourist sights, and you can get to downtown in less than 30 minutes by a short walk to a nearby bus stop. Susanna and Patrick are very welcoming and conversational. We're so appreciative that they shared their kitchen and nice food/coffee/beverages with us. Dining on their rooftop deck is one of the most unforgettable experiences in Seattle - we were so lucky that the Mount Ranier appeared in sight after a cloudy morning, and a lovely humming bird came to say hello in time before we finished our lunch! Oh, and we miss Royko the lovely cat sooooo much....he's the most friendly and adorable cat we've met 3
77851	1796302	10.0	10.0	34988200	"This was my first time staying at an airbnb and it was a GREAT experience. My boyfriend and I came out for a wedding and it was in a cute neighborhood in Fremont. We went to a near by coffee and wine bar, which was excellent. In addition, went to an excellent near by restaurant, RockCreek.

Susanna was extremely accommodating by letting me arrive early so I could get ready for the rehearsal dinner. The house was clean and comfortable. My favorite part about the place is the balcony upstairs that overlooks the city. Perfect place to go for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. I would recommend  yo stay here if they are visiting Seattle."
77852	1796302	10.0	10.0	35064660	"We had the most wonderful time staying at Susanna and Patrick's  place. The neighborhood was nice, parking was no problem and downtown Seattle ist just a short bus ride away.
Our room was clean and comfortable, as was our private bathroom.
Crispy bagels, amazing coffee (thank you Patrick!) and a nice chat were also most welcome for sure.
We have to come back for longer!"
77853	1796302	10.0	10.0	35766662	Susanna was amazing, she greeted us at the door even though we arrived late in the evening. The set up is amazing, didn't need a thing and the information she provides you with will get you to all the tourists spots with no problem. I would definitely recommend anyone to Susanna & Patrick, they were phenomenal in making you feel welcomed. 
77854	1796302	10.0	10.0	36090754	A wonderful stay!! Susanna was so warm and helpful, and has done so much to make her guests' stay comfortable, from the super-soft sheets to the little basket of toiletries in the bathroom to the books on Seattle and packet with suggestions for things to do and tips for getting around.  I would recommend this spot to anyone! 
77855	1796302	10.0	10.0	36518522	Susanna was welcoming, has the place well organized, and was flexible about our arrival and departure details.

Upper Fremont is a great little neighborhood, is easily walkable to lower Fremont, and buses downtown are frequent and two blocks away. 
77856	1796302	10.0	10.0	36802071	This was perfect! Susanna and Patrick are very nice and helpful! 
77857	1796302	10.0	10.0	36935412	Susanna was delightful and had thought through all the little details like toiletries and a fan for air flow. She was really welcoming as well and everything was so great, in spite of it being a last minute booking! Also love her pup and kitty. My friend got a good picture of me and the cat snuggling in the morning, in spite of only being there one night.
77858	1796302	10.0	10.0	37453230	Susanna and Patrick are wonderful hosts! Susanna greeted us warmly, gave us a thorough tour of our room, kitchen, and the roof deck, and also gave great suggestions for neighborhoods to see and things to do. Our room was clean and inviting, and they even included tea, chocolate, and a welcome guide on the nightstand. The neighborhood is quiet, pedestrian-friendly, and feels very safe, both during the day and at night. The view from the rooftop deck is spectacular. Best of all: their pets are so sweet, particularly their gray cat, who will give you all the cuddles. 
77859	1796302	10.0	10.0	37659104	Staying at Susanna's place was great. We loved the location- it is in a residential neighborhood so it was quiet, but right around the corner were a number of delicious places to eat and get coffee. It is also near a number of bus lines so it made it very easy to get to downtown and to Ballard. Susanna was a great host because she was able to balance being attentive to our needs while still giving us space and privacy. The room is on the smaller side, but the view from the deck and having our own floor with a very nice private bathroom made it worth it. We also loved the cat who wanted to hang out in our room whenever we were there! 
77860	1796302	10.0	10.0	38254512	"There is only one word to describe our stay with Susanna and Patrick:  splendid.  They were warm and welcoming hosts throughout our visit to Seattle, and very helpful in guiding us through the city and its many attractions.  We enjoyed getting to know them (and their pets!)  Our room was cozy, clean and comfortable.  We relished our mornings,  sitting on their deck and watching the city go by.  Additionally, we appreciated their Fremont neighborhood, and spent many happy hours exploring it.  In short, we had a wonderful time, and hope to return someday.
"
77861	1796302	10.0	10.0	38470061	Susanna was an amazing and attentive host! She was flexible with our late arrival time and checked in with us en route from the airport to make sure we didn't get lost. Her home is very bright, sunny and welcoming! She gave us a tour and showed us what was available in the kitchen for breakfast, which was laid out very well for guests. We had the lower floor to ourselves which included a bedroom and our own bathroom. Very nice and quiet neighborhood close to Greenlake. Will definitely consider staying with Susanna again next time we are visiting Seattle!

The home (located in one of the best neighborhoods of Seattle)  was quiet, comfortable, clean, and inviting. Everything I needed was within walking distance to the B&B.  My morning walk was around  beautiful Green lake and then off for coffee at a small, intimate coffee shop around the corner.  Finish off the morning with a breathtaking view of Mt. Ranier from the upper deck.

Overall, we had a pleasant stay and would recommend Susanna's to anyone visiting the area.  "
77865	1796302	10.0	10.0	40401113	All was good. Susana was very chill and friendly. Pets were nice. 
77866	1796302	10.0	10.0	40563354	We loved our stay in Seattle. Susanne and Patrick greeted us very warmly and gave us al the information we needed. They are very kind and friendly people: we really enjoyed our conversations with them. The lower floor was ours, so we had al the privacy we wanted, but we were also welcome to sit in the kitchen and the living room, or at the deck to look at that beautiful Mt Rainier and downtown Seattle. Their pets are really cute: the grey cat wants to cuddle all the time. Susanne has written a small Seattle document of a few pages with the correct busnumbers, some good restaurants in Fremont ... It was very helpful. A fantastic airbnb experience!

77871	1796302	10.0	10.0	44099510	We had a wonderful time in Fremont with Susanna and Patrick and their pets! I'm so glad I decided to stay in this area (not knowing Seattle and what's where), because it's such a funky and interesting place, with lots of public art, awesome restaurants, bakeries, cafes, bridges, parks, etc. Easy access to downtown Seattle by public transit and driving distance to museums, parks and local points too. Thank you for sharing your beautiful house with us!
77872	1796302	10.0	10.0	53564822	"This was truly one of  the best accomodations I ever had: It was all cosy and comfortable, extremly clean and tidy and it felt just like a real home away from home. We had the basement all for ourselves and were welcome to use both kitchen and livingroom. Susanna and Patrick are the nicest guys ever - having plenty of helpful recommendations for our stay (you can save space in your suitcase and leave the travel guide at home :-) Besides: There are lot's of travel books and magazines provided in the room.

Communication was fast and easy which was extremly helpful since we booked our stay only two days in advance. The area they are located in is great - there's a good choice of restaurants, bars and cafes just within short walking distance, the centre of Fremont itself is very nice and worth seeing and to the city centre (Pike Place Market, etc.) it's just a 20 Minuten busride. I highly recommend this place and I also recommend to immediately book it if it's free because their home is so popular that they are booked up most time of the year. And of five stars I definitely rate this wonderful place a six!"
77873	1796302	10.0	10.0	53847159	I am a returning guest to Susanna & Patrick's wonderful home.  As always, they were very welcoming and warm in the arrangements and welcoming me.  The accommodations are just like home - very comfortable, quiet and private.  They are great AirBnB hosts as they really practice the right balance between taking care about me and leaving me on my own when I want to be.  I will for sure stay there again (if they will have me)
77874	1796302	10.0	10.0	56208796	I have had the pleasure of staying with Susanna & Patrick on several occasions - they are warm and welcoming and the room and private bath are very comfortable.  Add to that a great neighborhood and proximity to bus lines downtown and it cannot be beat!

77877	6750264	10.0	10.0	47114812	This place would be perfect for all walks of life, it was especially nice traveling with our toddler as there were some toys and children's books for our daughter to enjoy during the stay.  A nice location, pleasant walks to the Zoo, and close to great neighborhoods like Fremont, Phinney Ridge and Ballard.  The space is clean, accurately described, and well equipped for a long or short stay.  Lovely views of the Olympic mountains to enjoy from kitchen and living area, and the master bed was quite comfortable.  We felt comfortable and at home.
77878	6750264	10.0	10.0	48845408	Great place to stay with an amazing view!! We had 4 guest and the 2 bedrooms worked out perfectly! Perfect place to go out on Ballard or Fremont... Or to stay in and make dinner! 
78084	6087451	10.0	10.0	31154433	Reid and Aaleen were great hosts! Upon arrival, they took the time to show me around the studio, answered any of my questions and made me feel welcome. The instructions on how to operate the TV were nice to have. I had arrived pretty late on my check-in day and so I really appreciated that they had some snacks waiting for me in the kitchen. There is a great selection of restaurants down the street, well within walking distance. The studio is located in the perfect area. If you find yourself wanting to explore beyond the Fremont area, downtown is a quick 10min Uber ride away. There is is a bus stop about 200 yards from the property as well if you prefer public trans. Could't have been happier with my stay and look forward to the next time I visit Reid and Aaleen. 
78085	6087451	10.0	10.0	31492596	This studio was the perfect size and in a great location. There is ample street parking (no small feat for a unit as centrally located as this one in Seattle) and the private entrance is ideal. Everything in the studio was clean and the appliances seemed new and well maintained. Aaleen was professional and courteous from the start and made the booking process quick and easy; she made sure we had her contact information and was available to us throughout the weekend. I would most definitely recommend this studio and look forward to booking with Aaleen and Reid again!
78086	6087451	10.0	10.0	32023485	Reid and Aalen's place was awesome. The house itself has a very comfy bed and beautiful bathroom.

78087	6087451	10.0	10.0	32583496	Aaleen and Reid made me feel super welcome right away. They were there to help you with anything you needed and the pictures don't do this place justice with their place just being newly renovated everything felt really new and it was very clean. It's also a super quick and convenient uber to most areas. For example, from their place to Pike's Place Market, it was only a $12 uber fare. I 100% recommend staying here, you won't be disappointed!
78088	6087451	10.0	10.0	33386610	"This place is so great! It was super homey, comfortable, clean, and a perfect location.  Our hosts maintain a beautiful space that we loved coming back to after a full day of touring, we felt so comfortable coming back ""home"" and relaxing."

78096	6087451	10.0	10.0	36902298	"Lovely large modern basement apartment. Very, very comfortable. Good location for Fremont, 10 minutes walk to several bars and restaurants. Downtown is only 15 mins bus ride and you can catch it almost on your doorstop.
Reid and Allen are a nice, helpful couple but we didn't see all that much of them as we only stayed 2 nights.
Highly recommended."
78097	6087451	10.0	10.0	37666993	The notes of welcome were much appreciated, as was the WiFi connection and the well stocked bathroom, the comfy pillows and bed, and the surprising bonus of a washer and dryer!  We didn't use the laundry facilities, but how great to have them in case we needed them.  Even in the unseasonably warm weather, the apartment was quite comfortable in the evenings, when opening the windows offered a lovely cross-breeze.  The remodeling is beautiful, and we were happy to note how our hosts are keeping as green as possible, down to the lovely raised bed garden.  We highly recommend this spot, as well as our hosts, who are as caring and considerate as one could ask.
78098	6087451	10.0	10.0	38503299	Really nice apartment with new fittings, close to restaurants and bars. Car parking is not an issue.

The ground floor rental unit is super clean, upscale, and very comfortable for a stay. We briefly met Aaleen and she was very kind to have as a host. Street parking is easy (albeit on a typical Seattle-style hill).  The bathroom was very nice and clean as was the kitchen. We loved our stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this property or host to others!  Thanks again.

It's a great place to stay -- I could live in the space. The basement is pretty quiet and the separate entrance is nice. Everything I needed during my trip was taken care of. Would highly recommend and I'll likely stay here again."
78102	6087451	10.0	10.0	41372131	"I can't say enough good things about Reid and Aaleen's Fremont studio. The apartment itself was clean, quiet and comfortable. A lot of thought was put into this apartment and it shows - It felt like home. The Fremont neighborhood is great, too. The apartment is close to the border of Fremont and Ballard, but Fremont coffee shops and restaurants are just a quick walk away, and it's a great way to experience a neighborhood first hand.  Ballard is a little bit of a hike if you're hoofing it, but busses, uber or rental cars are all easy options to reach other Seattle neighborhoods (we utilized all 3).

The attention to detail, great design and thoughtfulness that has gone into Reid and Aaleen's apartment is obvious. It raises the bar and we can't way to come back to Seattle soon and stay again. Thanks for the hospitality! "

We had a fantastic time in Seattle and highly recommend this terrific apartment!!

What I loved most about the unit was the private entrance and the very clean and modern feel to everything. We really enjoyed having a full kitchen which made it easy to take home and enjoy food bought at Pike Place Farmers Market, we even made a fruit smoothie during our stay. Another plus was having the Xbox with a good selection of games (my boyfriend definitely loved playing FIFA after a long day.) Another plus was having the option of doing laundry during our stay which we definitely took advantage of and came home from our trip with all clean clothes. The bathroom honestly felt like a spa in the way that it was decorated and has optional heater if you happen to be visiting during colder months (we didn't really use this as we stayed in August but tested it and it got the bathroom pretty warm!) In terms of size it was more than enough room for the 3 of us staying as their couch can double as a comfortable bed and the room was equipped with extra blankets however in case you made the same silly assumption I did, the bed pictures in the photos is not in a separate room in the unit behind a door- it's more of an open-concept in that sense and will be to your immediate right when you walk in (once again most of you may have realized that, but I didn't.) The privacy was amazing and we almost forgot we were staying in a home and not a hotel. The Fremont neighborhood was also very nice, walking around enjoying the Seattle air felt very safe and was beautiful. We used ""Uber"" throughout our trip rather than taxis and this place was always fairly close to everywhere we needed to go which was a plus! Last thing I'd like to mention is the amazing price, when looking up other hotels in the area for the month of August most we were over $300+ a night, some for only 2-star places. This unit was half the price and twice the stars so definitely worth the stay!"
78105	6087451	10.0	10.0	44331669	Everything was great. The place was super stylish and cute. Just what we needed for our short vacation. In a great neighborhood. Very close to shops, restaurants and bars. I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Seattle! 
78106	6087451	10.0	10.0	44553623	Loved the area! Aaleen & Reid answered all of our questions and the downstairs apartment was like having our own home and quiet space. Beautifully decorated and comfortable. Thanks again!!
78107	6087451	10.0	10.0	45274938	"Had an amazing stay at this gorgeous apartment ! The full kitchen, large TV, and remodeled bathrooms were huge bonuses that you could not get at your typical hotel or even other Airbnb location. It was in a great location, close to great restaurants and shops and the host provided local spots to check out. They included local transit maps and loads of materials to check out all of Seattle. Place was well kept and looked brand new as we walked in. 

The most impressive part was that there was a power outage due to crazy wind. Not only did the hosts have a generator and provided an extension cord to make sure that we had light and a place to charge our phones, but they also gave us a heads up when the power was back on and offered to have us hang out with them in their apartment until it was fixed. 

Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and I would suggest everyone check it out!"
78108	6087451	10.0	10.0	45514204	Thanks for Netflix! Clean & stylish! Private & well equipped kitchen & prefect location for exploring neighborhoods & car parking was easy. Definitely recommend for comfortable stay. Quick reply by host!
78109	6087451	10.0	10.0	45959441	"Great place in a great location. Perfect for our needs. 

Communication was excellent.  We were given very clear instructions before our arrival, and all our messages were replied to promptly.

Highly recommended."
78110	6087451	10.0	10.0	46356170	I had such a great experience staying here! Reid and Aaleen were welcoming and accommodating, despite my last-minute request. The space is  comfortable and clean, with every amenity you could dream of! I appreciated being able to do laundry during my stay, the French Press and coffee, and the Netflix on the TV! Thanks for making my days in-between apartments less like a hassle, and more like a vacation.
78111	6087451	10.0	10.0	47047111	This was our first airbnb experience. So, one half of the couple was a little hesitant going into it. I'm happy to report he has been converted. Great place, great hosts. We got in late and left early. Enjoyed the stay! Will do it again next summer when we are in town again.
78112	6087451	10.0	10.0	47333730	The place was great. Great neighborhood. Great value. The host were great to accept me on such short notice.
78113	6087451	10.0	10.0	47507566	It's my first time using AirBnb and the experience was great! Reid and Aaleen were very prompt in answering any questions that I had.  Their place was as described in the description.  As host, they were very welcoming.
78114	6087451	10.0	10.0	47895603	The downstairs apt was just as described. It was very nice and new and we loved staying there. It was a quick walk to Freemont and walking across the bridge at night was awesome. Our hosts were great and we would recommend this place to anyone. 
78115	6087451	10.0	10.0	48692904	Reid and Aaleen were such amazing hosts. They are very knowledgeable about what's around them and great at giving recommendations on where to go and what to see. Their basement apartment is in a great location. We used uber most of the time we were there and they cost no more than $15 at a time. The apartment is stocked with maps, magazines, and menus, so getting an idea of where you wanted to go was super easy. There is a bus stop super close by that will take you straight to pike place market, or around the area where all the tourist-y attractions are. Overall great experience.  Perfect description of what you are getting when you get stay with them. Definitely a place where you can't wait to stay again!
78116	6087451	10.0	10.0	49021435	"The Fremont Studio was a perfect place to stay for the day and a half we were there. Fremont is a nice neighborhood with food and drinks within walking distance. It was a quick Uber ride away from Ballard which is also a nice area for food and about 10 min from downtown to all the tourist stuff.

We would definitely stay here again.

"
78117	6087451	10.0	10.0	49797497	Reid & Aaleen’s place was super clean & comfortable — and conveniently located too, walkable to fun places like Frelard Pizza and Fremont Sunday Market. Would definitely book again. Thanks!
78118	6087451	10.0	10.0	50555326	"The home was absolutely lovely, definitely looks like the pictures.  I didn't get a chance to really explore the neighborhood but driving through it, it looked so cute and somewhere where I could spend a lot of time.  

My one disappointment was that the hosts were apparently out of town the whole time and didn't tell me.  I texted them when I was on my way to the apartment and when I got there, but I didn't hear from them until the day I left that they were out of town and didn't have reception.  What if something had gone wrong?  I would have appreciated a heads up and maybe an alternate person to contact if I had needed something.  "
78119	6087451	10.0	10.0	50897708	Reid and Aaleen were wonderful hosts. They were very organized and responsive with instructions and details to help make our stay seamless and easy. The apartment was perfect. Clean and spacious with every amenity you could need or want. Location is very convenient and street parking is ample. I would highly recommend this studio apartment to anyone looking for a simply wonderful place to stay in Seattle.
78120	6087451	10.0	10.0	51790492	Reid and Aaleen's apartment was perfect for me. Brilliant location and neighborhood. Everything was made convenient and smooth by them.
78121	6087451	10.0	10.0	52334233	Very nice and clean listing in a quite neighborhood.  Every room, including the bathroom and kitchen, were very clean and inviting.  No problem finding parking outside.  Appreciated the magazines and streaming tv that made downtime seem short.  Would not hesitate to stay again when in town.  
78122	6087451	10.0	10.0	52737055	The place was clean and accurately described. We did not use it but the kitchen was well stocked. It was very spacious for a studio apartment.  We were aware of pets on the property but surprisingly only heard the dog bark once. I recommend this property.
78123	6087451	10.0	10.0	53088410	Our stay at the Fremont House was fantastic! The location was perfect and we enjoyed the easy access to Fremont and Ballard. Tons of restaurants, coffee shops, and breweries in waking distance. The apartment was very clean and cozy, plus there were tons of amenities. The kitchen is super gorgeous and includes a dishwasher (which is often hard to come by in Seattle!) and there was a nice selection of coffee, apple cider, and hot chocolate available. The entertainment set up was awesome and included Netflix, games, and built in speakers that really set the mood and made watching a movie or listening to music even better. We could tell that Reid and Aaleen put a lot of thought into making this apartment as comfortable as possible. The best home away from home! Reid and Aaleen are fantastic hosts and made us feel very welcome! Hands down the best Airbnb experience that we have had. Thank you!
78124	6087451	10.0	10.0	54447217	Convenient location, lovely apartment.  Great place to hunker down during a cold, rainy week in Seattle. 
78125	6087451	10.0	10.0	54787875	"The apartment was very modern and well appointed. The Xbox and Netflix (including surround sound!) were all very nice touches, and were well utilized. 

The only issue we ran into was that there seemed to be some pet dander from (I assume?) their dog that lived upstairs, which caused me to have an allergic reaction and one of my eyes to almost swell shut. Thankfully there is a Shell gas station across the street, so I was able to buy some eyedrops and allergy meds and get back to relaxing. 

Apart from this, we had a great weekend. The hosts were even so kind as to point out an item we threw out (intentionally), in case we unintentionally threw it out. "
78126	6087451	10.0	10.0	55388642	Though we have stayed at B & Bs domestically and internationally, this was our first airbnb experience.   This is a very lovely apartment in the lower level of their home.  Private key pad entry and street parking make it very accessible.   Fremont is also a great location to explore Seattle.  We plan to stay here again when we return to Seattle.
78127	6087451	10.0	10.0	56320594	Another great stay in Reid & Aaleen's terrific apartment. December in Seattle was getting a little windy and wet but it was cosy and incredibly convenient for Fremont & Ballard – my favourite bits of Seattle
78128	6087451	10.0	10.0	56580595	Beautiful place. Thanks for putting us up at  such short notice.
