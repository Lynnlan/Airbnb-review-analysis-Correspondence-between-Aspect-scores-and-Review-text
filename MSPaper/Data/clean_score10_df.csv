3304	9015088	10.0	10.0	55140783	Lovely home, very comfortable and attractive, with great hospitality. Muna left us some nice treats and kept in contact to see if there was anything we needed to make our stay better
3305	9015088	10.0	10.0	56000906	I absolutely LOVED the place it was perfect for a girls getaway. It was my first time at a B&B so it was different but I was definitely not disappointed. The beds were so comfortable and soft and fluffy. The decor was very nice and homey. Way better than the hotel. We got parking really close to the place we were staying so that was a plus. Communication was great and she was there when we needed anything answer all in all a 10 out of 10!
3306	9015088	10.0	10.0	56411199	Muna is an amazing host! She is very nice and prepared everything for us. We will come back if we visit Seattle again.
3307	9015088	10.0	10.0	57183789	A couple of buddies and I stayed here for a trip to go to a Seahawks game and see some old college friends. Muna was absolutely incredible going through the booking process and during our stay. She was incredibly flexible and made sure we had everything we needed. The champagne and chocolates were also a nice touch! The condo itself is very inviting and spacious as we fit three comfortably and it is in the heart of Ballard. Would love to stay here in the future! Thanks so much for a wonderful time!
3308	9015088	10.0	10.0	58392485	Muna was a perfect hostess for her gorgeous condo. She prepared many personal touches to the condo that made my visiting brother and his daughters feel very welcome, and certainly made all the difference for them to stay at an Airbnb versus a hotel.  The condo has a great view of the surrounding community, with a little patio as well.  The condo was very clean and well organized and we would definitely recommend her place to others.
3309	3979496	10.0	10.0	18700689	Relaxing stay! I was in a tough transitory state, and Jayne put me up last minute, gave me space to sleep, made me tea, and was kind enough to inquire after me well-being. She's a solid lady! The room is well-kept with a big tv and all kinds of entertainment. Futon was actually comfortable. Would stay here again. 
3310	3979496	10.0	10.0	18928407	Stayed for three nights at Jayne's place. Jayne is a great host and knows all the good places in the city. Ballard is a lovely neighborhood with great restaurants in walking distance. I definitively recommend to stay here. By bus you easily get to downtown in less than 30min. Make sure to ask Jayne about her personal favourite sights and restaurants!
3311	3979496	10.0	10.0	19970524	"This awesome spot in Ballard was our first stop for a week in Seattle. The location and host can't be beat!
Jayne was so accommodating and friendly, she provided incredible directions to her home from the airport (we didn't have a car), as well as tips for getting around the neighborhood. She gave us some of the best tips for places to eat--we love food and thanks to Jayne we ate some of our favorite meals in Seattle in her neighborhood.
We got around just fine without a car! It's about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown Ballard, unending bars and caf√©s and restaurants. It's the place to be in Seattle! Quick 10 minute bus ride to Fremont, etc... Perfect location on a gorgeous neighborhood street!
The room was comfortable and secluded with a view of the garden. All things considered, this room is a bargain for the experience. A great place to come back to and unwind after a day of exploring. 
Jayne was our first host of the trip and she set a great tone! Can't wait to see her and her adorable doggy when we visit Seattle again! Thanks for the great times!"
3312	3979496	10.0	10.0	20402601	Jayne is a wonderful, warm and courteous host. She has a bevy of knowledge about good bars and restaurants in the area and accommodated all of our needs. She's very friendly and my boyfriend and i had fun chatting with her, but she knew to respect our space and privacy when we were tired and ready to relax. The room was very clean and private with a comfortable bed, and came equipped with an enormous apple TV. Also she has an adorable dog! We were only there for one night but i wish we could have stayed longer. Would definitely recommend a stay at Jayne's!
3313	3979496	10.0	10.0	20456277	"Jayne was a lovely and accommodating host for my quick overnight visit in Seattle. I was able to leave my bags with her before check-in and after check-out while I explored the city. The D-Line to downtown is just around the corner and I was able to spend the weekend in town without needing a car, walking to breakfast and dinner spots and catching the bus into town. Spent some time in the evening chatting with Jayne and her neighbor - really comfortable and easy conversation.

The room was as listed and provided all the amenities I needed. I'd definitely stay with Jayne again and highly recommend her home for a visit when you're in town."
3314	3979496	10.0	10.0	21571608	Holy moly! This place was great! Sort of a man cave with a bed. Jayne and Tyke were great hosts. They allowed me space and privacy, but also were happy to let me join in for some Downtown Abbey. The location is great as it is only a 10 minute walk to Market st with all the great restaurants and shopping Ballard has to offer. 
3315	3979496	10.0	10.0	21932547	Great accommodations. Very cool mancave basement room especially with the huge TV. Lots of privacy if you need it, but Jayne was more than friendly and willing open to hanging out if that's what you're in to. 
3316	3979496	10.0	10.0	22639138	Jayne and Tyke were awesome people! Extremely considerate and accommodating. The room was perfectly comfy for a weekend getaway and a great location for roaming Ballard. Buddy their dog was a great added bonus. Our favorite part of our stay was sharing some wine and chatting with the two of them. Very highly recommended!!
3317	3979496	10.0	10.0	23588976	"The location was great; the house was on a quiet street, and within walking distance of the places I was visiting in Ballard.

Jayne, Tyke, and Buddy were extremely welcoming hosts.  I'm very thankful to have met them and wish them well."
3318	3979496	10.0	10.0	23619496	"Jayne was a great host, and the room was exactly as described. I was only in town for a brief while and didn't spend much time there (at all really!) but the little touches like the complimentary toiletries, fresh towels,  huge TV in bedroom and AppleTV make this Airbnb option worthwhile for a single or couple. The room is really massive.  Her and her partner were really warm and friendly and gave great recommendations for many bars and restaurants around Ballard - of which there are many options, so it's helpful to have a local guide you through. They even knew where the really, really late night options for food were. 
Also, Buddy the dog is adorable.   "
3319	3979496	10.0	10.0	27634866	Perfect - minutes walk to central Ballard, clean and comfortable.  Jayne ensured solid communication and the place was open and exactly what I needed for a visit!!!
3320	3979496	10.0	10.0	27912263	Awesome place, awesome hosts. I was there for just a night, but Jayne and her husband helped us find our way around Seattle and made us feel very welcome in their home. The room is really nice, huge TV with all the fixins. Thanks guys!
3321	3979496	10.0	10.0	28757255	What a wonderful mini vacation!  We had such a nice stay at Jayne's place.  It was easy to communicate with her leading up to check in, and they made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  The room was quiet and clean-just what we needed after a day on the town!  They gave us great recommendations of places to eat and were great hosts.  Plus, their house is in a quiet spot but an easy walk to downtown Ballard.
3322	3979496	10.0	10.0	30654949	Jayne and her husband were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us helpful directions and suggestions for local eats and attractions. The room they have on the lower floor was nice, comfortable and warm with a giant TV! Thanks, Jayne!
3323	3979496	10.0	10.0	31852989	Jayne and her husband are great hosts and I really enjoyed staying at  their place! We even had some time to chat and they're friendly and welcoming people. Recommended.
3324	3979496	10.0	10.0	35428000	I felt welcomed right away. The room was very comfortable and I had a  very nice night's sleep. Had all the amenities I was looking for. I will definitely be checking back on future trips. Thank you 
3325	3979496	10.0	10.0	36106692	"The hosts were very generous with their time.  They enjoyed talking with us as we did with them.  

The basement room was comfortable. Because the bathroom was  upstairs it is inconvenient for  older people or those of any age who need to use the bathroom at night.

The neighborhood was very nice."
3326	3979496	10.0	10.0	36558047	We had a great time as Jayne's guests!  Our room was not only large, clean and bright, but also remained cool during a surprisingly warm summer weekend.  The futon was comfortable and the room nicely appointed.  The neighborhood is wonderful, full of shops and restaurants and terrific coffee shops, and only a short walk away you can hop a bus into downtown Seattle.  We had no transportation trouble even though we did not rent a car during our stay.  We were made to feel entirely welcome, both in our private space and in sharing their kitchen and bathroom.  We greatly appreciated our visit with Jayne, her husband Tadgh, and their friendly dog Buddy.
3327	3979496	10.0	10.0	37085384	We had a great time in Seattle with Jayne and Tidgh. They were lovely, laid back, and welcoming hosts, and we really enjoyed chatting with them in the garden. The basement room was just fine for us. It looks as described in the photos, spacious with a futon. The location is a two block walk from the bus and walkable to the shops and bars in Ballard.
3328	3979496	10.0	10.0	37774141	I had rented the basement room in Jayne's house for 1 night. My experience was short but great. Jayne and her husband are warm and friendly. The futon mattress in the room is great (especially if you prefer a hard mattress) and comes with clean sheets. the shared bathroom shower is great. 
3329	3979496	10.0	10.0	38645711	I had a wonderful time staying with Jayne.  Her and Tadgh were warm and inviting, as was Buddy.  She even laid out a small toiletry spread for me, in case, I had forgotten anything from home.  She was available to answer any questions and gave recommendations for places to visit, even informing me about places to visit in Vancouver, the next stop on my trip.  The room was clean and well appointed, and the bed was comfortable.  You really could not ask for anything more during a stay.  I would recommend this room to a friend without question.
3330	3979496	10.0	10.0	39450729	Jayne and her husband were delightful. The room and accommodations were what we expected. I felt safe and comfortable in the room, house and neighborhood. I would stay here again.
3331	3979496	10.0	10.0	39651127	These two were really great! They made sure we were comfortable, offered oodles of suggestions, engaged us in good chats, and always had coffee available in the morning. Definitely a super host!
3332	3979496	10.0	10.0	39820480	"Jayne's home was everything the listing made me hope it would be. She is an extremely welcoming, courteous and helpful host that I'd recommend to anyone passing through the area. Very close to Woodland Park Zoo, which is where we went, as well as a very short drive to downtown. 
Can't thank you enough, Jayne!"
3333	3979496	10.0	10.0	40834833	Jayne is extremely flexible and it helped a lot as our schedule was little  tricky. Her house is in a really nice neighbourhood so getting in and around is very easy. I would highly recommend Jayne's house. 
3334	3979496	10.0	10.0	42630782	"
We had a very restful night.  The room was clean and neat and the bed was very comfortable.  Jayne and her husband were gone and we were almost ready to retire so we did not visit much but Jayne was gracious in our desire for a fan.  Coffee was really nice the next morning.  "
3335	3979496	10.0	10.0	42738240	Jayne's a very accommodating host. She left clear instructions on how to access the house if she was out (or asleep). Our estimated arrival time changed several times (delayed flight) and Jayne was very flexible. The room/house/bathroom were all very cozy and clean. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
3336	3979496	10.0	10.0	43762538	We had a wonderful time staying with Jayne. Her and Tadgh were warm and inviting, as was Buddy.  They were available to answer any questions and gave good recommendations for places to visit.
3337	3979496	10.0	10.0	45990932	Jayne was indeed a superhost. She made me and my boyfriend feel more than welcome to enjoy our stay in her splendidly kept Seattle basement room. I rarely feel that I have the comforts of home truley on vacation, but Jayne and her friendly husband made sure we felt both accomdated and comfortable. Would rate (phone number hidden) stars if possible!
3338	3979496	10.0	10.0	49712444	Our room is large and comfortable, set in a well-lighted basement, with a window and door to the back garden.  The house Is appointed with tasteful English/Irish artifacts.  Jayne is very friendly and made us feel at home.   The bathroom is shared, but it is convenient, and has everything we possibly need.  The nice, thick and soft towels are much appreciated.   We highly recommend it.
3339	3979496	10.0	10.0	53300403	The one-night stay at Jayne's place was great. She is super friendly and the place is exactly as described.
3517	3076065	10.0	10.0	24728738	Had a wonderful time staying at Michaels place in a neighborhood that proved to be easily walkable and extremely enjoyable. Mike's apartment was as listed, great space for family and friends to gather for dinner and enjoy the holidays together. Easily slept 5, was very close to tons of great night life in ballard and had great transit to downtown seattle via uber and the nearby bus lines. Buying groceries from the markets was great for when we felt like staying in and watching football. A great space and a great neighborhood. Mike was easy to work with and readily acceptable. 
3518	3076065	10.0	10.0	27355606	We had a fabulous time staying at Mike's house in Seattle! The house is very conveniently located in Ballard, and is a short walk to many great restaurants and bars. It is also very close to the supermarket. When we arrived, Mike gave us great suggestions about what to do and see during our time in Seattle. Overall, the house was very clean, and was great for two couples. The kitchen was well equipped, and the living room was a comfortable place for us to hang out when we wanted to relax. The fireplace made the house especially cozy. Mike was flexible with our arrival and departure times, and he was easy to get in touch with. We would definitely stay there again!
3519	3076065	10.0	10.0	28084984	The place was great and easy hassle free checking in. They had great amenities and the house was in a great location.
3520	3076065	10.0	10.0	29277353	"Nice quiet neighborhood.  Mike communicates well in getting check-in instructions, and house instructions.  The Foodie paradise is as described--clean and fresh.   

Parking can be a challenge in this neighborhood.  Plan for the possibility of needing to park more than a block away. "
3521	3076065	10.0	10.0	29702441	The house was great.  Great location.  The facilities the kitchen are all top class.  We had a great trip.
3522	3076065	10.0	10.0	33093381	"Mike was easy to communicate with and his home is lovely and very comfortable. We slept well and enjoyed the coffee he left for us. We enjoyed the fire pit and he was more than gracious with me and my mistake with it. It is not an edge burning one like I thought it was. Although parking is ""ample"" it is not always available close by. The home is close to shops and dining. We did more than our fare share of walking - loved Pike Place and enjoyed our stop at Number 6 Cider on our way back! I need to note that for those guests who are not used to being near a large city, there is a small group of homeless people that congregate a couple of blocks away. They were very quiet and neat and did not cause us concern. My son and I were exploring cities for him post-graduation. Seattle came out on top, so I may be staying here again when my husband and I come out to visit him. "
3523	3076065	10.0	10.0	35200104	This was a perfect place for my family to stay during my wedding in Seattle. Everything was as described, and conveniently located. Would definitely stay here again. 
3524	3076065	10.0	10.0	39014144	Great home - beautiful and just as pictures show, in a nice neighborhood in NW Seattle with lots to do nearby. Michael made communicating before and after the trip simple and easy. Would highly recommend! 
3525	3076065	10.0	10.0	40193900	Foodie Paradise was all it was described to be.  We two couples found there was plenty of space for relaxing when we were done for the day and the bedrooms and baths were comfortable and clean.  The kitchen was well stocked with all utensils and condiments needed for our occasional meals eaten at home.  The fireplace was wonderful when it grew cool.  We enjoyed the patio during all hours and the fire pit set the mood on a cool evening.  The neighborhood is very walkable, with numerous restaurants and pubs nearby.  The Ballard Farmer's Market was a must visit.  Parking can be a challenge, but we managed to park right at the location or a block away at the most.  It is suggested that Uber or public transportation be utilized if going downtown.  Our host was gracious and prompt in communicating when I had any questions.
3526	3076065	10.0	10.0	41398708	Tue house si really lovely. Clean and noiseless. Also the area si cool. A bit far frombola downtown but surely charming (and there are many bus very near). It si a great choice!
3527	3076065	10.0	10.0	42613896	Michael's house was immaculate and comfortable. It felt very private, but was in close proximity to numerous restaurants, shops and coffee houses. We were able to take a shuttle from the airport to this location and walk everywhere we wanted to go, which saved us the hassle and expense of a rental car. The neighborhood felt safe and everyone we encountered was extremely friendly. Several times during our stay, Michael made us feel at home by sending us helpful messages. As we have family in the area and plan to visit frequently, we will wholeheartedly recommend this house to our family and would love to stay there again in the future.
3528	3076065	10.0	10.0	43069383	This house was absolutely beautiful and felt extremely comfortable and clean for our stay. It's a little further from town but we loved exploring the nearby neighborhoods of Ballard and Freemont. It's about a $14 uber/lyft drive from downtown Seattle/Capitol Hill. We loved the firepit and the outdoor patio. Everything was lovely and would recommend this for a comfortable stay in Seattle! 
3529	3076065	10.0	10.0	45105049	We loved this place!  We would definitely recommend this host and the accommodations and would stay here again next time we go to Seattle.  
3530	3076065	10.0	10.0	46114215	The listing was accurate, great place to stay! Very quiet and clean with detailed guide for ammenities in house.  All furnishings and linens were high quality and lots of space indoors and outdoors to relax and entertain.
3531	3076065	10.0	10.0	47702726	"Great neighborhood, accurate info on house and how to make it work best. Beautiful outdoor fire pit. Quiet home. Super clean and organized.  Would rent this place again.

It was wonderful not only to share their beautiful clean space, but also have dynamic conversation and a delicious home cooked meal together. They had great suggestions for what to do in the neighborhood and beyond and we weren't disappointed when we took up on a few of their suggestions. Slate coffee is amazing!

I will definitely be staying here next time I visit the Seattle area and recommend this place for anyone who wants to stay somewhere that feels just like home. 

Thank you Javier and Yeon! "
4147	1198799	10.0	10.0	32348543	"Javier & Yeon are absolutely wonderful hosts! My friend and I stayed here this past weekend in Seattle and it was an extremely comfortable stay. Not only were Javier & Yeon accommodating with our arrival time being before check in but they were also very helpful with many wonderful suggestions. When we arrived to the house, it was exactly as pictured and everything was so clean.

The Ballard area is so great- filled with a big variety of coffee shops, bars, and restaurants you can't go wrong! We took public transportation for the majority of our trip so having the D line bus stop so close to the house was a huge plus! 

Javier & Yeon were very easy to communicate with, generous with their help, and even prepared fruit and delicious pastries for us! Needless to say, we are grateful to have stayed in this very friendly place in Ballard.

They are both very kind and considerate, giving us great recommendations of where to eat or enjoy coffee. And their home locates in a terrific location for visitors who don't have a car, which is less than five minutes to Dline station heading to Seattle downtown.  

Since we have a tight schedule visiting Seattle this time,  there's not much time spending quality time with them but we still had great time chatting with Airbnb App. 

Next time I visit Seattle, I will definitely choose Javier and Yeon 's home."

The neighbourhood is a very safe and nice area, not far to walk to restaurants, pubs, and grocery stores.  Several bus routes are within short walking distance too.  
5103	4449303	10.0	10.0	29146553	Very nice place, great neighborhood. Wish I had had more time to spend here. Very modern place.

5104	4449303	10.0	10.0	29792443	This house is in a great location and Steven is an excellent host.  The place is very clean and has all you could need. Steven went out of his way to ensure I had what I needed; he vent supplied a iron and ironing board. He has a great dog that is very friendly; and not a bother at all. I highly recommend Steven and this listing.

Steven was a truly gracious host and sharing his home was perfect for us. I was having a surgery done at Swedish and this provided a close in respite for us. The neighborhood park was just what our dog needed too. We would stay with

Thank you Steven, it was perfect!

I'll be back!
Thanks!"
5108	4449303	10.0	10.0	32692714	"Steven made sure the space was clean and welcoming, and had some extra coffee on every morning. I loved the great internet/tv access and the house is really beautiful with great facilities. Plus, dog cuddles! 

The house was not far from services/grocery etc, and an easy walking distance to a number of bus routes which was helpful for me as I wasn't driving while in town. 

I appreciated the privacy of having the bedroom and bathroom on their own level too. I tend to keep to myself when I travel to rest up so it was nice.

Flexible check-in times were really helpful too, with a late flight arrival on my first day. "
5109	4449303	10.0	10.0	33255581	Steven was a great host. My partner and I stayed with him for 3 nights. The bed was extremely comfortable and Steven made everything very clear and was great about communicating. Thanks for a fantastic stay. Loved your house!
5110	4449303	10.0	10.0	33713373	"Steven's home is every bit as hospitable and inviting as his listing suggests.  The first floor bedroom is very comfortable, the private bathroom is very convenient, and the common areas are a great perk for moments when you need to just relax for a bit.  The location is a short walk from a bunch of great micro-breweries, and it's not much farther to get to the hip spots in Ballard.  We walked almost everywhere, which was perfect.  

Steven is a very accommodating host.  Everything worked perfectly, down to the personalized key code to enter the house.  He even made us coffee in the morning!  As far as shared living situations go, Steven was the perfect blend of hand-on when he needed to be, and hands-off when he wasn't needed.

I would highly recommend this location.  Go for it!"

I was able to relax in bed watching modern family on HuluPlus :) the bed was super comfortable as well. Steven was an amazing host...chill, relatable, and friendly. I would definitely stay here again!

5119	4449303	10.0	10.0	37518301	Steven has a great pad in a wonderful part of Seattle, convenient to almost everything it felt.

I will definitely be making a return stay here when I can.
5120	4449303	10.0	10.0	37758217	Great house, great host, great location. Steve provided a clean room with extras including coffee, a great patio and tons of information about the city. The house is walking distance to several local breweries in a very cool neighborhood. Thanks for the great stay!
5121	4449303	10.0	10.0	38266805	Steven was an excellent host. He was very accommodating and helpful. The house is lovely and should have everything you need for your stay. You'll also have delicious coffee and fresh eggs from his hens! Tug, his dog, is friendly and very cute, but if you're not a dog person he's very quiet and shouldn't bother you. The townhome is about a 15 min walk to downtown Ballard or Freemont, but you'll need to drive/Uber to most other places. 
5122	4449303	10.0	10.0	38695617	Steven has a very nice and modern house in a lovely neighbourhood in Seattle. He helped a lot when we had questions or wanted to know things. The room and bathroom is like on the pictures: very comfortable and modern! From Stevens house, you could very easy come into town with public transportation.  So all in all, we would definitely recommend to stay in Stevens house!
5123	4449303	10.0	10.0	39012759	I loved my stay at Steven's great house in Ballard! It was great to be in a real neighborhood with character instead of in a boring hotel. Space was clean and pleasant, and parking was plentiful. Plus, there were tons of great breweries, food carts and restaurants a short walk away. Steven made it really easy to access the space and made us feel very welcome. Will definitely try to book this place again on my next visit to Seattle.
5124	4449303	10.0	10.0	39290817	Steven was a great host, model of hospitality. The place had everything we needed, coffee was ready in the mornings, and Tug, the pup was super sweet. Perfect location for restaurants and bars in Ballard.

We enjoyed walking around and exploring Ballard. Everything was close by. Parking was easy. Steven was working most of the time, but was very responsive via texting and e-mail. would recommend tony friends.
5126	4449303	10.0	10.0	40462459	Staying at Steven's Modern Townhouse with my very own private floor was a truly top notch Air BnB experience. He had everything customized just for my stay - from the wifi with my own name on it, to the custom four digit lock code that was the last four digits of my personal cell number, Steven went to great lengths to ensure that my stay was as comfortable and easy as possible. It was the first air BnB i stayed at that wasn't completely detached from the hosts main living spaces, but Steven was super gracious and gave me the space when I needed it, but was more than happy to let me sit down and watch ESPN with him over a glass of wine. And his awesome dog, Tug was a pleasant surprise too. If you're looking for a place with hotel-like service, then this is definitely the one you're looking for!
5127	4449303	10.0	10.0	40795938	"Great location!!. Very hospitable hosts. Very friendly greater (dog). 
Would stay there again anytime! "
5128	4449303	10.0	10.0	41257316	Steven's townhouse was just as it looked: newish and very comfortable and clean. The bathroom was nice too and completely private.  Getting in and out was easy via a coded lock - no key needed.  The neighborhood is very quiet, and everything you might need is within walking distance: breakfast, lunch, and dinner restaurants, and many microbrew pubs. I took the bus line to downtown for $3.00.  Steven was a nice host - he provides lots of recommendations on where to eat locally, and what to see - as was his dog Tug, who I took for a walk. This was a great way to get to know a part of Seattle that I never would have visited. 
5129	4449303	10.0	10.0	41636105	Staying at Steven's place was amazing. The house is super clean and beautiful! Steven went out of his was to be accommodating and provide suggestions as to what to see and places to eat and drink. Plus Tug(the dog) is a blast! Super cute with a lot of energy. I'm glad my first Airbnb experience was here. Would definitely stay at Steven's place in a heartbeat again!
5130	4449303	10.0	10.0	41941454	Steven was very responsive with texts and e-mails as we got close to the date of our arrival.

Even though we were only there for one night, we were able to easily access the house and our accommodations and found the location very convenient for our visit.
5131	4449303	10.0	10.0	42461333	Awesome house in a great part of Seattle.  Super close walk to the interesting Ballard area, and an easy drive or bus ride downtown.  Steven was great. I'd recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle!
5132	4449303	10.0	10.0	42625165	Though we only visited one night Stevens house is a great place to explore Seattle from. A bus stop that will take you downtown is only a few blocks away. We followed his recommendation and had breakfast  at The Dish. A delicious and cozy little place.  An overall great experience.
5133	4449303	10.0	10.0	43468587	Great place! Location was easy to get to, and still close to downtown. Parking was no problem, and the house was nice and clean. The bed was also super-comfortable.
5134	4449303	10.0	10.0	44116526	Steven made sure my girlfriend and I knew everything we needed to for check-in, check-out, and getting around the house. Him and his hilarious golden doodle were most welcoming! Would definitely stay again!
5135	4449303	10.0	10.0	44693479	This was my first experience with airbnb and i'm happy to say it went great. Steven was very welcoming and his dog Tug was awesome. The apartment was on a pretty quiet street in Ballard but close enough to everything. My bedroom and bathroom were both cozy and clean! I would definitely stay here again. Steven makes it very easy on setting up codes and passwords for coming in and out ,internet, and cable. Wish i could have stayed longer! 
5136	4449303	10.0	10.0	45462656	"
My stay at Steven's house was very nice and quite comfortable.  My cozy bedroom was just the right size for me and had a sizable closet for all my stuff; plenty of room altogether.  My private bathroom down the hall was spectacular.  The neighborhood was delightful and friendly.  I rode my bike through it feeling quite safe. "
5137	4449303	10.0	10.0	46928975	The perfect spot for us to visit relatives in Seattle for a few days. Steven was gracious and helpful. Thanks for the excellent stay!
5138	4449303	10.0	10.0	47419486	"The place is very nice and clean with 2 great breweries within 2 blocks of his house!  The room is on the smaller side but was very clean and had a big TV mounted on the wall so you can easily hang out on your own if you want.  Steve is a really nice guy and although we didn't see much of each other he was pretty easy going and even made coffee the first morning I was there!

Would definitely go back."
5139	4449303	10.0	10.0	48295429	I like the fully automated checkin/checkout process which made ti very easy to arrive at any time.  Steven's house is very well appointed and just as described.  I found it perfect for my visit to Seattle.
5140	4449303	10.0	10.0	48640155	Steven made me feel welcome with keeping things simple for me with the door code and wifi password.  The neighborhood was quiet and close to amenities.  The house is clean and Tug is adorable and well behaved.  Overall, a positive experience!
5141	4449303	10.0	10.0	50983980	Steven was a great host and made our stay super easy. Easy instructions on how to come and go from the condo and the downstairs unit was very private so it felt like having an apartment to ourselves. The Ballard area was perfect for great restaurants and exploring the city both on foot and an easy drive to popular sites downtown. 
5142	4449303	10.0	10.0	51816372	Steven's Airbnb was a restful retreat--enjoyed the downstairs suite and small garden area. I also used the kitchen on the main floor to heat water for tea and eat meals in a clean and contemporary space. Steven is a gracious, responsive and accommodating host!
5143	4449303	10.0	10.0	53943692	"Steve was very welcoming and even ran  home in the middle of his work day to be certain the space was in good order.  He also responded quickly to all of our inquiries.

The neighborhood was safe and quiet and within walking distance to the Ballard business district where we discovered several wonderful restaurants.  On a chilly, rainy Seattle afternoon we found refuge at the Majestic Movie Theater and enjoyed the BIG screen experience!

"
5144	4449303	10.0	10.0	54168326	Steven's home was super clean and tastefully decorated.  We appreciated his detailed instructions and suggestions for local restaurants and activities. Communication was easy, too.
5145	4449303	10.0	10.0	55700571	"Steven's place im Seattle's hip Ballard neighborhood was ideal! His dog, ""Tug"", is very cute & welcoming as well.... Walking distance to several great micro brewery's - One of the most relaxing airbnb experiences i've had... You really have your own entire floor to yourself, with access to the other floors if needed-- I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5146	4449303	10.0	10.0	55870941	Easy to find. Quiet and comfortable. Did not meet Steven, but he was responsive and easy to work with prior to my stay. Thanks for providing recommendations for places to eat - I really enjoyed trying a new place for breakfast (loved the food, service and setting of the Dish).
5147	4449303	10.0	10.0	56082517	We had a great time! Nice and clean, exactly as it was listed, and the pup Tug made for a great new friend! Steven was even kind enough to get the coffee brewing for us late-ish sleepers. The house is close to a lot of local breweries and stylish restaurants, ensuring that neither the foodie nor the beer-lover will go wanting if they stay here. Highly recommend this place and its awesome host!
5148	4449303	10.0	10.0	56286314	A hidden jewel of an airbnb located in the pleasant Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Steven's place is quite charming & relaxing. This was the 2nd time in 2 weeks that i stayed here and, as with the 1st time , i give it 5 stars~ 
5149	4449303	10.0	10.0	57242583	This was my first airbnb experience.  I was a little nervous about being a stranger in someone else's house but Steven made the experience comfortable and easy.  I was out and about most the time so only interacted with Steven once but he was very welcoming and his dog Tug gives excellent hugs.  The neighborhood is great.  I rented a car and found that I was an easy 10-15 min away from everything I wanted to see.  I did a lot of yoga around Ballard, Fremont and Queen Anne.  All the studios were excellent.  Coffee shops in all those neighborhoods are cozy and tasty as well.  It was great having a comfortable place to come home to each night.  Not having to bother with a key was excellent!

6527	8308316	10.0	10.0	50126169	We had a wonderful stay at this charming apartment. It has a great view and was spotless. There are some cafes and grocery stores in walking distance and buses to get to downtown. Kimberly was very kind and helpful, provided us with recommendations for a rainy day we experienced ;-) and was easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend this home away from home if you'd like to stay in a nice neighborhood in Seattle.

6530	8308316	10.0	10.0	56937786	The apartment is great. Really cozy and comfortable! Also in a great spot in queen anne. Only a 10 to 15 minute walk down the hill to the space needle. Even though I never met Kimberly face to face, she would respond promptly if I had a question. Thanks!
7075	2692126	10.0	9.0	17264785	"I have loved living here. Kelly is really friendly and helpful. When I first arrived, she was welcoming and explained where everything was and gave me all the details about the house. She is easily accessible through text and responds quickly. She's also very respectful and gives me my privacy.

The house is older, but recently renovated and all of the furnishings are nice. Basically anything that you need is already here. There's laundry in the house, which is convenient. The house is pretty quiet in general. There's a separate entrance to the garden unit, so I feel like I have my own space, but it's nice to have other people in the house as well.

I really like the location. The neighborhood feels safe - I have no problems walking around by myself at night. It's also easy to get downtown and to other neighborhoods, like Fremont, which is where I work. It's fairly quiet here. It's nice to be in a convenient location, but not to feel like I'm living in the middle of the busy city. There's a grocery store about half a mile away and just beyond that is the Space Needle. Lake Union is just a short walk away as well."
7076	2692126	10.0	9.0	17837316	It's going to be hard to describe how amazing our Airbnb experience with Kelly was, but, I will do my best. My husband and I were staying in Seattle for 8 nights, so we wanted an upscale accommodation without the expense and hassle (read: parking fees and children running through hallways) of staying at a hotel. Man, did we nail it when we chose to stay with Kelly. To begin, the pictures are exactly accurate. What you see is what you're getting. Kelly has created a little private, urban oasis in Lower Queen Anne, just outside of the City Center (space needle, emp, chihuly, etc). The apartment is equipped with a full kitchen with everything you could possibly need (except a muffin tin, but you can borrow hers), a table and 4 chairs for dining/we converted it into a great work space, a large bathroom with a luxurious shower (the pressure is unreal), a small living area with an Amazon fire tv, and a cozy bedroom with plenty of closet space and drawers. The bed is snuggly and the apartment gets good and dark for excellent sleep, not to mention it's amazingly quiet and peaceful amidst this bustling city. For us, the location couldn't have been any better. Queen Anne is so central and the vibe was clean and safe. We found that everything we wanted to do was a quick walk (coffee, restaurants and awesome supermarkets are 5-10 minutes away by foot), a short car trip or a cheap uber ride away. Kelly was an excellent host, extremely easy to communicate with via text, email or phone call and was able to answer all of our questions and give us local suggestions for restaurants and things to do. We felt like we were staying with a friend, but better, because though she was always around when we needed, she left us alone to enjoy our vacation as a couple. A sincere thank you to Kelly for a most enjoyable Seattle experience!
7077	2692126	10.0	9.0	18032661	Kelly was a great host and this is a clean, well-equipped, private apt near downtown. 
7078	2692126	10.0	9.0	18316586	We had a great stay with Kelly! Her place was immaculately clean, wifi was good, shower was fantastic, and the bed was comfy. I appreciated the little touches Kelly added to make our stay extra nice. Access to her laundry room was a plus, too.

7079	2692126	10.0	9.0	18581805	Kelly has a perfect downstairs apartment in the popular Queen Anne neighborhood. It it very nicely appointed and she was extremely accommodating for all requests large and small. I would highly recommend the listing and can't wait to get back to Seattle! Thank you Kelly!
7080	2692126	10.0	9.0	18881483	I stayed here for a week and the location of the apartment is very convenient. There are bus stops five minutes away to downtown Seattle and the space needle area. Yet the  bedroom is very quiet and the location of the home is relatively removed from the hustle and bustle of Seattle. Plus if you like nature paths the apartment is ideal towards that as well as being near Seattle center. Thanks Kelly for letting me stay in your beautiful apartment!
7081	2692126	10.0	9.0	19326551	Our trip to Seattle was wonderful and Kelly's apartment was everything you could ask for to make your stay comfortable. We loved Seattle and staying at Kelly's is the perfect area for exploring. We have stayed at several Airbnb apartments and this one tops all. Kelly was quick to respond to any questions we had about the area and offered some great tips for eating and transportation. The apartment was exactly as described with all of the extras you will need for your stay. The bed was extremely comfortable and we felt welcomed from the start. I highly recommend staying at this apartment on your visit to Seattle.
7082	2692126	10.0	9.0	19437890	"Good location - not far from City Center. Walking distance, about 7 minutes, to a wide selection of dining experiences and a super- market. Also, apartment is in a really nice residential section with peaceful and interesting places to explore.

Kelly made our first trip to Seattle hassle free. She acted as tour guide, with great recommendations for all places of dining and points of interest. Her patience and sweet nature shine through - she is especially accommodating ( she worked around our arrival schedule and left work early and got us settled).

Her apartment is immaculate and extremely clean. It feels cozy and quite inviting. Bed is comfortable and  new, bed sheets are rich and of a higher quality - great sleeping experience. Full kitchen with all the touches of home.

I gladly recommend this wonderful apartment to the airbnb world."

The location is ideal for anyone visiting Seattle. It's 10 minutes to everything. Coffee shops, grocery stores, food and transportation are all within a walkable distance. (I highly recommend getting an ORCA card if you're staying for a long period.)

Kelly is a wonderful host. Her advice was useful and spot on.
The apartment was very comfortable, well appointed and had everything one would want including a washer and dryer. Kelly left fresh coffee beans from Cafe Vita that definitely helped start the day.
While the Queen Anne neighborhood is hilly, it is very convenient. It is walking distance to the Space Needle and a little further to downtown and Pikes Market. The bus is also nearby and fairly frequent.
Highly recommended!"

Kelly was very accommodating with our check-in/out times.  Everything was smooth from start to end.  There's a reason why the reviews and ratings for Kelly and her apartment are so great.  Kelly does a superb job making you feel welcome and her place has everything you could need.  The photos pretty accurately depict the apartment.  It's super clean.  It is more than adequate for two people and I would say it could comfortably accommodate 4.  My wife and I have used airbnb a number of times and I have to say that our stay at Kelly's place has been one of the best experiences we've had. 

Thanks for everything, Kelly!"
7089	2692126	10.0	9.0	23383009	Absolutely loved staying here.  The tidiest airbnb I've ever stayed in.  Fully equipped, everything sparkly and new.  Handwritten note and a delicious chocolate bar from the local chocolate factory.  Oh, and the location is a few short blocks from everything you would need. 
7090	2692126	10.0	9.0	25738176	Kelly was an amazing first airbnb experience.  Photos are accurate, she is so welcoming and gives you your space, yet always available if you should need anything.  Thank you Kelly for a wonderful place to stay.  I will look you up when I come back next year!  All the best to you!
7091	2692126	10.0	9.0	27869133	We absolutely loved staying at Kelly's!  She is super kind, helpful, and very, very accommodating. The apartment is just as it's pictured - warm, cozy and inviting.  It is also VERY clean, which we appreciated. The location is minutes away from coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants and downtown Seattle. If you're not used to the area, the small streets and hills can take some adjusting to, but we were able to find parking nearby and drive wherever we needed to go pretty easily. In terms of the apartment itself, it is a great spot for a couple to stay. Do keep in mind that it is a renovated basement, so you can hear people outside and above pretty easily.  It didn't bother us too much but it is helpful to know if you are desiring a more quiet location. We had everything we needed from clean towels to a nice bottle of wine in the fridge! Kelly was just a text away if we needed recommendations for great restaurants or more paper towels :) My only negative feedback is that we didn't get a chance to meet her! 
7092	2692126	10.0	9.0	28177960	I love the experience living in Kelly's. Her house is nice and neat. We rent a car when we were in Seattle and we could get space needle, kerry park and the coast very quick from Kelly's house. We were pretty satisfied by the location of the house. Besides, Kelly is really sweet and considerable. She even prepared travel books, cards and snacks for us.  I would recommend this house to you.
7093	2692126	10.0	9.0	28643513	Kelly gets a five star rating from us!  The garden level apt was just as described and pictured (if not better!).  Great kitchen, with some sweet perks from Kelly, and very very comfortable bed!  Lots of storage for our clothes, and even a washer/dryer that we were able to easily use.  We felt entirely at home!  Lovely neighborhood, walking distance to city center and public transportation.  When we return to Seattle, we will definitely stay here again!
7094	2692126	10.0	9.0	28794162	The listing was very accurate and very true to the photos. Felt very welcomed and absolutely had all our needs met!
7095	2692126	10.0	9.0	29130859	This apartment has great! Very neat, newly remodeled, had everything we needed. Kelly was inviting and attentive. I would definitely return!
7096	2692126	10.0	9.0	29754457	Beautiful apartment. Close to everything. 
7097	2692126	10.0	9.0	30443582	"Kelly is a fantastic host! She greeted us upon arrival, and so patiently waited while we navigated traffic with a lot of construction. Kelly has a wealth of resources for great restaurants and things to see in the area. The apartment was exactly as described and oh-so cozy. I really liked the individual room climate controls. The apartment is in the basement level, but the slope of the hill provides plenty of windows for light so it does not feel like a basement. The apartment is incredibly convenient to QFC, Trader Joe's and shops on Queen Anne Ave, as well as the Space Needle.
Kelly provides even more creature comforts than expected: coffee, nice smelling bath products, spices and herbs, and plush towels."
7098	2692126	10.0	9.0	31235089	Kelly was a great hostess, the place was clean and the bed was comfy. She checked on me to make sure I had all I needed, which was appreciated. It was a very smooth check in and stay and I would not hesitate to stay there again.
7099	2692126	10.0	9.0	31591527	My mom stayed here while visiting and absolutely loved the apartment. The apartment is fantastic and in a great location. Easy walking distance to the Seattle Center and restaurants. Kelly is also an amazing host. She checked-in on my mom to make sure she had everything. Definitely going to advise future visitors to stay here.
7100	2692126	10.0	9.0	31775050	This is an amazing gem of an apartment with a wonderful host. I was visiting my daughter in Seattle for Mother's Day weekend and unfortunately she's moving to Chicago because I'd love to stay here again and again. The apartment is fantastic, newly furnished, thoughtful touches everywhere and tastefully decorated. In a wonderful Queen Anne location where we walked to Caffe Vita and Crow restaurant.  The best of all was Kelly- she is warm, smart and communicative.  I felt I was staying at a friend's place.  Fantastic!
7101	2692126	10.0	9.0	32239129	Kelly was an amazing host. She's so nice And helpful. Her place is really comfy And beautifuly decorated. I would highly recommend it to anyone!  My parents loved staying there And they can't wait to be back!!
7102	2692126	10.0	9.0	32596207	Wow! The accommodations exceeded our expectations and were even better then described on the site!! The location was great and nestled us right into the area with lots of options for food and site seeing. The owner, Kelly, was extremely courteous, helpful and nice and had everything we needed and more to cook and clean if necessary.  The bed was super comfortable and the apartment felt very spacious! We felt very safe in the neighborhood and loved coming back after a long day of sightseeing to this beautiful place!
7103	2692126	10.0	9.0	32858420	Kelly's place is wonderful. It is very clean and exactly as pictures showed on her listing. It has everything you need to a stay in Seattle. I got to meet with her and she is so nice!! I will definitely stay again next time I go to Seattle!
7104	2692126	10.0	9.0	32968126	Kelly's apartment was immaculate and only about twenty minute walk downhill for a couple of avid walkers. My parents who are not as mobile appreciated the free, albeit first-come-first-serve parking. Kelly was always there with help and advice about the apartment and the city. The space was even enough for two couples with the double high air bed setup in the main living area. A+ airbnb. Slick check in and out. Highly highly highly reccommend 
7105	2692126	10.0	9.0	33781730	My friend and I had a great time in Seattle! And the apartment was in the perfect location! The apartment was clean and cozy but had everything we needed. The bed was super comfortable. Street parking was a tad difficult to find on nights when we returned a bit late, but I think that's expected of nearly anywhere in the Queen Anne area, and we eventually found a spot within a couple of blocks. Although we didn't get to meet Kelly, she was always very easy to reach via phone/text and quick to respond, making sure we had everything we needed. Also super appreciated the complimentary dark chocolate bar! Thank you so much, Kelly!
7106	2692126	10.0	9.0	34307934	"We had a great time at Kelly's place. The reviews were right on and the apartment was just as pictured. Kelly is kind and easy to deal with. Quick to respond and eager to help. The apartment was great. The bed was very comfortable, everything was clean and there was every thing you can possibly need on hand. I found the rate to be significantly cheaper than a 3 star downtown hotel and feel that this place and location was better. 

I'd stay again for sure. "
7107	2692126	10.0	9.0	34643164	"Kelly was a great host. She made the apartment very clean, cozy and home-like. I was also welcomed by a sweet treat in the fridge and lots of great recommendations about local restaurants.

The online descriptions are accurate. All rooms are modern and simplistically stylish. All facilities are easy to use.

I also like the Queen Anne neighborhood. It is safe, quiet and in walking distance to Space Needle, Amazon and downtown. "
7108	2692126	10.0	9.0	34930729	"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was absolutely fabulous! Kelly was very accommodating from the start, allowing us to check in much earlier (and on short notice!) so we could avoid lugging our bags around. She left a guide book (and chocolate, mm!), offered to provide any recommendations, and checked in to make sure we were satisfied.

The place itself was lovely, too. Adorable, quiet neighborhood, with Seattle Center just a short walk downhill (I was in town for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon, so this was especially pleasing to me). There are cute restaurants and a fabulous coffee shop very close by as well. The apartment was perfectly clean with nice furnishings and a kitchen fully-stocked with supplies!

I would highly recommend Kelly and her wonderful apartment to anyone!"
7109	2692126	10.0	9.0	35535580	My husband and I recently stayed at Kelly's apartment during our anniversary trip to Seattle.  Kelly was an excellent host! She made us feel at home in her Queen Anne apartment.  The apartment looked exactly like the pictures and felt very cozy.  It was furnished well and had everything that we needed for our stay.  We also loved the neighborhood!  It was quiet, but not too far of a walk to great restaurants as well as the Seattle Center.  We tried several restaurants within walking distance of the apartment and loved them.  Crow and 5 Spot were two of our favorites!  We would definitely recommend staying at Kelly's place if you are visiting Seattle!
7110	2692126	10.0	9.0	35869254	This was our first AirBnB experience. The location was excellent, and Kelly was a wonderful host, even suggesting some really good local restaurants! The whole apartment was clean and very modern. The local is easily within walking distance of the Space Needle!
7111	2692126	10.0	9.0	35997740	"Kelly's home is welcoming and exactly as pictured--so clean and well kept, I am a stickler for cleanliness and this place fit the bill! Kelly was very accommodating and let us check in earlier than we were scheduled, she left everything we needed including an air mattress. We really appreciated the washer/dryer which was SO convenient! The neighborhood was lovely and the grocery store was just a few blocks away.
I'd absolutely stay here again, my kids and I had a great time exploring the local parks and playgrounds, definitely a family friendly area. The Seattle Center is about a 20min walk away."
7112	2692126	10.0	9.0	38099155	This was our first experience with Air BnB.  Kelly‚Äôs place was centrally located, clean and had all the amenities that one could possibly think of using.  Our room was really comfortable and we felt like we were at home.  The pictures on the web looked just like her place with plenty of space.  She was easy to work with and went above and beyond to please.  One a scale with one to ten with 10 being the best we would rate Kelly‚Äôs place a ten.  
7113	2692126	10.0	9.0	38733173	We absolutely enjoyed staying at Kelly's appartment. Everything as pictured and very clean. We loved the neighborhood and the recommended restaurants within walking distance. The appartment is perfectly located to explore Seattle! Situated in a lovely and quite neighbourhood, but at the same time just a 15min walk to Space needle, EMP museum and Monorail. We definitely recommend Kelly's appartment to enjoy Seattle!
7114	2692126	10.0	9.0	39546891	Kelly was so helpful with information about things to do and places to eat in and around Seattle. She didn't mind us arriving late in the night as we were coming in from Vancouver. The apartment is very beautiful, very nice floors and a super comfortable bed. She also had all the essentials setup in the kitchen and bathroom, which made our life so easy. It really felt like we were part of the city being so close to everything. I would highly recommend staying at Kelly's amazing space for any amount of time.
7115	2692126	10.0	9.0	39902181	"A fabulous experience in Seattle! The amazingly clean apartment had everything we needed for a supremely comfortable stay for three nights.  A really comfy bed, quiet and convenient neighborhood, and a kitchen with all the essentials made for a perfect home away from home. There is lots of room to spread out and the dresser was a personal favorite to reorganize my packing before heading to the Olympic Pennisula to hike.
Every connection with Kelly was friendly, professional, and timely from booking to checkout. This would be my choice anytime I visit the area again. No reason to hesitate. Book it!"
7116	2692126	10.0	9.0	40307098	Apartment was very clean at arrival. The neighbourhood was central and suited our needs very well. The kitchen was remarkably nice - everything new and good quality. Good relation between quality and price. Sometimes some foot step noise from the above apartment. 
7117	2692126	10.0	9.0	40712334	Lovely, spacious downstairs apartment!!!  All recently remodeled with great taste.  Location was central for exploring Seattle, and we had no trouble finding street parking right nearby.  Kelly was very helpful and communicative throughout our whole visit.  Definitely would book here again.
7118	2692126	10.0	9.0	41341309	Kelly was a very welcoming and well organized hostess, and her place is super comfortable. Everything is clean, new, tasteful and beautifully maintained. The whole experience was very easy and seamless - she even had a bottle of wine set out for us when we arrived! Throughout our stay, she was very helpful and communicative. We would be happy to stay here again next time we're in Seattle. Thank you, Kelly!
7119	2692126	10.0	9.0	43260655	We had a great time in Kelly's apartment. Check in and out was very easy and Kelly was flexible on the hours. The place was super clean, and had all the necessary kitchen appliance, linen, towels, soap... There is Fire TV, working Wifi and Netflix available. The place is in lower Queen Ann which was perfect for me since I was visiting friends in the area, easy to walk to the Space Needle and downtown. I would definitely recommend the place.
7120	2692126	10.0	9.0	43667733	"The host made me feel extremely welcome.  It was as described and more.  Extremely clean, spacious, lots of closet space, TV with FireTV,
comfortable bed, at a reasonable price.  Great location, walking distance to downtown Seattle.  I would definitely return."
7121	2692126	10.0	9.0	44309835	Immaculate, bright apartment in a great location. The whole experience from booking to departure was flawless. Would book again without hesitation. 
7122	2692126	10.0	9.0	44783320	Kelly was an amazing host. We had everything we needed for our week in Seattle and she was always available to answer questions via text. The location is conveniently located to downtown. There is a grocery store, cafe, and bar all within walking distance. 
7123	2692126	10.0	9.0	45670390	Kelly made us feel extremely welcome.  Her place was nicely decorated and extra clean with all of the essential amenities (and more). She even let us check-in early and the lockbox was super convenient.
7124	2692126	10.0	9.0	46794974	What a wonderful host! Kelly provided a very comfortable and clean apartment for my boyfriend and I during our weekend stay for the Seattle Cider Summit. The house is tucked into a corner of the block, in a quiet, Victorian neighborhood, with easy access to the highway, two blocks away. It was an optimal location for walking downtown, to the lake and to a moderate selection of neighborhood eateries. The night we arrived, we had a bit of difficulty finding street parking and Kelly was very polite in giving us a parking spot directly behind her car in the driveway so that we could relax and not have to walk several blocks with baggage after a long day working at the Cider Summit. We really appreciated the kind gesture.
7125	2692126	10.0	9.0	47392886	Beautiful home!  Had all the necessary amenities and Kelly was very nice :)  It's also in a great location!
7126	2692126	10.0	9.0	47724709	"Kelly's apartment was just as expected. A very nice space, nicely furnished and immaculately clean. Kelly was very welcoming to us and available if we needed anything. Even though she lives upstairs, we rarely heard anything - perhaps because we were noisy ourselves. 

Ordinarily with so many restaurants to choose from, we wouldn't have needed to do much cooking; however, with recent dietary restrictions we did end up cooking a few meals and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed, including olive oil, spices, etc. We had Saturday night dinner at The Crow (I love that restaurant) which was a pleasant walk from the apartment. 

Parking is difficult unless you get lucky but we always found a space, even if a couple of blocks away. A great alternative is Uber - reasonably priced and super efficient.

Kelly has a great place and she is a very gracious host. I recommend her apartment!"
7127	2692126	10.0	9.0	53301886	Kelly's place was simply perfect. This was my first time as a guest through Airbnb and I can say that she has set the bar high for all other hosts. This is coming from another Airbnb host. In fact, I'm a Superhost, so I know what it takes to earn the coveted designation and the excellence that is required to maintain it. Kelly was there to meet me when I arrived in the evening. As I was reaching for the doorbell, I could still see her through the glass on the door making sure everything was perfect and set up just right. It was a rather cold  evening in Seattle so after walking from the train stop in downtown, I was freezing. Her place was warm and toasty and in the perfect welcoming condition for someone who was freezing with numb hands. Her place was as immaculately tidy as can be and utterly spotless. It was comfortable and super quaint and spacious too. The d√©cor made it feel like home. The shower was hot and the bed was as comfy as my own bed, if not more! I didn't use the kitchen at all, but I saw that it was well equipped with everything you would need if you did any cooking. Kelly's place was in a quiet neighborhood. Before I booked, I thought I wanted to be more in a bustling area, but after staying in Kelly's place, I realized it was in the most ideal location. The noise level was immediately appreciated as there was none of it, so I slept like a baby. Quiet in the beautiful neighborhood of Queen Anne with its unique architecture and craftsman style homes, it was exactly how Kelly described it to be - only a short walk to the Space Needle and Chihuly museum and about a 20 minute walk to downtown. Once you're downtown, then pretty much everything else in Seattle is right around it. Kelly took her time explaining everything to me about her home and what to see and do in Seattle and how to get around. I was flabbergasted at how keen Kelly was to every detail. Kelly even managed to squeeze in a little time to play tour guide with me, but don't expect that all the time as she's such a busy bee! Kelly is the essence of all things a wonderful host is. She certainty sets the bar very high and I thank her very much. I can't recommend any more to stay at her place while in Seattle, it's the perfect place, and you'll have no regrets. 
7128	2692126	10.0	9.0	53897782	This was a 1st AirBNB experience for my boyfriend and I. Kelly (and the place) blew away any apprehensions.  Prior to the trip, Kelly was quick to answer minor questions regarding availability of amenities and checked in with us during our stay, which was very kind. We stayed a full week and despite the chilly rainy November weather, did a lot of Seattle tourism. This apt in Queen Anne was ideally located for us to walk to/from downtown -- occasionally taking the bus when it poured.  Each night, we loved being able to come back to Kelly's place to relax. The neighborhood was very peaceful and safe.  Bed was  comfortable. Entire apt is tidy, modern, and spacious enough for us both. It was really nice to have separate kitchen / living room area and bedroom instead of a smaller cramped hotel room which would've cost more! We really appreciated the extra space.  Access to Laundry room was superb. Allowed us to do a load mid week which saved on packing extra clothes.  We would highly recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle!
7129	2692126	10.0	9.0	54281290	"Kelly and her cute and tidy apartment exceeded expectations!  It was perfect!  Great location, immaculate, charming, private - everything we needed for a perfect weekend in Seattle.  Kelly was there to meet us when we arrived and greeted us like old friends.  She supplied us with restaurant recommendations that helped us navigate all the Seattle choices.  
The apartment was tastefully appointed and equipped with everything needed to function in a full kitchen, should you decide not to take advantage of all the amazing food in Seattle.  We felt pampered as if we were staying in a four-star hotel with all the little extras that Kelly provided.
We would stay here in a heartbeat the next time we are in Seattle, as long as this sweet place is not booked!"
7130	2692126	10.0	9.0	54616763	Kelly was so helpful and always available for recommendations. The house was perfect for my girlfriend and I, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Perfect location and set up, I highly recommend Kelly and her home. 
7131	2692126	10.0	9.0	55198185	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kelly's garden apartment.  The pictures she posted of the apartment were a true representation of this lovely space.  Kelly met us when we arrived and gave us a tour of the space making us feel totally at home.  The location was was perfect for assessability to Queen Ann shopping and restaurant area as well as downtown Seattle.  We would definitely ask to rent again.
7132	2692126	10.0	9.0	55701174	I enjoyed my stay at Kelly's apartment.  It's more like a 1 bedroom suite at a hotel versus a room since it has a kitchen, living room, and a separate bedroom.  The place is incredibly clean and has all the right extras (bathroom amenities, kitchen supplies, coffee etc.)  I also used the laundry which was very helpful when traveling and while I didn't cook, if you wanted to, the place was fully outfitted with tools and basic ingredients.  I stayed on business and it was very conveniently located but it would be equally convenient if you were visiting Seattle on vacation.  Highly recommended!
7133	2692126	10.0	9.0	56413024	Couldn't have been better.  Rooms well proportioned, kitchen and living room great.  Parking not as much a problem as anticipated, just have to look and walk a little sometimes.  Best part was how clean the home was.  Instructions on how to use TV would have been nice, although we didn't really need it, but for more music if those channels available.  Thanks, md

8502	182716	10.0	10.0	427174	Our stay was perfect.  We had all the privacy we wanted.  The room was comfortable and the breakfast Barb set out each morning had just the right amount of variety and she always set a beautiful breakfast table.

8505	182716	10.0	10.0	478869	"Wow! Barbara and Steve offered friendly hospitality together with a clean and peaceful environment.  Flexible and relaxed, they made us feel like part of the family but offered plenty of privacy as well.  When we came stumbling along their street from the bus stop on the first night, after a long hard day of travel, Steve came down to meet us and see if we needed help with our bags.  That level of consideration and kindness continued throughout our week-long stay.  We enjoyed quiet mornings with coffee by the pond in the backyard, watching birds.  We were free to come and go through our own personal entrance.  

Also, the neighborhood was very convenient and good for walking, with easy transportation to downtown or anywhere we needed to go.

We would recommend Steve and Barb to anyone -- whether you are traveling for business or pleasure, their home is a peaceful retreat for an excellent price."
8506	182716	10.0	10.0	490523	A darling place, run like a B & B.  Barbara had some lovely touches, and wrote notes, making me feel welcome.  It is suited  to 1 person.  Home-made muffins, tarts, good coffee, fresh flowers.

We were in town for our daughters wedding and traveling with our dog.  Both Steve and Barb took the stress out of having to kennel the dog while at the wedding.  Barb even took him to a near-by dog park and jogged with him. They went out of their way to accommodate our dietary needs.  We were very comfortable in their house.

We had our own key and entry so we could come and go as we please. They truly made us feel at home with allowing us to use their kitchen and home. They left us nice Breakfast with fruit, cereal, boiled eggs, PP&J, coffee, and more. Barb even cut us up fresh fruit and put it in containers with our names on them when she found out we're going hiking.

We absolutely recommend Barb and Steve if you dont mind sharing the bathroom. This was not an issue for us. The house was so neat, organized, and clean.

8522	182716	10.0	10.0	1681907	We had a great stay with Barb and Steve in their lovely home in the heart of Wallingford. They were very welcoming and made us feel right at home. We were a little nervous about sharing a bathroom but it really was never a problem. They have a lovely back patio with a beautiful garden and koi pond where we enjoyed our coffee and breakfast each morning. It is a great location to explore North Seattle and is very close to downtown Seattle as well. We enjoyed walking to this funky gelato shop called The Fainting Goat in nearby Wallingford and were super close to several good restaurants. We would definately stay there again! 
8523	182716	10.0	10.0	1931676	"We recently had the pleasure of staying here in Seattle and cannot say enough wonderful things about our hosts!  We were located just close enough to the city and our friends to make getting around incredibly simple.  The accommodations were clean and comfortable along with a lovely selection of breakfast items.  They even inquired regarding our food preferences and made ""our"" coffee for us every morning.  We would highly recommend this as a place to stay in Seattle should you be looking for a comfortable, beautiful, inviting place to stay!  We also loved the turtle!!"

At the same time, they were very helpful if we had questions about anything, needed anything, or just wanted advice or recommendations.  Barb was also very communicative in advance of the trip in order to help us plan.  As for the house itself, we enjoyed the private entrance due to the beautiful garden just outside, as well as the lovely Koi Pond.  Parking on the street outside was very convenient, and they provided a number of basic breakfast amenities for our convenience like fresh coffee, yogurt, fruit, etc., even offering to pick up our favorites!  Finally, my wife says this may have been the most comfortable bed she's ever slept in :)   Thanks Barb and Steve!

Thank you for a great stay!"
8527	182716	10.0	10.0	2780713	Trust me, you want to stay here.   Barb and Steve have obviously been doing this for a while now, and they've perfected the host role.  They are both very friendly and ready to help with practical issues like busses or the location of nearby coffee houses.  The house is immaculate, the guest room is perfectly appointed (empty dresser drawers, a place for your suitcase, a page with all your possible questions already answered...), and the neighborhood is just charming.  The house is easy to reach by public transportation, and there's plenty of room for parking.  As an experienced traveler, I'm highly recommending this accomodation as an excellent value.  They could easily be charging more.
8528	182716	10.0	10.0	3523503	My stay with Barbara was exactly what I was needing for my stay.  Having my own entrance was very convenient and her husband Steve kindly let me put my bike in the garage and they offered lots of great options for breakfast which I was not expecting.  The bed was hugely comfy and the house quiet so yes, all in all I would recommend a stay. Cheers!
8529	182716	10.0	10.0	3918786	Barb and Steve are wonderful hosts.  They are welcoming and friendly and their home is warm and peaceful with lots of natural light and tasteful decor.  The room is comfortable and has its own entry to the back--feels safe and private. The location is wonderful as well--Wallingford is a walkable neighborhood that is close to parks and the zoo as well as great neighborhood restaurants and cafes. A great place to stay!  
8530	182716	10.0	10.0	4522944	Excellent stay with Barbara and Steve.  Room was very quiet, bed was comfortable and there was plenty of parking.  The turtle and fish are a great touch as was watching the local squirrel steal birdfood while eating a light breakfast in the lovely nook that over looks the back yard.  
8531	182716	10.0	10.0	5205906	"Barb is wonderful host and we felt very at home at her place. Barb provided some lovely simple break fast items and was enthusiastic about getting anything we need for our stay.

The room was clean and bright, Barb even put fresh peonies in our room for us to enjoy. There is a small Koi pond with a turtle and koi, it was nice having the door open at night and listening to the water. 

I would definitely recommend anyone to stay with Barb and Steve, they are lovely!"
8532	182716	10.0	10.0	5827076	"Me and my wife enjoyed a lot for the past 8 days in Seattle and a big part of the enjoyment should be credited to Barbara's warm hospitality and hosting during those days we stay in her place. 

Barbara and Steve created a very comfortable environment for us that makes us feel just like staying at home. Barbara provided very good breakfast for us as well. The house is neat with a wonderful garden filled with colorful flowers where we relax ourselves after coming back everyday. Its location is convenient to take the public transportation and close to many major spots. If you don't mind walking you can just go there on food since the neighborhood is also fantastic and very quite. I enjoyed walking around and say hello to people I came across. "
8533	182716	10.0	10.0	5943535	"This was my first Airbnb experience and I can't fault a thing. Barbara and Steve are amazing people and so accommodating. They made us feel very welcome. They laid on a breakfast each morning with fresh fruits, yogurt, bread etc and we could also take it for lunch.

The room is great, with its own private entrance out into the garden - perfect spot for eating your breakfast.

The location was for us perfect as we attended a festival at the Chapel Performance Space which is literally 2 minutes away. Within 5 minutes walk each side you have lots of very nice neighborhood bars and restaurants. 

Thank you Barbara and Steve - it was perfect!"
8534	182716	10.0	10.0	6070055	"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Barb & Steve. They made me feel welcome and were very generous with breakfast. Barb asks food preferences prior to arrival and the had everything I needed to start the day out with healthful breakfast. The  house was charming and immaculate. The koi pond outside the guest room provided a soothing background sound and the beautifully landscaped patio provided a soothing place to enjoy solitude or friends during my stay. Watching the koi, large goldfish and Butcus the 3 legged, 27 yr old turtle was a delight.  
The house is small so if the intimacy of sharing a small space with the owners is uncomfortable for you, this is not the lodgings with the best fit. If you are a light sleeper, the sounds of the owner opening and closing doors in the late night hours could be problematic. 
While the guest room is small, there is plenty of space to lay out and store belongs making it easy to put the suitcase away and feel at home. There are plenty of blankets of varying weight to chose from and Barb fou d a pillow for me that suited my preference.
I would stay with the Parnells again because they are so kind, accommodating,  and generous and the neighborhood and their home has so much appeal  "
8535	182716	10.0	10.0	6300314	Barb and Steve were amazingly gracious hosts. They are such lovely people and we really enjoyed meeting them. In addition the room was immaculate, well decorated, and bright. It opened to a beautiful patio. The breakfast was also very good and had healthy options. Would highly recommend staying with them!   
8536	182716	10.0	10.0	7664577	"It was my first experience with Airbnb and I couldn't have asked for more. Great hosts, perfect accommodation and amenities working exactly as announced. The room with private entrance is ideal and allowed me to come and go without disturbing my hosts.

I had easy access to public transport to everywhere, but sometimes I chose walking rather than catching a bus just to see all the beauty around the neighborhood.

I enjoyed spending some time sitting around the pond. It's impossible not to relax listening to the water or just watching the fishes and the little turtle. As I used to say to Barbara, ""What a wonderful piece of paradise.""

As a foreigner in a different culture you have to learn how to adapt, but Barbara and Steve were extremely kind and understanding during this process, providing me with a lot of information about 
the house, neighborhood and very useful tips regarding Seattle. More than my hosts, they were my friends. I'm eternally greatful for that.
I highly recommend staying Barbara's room to any traveller. "
8537	182716	10.0	10.0	13726066	"I had a wonderful stay in this charming place.

Barbara is a bright and conscientious host; friendly and engaging, but completely respectful of privacy.  I enjoyed chatting with her.

The room is cozy and airy, with a comfortable bed.  I'm a light sleeper, but slept soundly here.

But the real delight is the back patio with koi pond.  The weather was fantastic during my stay, and it was the perfect place to eat breakfast, catch up on work, and read.  The sound of the waterfall also helped lull me to sleep at night.

The private entrance allowed me to feel completely comfortable coming and going as I pleased.

The location was great, too. The 16 bus is just a short walk away and is a 20 minute ride to downtown.  It's a quiet street, but just blocks away from lots of restaurants, shops, an historic cinema.  

Highly recommended!

"
8538	182716	10.0	10.0	13999265	For my first stay with Airbnb, Barb's place has set the bar high.  Barb was a great host, and provided nice details such as:  fresh flowers from the garden; assorted toiletries in case you forget something; and a compendium of Seattle travel info, maps, & bus schedules.  The pillow-top mattress, linens, and bath towels were high quality and comfortable.  The koi pond and back patio are a highlight as you can fall asleep listening to the water or close the slider and hear nothing.  The neighborhood was also quiet and beautiful - walkable to Tangletown, Green Lake, Wallingford CBD, and bus lines to take you to downtown, Ballard, & U-district.  Thank you, Barb, for a very nice stay!
8539	182716	10.0	10.0	14105483	"My daughter and I stayed with Barb while waiting for my son and daughter-in-laws baby to arrive.  It was so wonderful to walk into the peaceful and welcoming garden.  Everything in the house was beautifully set up and comfortable and Barb's kitchen was well supplied with lots of breakfast makings.
The location was an easy 5 minute drive from UW.  I was surprised at how close it was.  Barb was very fast and efficient with every communication and such a thoughtful host."
8540	182716	10.0	10.0	14212904	What a jewel of a find for the Seattle area, where I travel often to visit my son at UW!  The accommodations were better than my wildest expectations, with the room directly accessible and with view of the backyard koi pond.  Staying with Barb has been one of the most tranquil experiences, a respite from the busy hob knowing of the city.  I can spend a whole day doing nothing but sit in her back yard by the pond!  Barb herself is a super host and incredible person.  Certainly, Barb's will be my first choice the next time I am in Seattle.  Hands down!
8541	182716	10.0	10.0	14305004	Barbara is a gracious host with a lovely home in a charming 1920s Seattle neighborhood close to UW. The room looks out on a beautiful backyard through a patio door which also provides private, keyed access. The shared bathroom is bright, and the shared kitchen is stocked with everything needed for coffee and a quick breakfast. Highly recommended.

8543	182716	10.0	10.0	14839409	Barbara met me on the walk in front of her home after I made a short walk from the bus stop.  She oriented me to her neat and very clean house, and I was off to the ballpark.  Returning that night, I had a private entry to the bedroom for a good sleep in a quiet neighborhood.  Each morning, the coffee pot was ready to be turned on.  While the coffee was brewing, I put together a breakfast of fresh fruit, cereal, muffin and yogurt.  Then, after a great in-tub shower, I was off for another day.  Thanks Barbara for a great place to stay.
8544	182716	10.0	10.0	15144382	Barbara was a fantastic hostess and really made me feel at home. Having a private entrance is really nice so you don't feel like you're disturbing the residents if you come home late. The house is lovely and quiet and the location is great. I will not hesitate to stay with her again and will certainly recommend to my friends and family that they consider staying there if they visit Seattle.

Coffee was always set up for the next morning, and there were plenty of healthy choices for breakfast each morning.
The absolute best part of the place is the koi pond in the private patio. It was a peaceful place to relax and recharge, and I could have spent all day there. The neighborhood is a great location for exploring, and convenient to both the U. District, the Zoo, Greenlake and downtown. This was my first stay at an Airbnb, and I think I hit the jackpot. "
8546	182716	10.0	10.0	15827695	"From  the moment we walked into Barbara's house, my daughter and I felt comfortable and welcomed. The house is just charming, and perfectly located in a picture perfect community.  Barbara had Rainier cherries sitting on the nightstand upon our arrival, which was very thoughtful, exemplifying the type of hostess she is.
She was always willing to help us with any questions we had about the city.
We enjoyed the wonderful smoothies she made for us, as well as the other breakfast items she keeps in the kitchen for guests. And yes, her coffee is excellent!
The private entrance to our room was really a nice touch, as well as the total relaxation we felt sipping our coffee in the morning by the Koi pond!
We had some wonderful conversations, and both my daughter and I felt like we had known Barbara for a long time.
We hope to have the delightful opportunity to go back and stay at her home again sometime.
We could not have asked for more from an AirBNB host!!
Thank you, Barbara!

House and garden EXACTLY as pictured, with fabulous waterfall fishpond on ""my"" patio!  Basket full of maps and brochures about Seattle, another basket of toiletries for my use.  Able to do laundry, and come and go as I pleased, but Barbara was available to chatter and offer any needed assistance, including helping to mail my packages home! Unbelievably comfortable ""homecoming"" before I had to head home again!!!  Safe, quiet neighborhood, full of lovely gardens and birdsong.  Easy public transport via SEATAC [LightRail] and Bus #16, which my hostess discovered and sent to me prior to my departure.  Being a senior, the total cost of transport was $2!!!"

10674	3231850	10.0	10.0	14794556	The listing accurately reflected the space.  It was spacious clean and the accommodations were accurately described.  A well designed and thought out layout of the space creates a visually appealing place to stay.  The decorations were very nice with many little finishing touches to make it feel very warm, welcoming and homey.  The host will go above and beyond to make sure all of your needs are met and are just nice people :)  I would surely stay here again if needed in the area and would highly recommend this space to any young couple or individual looking for a cool space to stay in the seattle area.
10675	3231850	10.0	10.0	14890974	The Carriage house is wonderful! The space is larger in person and so incredibly comfortable.

10676	3231850	10.0	10.0	15506938	Wonderful, amazing carriage house. Everything was immaculate and just as the pictures showed it. I would highly recommend staying here -- blocks to Greenlake, coffeeshops, restaurants.
10677	3231850	10.0	10.0	15920860	The carriage house was a beautiful place to relax and work. Jon and his wife have done a great job designing this cozy, well appointed space. You definitely need to be comfortable with climbing a galley ladder to get upstairs, but if you find that fun like we did, I would highly recommend Jon's place.
10678	3231850	10.0	10.0	16210732	Jon & Laurie's carriage is a piece of heaven. Looks exactly like the photos but feels even cozier and more clarifying.

The neighborhood was nice, and even though there was no oven or stove to cook with, there were plenty of great restaurants close by. The stairs to the loft could be difficult for some as they were steep but that was no problem for us.  The bedding was really comfortable.

10680	3231850	10.0	10.0	16476148	"My girlfriend and I had a great time staying at this carriage house.  Jon and Laurie made our stay very comfortable.   Laurie greeted when we first arrived to make sure we have everything thing we needed. The room was cleaned prior to our arrival.  All the necessities were available: bath towel, shampoo, soap, plates, coffee, etc.  

This in essence was better than staying at a hotel room.  This was like our home away from home.  This place also has heated floor in the event the evening gets cold.  We stayed at this cottage for three nights and there are plenty of parking.  We parked right in front of the cottage each time; this beats paying $$$ for hotel parking.

I want to reiterate again that Jon and Laurie were great hosts.  This was my first time using Air BnB and I had great experience.

The Green Lake carriage house is spectacular. The look and feel was comfortable but luxurious and at a very modest price. Incredibly clean, beautifully furnished, and in a prime location. Easy to find and a short drive to downtown, the Green Lake carriage house was perfect.  Jon was very friendly and helpful, and we couldn't have asked for a better house. I can't wait to visit Seattle again, and hopefully this house will be available for us to stay at again!

The neighbourhood is quiet and has some cute shops and restaurants. The park a few blocks away is great too. The space is so modern and clean, and we really loved the little extras they provided. We would definitely stay there again! Thanks Jon and Laurie! 
10687	3231850	10.0	10.0	18005039	My partner and I had such a wonderful time staying at the green lake carriage house! the space was so wonderful. very clean, well thought out, and the location was conveniently located within walking distance to many shops & stores, as well as super close to bus stops to get downtown with ease. Jon and family were wonderful hosts and had everything set up for us before we arrived, and were very helpful with questions and area suggestions. I would definitely stay here again.
10688	3231850	10.0	10.0	18184619	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in August and we absolutely loved it. Upon arriving, Jon and Laurie happened to be home and we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome. Our flight came in a bit early and they were nice enough to accommodate us earlier than the check-in time. The carriage house is amazing- sleek, modern, clean, with an industrial flair, and it had everything we could ever need during our stay. Although the rental is a few steps away from their house, you still get all the privacy you want- no distractions whatsoever. The location is close to the freeway, very accessible to downtown. We had a rental car so we didn't have a problem getting where we wanted to go. The neighborhood of Green Lake is beautiful; we also made sure to visit the lake (which is only a few streets away). I would highly recommend staying here, and will consider it again when I return to Seattle! Thanks Jon and Laurie! :)
10689	3231850	10.0	10.0	18318885	"We enjoyed our stay.  The Carriage house is really beautifully made and  thoughtfully appointed.  Jon and Laurie were so nice, and Jon was very eager to help with any needs.  We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood (some fun homes and nice cafes, etc.) and loved Green Lake; so beautiful and so many options. It was also a fairly convenient location for Seattle/  One caveat for tall people: the shower stall would be problematic for anyone taller than say 6'1"", and tall folks need to remember to bend when passing the beam in the loft. Also, the spare bed (folding down the couch is on the firm side.)"
10690	3231850	10.0	10.0	18537054	The green lake carriage house is a modern loft with all your vacation needs.  The furnishings are comfortable. Jon and his family are wonderful hosts. The neighborhood is close to downtown and has great shops and restaurants of its own.  Many bus routes to downtown are nearby as well.  This rental is perfect for your next trip to Seattle. 
10691	3231850	10.0	10.0	18881204	"The host, Jon Polaha, and his wife were amazingly nice people and definitely made me and my friends feel welcomed and at home. If there was something I had a question about, whether it was about the housing, or something in the area, he would always respond not long after I messaged him. He was also very respectful of our privacy. 

The Carriage House was also very nice, clean, and comfortable. It felt like a little home away from home. They also left a little folder in the room with some very helpful information, like their preferred cafes, restaurants, and grocery stores in the area, most of which were within walking distance, and also some fun activities that we could do in the area. There was even a neighborhood project going on at the time that they had all set up, and my friends and I were openly invited to participate and even come hang out at the block party that followed. It was pretty amazing!

Overall, Jon made our trip to Seattle very pleasant and welcoming. He is a great and friendly guy, and we would all love to come back and visit again. "
10692	3231850	10.0	10.0	19082489	"The carriage house was clean, comfortable, modern, and very well stocked with all of the ""must haves"" that nobody wants to pack but needs. From kitchen supplies to toiletries (and Apple TV!), it was the attention to detail that quickly made this house feel like home.

The location north of downtown was perfect. Close enough to get to eveything ""Seattle"" yet far enough away to escape the hustle and bustle.

We stayed for four nights and truly enjoyed every minute of our stay. Wish we could've stayed longer!"
10693	3231850	10.0	10.0	19199405	Jon was prompt in responding to our inquiries,  and this listing is just what we hoped for in using airbnb.  The house was clean and bright, the neighborhood walkable with things to do nearby, and only minutes from downtown.  We had a great experience! 
10694	3231850	10.0	10.0	19411570	"We had a great time at the carriage house - very clean, fantastic design and surprisingly comfortable! Little details such as USB plugs on the wall, Apple TV and board games in the house made our experience even better. 

Location is great as it's close to I-5 but still in a quiet and lovely neighborhood. We unfortunately couldn't meet Jon in person, but he quickly to reply to all our messages and even let us arrive before our check-in time. 

We truly wish we could have stayed longer. Thanks for everything! "
10695	3231850	10.0	10.0	19676785	My husband and I had a great time in Seattle. Jon's place is really nice. We liked the industrial/ eclectic design he did to the space. The bed is comfy.  We really liked the Little detail they left for us a happy aniversary note and chocolates. Yummy! Great people! Absolutely will stay again. Thanks Jon! ;) 
10696	3231850	10.0	10.0	19937161	My wife and I had an amazing time staying at the Green lake Carriage House. It was even better than we could have imagined! Jon did an amazing job designing and building the place, it was extremely comfortable and so well thought out. Jon and Laurie were so friendly and welcoming and had a ton of recommendations for local restaurants and activities! We can't wait to go back!
10697	3231850	10.0	10.0	20143404	The Carriage House has a beautiful modern loft feel and is a cozy comfortable place to stay. The craftsmanship of the work is impeccable and the place is immaculately clean. Jon is a great host, and I would recommend this property to anyone I know. 
10698	3231850	10.0	10.0	21873103	I had a great time staying at Jon's Green Lake Carriage house! The space was beautifully furnished and warm to the feel. Even the concrete floor was warm to walk on with bare feet. The space was clean and minimalistic, and the tall ceilings made the carriage house seem so big and open. The carriage house served as a great shelter from the wind storm that blasted us on our trip. It was also a great place to rest while I was weathered by a cold. I had a great time staying at the carriage house and hope to revisit again in the future. Thanks Jon for being so responsive with your suggestions and for being concerned. Hope to meet you in person in the future!
10699	3231850	10.0	10.0	22356664	"Very comfortable space, and welcoming host, enjoyed our stay immensely! It was thoughtful of Jon to get a tea maker for the
carriage house."

The Seattle experience was exemplary and this only made it better to come back to after a long day if exploring. 

Amenities we're excellent and I couldn't have asked for a more comfortable bed! 
Thank you again!
Hope to be back soon!
"
10701	3231850	10.0	10.0	22777189	This is a lovely pocket of residential neighborhood in Green Lake. The Carriage House is exactly as described and photographed. I'm sure that Jon has a lot of love, sweat, and tears in this little place. The craftsmanship and modern furnishings are all really nice, simple, minimal. It's a small place, good for 1 or 2 agile guests. I LOVE the radiant heated concrete floors and the keyless entry. Street parking is easy. Jon is very accessible and responsive via phone or text if you need anything. I'd stay here again with pleasure!
10702	3231850	10.0	10.0	22996099	My husband and I spent two nights here. It was an AMAZING stay. We stayed in November when Seattle starts to get pretty cold, but the place was very warm. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. Altogether, this place was very warm, cozy and clean. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!
10703	3231850	10.0	10.0	23157400	Amazing house and great area!  Very clean and open feel. Perfect Seattle getaway. 
10704	3231850	10.0	10.0	23878840	Jon and his family were amazing hosts! The apartment is so well crafted and designed and is exactly what you see in the beautiful pictures...It is so cozy there with 3 walking distance restaurant areas plus a Whole foods...it was an ideal week for me. They looked after me when they thought a winter storm might cause a power outage and were proactive to make sure the floor heating system was at a temperature that suited me...such kind, considerate and caring people.  The care Jon put into creating the apartment is what you get with your stay but with plenty of privacy as well. I will definitely go back. If you're a foodie, check out Mkt. (walking distance), Delancey and the Fat Hen (both a short drive around Green Lake). Parking was easy on the street and neighborhood was super safe and had a great vibe. Thank you both for making my stay a perfect experience!
10705	3231850	10.0	10.0	24065533	Our experience at the carriage house was just wonderful! Jon and his wife were extremely accommodating and helpful. We had everything we needed - the space is gorgeous, well stocked and very comfortable. The heated floors were awesome as was the Apple TV. We would definitely stay again! Thanks Jon ! 
10706	3231850	10.0	10.0	24945535	Stayed here for 4 nights with my girlfriend and could not have had a better time!  The space was very clean, well designed, and quiet.  The location provides easy access to all of the neighborhoods in Seattle.  I would love to stay here again, it was a fantastic experience.  Thanks!
10707	3231850	10.0	10.0	25097146	Though we didn't get to meet, Jon was a great host-- my fiance and I were late in checking in and he texted to check in with us and make sure we were getting in okay. They had a folder full of smartly-written recommendations and information, and Seattle guidebooks-- they're clearly thorough and thoughtful. The space is gorgeous-- love the radiant heating through the floors and the airy view from the loft. The ladder is a little treacherous in the dark, but if you have your wits about you you're all right. Bed is super comfy, shower is delightful. Love this space. We had hoped to do a little cooking until we realized that the place doesn't have a stove or oven (which of course aren't essentials), so be mindful of that, I guess. But we'd love to stay here again. A beautiful spot. 
10708	3231850	10.0	10.0	25301586	Jon's well-constructed and modernist abode was the perfect locale for preparing for trial in a great neighborhood.  Close to Greenlake and Ravenna, the space was quiet, with great acoustics for playing guitar or listening to music.  It had a quite comfortable bed and very nice heated floor that kept everything nice and warm.  Jon's place is a great place to stay for a couple or a single traveler and Jon is friendly and communicative.  Highly recommended.
10709	3231850	10.0	10.0	25627594	Our second stay at the Carriage House and it was again perfect. The accommodations are sparkling clean and well designed and the location is great. Jon even allowed our friends to put in a welcome basket before our arrival. Very nice!
10710	3231850	10.0	10.0	26213071	Awesome modern home. Great location for food and coffee. Jon is cool who recommended plenty of places to visit.
10711	3231850	10.0	10.0	26522271	Jon was very considerate and accommodating. He checked in with us and was easily accessible via phone or Airbnb messages. Check-in was very easy because they have a keypad entry. The house was very well kept and tidy; exactly as the photos portray. He has a folder of different things to do in the area, restaurants, and grocery stores that are within walking distance which was very helpful. They had an Apple TV and a small kitchenette. There is no stove but that wasn't really a problem for us. We would definitely love to stay here again if we get a chance and would recommend it to anyone visiting the area!
10712	3231850	10.0	10.0	26967353	We loved it! The house is beautiful and well designed. The loft was fun and there was a surprising amount of space. Parking was easy and the code to get in the house made arriving very convenient. We went to Cafe Lulu and got tasty egg bagels, walked around Green Lake, and bought a few groceries at Whole Foods. We had a nice and relaxing weekend.
10713	3231850	10.0	10.0	27114706	I loved Jon's Carriage house! The loft is very clean, spacious with really cool modern interior design. Jon is a great host, he was quick to respond to my msgs and questions. I would definitely love to stay here next time I visit Seattle and I would recommend this place to anyone.
10714	3231850	10.0	10.0	27215175	Thank you Jon! This was the perfect space for a short getaway. Everything was exactly as pictured and super clean. We loved the design and decor. Comfortable and relaxing it was great to come back to each night. Jon was great at communicating with us. He even suggested an amazing spa (banya 5) that we visited twice in 4 days! The Apple TV is an added bonus as well as the heated floors. Again thank you so much and we would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle. 
10715	3231850	10.0	10.0	27412859	The carriage house was a perfect place to sleep and rest after hanging out in Seattle all day.  The house was very clean and put together, making us feel comfortable and relaxed.  Thanks for the great experience!
10716	3231850	10.0	10.0	27522612	My host was great. Description is totally accurate. Super nice space. Immaculately kept. Very relaxing. Prime location to everything...food, downtown, surrounding cool neighborhoods, freeway, Green Lake...very central location. Well done!
10717	3231850	10.0	10.0	27660407	"I could not have had a better trip to Seattle, and it was in huge part to my stay at Jon's carriage house. The neighborhood is gorgeous. Tree-lined streets, the lake just blocks away, and plenty of restaurants, coffee, shops, donuts, bars, and everything in less than a 10 minute walk in any direction. It was an absolutely perfect landing spot for my 4-day trip.

The carriage house itself was impeccable. You could tell Jon poured his heart and soul into the renovation and creation of this inspiring space. Perfect decor, beautiful construction, and every amenity you'd need for a small space. The windows throughout let in a great breeze, the bathroom and shower was perfect, and WiFi was easy and fast. Apple TV and the stocked up coffee in the kitchen made for great added bonuses. The bed was super comfortable and waking up in the loft was so sunny and delightful. Even though you're on the same property as their family, it was private, easy access, and could enjoy the yard too on a nice day.

I'd HIGHLY recommend a stay here, my first trip to the PNW couldn't have been better if I tried, and the carriage house made it all the more."
10718	3231850	10.0	10.0	28219916	Jon is really nice and their house is perfect for 2 person to stay! Easy to park! If i have friend come to seattle i will stay here again!
10719	3231850	10.0	10.0	28495803	The carriage house was awesome and exactly as pictured. New and clean and private. We did not meet Jon but felt welcome all the same. Very easy to check in. The neighborhood was great, an easy walk to restaurants and Greenlake. We would definitely stay there again!
10720	3231850	10.0	10.0	28789252	Jon and family were wonderfully helpful in all our communications. The carriage house is beautiful and luminous (if you are planning to sleep in, bring your sleep mask!! ). The neighborhood is convenient and comfortable. 
10721	3231850	10.0	10.0	29837400	Great host.  Great place.  It will be at the top of my list when I need a place in Seattle.  Everything is exactly as pictured and described, and it is a quick walk to greenlake.  Highly recommended.
10722	3231850	10.0	10.0	30408634	"Walking through the door for the first time at the Green Lake Carriage House, we saw that the space was indeed as beautiful as it is in the pictures. It was bright and airy and smelled as fresh and clean as it looked. While it is a small space, we never felt like it was too small. It is well appointed and it's obvious that a great deal of care has gone into the design and decor.  
We were in Seattle for just a few days to celebrate our anniversary. Jon, Laurie, and Calder left us a handmade ""happy anniversary"" card along with some delicious local salted caramel truffles... yum! Speaking of treats, returning from our outings and adventures to relax in such a wonderful space really helped to make our mini-vacation feel like a real treat. We felt like we could make ourselves at home here. As we prefer to be independent and fairly self-sufficient guests, it was wonderful that we didn't have to ask Jon and Laurie for anything that we needed; it was all there. 
A few more points:
-The location was perfect for us. It is within walking distance of Green Lake and several eateries. It's also a nicely walkable neighborhood. We were grateful, however, that we rented a car since there was so much more that we wanted to see and do. The location of the Carriage House was a great launching point.
-The ladder to the loft can seem a bit intimidating, but it seems to be super sturdy and we had no problems navigating it. 
-The brightness that is otherwise such a wonderful aspect can be a bit ferocious when the morning light comes pouring through the unshaded upstairs window. We dashed out to Target to buy some of those luxuriously padded eye masks. Problem solved.
-We happened to be in Seattle during and unseasonably warm week. While there is no cooling system in the space, we found that with opening the windows and using the oscillating fan to move the air around, we were able to stay mostly comfortable. 
-We loved our stay here and highly recommend it!"
10723	3231850	10.0	10.0	31578618	"John and Laurie were very warm and welcoming.  We got in late, but Jon had already forwarded instructions on the door entry (very easy), so we just settled in.  The Carriage House is just as pictured on AirBnB - deceptively roomy, yet cozy.  The kitchen is pared down but quite sufficient, since there are so many places to eat in Seattle.   The loft was beautifully done with a series of windows at both the head and foot of the bed for excellent circulation.  

It was the little things that really impressed me; I was initially concerned that I may have packed too lightly, and would regret having left a few essentials behind.  But Jon and Laurie had thought of everything - I found a hairdryer, market bag and umbrella at my disposal in the Carriage House.    

This was my first stab at AirBnB, and I would gauge it a success.  We will definitely stay at the Carriage House again when in Seattle, and recommend it to others without reservation.

10724	3231850	10.0	10.0	31849606	We had a wonderful experience at the Green Lake Carriage House! It's notably evident how much time, effort and passion John has put into the design and functionality of the building. We were very impressed and comfortable the entire time. Super welcoming and beautiful neighbourhood. John and Laurie were also a pleasure to talk to and very accommodating with suggesting activities and places to eat/ see. Highly recommended!
10725	3231850	10.0	10.0	32335856	"This listing was exactly what myself and two other friends needed - a great place to crash that was affordable and close to everything we wanted to check out! Oh, and the neighborhood is beautiful which was a huge PLUS!

Jon was very accommodating and let us check in earlier than usual which worked out great!

We weren't in the carriage house much, but we enjoyed the space and it was definitely nice to come back to when we needed a break from the plethora of things to do in the area and all the rest of the city.

Whole Foods was about 10 minutes walking, freeway access less than 5 minutes and just down the street, an awesome sandwich shop right around the corner, and Jon was right about parking on the street being a piece of cake!

Would we stay here again? YES. Highly recommended for sure!

10726	3231850	10.0	10.0	32584511	This is a wonderful, light, open space in a quiet neighborhood that felt very safe and comfortable. The location is perfect for walking and driving access to everything, especially Green Lake! I would definitely make this my go-to for Seattle!!
10727	3231850	10.0	10.0	32971801	My sister and I enjoyed a wonderful Seattle vacation at the Green Lake Carriage House. Jon and his lovely family were very friendly and helpful though not intrusive and promptly provided directions and answered all our questions.  The Carriage House is beautifully designed and spotlessly clean and is located in a trendy residential area within walking distance to appealing neighborhood restaurants; bus stop is less than a block away. The loft space might make this best suited for young hipsters, but this old hipster was glad she got to stay at such a cool place before her knees refused to get her up the steep ladder-like stairs. All in all, a fun and unique experience we very much enjoyed.
10728	3231850	10.0	10.0	33456606	"I had a great experience at the carriage house.  Jon and his wife were friendly and welcoming and the carriage house was exactly as it is pictured.  I loved the location (lots of local bars and restaurants within walking distance) to so many things as well as great access to bus lines.

I travel to Seattle often for work and would happily book the carriage house again."
10729	3231850	10.0	10.0	33727618	Can't say enough about how beautiful and well taken care of this house is.  Jon's description, if anything, wasn't enough to accurately describe how lovely of a stay we'd have.  Truly enjoyed not only the loft, the care to detail, and the location, but Jon really went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and logistically set.
10730	3231850	10.0	10.0	34127233	This was a great place to stay. The door lock pin is prearranged check in access is easy. The place is spot on like the photos and is very clean. Jon did a great job with the industrial styling and build quality.

Jon, I think we stole on of your ""welcome"" pages by accident!  They were so useful that it was on the table and was collected and put away with my work papers.  Sorry!  Hope to see you next we are in town!"
10733	3231850	10.0	10.0	39756520	The Green Lake Carriage house we perfect for our weekend trip to Seattle. Jon was excellent, replying quickly to our questions and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. 
10734	3231850	10.0	10.0	40206600	"My experience staying in this home/apt was absolutely fantastic!  Jon made me feel very welcome and provided excellent detailed information about the space and its neighborhood.  Off-street parking was nice and just a few steps away from the apartment.  

As a former Seattle resident, the neighborhood was one I was not very familiar with, so I was very appreciative to Jon for providing helpful details of what the neighborhood has to offer: a lot, while being close to downtown and other desirable locations with the city.  

I read several positive reviews about this offering and I would agree with everyone who provided favorable feedback.

I highly recommend this space and hope to stay there on any future visits to the area.

Thank you Jon,

Jon was great at communicating on location and taking our comfort into account.  
One warning: shower is not meant for anyone over 6', but you can make it work if you try! "
10736	3231850	10.0	10.0	41364542	This was the perfect airbnb experience!  Wow.  The Carriage house is even cooler than the photos.  Jon was an excellent host: responsive, helpful, and generous (local fresh fruit waiting for us!).  Great location in Seattle.  Everything ran super smoothly.  I can't recommend this rental highly enough!
10737	3231850	10.0	10.0	43045279	The carriage house is awesome! Whenever my mom comes to Seattle to visit, this is her go-to spot. It is super clean and very comfortable. LOVE the Apple TV. Green Lake is an awesome neighborhood- a lot of good food. The carriage house is jus a 10 minute walk from the park which is one of the most frequented parks in the country! Close to the U-District, Wallingford, and Fremont. Also one of the most affordable places you can stay in Seattle. 
10738	3231850	10.0	10.0	43545835	Jon's guesthouse is the nicest and most unique place to find on Airbnb. It's beautifully built and just as great as it looks in the pictures. He's stocked it with all the amenities you could want, which came handy when we needed bags for sandwiches. We used his guesthouse as our home base for hiking in Mt Rainier and it worked perfectly. It's off the University of Washington exit and has parking available in the driveway. Jon and his family live next door and are super friendly and helpful.
10739	3231850	10.0	10.0	44470667	This is a great place to stay in Seattle! Jon provides a well appointed private carriage house in quiet Green Lake neighborhood. Zoka coffee is a 5 minute walk and great way to start your day with a local Seattle coffee shop experience, and there are several excellent dining options in the vicinity as well. You'll most likely want to rent a car for your stay if you plan to get out and do some sightseeing. 
10740	3231850	10.0	10.0	45365080	Once again my friends and I chose to stay here at the Green Lake Carriage House while we attend PAX Prime 2015, and again we absolutely loved our stay! Since our last stay, there has been some nice improvements to the house, including a nice closet with coat rack to better store our clothes during our stay. I honestly didn't think our stay could have been better than it was last year, but it was! Unfortunately, because of our schedules, we did not get to spend too much time in the neighborhood as most of our time was spent in Seattle, but we did get a small chance to chat with our hosts on the way back to the house one afternoon. We really enjoy the lovely neighborhood, amazing hosts, and awesome housing. Already we are looking forward to coming back to stay here again next year!
10741	3231850	10.0	10.0	45958399	"This was one of my favorite experiences while traveling.  The neighborhood is beautiful!  Very suburban but only about 10-15 minutes from downtown.  They have the coolest dragonfly mural on the street which made me smile every time I saw it.  Walking to breakfast (The Butcher and the Baker and Cafe LuLu) and to Green Lake was very easy.  
The place itself is exactly how it looks.  Clean, modern, and incredible.   Sitting on the couch and looking around at the craftsmanship was breath taking.  The place also had everything I needed (umbrella, iron, scissors).  Clean and quaint!  Also the lock pad was very efficient.  The house is easy to find from the street.
Overall staying here felt like living in Seattle.  Jon and his family are nice, helpful, and welcoming.  Very gracious hosts.  Next time I go back to Seattle I'll be looking this place up again! "
10742	3231850	10.0	10.0	46740668	"Had a fantastic stay here with my fianc√© on our weeklong trip to Seattle.  We chose this place because of the location, reviews, and the pictures. The images were spot on.  It's a very cozy and charming place to spend a few nights while exploring Seattle and surrounding areas.  Really impressive that Jon built everything himself!  Felt very reminiscent of our stays in Sweden with the clean and modern architectural designs.  Loved all the natural light coming in through the skylights and all the windows throughout the carriage house.  We stayed here during the summer but imagine it would be great during the rainy season to see the rain pitter patter from all the different window locations.  Also, would be an excellent time to read through the classic book selection in the loft and play a couple board games in the TV media console.  (The place is well equipped for any season!)

Jon is super nice and informative.  We corresponded with him via email during our stay and met him in person on our last day.  He is as cordial and personable in person as he is via email.  Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely return when we have the chance!"

The house make me good memory about Seattle! Thank you alot :) "
10744	3231850	10.0	10.0	48076334	This was my second stay at Jon's carriage house, and it was just as magical as the first. The location, and the surrounding neighborhood can't be beat. An easy walk to a few different areas of bars/restaurants, as well as beautiful Green Lake. It's so peaceful inside the carriage house, and the bed/linens throughout are awesome. It was a great advantage to have a driveway spot to park our car as well. Next time we're in Seattle, we will absolutely be staying at Jon's place again, no question about it!
10745	3231850	10.0	10.0	48753859	We felt very welcome, we were greeted when we arrived. Everything we could have needed was provided, including some great recommendations for the neighborhood. Speaking of the neighborhood, it was such a great quintessential Seattle location! It was also convenient to anything we wanted to do. 
10746	3231850	10.0	10.0	49432877	"LOFT:
I feel like I lucked out finding this charming little loft!   It was the perfect space for me & my husband.  (Cozy and still Roomy)  It really was one of the most charming spots we have ever stayed.    I loved how the upstairs bedrooms windows where in the perfect spot to let in natural light and listen to the raindrops.  (Relaxing).  
The location was super convenient.  

LOCATION:
We felt like we were close to enough to the city, to pop in and out of main Seattle.  But far enough to have some peace & quite.   The neighborhood felt very safe and walkable.   The loft itself is located near some great bars and dining spots (Lantana, Tornado, Pies & pints!)
Jon was easy to reach & very helpful!!!!  We enjoyed having the brief chat with him about how he built the loft (you can tell it‚Äôs a labor of love)

IN CLOSING:
Loved everything about this cute Airbnb!  We definitely want t stay here again on our next Seattle (website hidden):
Thank you Jon for being such  great Host!

10747	3231850	10.0	10.0	51318017	My husband and I stayed here and it was perfect for our adventurous stay in Seattle. The place is cozy, clean and has everything you need. The windows and natural light make the place even more comfortable. The location is great as well. There's a bus stop for downtown literally right around the corner as well as restaurants, cafes and a pub down the street from the Carriage House. I recommend Cafe Lulu for a quick breakfast and coffee! The neighborhood and house is so charming. Would definitely recommend! 
10748	3231850	10.0	10.0	51676328	"The carriage house is such a great place to stay in! Comfy bed, great area to sit and work in, and lovely hosts! I totally needed this place and got what i needed! Great for one or two people, and is exactly as it is described. 

And i loved meeting the kid for a little chat, what a great guy!

Good Luck J&L!

10749	3231850	10.0	10.0	52081341	The place was so clean and quiet. It has everything you need. The keyless entry is convenient too. It's a great neighborhood. 
10750	3231850	10.0	10.0	52983812	This is by far the best Airbnb I have stayed in since using the site for about 4yrs!  It was nice, cozy and pretty amazing at how Jon utilized the space with modern decorating.  No complaints at all, the location to food was great and within walking distance.  15min Uber ride to downtown but the close eateries provided enough for my entertainment.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle, in fact this is where I'm staying next time I return.
10751	3231850	10.0	10.0	53336415	We had a great time staying at the Carriage house. It is the coolest modern design you will see anywhere and a fantastic break from the regular hotel room or renovated basement. Everything about it is well designed and thought out. It is also on a great location that is close to lots of things. Good local coffee and eating places 5 minute walk away. UW is only 10 min away.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet with the coolest dragonfly mural painted on a T intersection down the street. But I have to focus on the great loft apartment design. If you stay here you will never forget it. It's one of a kind. 
10752	3231850	10.0	10.0	53776880	This place is great! Good location - the neighborhood is cute and it's a quick and convenient drive to downtown. Jon and his family were super friendly. Perfect spot! 
10753	3231850	10.0	10.0	53977330	"Great communication with Jon. Perfectly described accomodations. Beautiful touches and a fun vibe.
Nicely done!"
10754	3231850	10.0	10.0	55654808	The Carriage House was an awesome place to stay for our anniversary! The location is really great, it's close enough to Seattle to get in and out of downtown relatively quickly (even in rush hour). In the neighborhood, there are a lot of good eats walking distance or just a few minutes drive. The house provided a great, quiet getaway from hustle and bustle. The house itself is the perfect size for 1-2 people, anymore than that would have been too crowded. We really enjoyed where the bed is, it feels like you're in a tree house! Overall, it was a great spot and I would recommend it. 
10755	3231850	10.0	10.0	55788256	We had another wonderful stay at The Carriage House. The place is modern & perfect, and Jon is a wonderful, responsive host. The city is easily accessible and there are many great restaurants nearby. Looking forward to our next stay! 
10756	3231850	10.0	10.0	56349551	Jon and his wife were very gracious hosts.  Jon was able to accommodate my husband and I in his carriage house on very short notice.  The carriage house in itself is amazing!  It's just so cool with a sort of modern industrial vibe and it was very fun to stay there.  The neighborhood has a few excellent restaurants as well.  We had a great stay.  
10757	3231850	10.0	10.0	57571492	Wonderful house and wonderful host! Jon is a kind and friendly host.I love this house so much that I will live again next time!
11260	3652434	10.0	10.0	21264531	Angelica and her husband are the best hosts you can wish for. They do everything to make your stay unforgettable. We had a very nice welcome. They are very interested and they tell you everything you need to know about the city. The room is very nice and pretty. You have the whole floor to yourself and everything is very clean. 
11261	3652434	10.0	10.0	21646904	Angelica was such a lovely host! Her place is really nice and comfortable with a great view of the water and city. Delicious breakfast too.
11262	3652434	10.0	10.0	22386111	"Angelica was away during my four-day stay but Randy and Frida (an irresistibly friendly middle-aged Golden Retriever) proved the perfect host and hostess. The ""City Life Views"" lived up to their billing and I enjoyed the nearby biking and hiking trails and the proximity to the U District.  Randy made me feel like a truly welcome guest in his home and every time I followed one of his suggestions as to local restaurants or points of interest, I was glad I had. I wholeheartedly recommend this listing and would be glad to stay there again. "
11263	3652434	10.0	10.0	22514105	"I'm hesitant to do a positive review because right now I really want to book at least 4 days a week (weekdays) every week until I find a permanent place because it's 1 block from my office, but I feel I have to. 

Angelica and Randy are amazing people and Frita is exactly what you'd expect - awesome dog. 

Breakfast of the week  ""Quiche biscuits and Greek yogurt"" 

Finally and really important - this bed you'll be sleeping on is AWESOME!!!!!!!"
11264	3652434	10.0	10.0	22611304	"What a wonderful place to stay in a new city! Angelica was great with logistics and setup, and very flexible on when we could check-in. As soon as we arrived at their beautiful home we found a wonderful space and fresh grapes and chocolate waiting for us. The bedroom, bathroom, and living room were straight out of a magazine, and there was a great view of the skyline and the Space Needle. The bed was one most comfortable either of us had ever slept in, and Angelica and Randy had delicious breakfast and strong coffee waiting for us. They were both gracious hosts, and were very helpful with offering us suggestions on where to go and what to see while we were there (hint: check out Ballard). They offered plenty of maps and guidebooks, as well as some local publications with ""best of"" lists. They gave us the rundown on the best Farmer's Markets in the area, and sent us off with a smile. This place will be our first choice the next time we're in Seattle. "
11265	3652434	10.0	10.0	22912876	Angelica and Randy were absolutely wonderful hosts and provided us with exactly what we needed: a great location, a comfortable bed (memory foam) , suggestions of places to see and eat, tasty morning coffee and breakfast, and overall hospitality. The view from their home is great and close to just about anything. The upstairs area is really accommodating and open feeling. Thank you for having us Angelica! 
11266	3652434	10.0	10.0	23223545	"Was looking for a central location to show a friend around Seattle and Angelica's Top Floor sounded promising. And from the prompt replies and thoughtful inquiry about food allergies she made the welcome as seamless as an exclusive resort.
Was exactly as described with the whole top floor to ourselves so as to enjoy our privacy, or  amble downstairs to socialize with Randy and play with Freda, the best Golden Retriever in Wallingford! Great walkable area with safe quiet streets and the Burke Gilman Trail down the block.
Cool little restaurant down on the shore that has an outdoor fire pit.
My friend commented on how comfortable she felt when Randy brought up breakfast in his pjs. Both were really laid back yet fully aware of our presence.  Thanks Angelica and Randy AND Freda! for a most relaxing weekend.
Will be returning soon and recommending this   gem to visiting friends/family.
Mike"
11267	3652434	10.0	10.0	23401110	"The space was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Bed was equally comfortable, and Angelica was very nice and we lacked for nothing. We would have liked a television, but two nights without Letterman won't hurt.
We enjoyed our stay very much."
11268	3652434	10.0	10.0	23487002	This place is perfect for anyone traveling through Seattle. We needed a place to stay for a night before the Seattle Marathon, and this was a wonderful choice. The place is gorgeous and private, but we were also made to feel at home with our guests. The bed was really comfortable, everything was very clean and organized, and the location is excellent. We were able to take a bus downtown just a few blocks away from their place. Angelica is very friendly, and made this AirBnB experience unforgettable.
11269	3652434	10.0	10.0	23710894	"From the moment we arrived, Angelica made us feel welcome! She accommodated us with an early arrival and then later on, when I asked about a cup of coffee, she made a delicious espresso for my wife and I! The bedroom and entire top floor has wonderful views and southern exposure which allowed lovely light to stream in. 

After a relaxing afternoon, we were off to our Ball and didn't get home till about midnight. Having the front door code made coming back late easy. The bed, oh the bed! My wife fell in love with the adjustable (motor driven by remote control) tempurpedic bed. She loved slipping under the sheets with the gentle massage lulling her asleep! 

Angelica had set up a cool little vietnamese coffee set so I could make excellent coffee when I woke up. I enjoyed the views and the quiet morning while my wife slept in. The WiFi is free and fast and they have a great little travel book library to peruse as well. The next delight was the tasty breakfast prepared by Angelica. Fresh fruit, yogurt, and organic juice (orange and carrot mixed - delish!) was all really good. However, the special treat was the warm little french toast rolls with candied walnuts that tasted like mini cinnamon rolls! Her husband, Randy, was more than willing to share his recipe secret with us. :)  Oh, and another great espresso shot to start the day!

The private bathroom is well appointed with great little shelves to put your things on. The shower itself was a very nice rain shower type head that felt like a thick, hot waterfall as it cascaded over me. 

It is fun to stare out the windows at the passing boat traffic down below. You can see the downtown lights and even the Christmas tree on top of the Space Needle. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and we parked either in their driveway or across the street during our stay. Their dog is super chill and very sweet. Not a peep and totally cool with us as guests coming in and out of the front door when unloading or loading our bags.

All and all, we had a wonderfully relaxing time in Angelica and Randy's warm home! They are fantastic hosts and we look forward to staying with them again in the future!"
11270	3652434	10.0	10.0	23883864	Amazing as always!
11271	3652434	10.0	10.0	24534035	Had a great stay with Angelica & Randy. The place was exactly as photographed and had a very comfortable bed. The hosts were very friendly and we were even invited to join  them for a drink in their kitchen one evening, which we gladly accepted & enjoyed. They also provided awesome breakfast & helpful pointers for our visit. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.
11272	3652434	10.0	10.0	24620795	Angelica and Randy were delightful hosts. Everything else you read about their hospitality is spot on. In addition, the neighborhood where they are located is a neat little part of town within walking distance to Ballard, Fremont, and Udub. If we ever come to Seattle again, we won't hesitate to book a stay with Angelica and Randy :)
11273	3652434	10.0	10.0	24880018	Super cute living area and bedroom. Very close to a great part of town and downtown. We had a great time and Angelica and Randy were so wonderful! Absolutely great experience all around!
11274	3652434	10.0	10.0	25239918	"Angelica and Randy are wonderful hosts.  The top floor room has a wonderful view that I enjoyed the entire stay.  This neighborhood is in the heart of Seattle-right by Lake Union, Fremont and UW areas.  Restaurants bike and jogging paths are plentiful and within walking distance. Parking was very easy in the neighborhood and always plentiful.

Anglelica was nice enough to make a nice breakfast with delicious coffee each morning.  I was even joined by their wonderful golden retriever, Frieda a couple times--very sweet dog and a nice bonus!

The bed was incredibly comfortable!  I slept amazing every night.  I would highly recommend staying here."
11275	3652434	10.0	10.0	25395344	I just had a quick 2 day trip in Seattle for work, but even in the short time I really appreciated Angelica's place as base camp. It's just what you would expect from the positive reviews. The house is right on the Burke-Gilman Trail (great if you're a runner), within walking distance of Gas Works Park, and in the hip neighborhood of Wallingford. Angelica is a wonderful host, she goes above and beyond by making a delicious breakfast available to her guests. The hosts were also very  respectful of my space - I had a whole upstairs suite available. 
11276	3652434	10.0	10.0	25532954	"Angelica's space was beautiful and comfortable. I was only there for one night and being quite tired from traveling and interviewing, I didn't explore too much of the area, which is why all the napping and sleeping I did on the oh-so comfortable bed, was even more of an added plus. 

Although the name of this site is air bed and breakfast, I've rarely had breakfast included in my stays. Angelica's place was different for this very reason. She presented me with a gourmet breakfast and even made it dairy and gluten free due to my dietary restrictions. Absolutely amazing-her delicious fare and the fact that she made me breakfast and made me something on my diet!! 

Angelica and her husband also offered all sorts of ideas for settling into Seattle once I've moved, which was very helpful. All in all, a great stay."
11277	3652434	10.0	10.0	25614515	Me and my husband were at Angelica's place for a week and we are super happy with the experience. The room is great and it has an amazing view! The breakfast they served us every morning was really good and the neighborhood is very pretty and close to everything. But the best part of our stay was the fact that we got to meet this great couple that is Angelica and Randy and their super cute dog, Frida! They were super nice to us and helped us with everything we needed. We could not be happier with our choice!
11278	3652434	10.0	10.0	26122349	Angelica was an awesome host, she did a great job making me feel welcome at her home after a very long day of traveling. Despite being 13 hours later than my expected time she stayed up to make sure I found the right place. I appreciated her also having a beer and pizza waiting for me as I came in. Honestly wish more AirBnb hosts were like Angelica as this little act helped make my trip much more enjoyable! Very clean apartment with very comfortable bed and if coming back to Seattle again would not hesitate to book with Angelica again!
11279	3652434	10.0	10.0	26278538	"Angela was an incredible host, going above and beyond what I would have expected. To illustrate --- one evening, I had a work emergency when my laptop broke down, and she generously lent me one of hers to finish a project on! I am forever grateful for that. 

The space (all of the 2nd floor is yours) is also beautiful and very welcoming. Clean, comfortable, and all the amenities if you need them (hair products/tools, toiletries, etc). You are just a minute walk away from a fantastic trail that takes you along the water all the way to a gorgeous view at Gas Works park. Also a nice walk to the U-district as well. I would absolutely stay here again when I'm back in town."
11280	3652434	10.0	10.0	26473271	Angelica and Randy (and Frida the retriever!) were excellent hosts, dealing with last minute booking, being flexible with check in timing, and then being fabulously welcoming and relaxed.  The space has an absorbing view across the water, and feels very comfortable.  Breakfast options and service was special, and I had great chats with all.  I would highly recommend a visit and will be back.
11281	3652434	10.0	10.0	26484141	Angelica and here husband were extremely gracious and welcoming!  Their home is beautiful, in a perfect location which is quiet enough but still very close to 'the action.'  I would recommend this to anyone!
11282	3652434	10.0	10.0	26552434	The neighborhood was nice.  The suite of rooms was quiet and comfortable, with great views.  It was an added touch to have breakfast provided.  
11283	3652434	10.0	10.0	26621148	Angelica was so nice! She responded quickly and anticipated our arrival at our convenience. She was very welcoming and very kind to us and our dog. The loft-lounge area didn't have a door but the bedroom did and it was all very private. The breakfast was super yummy and a definite treat especially since she brought it up to us. We were very glad to have stayed at such a cute place with a great view. 
11284	3652434	10.0	10.0	27009212	The B & B at City View just ideal for a single person or a couple wanting to stay in the north end of Seattle, and close to the trendy districts of Fremont, Ballard and the University district. Angelica is the perfect hostess, and the place is charming - bright, open and airy, and the bed is super comfy. Breakfast was delicious, and was just the right amount - I left completely satisfied without feeling like I had been stuffed to the ears with carbs and sugar. And finally Frieda, the canine hostess, is equally as welcoming! If I ever need a place to stay in Seattle again, this place will be a the top of my list.
11285	3652434	10.0	10.0	27152121	We stayed 2 nights and felt right at home in the elegantly decorated suite. Angelica and Randy (and their dog Frida) are wonderful hosts who made us feel right at home, and the breakfast they brought up each morning was a great way to start the day. Highly recommended.
11286	3652434	10.0	10.0	27236608	A super comfortable suite, located meters from Lake Union, and hosted by an uber cool couple. Angelica and Randy are warm and welcoming, and quite knowledgeable in their world travels. For runners, Cheshiahud Loop is runner friendly and takes you through several neighborhoods. Just look out for bikers zooming by!
11287	3652434	10.0	10.0	27368796	My husband and I had a wonderful stay with Angelica and her husband, Randy.   Great location for restaurants and walks, close to the Fremont shopping area, and available street parking.  Highlights:  the bed and  pillows (temperpedic!),  an excellent shower,  plenty of space to relax, and a fabulous view.   Angelica made us feel very welcome  and at ease.  We highly recommend this listing.
11288	3652434	10.0	10.0	27687662	This was a lovely place to stay for 3 nights.  Great breakfasts, bed and bath.  Angelica and Randy were very gracious hosts.  Recommended! Thanks.
11289	3652434	10.0	10.0	27815522	"Our hosts did everything they could to make us comfortable.  The bed and bathroom were cozy, clean and comfy.  The living area opens up to hosts' living area so we were always aware that we could be disturbing them if we made too much noise.  At one point my son made us all laugh so much that i was worried we would get kicked out.  It was late in the evening.   Same issue in that to get to the bedroom we had to pass thru shared front hallway of hosts.  
 There was a fridge but no way to heat water so I tried to make some bedtime  tea with  tap water, ugh.   Offered waffles for breakfast but surprised to see eggos on my plate, had not seen them on my plate since my son was a toddler.   Most B&Bs make something special or signature for breakfast.  Basically a friendly clean cozy comfy place with shared experience, nice hosts,  basic amenities.  
It was very handy to my son's home in Wallingford.  Son jogged back and forth to visit, we drove.  "
11290	3652434	10.0	10.0	28043599	"We were made to feel so welcome and comfortable during our weekend stay. Angelica and Randy are interesting and charming.
We were in Seattle to visit our three adult children; the location was excellent and easy access to everything around the city. Parking was not an issue, of which we were grateful. 
The breakfast service was really nice and the bed was amazingly comfortable!! 
LOVED the beautiful houseplants, patio and Frida."
11291	3652434	10.0	10.0	28174470	We only spent one night but it was exactly what we needed. Perfect location, beautiful views, and comfy digs. It was my first AirBnb experience and it went off without a hitch. I'd like to stay longer next time and explore the area more. Angelica was very welcoming and accommodating.
11292	3652434	10.0	10.0	28340404	Awesome space and better people. Best AirBnB experience I've had. Big open space and cozy bedroom. Angelica and her husband Randy are outstanding hosts that make you feel welcome - they're also really interesting to talk to. Highly recommend staying here if you can.
11293	3652434	10.0	10.0	28408582	It was a totally wonderful experience staying with Angelica and made our trip to Seattle so much better. The accomodations were spacious, comfortable, relaxing, beautifully decorated, fresh, and airy. There were dozens of travel books and maps of the city available and Angelica was full of perfect recommendations. I only wish we had more time to do and see them all. We were a 10 minute drive from all the sight seeing spots and had beautiful views of the lake. We would definitely stay here when we come back. Absolutely lovely experience.
11294	3652434	10.0	10.0	28621949	"Angelica and Randy were very communicative and kind! They made the check-in process quick, easy, and convenient.

The location is FABULOUS! Within walking distance to: Gasworks Park, Fremont Bridge (Troll), Wallingford shopping district, and just a quick drive to the U. We walked to Green Lake Park (but we're urban hikers, and 4.5mi return may be a bit much for some).

We only stayed overnight, breaking up travel, but this was the best way to do so. They had coffee, tea, and breakfasts provided ‚Äì which was an unexpected benefit. The space is cozy and wonderful¬†‚Äì they do a great job making rainy Seattle seem tropical. "
11295	3652434	10.0	10.0	28884146	It was a very good experience live in this place. The house is clean, and there has flower inside with good cent.  I will definitely live here again when I plan go Seattle. Angelica is so nice showing us around.  
11296	3652434	10.0	10.0	28959797	Angelicka and Randy were great! They welcomed me very warmly to a clean and attractive, as advertised. Additionally, there were some nice little chocolates and brochures of things to do in Seattle. Angelicka was also happy to recommend and direct me to interesting spots around town. Breakfast was lovely, and included some fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Probably the best I've ever had!

we really enjoyed our stay there"
11298	3652434	10.0	10.0	29627932	Spacious, immaculate, great views and neighborhood with extra special touches such as beautiful patio/garden area, chocolates, Tempur-pedic bed, local magazines.  Private area and quiet - nice breakfast as described.  Randy and Angelica are warm and welcoming - recommendations we enjoyed were walking to Ivar's fish and chips bar, nice dining on the water, Pronto bike rental for ride around Lake Union, Burke-Gilman trail for nice run.  They even mailed us my daughter's necklace we left behind.  Super close to U-Dub and downtown.  Fantastic stay!
11299	3652434	10.0	10.0	29863620	Our first Airbnb experience was amazing! The suite was very clean and the amenities provided were great. Since public transportation was near by, it made it easy to travel around the city.  Our host was extremely accommodating and gave great suggestions about local restaurants and activities! Definitely wouldn't have been the same trip in a hotel. 
11300	3652434	10.0	10.0	30298346	I had a wonderful time staying at Randy and Angelica's place.  It was exactly as described.  Location was fantastic with walking destinations in every direction.  From the University area with restaurants and shops galore to the zoo and parks (Seattle Sensory Garden was amazing!).   Downtown was an easy bus trip and the airport was a simple transfer to the Link at the downtown station.   Very clean, comfortable, quiet house with spectacular views of the downtown area and Space Needle.  
11301	3652434	10.0	10.0	30584682	Angelique's top floor suite was the perfect accomodation for me and my maltese Celeste while my husband had over night hospital stay at UW. Peaceful water and garden views. Just enough little snacks so I didn't have to go out food hunting. Angelique and her husband are very considerate and have paid the utmost attention to the details of their Airbnb. 
11302	3652434	10.0	10.0	30797488	Angelica was a great and welcoming host! She provided us with everything we needed to feel comfortable and relax. The living space was as described and the views were fantastic. She and her husband gave us great recommendations for places to go in the area and throughout the city. The location made it easy for us to get around by foot and car. I will highly recommend this listing to any friends seeking a rental for their visits to Seattle!
11303	3652434	10.0	10.0	31189728	Great stay. Angelica and Randy were great hosts.  The top floor was exactly as described.  Plenty of space. The food in the fridge was a real surprise. Thanks.  The advice of activities close by very helpful.  Bus stop to Downtown real close. All in all a great stay. 
11304	3652434	10.0	10.0	31372064	"Angelica, Randy and Frida were really sweet people (and pet!). Angelica called us immediately to let us know that we had left something behind. I only wish we had had more time to visit with them. Angelica made us cappuccinos in the morning which was very much appreciated. Great neighborhood for walking. It felt very safe. It was close to downtown and the university district. We would definitely stay again.

11305	3652434	10.0	10.0	31623264	Angelica, Randy, & Frida's (golden retriever) place was fabulous! We made a rather last minute reservation and Angelica was very accommodating with great communication. Their place is gorgeous and the sitting area & bedroom were very nice. They had beer, coffee and a light breakfast for us which was welcoming. Their golden retriever was very friendly, in & out was easy and the location was perfect (great city & lake views). Thank you for a wonderful stay in Seattle. 
11306	3652434	10.0	10.0	31883408	We loved this quaint little home on the hill above Lake Union. Just two blocks from the Burke-Gilman trail and amazing views of the Seattle skyline and Space Needle. The suite was perfect. Room for relaxing, a neat and tidy bedroom with an amazing queen-sized bed and a lovely private bath. You can't go wrong picking this place. Angelica was a perfect host, always having coffee, continental breakfast and mid-afternoon snacks ready for us. We would be delighted to stay again!
11307	3652434	10.0	10.0	32073417	Had a wonderful time in Seattle. The place was perfect! Plenty of space. The light breakfast was perfect. I would definitely stay with Angelica and her husband again! 
11308	3652434	10.0	10.0	32359765	Angelica and Randy have a very beautiful home! The upstairs was very comfortable, and they provided many amenities for us. They were very helpful in suggesting things that my fiance and I could do while in Seattle. Their dog is sweet and didn't make a sound. The location is within walking distance to a bus stop, which is how we got around. Overall I would highly recommend them.
11309	3652434	10.0	10.0	32485370	Angelica and Randy were fantastic hosts and made me feel so welcome! This was my first AirBnB experience and I can't imagine a better situation. Their dog is so sweet and makes you feel right at home (if you have a dog, like me). I would recommend staying with them a million times over. Randy has some great local brewery suggestions, so make sure you ask him!
11310	3652434	10.0	10.0	32779973	"I loved everything about this experience. My hosts were warm, charming and so accomodating.

For me, this space was everything I could hope for and more.
Wish I could move in!"
11311	3652434	10.0	10.0	33228391	Angelica is very pleasant and attentive
11312	3652434	10.0	10.0	33897007	Angelica and Randy are really nice people and amazing hosts. They made everything to make us feel welcome and helped us with buses  schedules, how to go to places we wanted to, and other tips about Seattle. Their house is very nice and very clean. The suite is very good and allow you to have privacy. The neighborhood is very good and close to University of Washington (less than 15 min by foot). 
11313	3652434	10.0	10.0	34622184	Angelica was great and very helpful.  The water/coffee filter broke and she was immediately there to help remedy the situation.  She recommended restaurants and helped with public transportation. 
11314	3652434	10.0	10.0	34805268	Angelica's home was everything she described and more! It was in a great location, had a great view, was well decorated and very comfortable (temperpedic mattress!) Breakfast was super healthy and she even shared her delicious fresh cantaloupe. We also enjoyed her plant collection and garden. We would definitely recommend it and definitely stay here again! 
11315	3652434	10.0	10.0	35449335	Angelica and Andy are very helpful to my parents, even as they can only speak limited English. Their dog is amazing as well! They provided a lot of useful information about dining, touring around the city and Portland. Definitely will recommend Angelica's house if any other friends are visiting Seattle!
11316	3652434	10.0	10.0	35562354	We enjoyed our stay.  The location was great; we were able to walk to dinner and then take the bike/footpath to a park with a terrific view of the city.  Angelica was very nice and the top floor suite was too. We really appreciated the stocked fridge in the morning when we had to leave. Thank you so much!
11317	3652434	10.0	10.0	36102261	"This stay was wonderful. The hosts fulfilled all promises, including leaving us plenty of coffee, tea, and other drinks and snacks in a mini fridge and water filter machine for our private everyday use. We had the upstairs to ourselves, with a door that separated the bedroom and bathroom from the living area. The bed is incredibly comfortable! And the views for my morning coffee were unforgettable.There was an outdoor patio available to us, though we only used it once. 

The location was walking distance to some nice views, but mostly bus or drive-able I'd say to most restaurants and shops. Though we did walk to a water-front restaurant for dinner one night. 

 I felt like I was in a nice hotel staying here. You will surely enjoy your stay."
11318	3652434	10.0	10.0	36367658	"What a fantastic way to visit Seattle! The upstairs suite is lovely, private and so much more than I expected. The Tempuer-Pedic bed and pillows are very comfortable, the bathroom is bright and clean and it's outstanding to have your own living space to enjoy coffee in the morning, or reading in the late afternoon sun. Angelica and Randy are very friendly, and generous of both time and spirit! They make you feel welcome and valued, and are happy to share in conversations and make recommendations. The whole experience was wonderful and I can't say enough good things. Thank you so much, Angelica & Randy.
*$11-$14 uber/Lyft to downtown Seattle, very quick and convient"
11319	3652434	10.0	10.0	36940237	"This is a great one bedroom suite with your own living room and wonderful view of Lake Union, next to Fremont and the dollege district.   
Angelica and her husband are super nice and provide a very comfortable setting with comfy bed, private bath and some yummy treats in the fridge in addition to breakfast.
While not in ""downtown"" it's a 5 minute drive from Seattle Center and great getaway location.  I highly recommend the ""Top Floor Suite with City Views.  
Pat"
11320	3652434	10.0	10.0	37138384	Our very first airbnb experience and we landed lucky with Angelica & Randy who are the perfect hosts. Beautiful neighbourhood, very comfortable accommodation, very helpful hosts and Frida the friendly dog. Bus route on the doorstep, Angelica recommended Ivars Salmon House which was spot on and Irwins coffee house just up the road was the best for breakfast. Many many thanks to Angelica and Randy (and Frida) for helping to make our visit to Seattle such a memorable experience. This accommodation is top notch. 
11321	3652434	10.0	10.0	38099634	Angelica was a perfect hostess. We had all the privacy we needed or wanted. The space is welcoming, super clean, and well equipped. My husband and I highly recommend a stay here for anyone in the Seattle area.
11322	3652434	10.0	10.0	38283874	We had such a great time. Angelica was so friendly and helped us out by opening her doors up to us. She also has the sweetest dog ever. I would definitely stay with her again and would record to anyone. 
11323	3652434	10.0	10.0	38693854	What a great area, a bit out of the city but glad we were. It was an easy walk to the city and grab a bike. Angelica and Randy were great hosts with lots of info and places to see. Upstairs suite was charming and relaxing. 
11324	3652434	10.0	10.0	39166888	Although Angelica was not there when we arrived (she was running a 24-hour marathon!), Randy was very welcoming, great suggestions for dinner. Loved the space...it was better than described! It was so convenient to the University for us to attend a wedding. Also, many wonderful restaurants were within walking distance. We met Angelica when she returned the next day and chatted for a bit...what a delight she is! And the driveway parking was very much appreciated! Thanks for all your suggestions.
11325	3652434	10.0	10.0	39594488	"We enjoyed our stay at Angelica and Randy's place; they are warm and very friendly hosts.  Their upstairs suite is comfortable and private. The organic goodies in the fridge and the coffee/cold water machine were a very welcomed, nice touch. Their house is on a quiet cul-de-sac and conveniently accessible to downtown via bus lines just a couple of blocks away. Their lab Frida is a friendly and very sweet pet.
We don't hesitate to recommend their place highly."
11326	3652434	10.0	10.0	39912210	Angelica's communication was warm and welcoming. The suite is very comfortable and decorated with great style and nicely furnished. After encountering two traffic snarls on Northbound I-5 from Portland that extended the drive by almost 50%, it was wonderful to arrive and see beer in the refrigerator. There was also a nice selection of food and coffee that made the next morning equally pleasant. The location is great--2 minute walk from Lake Union and a 15-minute or less drive to downtown.
11327	3652434	10.0	10.0	40200506	A very nice place, clean house with an upstairs that had a great view of the bay. Spectacular location. Great neighborhood. A nice selection of quick food on the go and Angelica had a wealth of resources on the area. We were sad we couldn't stay longer!
11328	3652434	10.0	10.0	40478436	The host was very clear on accessing the top floor apartment. The house and parking are easy to find; it is set in an area that overlooks the Ship Canal of Seattle. It is handy to downtown and the University District.  We liked the outdoor setting area at the front door.  The bed was wonderful and the bath had a great tub as well as shower. You are in a wonderful setting here.
11329	3652434	10.0	10.0	43270287	"Wonderful experience with Angelica.  Very communicative and a gracious host. The private space is bright and the bed is a temperpedic (which I sleep on at home) so it was great to not get a sore back from a night away from home.

There was so much breakfast to choose from, but I went for the home made scones and coffee.  Sitting in a chair in the morning sun watching the morning traffic on the bridge in the distance was a great way to start me day.

I highly recommend Angelica and her Top Floor Suite."
11330	3652434	10.0	10.0	44232931	"The place was great! Very well kept, and in a great location. The host gave us some awesome recommendations on places to have dinner and drinks around the house.
Would not hesitate to stay again. Thanks!"
11331	3652434	10.0	10.0	44537992	My sister and I stayed with Angelica and her husband while we were just visiting Seattle. They have a beautiful home and are very friendly and welcoming. Angelica left breakfast options in the cabinet and even snacks mid-day which was super nice. The space upstairs was our own area, which was open and very clean. I would absolutely stay with them again!
11332	3652434	10.0	10.0	45066588	We spent three great days at Angelica‚Äôs place. The upstairs suite has ample space, privacy and everything you need to feel at home. It also has nice views of the water. Angelica‚Äôs place is in a great location and we made use of the fact that there are excellent shopping and dining options within walking distance. There‚Äôs a coffee maker and refrigerator in the suite and Angelica makes sure you have a lot of options for breakfast. We look forward to staying there again!
11333	3652434	10.0	10.0	45633125	"My experience was great!  Had a few questions about check in prior to checking in and Angelica was very helpful and prompt with her response!

Check in was seamless.  Code for door was easy to use.  

Location and view was perfect!  It was very close to downtown and just minutes away from the awesome Gas Works Park that we went to!

Amenities that Angelica offered was a plus!  The hot/cold water and coffee machine was perfect for morning and nights!

Overall we had a great experience and would definitely recommend staying here!"
11334	3652434	10.0	10.0	46114025	Our hostess made us feel very welcomed.  We arrived later than expected on a Friday night & Angelica was so kind.  The neighborhood & listing were very accurate. 
11335	3652434	10.0	10.0	46645907	We had an extremely pleasant stay. The suite was light, airy, and immaculately clean. Add to that a comfy  bed and a very nice bathroom. Our hostess greeted us and showed us all the ins and outs, and we enjoyed the feeling of privacy that the second floor afforded. There were plenty of good things for breakfast. It's the perfect location for events or activities connected with the university. Highly recommended.
11336	3652434	10.0	10.0	46873727	Angelica and her husband are so great to offer their beautiful home to guests. It is in a great location with easy access to downtown and other fun neighborhoods in Seattle. The space was incredibly clean, comfortable and private. The breakfast she provided was a perfect way to start the day, and she offered a lot of good suggestions of things to do that suited our tastes. This was my first Airbnb experience, and I'm very happy with my choice. Their dog Frida is so sweet!
11337	3652434	10.0	10.0	47993781	"Great experience! Angelica warmly welcomed us, provided suggestions for restaurants, parks, coffee and more. All were fantastic.  Great location. The most comfortable bed my wife and I have ever slept in. The provided amenities were just like the 4 star hotels I grew up in. If this private suite is available reserve it and enjoy the hospitality. Thanks again Angelia. 
"
11338	3652434	10.0	10.0	49654969	Perfect house with perfect view! Angelica is so kind and easygoing. My parents really enjoy living in her house. The doggy is soooo cute!
11339	3652434	10.0	10.0	50126221	It is a very nice place! 
11340	3652434	10.0	10.0	50590981	I loved this place, whole top floor is yours to enjoy, airy and open with views across Union Lake to the city.  Angelica has given the house Mexican decor, with Mexican hospitality to match ('mi casa es Su casa'). With yoghurt, beverages and fruit in the fridge, the tempur mattress and pillows, I thoroughly and Frida the dog, it all feels 5-star homely.
11341	3652434	10.0	10.0	50897604	Angelica and Randy were perfect hosts. They made me feel very welcome in their lovely home. Their top floor apartment was well appointed and all the little touches like breakfast items were extremely appreciated. I will definitely stay there again and cannot recommend them more highly.
11342	3652434	10.0	10.0	51634965	Angelica met us at the door when we arrived and showed us our wonderful suite. The refrigerator had some snacks and coffee that were nice for breakfast. Location was perfect for us. Walking distance to Fremont and Wallingford. 
11343	3652434	10.0	10.0	52129019	Angelica was incredibly welcoming upon our arrival. We were in town for a busy wedding weekend and were able to come and go freely from the residence. Its a great location and the space was just perfect for what we needed. We definitely appreciated her hospitality and would recommend. 
11344	3652434	10.0	10.0	54757074	Amazing place, amazing host. A very friendly and welcoming home. All and all an extremely pleasant and relaxing Airbnb experience.
11345	3652434	10.0	10.0	55502187	Angelica and Randy were exceptionally welcoming and kind hosts.  They immediately made us feel welcome, and were more than happy to share recommendations about places to go and things to do during our visit.  Angelica was flexible and communicative before and during the stay.  It was an absolute delight to stay with Angelica and Randy, and I would recommend their suite to anyone staying in Seattle.
11346	3652434	10.0	10.0	56563135	Nice space.  We were not able to take advantage of all of the amenities; this is a good place if you need to spread out.  Two large rooms, one good for relaxing or as an office.  Would recommend.
11347	3652434	10.0	10.0	58072978	We had a great experience. The loft  was well kept, beautiful views, very comfortable. We had a feeling of a home something that you do not get when you're go to a hotel. Well located nearby and water in the view of the city was great.
12069	2373176	10.0	10.0	10507976	The reservation was canceled 81 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
12070	2373176	10.0	10.0	11362747	This was our first time using airbnb and it was a very pleasant experience! Anna's place was great and Queen Anne is the best neighborhood! We didn't get a chance to meet Anna but she was very friendly and helpful over the phone and left us a list of a bunch of places to go/eat in the Queen Anne area. I can't say enough great things about that neighborhood! We even went walking around in the rain and it was beautiful! Anna's space was just perfect for the two of us, I would recommend it for any couple's getaway! 
12071	2373176	10.0	10.0	13912141	"If you want to have a great experience in Seattle, I absolutely recommend staying at Anna‚Äôs place.

My wife and I had a wonderful time thanks to Anna. We stayed in her basement apartment that had 

all the amenities you could need in a nice hotel ‚Äì great size living room, bed room, kitchen with all 

appliances, nice sized bathroom. We also were relieved to find a washer and dryer available since we 

were continuing on with our trip for another week after we left Seattle. It was an easily affordable price 

for what you are getting. 

More than just a very comfortable place to stay, Anna also made you feel right at home as soon as you 

walk in. We came into her apartment to find a bottle of wine and a detailed list of things to do in Seattle 

and places to eat. Anna was born and raised in Seattle, and her recommendations were incredible! We 

tried out some spots on her lists and loved them. She knows how to make Seattle a great trip.

Lastly, Anna lives in a gorgeous area of Seattle. She has a great location on Queen Anne‚Äôs Hill that is 

surrounded by beautiful houses, adorable bakeries and boutiques, but most importantly, a stunning 

view. My wife enjoyed taking morning jogs around the neighborhood (always finishing with a geat cup of 

coffee around the corner from our stay), and we both loved taking in the view of downtown and Mount 

Rainier a few blocks away at sunset.

Bottom line ‚Äì there is not enough great things we could say about our stay here. You will undoubtedly 

love it too!"
12072	2373176	10.0	10.0	14224786	Absolutely wonderful experience at this basement apartment! Cozy & clean are the perfect two words to describe this place... it's perfect. We used the full kitchen to cook some amazing fish bought at Pike Place Market, which is just a short 10 min drive away. The neighbourhood is unreal... so lush, quiet and beautiful. Do yourself a favour and make the 25-min walk or 5-min drive south to Kerry Park and take in the best view in the city! Anna is so friendly and accommodating... we couldn't ask for a better host. It's honestly the perfect place for a couple to stay in Seattle at a great price. Highly recommended... we'll be back without a doubt!
12073	2373176	10.0	10.0	14437031	My husband and I took a short trip to Seattle for a little getaway!  I had been to Seattle before and stayed in the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood.  I knew that if I went back again, this is where I wanted to stay!  When I found Anna's cozy, clean hideaway, I knew I had to jump on it!  The place was perfect for our stay!  Anna has it decorated so nicely and it really is cozy and clean!  My husband and I were very happy with our stay and with Anna!  She was very helpful and responsive.  I'm so happy to have stayed here and hope to be back soon!
12074	2373176	10.0	10.0	14611420	"Anna's basement apartment was wonderful! My wife and I found it to be the perfect hub for our Seattle getaway.

A two minute walk around the corner gets you to Malena's Taco Shop, Macrina Bakery (amazing bread, pastries, brunch, etc), and Ken's Market. A 0.4 mile walk east gets you to the Queen Anne strip with a number of restaurants and shops, and a fantastic farmer's market on Thursdays. The neighborhood is beautiful, with tree lined/covered streets and great craftsman style houses. Really nice to walk around.

Getting to other neighborhoods such as Fremont was a breeze, as was getting to downtown. We had a rental car, but there's a bus stop right around the corner. Parking was never a problem; plenty of open spaces right in front of the house.

We'd happily stay here again on our next visit to Seattle!"
12075	2373176	10.0	10.0	15035973	"We booked this for our friends who were attending our wedding. Here is what they had to say:

Anna's basement was indeed cozy and clean, as my wife and I enjoyed a nice weekend in Seattle. The basement apartment has all the amenities you could find in a nice hotel, such as a good-sized living room with a nice TV and cable, bed room with a comfortable queen bed, kitchen with all appliances, and a clean bathroom. There is also high-speed wireless internet free to the guest. A washer and dryer are available for $1.25 each. The place is located in the beautiful and quiet Queen Anne neighborhood, and just walking distance away from Malena's Taco Shop, Macrina Bakery, and Ken's Market. A few minutes of driving would get you to the Queen Anne strip with more restaurants and shops, and Kerry Park (on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill, located at the corner of 2nd Avenue W. and W. Highland Drive), where you can see an incredibly amazing view of downtown Seattle! Overall this is a great place in a wonderful neighborhood, we would totally recommend to people visiting Seattle!"
12076	2373176	10.0	10.0	16170617	Anna was very accommodating and offered clear guidelines. The place was spacious (although maybe not for the super tall folk) and was as cozy as could be. Queen Anne is awesome and Anna's place offers easy access to touristy spots such as the Space Needle. Would highly recommend!
12077	2373176	10.0	10.0	16235158	My girlfriend and I stayed one night and it was a great experience. Everything was super clean and nice. I had a very short and easy commute to south lake union for an early morning interview. If you need a place to stay I would highly recommend this.
12078	2373176	10.0	10.0	16342934	Anna's place was super convenient for trips into the city, and the space was just what we were looking for during a short stay in Seattle. The apartment is just around the corner from a bus stop (and great Mexican take away) and there was a great park across the street which our 1 year old loved. Anna was very easy to communicate with and was so welcoming when we arrived a little bit earlier than expected.
12079	2373176	10.0	10.0	16721578	This was my fianc√©e and I's first time using ABNB, and Anna set a precedence that I believe will ruin my future stays. First off, the accommodations were far better than what we expected. Clean, spacious, and cozy, you feel right at home when staying there. The neighborhood has a quiet and homey feel to it as well. Friendly people, small bakery and convenience store around the corner, make a stroll around the block extremely enjoyable. If your looking for a little noise, downtown Seattle is only a 5-10 minute cab ride, or 45 minute bus ride away. Public transportation was very easy to use in Seattle, and bus stops were right around the corner as well. If you enjoy the outdoors, Discovery Park is close by, which has amazing hikes with stunning views of the water, Mt. Ranier, and the Olympic Mountains on a clear day. Unsure about what to do, or where to eat, just ask Anna. She makes herself available to you with a text, email, or phone call, and her recommendations will not let down. As you can see, we had an exceptional experience, and when we visit Seattle, we know who to look for first when deciding on a place to stay.
12080	2373176	10.0	10.0	17110697	"We coincidentally arrived at the property at the same time as Anna. She let us into the apartment and gave us the lay of the land, which was very helpful. The place was clean and well put-together. Anna provided maps and suggestions for places to go in the city. The only downsides were the distance to Downtown (Though it was accessible by bus and for the price, the location can't be beat!) and the ceiling height (My 6'6"" husband had to duck most of the time.).

Overall, we loved the neighborhood (its proximity to bakeries, restaurants, and Kerry Park for a beautiful view of the city) and would definitely come back!"
12081	2373176	10.0	10.0	17555029	This was a great Airbnb experience.  Anna is a fabulous host and the space was perfect - exceptionally well cleaned and maintained - although if you are very tall the ceilings may be a little low.  The neighborhood is amazing - great coffee cafe and bakery and close to bus lines to downtown.  Everyone was so friendly and never hesitated to help out visitors from the East coast.  Anna and her lovely airbnb helped me have one of my best birthdays ever.  Highly recommend - 5 stars!
12082	2373176	10.0	10.0	18467429	Great location and well equipped apartment. Good recommendations for what was in the area and how to get there. No problem with access and communication with Anna was easy and responsive.
12083	2373176	10.0	10.0	18624070	This place is great. It is in a nice, quiet section of Queen Anne, about a block from the #2 bus line, with the Macrina Bakery between the two. Fantastic. Anna is a wonderful host, and very responsive via email or text. I can't say enough good things.  Great first airbnb experience!
12084	2373176	10.0	10.0	19405348	Great place in what is arguably Seattle's best neighborhood.  Good places to eat and stores within walking distance.  Easy transit access.  Abundant street parking  Kitchen was unusually well stocked and furnishings new and comfortable.  Easy transition into the place.  Anna and her family were gracious hosts
12085	2373176	10.0	10.0	19819936	Anna took care of everything. I will be recommending this place for anyone who travels to Seattle.
12086	2373176	10.0	10.0	20086960	One of my best AirBnB experiences. Smooth and straightforward, Anna made everything so easy with clear instructions and good local knowledge. Anna lives in a beautiful part of Seattle, this is a perfect spot for a couple who'd like to experience the city without the bustle of downtown. The apartment has everything you'll ever need, highly recommended. 
12087	2373176	10.0	10.0	20283122	The host made me feel welcome. She provided clear directions of how to get into the unit and she sent me multiple emails to make sure I knew exactly where to go and what to do.
12088	2373176	10.0	10.0	20569786	The room is like a 5 star hotel, and it's neighborhood is very safe and beautiful! Highly recommended!
12089	2373176	10.0	10.0	21378340	All around awesome place to stay. Cozy, private apartment, charming neighborhood and terrific welcoming host. I did both a short stay and longer stay with Anna. Was able to both work out of location and spend fun filled time in Seattle. Was even able to cook a few meals for son attending SPU. Close to downtown and great walking area with lots of shops and restaurants
12090	2373176	10.0	10.0	21602263	The place was very cozy and very comfortable. The neighborhood was fun to walk around in. Trader Joes was just a 15 min walk away. The nearby bakery and taco shop were great.  It's only about 3 miles from downtown. It's also 3 miles from Discovery Park. 
12091	2373176	10.0	10.0	21881872	This was my first airbnb experience and I am so thrilled. Anna's place was even better than described. The neighborhood was amazing and we were so close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. After a long day of exploring it was almost as if we were returning home to our own apartment. Anna provided recommendations for the neighborhood and we were not disappointed. One of our favorite things to do every morning before we headed out to explore the city was to stop by Kerry Park near the apartment to take in a view of the city. Anna is an excellent host so don't hesitate to stay here!
12092	2373176	10.0	10.0	22139190	Anna was very easy to communicate with, and the apartment was perfect for us.  Very cozy and conveniently located.  The restaurants and bars in the neighborhood were excellent and fun to try.

12096	2373176	10.0	10.0	23819030	We loved our time in queen Anne! The place was just as described and the bed was comfortable. It was everything we needed and very convenient. It's a nice, quiet street with plenty of parking. We could hear people above walking around upstairs a lot,  but that's to be expected in a basement apartment.
12097	2373176	10.0	10.0	23909679	The cozy cottage was perfect just as described. The neighnorhood was awesome. Very close to shops and stores.

12102	2373176	10.0	10.0	25197954	"Cozy and Clean is a perfect description for this Airbnb.  I am 5'3"" so the lower ceilings didn't bother me.  I had everything I needed for the week I stayed.  Anna thought of everything.  She is friendly and welcoming.  This is a small but perfect place to stay in Seattle!  I will definitely keep this as an option for future visits to the Emerald City."

Enough room for a pack-n-play in the bedroom. Very family friendly w/a park across the street. Charming little part of town. Easy to get to any part of Seattle. I would stay there again for sure.
12104	2373176	10.0	10.0	26603763	Anna's place is simply amazing. She puts in a lot of work to ensure that your trip is best. Cody and I went to Seattle to spend valentines weekend and our anniversary. Anna had the TV playing love songs upon checking in and left small chocolates on the counter for us. She was available any time we had questions and was super nice when I had forgot some additional information she had sent me on how to get into the listing. Anna also left a recommendation list of local restaurants, which was perfect for valentines night. The location of her listing is perfect and in a safe neighborhood. We had a fantastic time in Seattle with Anna's help. If you are traveling to Seattle, we highly recommend staying here.
12105	2373176	10.0	10.0	27014163	Anna's place was just what my boyfriend and I needed on our working weekend in Seattle. The room is just as the pictures show and Anna is very reliable and quick to respond. The apartment is located in a safe neighborhood with coffee shops around the corner that made it convenient for early morning starts in the city. It was a pleasure staying with her.

I've been able to cook and feel like at home! The area is great, quiet and beautiful with gorgeous view, close to everything. I used the bus to move around (downtown and to wsu) and it's been very easy. I hope I can stay with her again in my next trips to Seattle. Thank you Anna! Grazie!
12108	2373176	10.0	10.0	28613635	I and my GF visited her lovely and cozy place. First when we walked in, the room and everything was exactly same as pictured. The bed was super comfortable and everything was so perfect!!! Also, even the neighbor was friendly, there was nothing like Anna's house!!! Overall, 5 out of 5 stars!!!
12109	2373176	10.0	10.0	29752689	Absolutely loved Anna's beautiful space. It was perfect for my boyfriend and I - great location, lovely house, and Anna was a wonderful host! After asking for recommendations for things to do, she went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience. It was my boyfriend's birthday and she made sure we were taken care of at the restaurant she suggested! She had 2 glasses of champagne + a personalized menu ready for us when we got there! Such an amazing stay in Seattle. Definitely would recommend booking your stay here!
12110	2373176	10.0	10.0	31951235	Wonderful experience, incredible apt and neighborhood, close to downtown by #2 bus which was a short walk to bakery bus stop, can't wait to return.   Apt was exactly as pictured and was immaculate and so homey and inviting.  Thanks Anna, for making our first visit to Seattle so wonderful.  We appreciated it immensely!
12111	2373176	10.0	10.0	32821448	The apartment was as described: cozy, clean and very well equipped.

12113	2373176	10.0	10.0	33561636	A lovely unit in a beautiful neighborhood with a gracious hostess.  The apt is clean, comfortable and has all the conveniences of home.  The bed is super soft and the neighborhood is quiet and safe making for a restful sleep.  We had a car which made travel convenient but if going into downtown before 8p be prepared to pay for parking.  Otherwise, a car is great and necessary to explore parts outside the city.  Downtown was about a 10-15 minute drive.  Parking is readily available on the block and there are few restaurants and shopping venues within walking distance.  Anna is responsive and full of great sightseeing and dining ideas.  She is extremely warm and friendly.  I highly recommend this unit and if we return to Seattle, we hope to stay here again.
12114	2373176	10.0	10.0	34846143	"Lovely quiet and private apt in wonderful neighborhood. Anna left complete instructions on the neighborhood and how to get around. Apt was clean and as described.
Only comment to take note of is be careful if you are tall. My son at 6'3"" had to stoop in places

I would definitely recommend to others and would stay there again

12115	2373176	10.0	10.0	35537081	This was a great rental.  The Queen Anne neighborhood is so quaint and has a nice small-town feel.  The unit was clean, comfortable, and very homey.  The bed is really comfortable, and the shower has wonderful water pressure.  The location is amazing:  almost everything we wanted to see was only 10-15 minutes away.  Please note:  the ceilings are LOW.  I missed that in her description, and my 5'11 hubby barely fit.  
12116	2373176	10.0	10.0	35809797	Anna's apartment is large, comfortable and located in an excellent neighborhood. It also has very well equipped kitchen and a luxurious bed. The apartment was well described by the photos. There are shops and cafe's only 2 min walk away. Anna gave us helpful information prior to arrival. It was easy to park our car next to the house.  A great stay all round.
12117	2373176	10.0	10.0	36523775	What a wonderful vacation! I planned this trip because I was proposing to my partner, and did so on the first day, and he said yes!  Everything was as described, and we enjoyed our week in Queen Anne.  Anna was a gracious host, and we ran into her a few times, and she was adamant about making sure that we were enjoying our stay, and to make sure we didn't need anything.  It was pretty hot the week we were up, but luckily there was a fan tucked away in the closet that came in very handy.  We had all the comforts of home, and would love to come back to stay again!
12118	2373176	10.0	10.0	36976146	"Anna's place was wonderfully clean and comfortable!  It was a great place to temporarily call ""home"" while we were visiting Seattle.  The place had everything that we needed plus Anna's special instructions on how to get around and where to go to for the special sights.  The neighborhood was safe, quiet, and just a lovely stay.  Anna was also very kind to check-in with us to make sure we were doing well.  I would recommend her place to anyone looking to stay in a terrific and cozy place while visiting Seattle.  Thanks Anna for being a gracious host!"

12120	2373176	10.0	10.0	37569961	By emailing us before & during our stay to ensure that everything was going to plan & that there were no issues.

This apartment is within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the breathtaking view of Kerry Park. My husband and I walked everyday ""up and down the hill"" (about 2.5 miles or so) to the restaurants and park. The neighborhood is beautifully landscaped and peaceful. Pikes Market is just a short drive as is downtown. This is our first visit to Seattle  and couldn't have asked for more! Anna's apartment is truly as described and more. "
12122	2373176	10.0	10.0	40425009	The apartment was very clean with everything we needed for our 10 day stay in Seattle.

12124	2373176	10.0	10.0	41629656	"We had a great stay at Anna's Airbnb! Everything was exactly as pictured, with lots of thoughtful touches like towels & shampoo being provided. We had to arrive late at night, and were relieved that Anna made it so simple & straightforward. She'd given us a code for the outside entry, unlocked the unit door, and left the keys & instructions out on a table for us. We were able to park for free on her block, which was great. Everything we could have needed for our stay was on-hand: dishes & glassware in the cupboards, extra towels, etc. We were a little worried about watching TV late at night, as we could hear when someone was walking around upstairs & we didn't want to keep them up, but we tried to keep the volume low and hopefully it was fine. We spent most of our time out & about in the city, and it was great to have a ""home base"" to come back to when we needed. Would definitely stay there again! "
12125	2373176	10.0	10.0	43600902	This is 5star accommodation. It's a small suite of rooms. I arrived late because of delay in Boston.   The instructions to gain entry were perfect.

Anna is a Seattle native and very accommodating for those looking for tips and directions, and she checked-in with me, mid-stay, which really made me feel safe and awesome."

I was looking for restaurant recommendations and she happily did some research and gave me a call to answer some questions I had. It is a beautiful location in Queen Anne and a perfect spot in between downtown and Ballard. The neighborhood is very safe and the apartment was also very safe and clean. It had all of the amenities we needed, too! She checked in on us the first day we got there, and made sure we had everything we needed.

The space is very comfortable and well furnished. All amenities a person needs are available. The location is fantastic, quiet and walkable. My only issue was that I am 6'-4"" and it is a garden level apt, so the ceilings were too low for me to stand fully up. Just a ""heads up"" for the tall people out there."
12137	2373176	10.0	10.0	51796067	Anna's place was exactly as advertised.  It was clean and cozy, in a wonderful neighborhood, and close to downtown Seattle.  I didn't have much interaction with Anna, although since I've been to Seattle before, it wasn't necessary.  When we did need to talk via text, she was very responsive.  Our stay couldn't have been more pleasant!

The listing was exactly as described, and the location was very convenient. Dan was incredibly generous and was kind enough to pick me up for check-in. He even treated me to a drink and prepared breakfast the first morning.

His cat Orin was very friendly, and the whole experience was very welcoming. He graciously invited me to meet some of his friends and spent some time showing me around the area too. Dan has lived in the Seattle area for many years and was great to talk to about the city. I'd be happy to stay with him again.

13834	6629132	10.0	10.0	37938155	The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13835	6629132	10.0	10.0	38027372	Dan made us feel completely welcome and at home.  He really went out of his way to do so.   We were traveling with two kids, 12 and 15.  Dan was so kind to the kids and in no way condescending.  They both expressed to their mom and me that they liked him (the supreme complement from those age groups).  Needless to say, my daughter and I felt the same.  The rooms lived up to our expectations.  The location is great - we walked to downtown and also took the bus to and from Dan's home.
13836	6629132	10.0	10.0	38210576	It was really a nice experience!!! Dan is nice and kind person. He let us stay till 9pm because our flight was 12am at night. The room is awesome, big and comfortable! I would definitely live here if I go to Seattle again!!

I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle.

14913	9957555	10.0	9.0	57093878	"E.J.'s Central Seattle home is a bargain for its quality! We were greeted by a lovely, clean home just as pictured with extra amenities of first aid kits, cleaning material, laundry and wonderful four-ply toliet paper. There was a ton of space for four people and the home would comfortably fit a family of over four people as we felt we had a ton of extra space all weekend. There were a ton of restaurants and bars in the area that we walked to and ordered delivery from. Downtown and Cap Hill were 5-10 minutes away and we took in the location for some great tourism. E.J. was professional and flexible when we got stuck in traffic trying to meet up for the key hand off. I recommend this home highly for it's size, location, and flexible host. And, again. Four. Ply. Toliet. Paper. Recommended!!!



All you really need to know is the home is equipped with super high quality, four-ply toliet paper. That little fact should speak to the quality of the rest of the home. "

16594	7550234	10.0	9.0	41511833	I enjoyed the stay in the cozy blue room. The house is well taken care of and stocked. It was a pleasant stay and I can recommend it as a quiet and friendly airbnb guest house. Sadly I didn't have a chance to meet Dario but his friend Ethan who stays at the house was there to take care of things. It's a big airbnb house with lots of interesting people coming through and walking distance from UW makes it a convenient place to stay for those visiting the campus.

I would definitely recommend staying here!
16598	7550234	10.0	9.0	45358350	Dario and his partner were very communicative and accommodating to me. The space was very comfortable and a good value. The neighborhood is a little far away from downtown, but otherwise has a lot going on.

There was just one problem, the toilet on the top floor clogged often, if that is solved, everything would be just perfect. The bathroom was well kept otherwise; the kitchen was also very accessible and stocked with variety of food for the guests. Will love to visit again. Keep up with the great hospitality. "
16602	7550234	10.0	9.0	48454063	I had a great experience at Dario's house. Ethan his roommate was available for any and all questions I had.

The room was quiet and the neighborhood was very walkable to be able to get food and other vitals. Very safe. The breakfast option was great with a variety of delicious options available, including good coffee, juice, and tea. Guests should be aware that breakfast is self serve, in case there is any confusion (I was not confused). Overall a very excellent and easy experience for a budget traveler. 
16603	7550234	10.0	9.0	48920440	I had a great stay! It was clean, accessible and had a great selection of breakfast items. There was even Tylenol in the guest cupboard that made all the difference in the world. I would definitely stay again.
16604	7550234	10.0	9.0	49300785	The Blue room rocks!
16605	7550234	10.0	9.0	49947935	While I didn't get to meet Dario or Ethan, I had a great time staying in their home. The room was the perfect space to get work done. I also found one of my favourite coffee bars here-- what a great location!
16606	7550234	10.0	9.0	51382818	Dario and Ethan are very nice person.Because of the misunderstanding between my friend and I ,we brought some trouble to them,but they are so kindly to host us. The house is clean and comfortable. Near the Washington (website hidden)'s safe and quiet.A good choice to stay.
16607	7550234	10.0	9.0	52262373	Great guys, great place! Thank you for everything. 
16608	7550234	10.0	9.0	53309985	I have stayed at Dario's place on multiple occasions. The place is very clean and well-maintained. Ethan, Dario's friend who helps with management is prompt and responsive to any questions or favors. 
16609	7550234	10.0	9.0	54296859	"Host made me feel extremely welcome! The listing could not have been more on point and to top it all off, there were helpful guidebooks in the common areas.

The neighborhood was quiet - although within walking distance of a Walgreens and a street / neighborhood that looked like it had some interesting things going on in the evening. Parking was easy to find, which I found extremely helpful."
16610	7550234	10.0	9.0	54770065	Dario and Ethan were awesome hosts! I was late getting into town and they were very flexible with my arrival time changing. They both give you as much space as you want to come and go from the house as you please. The Blue room was very comfortable and exactly what is advertised. Thanks to both!
16611	7550234	10.0	9.0	55049147	Nice decoration, cozy room and great location. 
16612	7550234	10.0	9.0	55310632	A comfortable stay.  Everything was clean and I slept well.  Comfortable bed and quiet house.  Just realize that this is a hostel-like setting with multiple lodgers in the same house.  Might not appeal to everyone.  Also, the breakfast food, while provided, is make-it-yourself; don't expect a big spread waiting for you in the morning.
16613	7550234	10.0	9.0	56610985	"Room and bathroom were clean. Kitchen was stocked. In case of any issues , response was swift. 
I loved  my stay. 
If i have to point out one thing, its that the room was slightly  smaller that how it looked in the pics. "
16623	7247720	10.0	10.0	38464172	This home is on a fairly busy street that quiets down during the evening. It is close to the great restaurants of the seattle university district.  I stayed in a modest room with its own bath.  The room was clean and comfortable. The host are friendly and charming. They made me feel welcome. This is a great place to stay if you are visiting the university. 
16624	7247720	10.0	10.0	38681416	A good stay! Scott and Delmis were warm and friendly and very accommodating as I had booked at short notice. House is easy to access via buses and just around the corner from the stop. The room comes with its own attached bathroom, which was well-stocked with toiletries/hairdryer, etc. (Guys, I loved that yummy muesli bar on the bedside table!) Bed was comfy. My room was the front one, with a window facing the street, so by 7am one hears sounds of cars zooming by, plus airplanes start flying overhead (a point only for light-sleepers to note). The neighborhood has many shops and eateries to explore! Would gladly stay again :)
16625	7247720	10.0	10.0	39100326	"Scott, Delmis, and their son were extraordinary hosts. Their home was very clean and they provided plenty of essentials like soap conditioner shampoo toothpaste towels. Each room that they list has its own bathroom and they provide plenty of privacy. They offered great advice about the local restaurants and entertainment. They made coffee for us every morning and when asked Delmis if you knew how to make Cuban coffee he made me the best Cuban coffee I ever tasted. Their home is centrally located in the University District where there is lots of stuff to do and plenty of delicious restaurants to visit. The bus stop is only a block away and gives you access to the entire city with public transportation. These are amazing people and we were lucky to have found them on Air Bnb. 
"
16626	7247720	10.0	10.0	40003224	Scott and Delmis were very welcoming and accomodating. They made me feel at home (away from home). Their home was clean and always felt safe and confortable. Both have great personalities and are very friendly. The room had it's own bathroom, closet area, shelves, and a desk. The bed and pillows were incredibly confortable. Home is located conveniently located near bus stops that will take you anywhere in Seattle. All bus stops within 2 blocks or less from their home. I had a wonderful experience staying with them, and this was my first time booking through airbnb, if I travel to Seattle in the future, they will be my first choice and I will gladly stay with them again.
16627	7247720	10.0	10.0	40666752	Scott and Delmis were great hosts! The room looked exactly as listed- no surprises. I always felt very safe walking around the neighborhood at all hours of the day. They were both very friendly and answered all my questions regarding transportation, things to do in the city, etc. Their home is located only blocks away from the university. I would definitely stay here again! 
16628	7247720	10.0	10.0	41258777	The hosts welcomed me and provided useful information about things to do in the area. I felt very comfortable talking to them, and they welcomed me into their beautiful home. The room was comfortable and homey. Although it wasn't a big issue for me, there is considerable noise from the street, but mainly during the early morning rush. At night, things are pretty quiet. Also, during this summer's heat wave, the house is pretty warm until a nice breeze comes through.
16629	7247720	10.0	10.0	41646288	If I could give six stars, I would. The room and house were beautiful and completely exceeded my expectations. Scott and Delmis were both unbelievably nice and welcoming. I would very highly recommend staying here, and hope to come back.
16630	7247720	10.0	10.0	42164670	Scott and Delmis are the best hosts anyone can ask for. The location can't be beat and the room was very clean and comfortable. They made us feel right at home and even made us sourdough pancakes for breakfast!
16631	7247720	10.0	10.0	42898776	"We had a nice time staying with our friendly hosts Scott and Delmis. Though they were busy working there was always time to give us information on what to do and see. 
The house was clean and we could use all the facilities. As cyclists they could give us assistance with repairing our bicycles.
We would always come back to stay with Scott and Delmis in the future."
16632	7247720	10.0	10.0	43985356	"Both Scott and Delmis made me feel extremely welcome from the moment I walked in the door. They were great at anticipating my needs. It was my first time in Seattle and they helped me get my bearings, were very patient, and gave me suggestions and recommendations when I asked for them. They were very approachable and I felt like I could ask questions and that they would be responsive if something urgent and living space related would have come up. They strike me as natural hosts.

The room and bathroom were both lovely, neat, and well stocked with linens. The living room and kitchen were also free of clutter and relaxing. I had everything I needed. Other houseguests/visitors I met during my stay were all friendly, polite, and interesting people as well. I slept great! In addition, the nights I was out late, they left the porch light as well as a small living room lamp on for me-- very much appreciated and welcoming.

The neighborhood is AWESOME. I am glad I chose to stay there-- it was tough to get a sense of Seattle since I had never visited so I was guessing but the location was truly convenient. It is close to the 5, 10 minutes from downtown without traffic (with public transit available), and I had an easy time visiting shoreline, mercer island, pike, and bothell. But the best part is probably the district the house is in itself-- there were many coffee shops and eateries to explore, as well as udub, all within walking distance. It was really nice to have a break from driving and more fun and relaxing to explore on foot. In addition, parking outside the house was very easy. A great balance of urban and hip with plenty of convenience."
16633	7247720	10.0	10.0	44583733	I stay at a lot of Airbnbs when I travel for work but I can honestly say that Scott and Delmis were some of the greatest hosts I have encountered. They made me feel very welcome in their beautiful, comfortable home. The location is excellent right in the U district and they even included a list of their recommended restaurants and things to do in the area. A++++
16634	7247720	10.0	10.0	45869740	Scott and Delmis were better hosts than we could've ever dreamed of. Amazing space and they had never ending helpful advice of spots to visit, activities to do, and places to eat. They truly open up their home to you (we woke up to pancakes the first morning) and make you feel welcomed and comfortable. The room itself was great and the house was incredible. Literally, the perfect hosts. 
16635	7247720	10.0	10.0	47399750	Scott and Delmis were very friendly and I immediately felt welcome in their home. The room/bath, community space, and amenities were as described and the location is very close to the University. While I was on a busy schedule in Seattle (gone early/back late), I did not have the opportunity to utilize all of the amenities and the hosts were very respectful of my rest and privacy. Great hosts! I look forward to a return stay on my next trip to Seattle.
16636	7247720	10.0	10.0	47853443	"Staying here again for the second time was great! Scott & Delmis are great hosts and have the answers what's fun and where to go.
I really don't want to write a review as this is such gem & secret in the city I don't want to share. BUT it really is worth your time & money and a great place to stay while you visit Seattle. 
- Dana Baird"
16637	7247720	10.0	10.0	48397432	Scott and Delmis have a lovely house and were great hosts! The key code entry was super convenient. Room is cute and clean. The neighborhood is close to UW, about a 20min walk.  I didn't end up cooking, but it's nice to have kitchen amenities in case!
16638	7247720	10.0	10.0	49754206	Scott and Delmis were great hosts. Super friendly and great communication. The room was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this stay for friends. 
16639	7247720	10.0	10.0	52764502	Excellent space in a great part of town, plenty of room and privacy, along with great suggestions from Scott and Delmis (Morsel and CPG were both awesome).  Great price for being so close to the Univ. District, along with just a 20 minute drive to just about anything you could want to do in Seattle (Fremont, Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, etc.)  Cozy room with a shower attached, can't go wrong.
16640	7247720	10.0	10.0	55219137	Scott and Delmis were consummate hosts!  They provided very useful information prior to our trip that made access and logistics very easy.  Parking was readily available on the street in front (with pass).  The bedroom, adjacent living room, kitchen and bathroom are beautifully appointed.  The house is located conveniently near bus lines, I-5, the University District and the University of Washington campus.  Scott and Delmis  also provided very useful information about recommended local restaurants and events.  We thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with our hosts and with the other guests.  We certainly will return when we next come to visit our son at UW, and we highly recommend this as a convenient, friendly and extremely attractive destination for anyone traveling to Seattle.
17646	2727984	10.0	10.0	45040625	Alan is very welcoming and available to help! He has a beautiful home and the garden is lovely. Very relaxing way to spend the morning. 
18891	4565370	10.0	9.0	23412849	Rachel and Jon were extremely friendly and welcomed us into their home when we arrived. They also invited us to take part in their Thanksgiving dinner! Their home is beautiful and the room I stayed in was very comfortable. Brigitte, their cat, made sure we felt at home during our stay. Their place is in a quiet neighbourhood and convenient for accessing other parts of Seattle.
18892	4565370	10.0	9.0	23611581	Jon and Rachel are very outgoing and friendly; they put me at ease and I felt at home immediately.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable with a warm comforter that kept me cozy during a couple of cold winter nights.  It is a unique house just as they described it with interesting interior touches.  You will feel right at home here.
18893	4565370	10.0	9.0	23927928	Excellent stay with Rachel and Jon. Their home is great, wonderfully located, and very comfortable and tastefully decorated. They even offered to share dinner with us! Our only regret was having to leave on an early flight the next morning!
18894	4565370	10.0	9.0	25275217	We felt super comfortable at Rachel and Jon's place. Rachel was very welcoming and flexible with our schedule - she let us check in early and check out later. Their home is lovely and in a decent location near Capitol Hill, but a bit of a walk to downtown. They are superb hosts and did a great job of making sure we felt welcome. 
18895	4565370	10.0	9.0	25488345	Jon and Rachel have a lovely home. The stay was perfect - comfortable and convenient. And they were very flexible hosts. 
18896	4565370	10.0	9.0	26276679	Rachel and Jon were very kind and accommodating. It was easy setting up an arrival and they even wrote us a great selection of breakfast spots for the morning of our departure. The house and our room are BEAUTIFUL! Love all the decor in this character home. Our bed was super comfortable and their cat was a gem. The neighbourhood was central to everywhere we needed to go. Highly recommended and we will definitely look to stay here again! 
18897	4565370	10.0	9.0	26380201	I could have great time at this place. The whole house (room, washroom, kitchen etc) is so clean. And it's nice location. Also the hosts (Rachel and Jon) are so friendly.
18898	4565370	10.0	9.0	26715184	Rachel and John were very nice and welcoming hosts. The house is charming and in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown. I would definitely stay again with them.
18899	4565370	10.0	9.0	27109734	We had a fantastic stay at Rachel & Jon's lovely home. We had a warm welcome from Rachel & their beautiful cat Briggie, which was a nice surprise. Our room was great, comfy bed, lots of space, liked the decor. Everything about our stay was perfect, felt at home there. Was easy getting the bus into town, also found a great local cafe, Cheeky cafe for the best breakfast & you are very close to some nice Chinese & Vietnamese food! We enjoyed our chats with Rachel too. Thank you for making our last stay in an AirBnB for a while so wonderful! We will miss all the lovely people we have met in our last year of traveling.
18900	4565370	10.0	9.0	28085350	Better than photos. Rachel and John's home has a lovely aesthetic with sleek, wordly and vintage appeal. Tidy and uncluttered. This place could be in a magazine. Bedroom has high ceilings and an incredibly comfortable bed and blankets. Beautiful kitchen. Bathroom is lovely, too. Hosts were highly flexible. Brigitte (cat) likes to snuggle. Neighborhood is an Uber or bus ride from downtown and lively spots like Capitol Hill. We used the bus routes heavily and walked only a few blocks to a well-connected bus. Highly recommended. 
18901	4565370	10.0	9.0	28797931	Had a fantastic time in The Reading Room.  We were in town for a conference, and as such were quite busy, but have nothing but good things to say about our hosts and their lovely home.  They were very welcoming, gave great advice, and welcomed us above and beyond.  And they have excellent taste in furniture, and an even more wonderful cat.  Highly recommended.
18902	4565370	10.0	9.0	29945910	These guys are just amazing. They are both so chilled out and happy to help with anything possible. Location is superb. A 2 min walk will have you on a bus heading into downtown Seattle. Or if you fancy walking it, which will take you 30 mins or so. I'd recommend these guys to everyone. 
18903	4565370	10.0	9.0	30827908	"Rachel and Jon are just the sweetest! Thank you both for the lovely room, and your generosity. Your home is very close to everything ""Seattle;"" I definitely recommend! I felt comfortable and safe, and will absolutely check for an available room with you next time I come that way!"
18904	4565370	10.0	9.0	30905041	It was a very short but sweet stay in this beautiful house. Rachel was very friendly and accommodating (we never met Jon). Lovely bedrooms and an excellent location; we had no problems finding parking near the house. The cat was also very friendly too!
18905	4565370	10.0	9.0	32488777	The host canceled this reservation 66 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18906	4565370	10.0	9.0	33580096	Both Rachel and Jon are very welcoming and accommodating throughout my stay. The house is bright and airy, and is a wonderful place to stay. It's a short bus/taxi ride into the main Seattle city center, and is within walking distance to cafes and grocers. It is a fantastic place for your Seattle visit, to get away from the noise of the city and experience the neighbourhoods. I highly recommend staying here!
18907	4565370	10.0	9.0	34459782	"Rachel & Jon were very warm and welcoming, as was their home --  an older frame structure, decorated with an austere elegance: Uncluttered, very clean, but cozy and woody and organic. The Reading Room has a bed, night stand and a chair, as well as a few shelves of books, ranging from French texts to Thomas Pynchon novels. The bed was quite comfortable, though I had to tread carefully down the wooden steps when I had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. 
The neighborhood is centrally located in Seattle, fifteen minutes' drive from most key places in town. There's a very nice coffee shop a block and a half away.  "
18908	4565370	10.0	9.0	35085497	Rachel and John are generous and friendly hosts eager to share their home (and a variety of delicious snacks). If you want great company and host interaction, their place is the place for you. They keep their home tidy and have great suggestions for area activities and locations.  Brigitte the cat has tons of charisma and really, really wants your attention. A cool spot!
18909	4565370	10.0	9.0	36665542	Jon and Rachel have a lovely home in a neighbourhood that is in close proximity to downtown Seattle. Although we had a rental car we chose to walk to the downtown area on our first full day. The walk was pleasant and took about 25 minutes. The house has high ceilings and large windows and is very tastefully decorated in a minimalist style that allows one to enjoy the space. Jon and Rachel were very friendly and welcoming. They graciously provided complementary tea bags, coffee, fruit and a few other treats. We enjoyed chatting with them at the breakfast table and felt welcome to share their kitchen and dining area with them. Everything was as described. The weekend of our stay Seattle was experiencing a heat wave. The room was warm for sleeping but Jon and Rachel did their best to provide ventilation by setting up fans, etc. A great place to stay when visiting Seattle!
18910	4565370	10.0	9.0	41200942	It was a perfect stay in Seattle. Our hosts helped us a lot to find restaurants and shops. Without  Rachel and John it wouldn't have been that amazing
18911	4565370	10.0	9.0	41330503	We loved our time at Rachel and Jons house! It was a lovely space, the room was great and a good size. The rest of the house was beautiful and relaxing. The bathroom was clean. All together a great place to stay!!
18912	4565370	10.0	9.0	43032403	Rachel and Jon were very welcoming during my long stay. The house was clean, and occasional fresh fruits (sometimes from their garden) were provided! The neighborhood is very safe and it only takes about 15-20 minute walk to get to the lively Capitol Hill. The only minor problem about the house was that there is only 1 bathroom, so sometimes it can be a little bit inconvenient...Overall, I think I fell in love with Seattle partly because of this nice airbnb experience! It made me feel right at home! 
18913	4565370	10.0	9.0	46135290	We had a delightful overnight stay in this lovely home. We felt very welcome, not just in our room but throughout the house. Rachel provided great and interesting company that kept us up chatting later than we intended! We would highly recommend this home to anyone. 
18914	4565370	10.0	9.0	46495997	We enjoyed staying with Rachel and John during our time in Seattle. The house was lovely, decorated with beautiful art throughout and the room was very comfortable. We were out and about during the majority of our time there however they answered any questions and provided everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Their cat Brigitte is the sweetest! She welcomed us at the door when we arrived. The location was a great! Just under 10 minutes and about 6 bucks for an Uber to Pike Place Market and many attractions downtown. We would definitely stay there again if in Seattle!
18915	4565370	10.0	9.0	46882869	"We had an amazing time at John and Rachel's place! Rachel did everything she could in order for us to enjoy our stay and make the most of the short time we spent in Seattle. The room was very comfy and was basically exactly what we've been looking for. We left with a very posotive impression of the city and the neighborhood and we will definitely come stay here again when in Seattle.
"
18916	4565370	10.0	9.0	48698424	"Staying with Rachel and Jon was great! The house is beautiful, clean and in true Seattle style. There were plenty of clean towels, and they provided an easy way to get in and out. They even let us check-in early so that we could store our bags and get headed out on the town! (They also have an adorable cat!)

It‚Äôs in a great part of town, too! Walking distance to the University, and all of the bars/restaurants in Capitol Hill. Not too far from other tourist attractions like the Space Needle, EMP Museum, etc. either. Though, a nice quiet place to rest at night. All in all: Great trip!

Our only bummer was not having more time in Seattle so that we could hangout with Rachel & Jon a bit. 

We would definitely suggest staying at the Farmhouse to anyone looking to be in the city ‚Äî no better location or room!"
18917	4565370	10.0	9.0	52134859	Staying with Rachel and Jon was phenomenal. The location was great for where we needed to be in Seattle.

18918	4565370	10.0	9.0	52837254	"Rachel and Jon were the perfect hosts during our short stay in Seattle!

Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!
18921	4565370	10.0	9.0	55966290	Had a fabulous stay with Rachel and Jon. Though visiting just for one night, we felt instantly welcomed in their space- an absolutely stunning home with so many thoughtful details. We had the pleasure of enjoying coffee and breakfast with Rachel and Jon on the morning of our departure and just couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Lovely home and even lovelier hosts! 
19337	6675927	10.0	9.0	34594524	Jon was a great a host. This was my first bnb experience and he made it a great one. The room was super big and clean, the house was perfect lots of things to entertain yourself if you feel like staying in. The location was great close enough to all the restaurants and bars. He was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. Thanks again for everything!
19338	6675927	10.0	9.0	35153883	We had an awesome experience here. The space was accurately described in the listing. When we arrived everything was very clean and Jon had left fresh towels, soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and clean bathrobes for us to use. We felt very comfortable during our stay. I would 100% come back for another stay. 
19339	6675927	10.0	9.0	35591591	This is our first time using Airbnb and Jon has made the experience a great one. Jon is a super friendly and helpful host who had given us a lot of info about where to eat and go. The house is gorgeous and super spacious. The host has a great taste of the arrangement and selection of furnitures and decorations which provides us a cozy and comfortable environment. The location is great. It is only half block from Safeway grocery store and only one block from the #11 bus station which takes you directly to downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend Jon's house to you.
19340	6675927	10.0	9.0	35852982	"This listing was as described and less than 10 minutes of downtown and Pike's Place. There were lots of restaurants, bars, and stores all around. The neighborhood was safe and specifically his 4 unit residential area, was gated too. 

The home was spacious, very clean, and organized. Jon was super welcoming and messaged me to feel free to the snacks and liquor on the counter. I met him once the night before I left and he was very friendly. 

The master bedroom was so spacious and had a walk in closet for all our stuff to go into. The bed was super comfy. The bathroom was a shared bathroom and was kept very clean. Made sharing a bathroom easy. "

19342	6675927	10.0	9.0	36707206	Jon's place is very comfortable, clean and in a great location. The apartment has all the amenities of home (and then some!) and Jon makes you feel very welcomed. I would definitely stay there again. 
19343	6675927	10.0	9.0	37223551	"Jon's space was a great place to stay while on vacation in Seattle. We were able to utilize the kitchen for breakfast and such which was of great convenience. Location was great, a block from the supermarket close to things to do in Capitol Hill.

Jon was very responsive when it came to communication. While we didn't see him much, he messaged us as to when air-conditioners were on the way (as it was abnormally hot for Seattle that week) and was quick to answer when I needed a hair dryer.

Definitely a great place to stay if you're looking for a longer stay, such as week."
19344	6675927	10.0	9.0	37677252	Jon is a fantastic host. His place is clean and well appointed, and he makes certain the kitchen stays stocked with items that guests are welcome to consume. He was very helpful giving directions and recommendations and accomdated our special requests with grace. The house is in a great neighborhood where you can walk to several bars, a grocery store, coffee shops, or hop on a bus that takes you all around town. Highly recommended!
19345	6675927	10.0	9.0	37805137	Great location close to food, shopping and night life. Gracious host and awesome space. Hope I get lucky enough to say with Jon when I visit Seattle again. Made my friends 1st trip to Seattle and my 1st BnB experience really great. 
19346	6675927	10.0	9.0	38620714	"We were immediately greeted and offered refreshments.  Beautiful ambiance, generous with their offerings of comfort.
Kitchen fully stocked for guests, coffee made for the start of each of the three mornings.
Kindly helped me receive my special delivery package: my passport.
Grocery store 1/2 block away.
Busses into town easily available.
We really enjoyed the restaurants nearby, especially The Skillet.
We felt very safe both in the neighborhood as well the city, at large"
19347	6675927	10.0	9.0	39226559	Jon was a fantastic host- extremely friendly, hospitable, clean, and accommodating. He made our stay in Capitol Hill very convenient, affordable, and comfortable. His knowledge of the area is a huge plus, providing maps, books, and personal advice for what to see and do in the area. His place is gorgeous and conveniently located to shopping, public transit, and restaurants. We felt very comfortable staying here, allowing us the option of lounging in his living room watching Netflix after a long, hot day! Jon made our stay memorable and gave us a great first experience with AirBnb! We would definitely stay here again. :-)
19348	6675927	10.0	9.0	39357572	Excellent, clean and very comfortable place. Really enjoyed my stay there. This is highly recommended place to stay, in a nice calm Seattle area.
19349	6675927	10.0	9.0	39559376	Jon's house was clean and well appointed. It was the perfect place for me to crash after a very taxing week of training. I would go back without hesitation.  Tougo coffee is a about a half mile away, and worth the walk up the hill!
19350	6675927	10.0	9.0	39705138	The stay was very short due to a hectic business schedule. The home was lovely and clean and Jon was very accommodating to a late arrival and very early departure. 
19351	6675927	10.0	9.0	39952566	I was not welcomed by the host, but his partner was polite. Our host was not in the city for our duration of the stay. I was not impressed with not being able to get into contact with our host especially when we had to call the fire department for a carbon monoxide alarm. I was not impressed by this and did not feel safe. I expected safety and available communication more so if  a host is not going to be present. Later that day after informing Jon's partner, it had come to our attention that Jon had been in communication with his partner, yet this information was not passed on. 
19352	6675927	10.0	9.0	40649639	Jon is a great host. He is super helpful, communicate in a very clear and friendly way. He is hospitable and interested in his guests. His Generosity is above and beyond. 
19353	6675927	10.0	9.0	40991071	Nicely furnished, spacious apartment with common space and kitchen downstairs, private bedrooms upstairs.  Had a friendly generous atmosphere.  Large screen TV, upscale coffee/tea service, computer all available.  Close to bus line, and walk downtown not unreasonable.  Would definitely use this listing again.  Thanks
19354	6675927	10.0	9.0	42233138	This house is awesome! Great location, very clean and well decorated, and Jon was responsive when I got in touch. It was really nice to have the numeric keypad entry instead of having to keep track of keys. Parking was easy to find. Would definitely stay here again! 
19355	6675927	10.0	9.0	42325640	"We enjoyed our stay at Jon Shepherd's place.  The room was spacious; the bed was uber comfortable!  There were some nice touches -lovely soap, toothbrush and paste, and these melt-in-your mouth mints (Dilantante, or something like that which we found in a chocolate shop closeby).  

In the morning, we enjoyed coffee, fruit, cereal and conversation with two other guests staying at Jon's.  I would recommend   his place, located in the Capital Hill area."
19356	6675927	10.0	9.0	42584802	Jon's home was lovely and in a great location. They were extremely accommodating and made our stay as comfortable as possible. Would definitely stay there again when we pass through Seattle. 
19357	6675927	10.0	9.0	43440570	The room is sooo beautiful and spacious, the bed is comfortable. My friend and I both had a great time stay there!! Jon also provided us pretty much everything in his house( fruit, bread, cereal,  wines(YES! THERE IS WINE!)) The only pity was that we didn't get a chance to say hi to Jon face to face.
19358	6675927	10.0	9.0	43664469	Jon's place was great! The bedroom was spacious and very clean. He provided a lot of great travel necessities such as maps, suggestions, and extra toiletries. Capitol Hill was a great place to stay as well. There were a lot of great places within walking distance. Jon was extremely friendly and welcome. I would highly recommend this place.
19359	6675927	10.0	9.0	43987617	Jon's place was awesome and Jon was a great host. The location is great. You can walk to many restaurants and transit options. The house is really nice and we enjoyed sharing it with the other guests and Jon. Jon was also very flexible with a later then expected check in due to flight delays.  We would definitely stay here again!
19360	6675927	10.0	9.0	44661804	Can't say enough about Jon and Dave. We had the run of the house, refrigerator and liquor cabinet. Felt right at home the minute we walked into the house. Great conversationalists for the short times we saw them. Loved stories of Dave's childhood in the small town Washington mountains. Bed was very comfortable; kitchen facilities adequate, and although we planned on using them, didn't have the opportunity to do so. Great location, especially for food shopping (2 blocks) and free (street) parking. Would definitely stay there again!!
19361	6675927	10.0	9.0	44819080	We had a pleasant stay at jon's place. The room was clean and quiet and Jon was a very friendly host. Would stay there again in the future. 
19362	6675927	10.0	9.0	45453481	I was pleasantly surprised by how beautiful this unit is. Gorgeous wood interior, comfortable bed, kitchen fully stocked. Jon is amazing, he obviously takes this seriously and is available to help whenever needed. I was leaving for the airport later the next day, and it wasn't a problem for my bags to hang out there a while longer. Great to work with someone so accommodating. 
19363	6675927	10.0	9.0	45984731	"We felt very welcome and comfortable in Jon's house.  He was very generous, making his kitchen and food  available to us.   He even offered us a beer or cocktail on our arrival.  

The house is in a residential neighborhood on a busy street, with ample free street parking near by, and easy access to great shops and restaurants near by.  

I definitely recommend staying here."
19364	6675927	10.0	9.0	46408224	Soooo good! I will choose again when we come to Seattle again!!!
19365	6675927	10.0	9.0	46955692	"Jon's place was beautiful. I love the hard wood. The place was impeccably clean. 

The neighborhood was cute and quiet but walkable to the bars in capitol hill. I also used the bus to get downtown and it was very easy and cheap. I loved Seattle and am now seriously considering moving there. 

Jon was also incredibly helpful with recommendations of things to do. We never would have known about the grove of the patriarchs at Mount Rainier national park and it was definitely a highlight of my trip. Thanks Jon!"
19366	6675927	10.0	9.0	48777964	Good location, clean & comfy digs. We were in town for 2 days/nights and were looking for someplace to crash at in the evenings. Jon's space was ideal. We arrived late in the evening on the first day, and decided to stay in. Jon was nice enough to offer us wine/spirits while we relaxed. 
19367	6675927	10.0	9.0	49856086	Jon was a great host ! He made me and my friend feel just at home.. He is extremely knowledgeable of the area and fun things to do.. We had a great time at his place and all the conversations that followed throughout the stay!  
19368	6675927	10.0	9.0	50154566	My partner and I decided last minute to spend one more night in Seattle during our PNW trip, and Jon was very quick to respond to our booking request. We got to meet him for a brief amount of time and he was very nice and accommodating. His place is a seriously ideal location - a short walk to a ton of great bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. The spot itself was clean and very welcoming. Thanks Jon! 
19369	6675927	10.0	9.0	50501439	Great location near downtown Seattle. Walking distance to Capitol Hill which is a lively and vibrant district of Seattle for nightlife. Jon was very accomodating and welcoming towards me while staying in his home. The room itself was spacious and comfortable.
19370	6675927	10.0	9.0	50902335	Jon's place blew our air bnb expectations out of the water ‚ù§ we have never stayed anywhere so great through air bnb, house was safe, easy access and so clean! -- the hosts were a perfect mix of attentive and accomodating, have us plenty of space to do our work but were so friendly.. Wished every experience was this good!
19371	6675927	10.0	9.0	51638137	This is about my 4th airbnb, and quite possibly the best.  Jon ( and David) we're very personable and helpful.  The home and room we're beautifully decorated and maintained.  The bed was very comfortable.  As hosts they we're very thoughtful and accomodating while maintaining privacy for everyone.  Just an overall great experience!!!
19372	6675927	10.0	9.0	51801108	Jon was a great friendly host. The house is cozy and nice. The bedroom is actually bigger than what I initially imagined. It was a very pleasant stay.
19373	6675927	10.0	9.0	53137694	Communication with Jon was good and we were made to feel welcomed in his home.  Jon and David were helpful in making suggestions to us since this was our first trip to Seattle. Location was great  - close to the bus or a short walk to restaurants, groceries. Bed was comfortable and tons of closet space for guests.
19374	6675927	10.0	9.0	53485174	Jon is a wonderful and welcoming host.  This was the second time we stayed in Jon's lovely home. We hope to stay with him every time we come to Seattle to visit our family.  We love it that Jon provides a clean, comfortable place to relax. It is quiet and cozy. The kitchen is so well stocked and he is very generous about sharing everything. We also love it that there is parking within walking distance. Remember - this is Seattle and parking is often hard to come by. Each bedroom has it's own heat/air control which made for greater comfort.  Thank you, Jon, for another great stay!
19375	6675927	10.0	9.0	54251244	This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful! My girlfriends and I decided on a weekend getaway to Seattle since we have never been and this place was an excellent home base location for all our tourist and adventure needs. There was construction going on in the street in front of the house, but it was still easily accessible using Lyfts and Ubers. Our flight arrived early and Jon was very accommodating by having our room ready a few hours early as we dropped off our bags and made ourselves comfortable in the living room. The place is very clean and well decorated with more amenities than I could ask for such as an accessible computer, Netflix, and board games. The room itself is spacious with a comfortable bed and large closet. You will be sharing the upstairs bathroom if there is another guest on the other room but there is also a half bathroom downstairs. Jon made us feel welcomed and gave us a good balance of interaction with privacy. The only thing I would warn about is that you can hear movement of other people throughout the house (footsteps upstairs when you are downstairs and vice versa) but if that doesn't bother you then you should be fine! I would definitely recommend!
19376	6675927	10.0	9.0	54557161	"This was my second visit to Jon's house.  This time I stayed in the master bedroom. It was very comfortable.  I find the location very convenient and will stay here again.  Thanks, John!
Lonnie (Patti's other half)"
19377	6675927	10.0	9.0	54897846	Jon's place is centrally located and very easy to get around to many places in Seattle which was a plus since we rented a car. Room is as described and bed was extremely comfortable. Did not see Jon too much since my bf and I were out exploring majority of the day but he was very accomodating and responded quickly to any questions we had. Light breakfast (cereal, toast, etc) and coffee/tea were made available to us which was extremely helpful and Jon was very kind and generous to also offer us some beverages. Overall, we had a great time and would recommend Jon's home to anyone visiting Seattle!
19378	6675927	10.0	9.0	55509219	Jon was out most of the time but the place was near to everything and we basically walked everywhere! Would definitely consider his place again if I am visiting. 
19379	6675927	10.0	9.0	56340783	Great place to hang, Jon and his mate were great hosts and I would be happy to stay again
19380	6675927	10.0	9.0	56891306	"Jon offers a very warm, friendly and relaxing home. He is a great host that goes above & beyond and I would definitely stay again. I felt very at home in Jon's house and he made it extra special with all the small touches he adds like filter coffee, light breakfast option of cereal, local books and pamphlets, toothpaste, soap etc.... 
Highly recommend staying with Jon!!"
19381	6675927	10.0	9.0	57093334	"What a great location and an inviting house. When we arrived our host was there to greet us and show us around. I'll admit that my partner and I were rather reclusive and tired during our one night stay but felt invited to enjoy the main rooms if we had wished to.

One more thing, the bed was amazingly comfortable and now I want one."
19382	6675927	10.0	9.0	57812387	"Jon's place was so much better than we expected. It was warm, beautiful, and perfect for staying for the holidays. Not only that, but Jon and his friend decided last minute to grab a Christmas tree and decorate, which was perfect for us and made it possible for us to have small Christmas gathering with my girlfriend's family. It gave us a place to put our gifts and filled the house with the smell of Christmas. There were labels on every important item and drawer in the kitchen, which made the space feel surprisingly welcome. We can't even begin to describe how wonderful it was! They clearly enjoy hosting and were  gracious with our needs and requests.

We'll definitely be looking at Jon's unit again for the next time we stay in Seattle!

P.S. My girlfriend loved the decor of the place, and wanted to thank our hosts for the small things like our guest towels, toothpaste & brushes."
21057	4238106	10.0	10.0	46093775	Grace and Jared were great! Their place is in a convenient location and and they are very nice people. I would stay here again if I'm ever in Seattle. 
21058	4238106	10.0	10.0	47112533	"Our stay with Grace was super good. She's nice and friendly, Jared was away during our trip. Grace went out of her way to give us peace and privacy but also interacted with us. We went out for breakfast together. Her tips on the area and the restaurants were really good. 

Apartment is very clean and beautiful. No worries there. Bed fits two easily even if they are friens sharing a bed like we were. 

Located walking distance to down town and the waterfront. Next to the trendy Capitoll Hill bars and restaurants area. 

I will stay again if I go to Seattle. Perfect first airbnb experience. Thank you Grace! Hope to see you in Finland some day.."
21059	4238106	10.0	10.0	48212647	Grace's Air BnB was perfect for a more local feel of Seattle! The neighborhood was great and we were never worried about our car. The apartment itself was beautifully decorated and very homey, and our room was small, but no complaints since we got a king sized bed and were only there to sleep. We didn't meet Jared but Grace was an amazing host! Despite her busy schedule and not being able to see her much, she regularly checked in on my boyfriend and I -- that's more than I could have asked for. I would definitely recommend Grace and Jared's home for anyone who wants a very local experience -- we were less than 15 minutes away from all of Seattle's amazing sites, food, parks, etc. 
21060	4238106	10.0	10.0	49151906	"Grace and Jared had to go out of town last minute and weren't going to be home when we arrived. Instead of canceling on us, they provided easy instructions on how we could get into the apartment for our first night. Once back in town, we were met happily by both Grace and Jared. Both provided helpful advice on our plans while visiting. Jared had to go out of town again the following day and Grace was working nights, so we had a lot of privacy while staying at their apartment.
Grace and Jared's apartment was super cozy and welcoming. It was a wonderful room with a large, comfy king sized bed. We also had access to the kitchen and living room, both of which were very comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked and easy to use. The location was super convenient to downtown, the Seattle center and Lake Union. We biked everywhere quite easily- once we got used to the hills. 
My first airbnb experience with Grace and Jared was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I would suggest their place to anyone interested in staying in Seattle!!"
21061	4238106	10.0	10.0	49692743	"I absolutely loved staying over at Grace's place. It's so close to downtown Seattle and the room is really nice and cozy. Not only did I love the location of the place, but the host Grace was really kind and accommodating to our needs. She had a very well thought out travel recommendation printed out for us as well. 
All in all, I highly recommend anyone planning to stay in Seattle to check out Grace's place. You will not be disappointed!"
21062	4238106	10.0	10.0	51562994	Communication with Grace and Jared was easy, quick and thoughtful (they checked to make sure I got into their place okay as they were out of town on the first few days I was there and to see if I needed anything). I only had the pleasure of meeting Grace, she was very warm and welcoming! I barely heard a peep from them or neighbours considering it's an old building. They had a beautiful home, with everything you could need for a visit to Seattle including a welcome package of recommendations! The house is a thoughtfully put together home with beautifully personal touches which was comforting to me as I was a little homesick being so far from home. Felt more like visiting a friends place! Perfect location to walk, ride or bus to downtown, Capitol Hill or CenturyLink (where I spent most of my time during my visit). Everything was clean and dust free. The bed was huge and super comfortable and the shower was great (things I usually miss about being at home, but not at Grace and Jareds)!
26609	9374358	10.0	10.0	54218269	"This was our best AirBnB experience yet! 

The studio is nicely decorated, spacious and comfortable. Parking in downtown Seattle is expensive so having a space right across the street was incredibly convenient. Nick was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed. There is a laundry room which was an unexpected plus after our evening of oysters. Although we weren't planning on watching TV, we were glad to be able to catch the Seahawks game on cable.

The building is very quiet - populated by young professionals, as described in the ad. The studio is on the ground floor and there is some road noise in the morning and at night, but I was fine with earplugs.

Pike Place market is just a short walk away and there is a Kress IGA pretty close. 

All in all, we had a great experience and highly recommend this space for Seattle travelers. "
26610	9374358	10.0	10.0	54471770	"Sharayah made sure her boyfriend was there to greet us at the time we had agreed upon. He was super polite and made sure everything was taken care of for us. We felt very welcome and he was more than happy to provide us with information about the neighborhood. It was super convenient to have a parking spot included in our stay!

Sharayah followed up later that day with a phone call to make sure things were going well. They were very wonderful people and I highly recommend staying here, especially if you are wanting to be within walking distance of downtown Seattle. She even let us check out a little later than we had planned, since we had a tour that ran later than expected.

Thank you for being so welcoming and flexible!! "
26611	9374358	10.0	10.0	54824617	A fantastic apartment in the heart of Seattle won't disappoint. The hosts are helpful and friendly and the premises is clean, convenient and cozy. This was one of the best finds of our entire trip. 
26612	9374358	10.0	10.0	55830671	Clean and comfortable place in an amazing location. Easy walk to Convention Center, Pike Market and Monorail. Nice view of Space Needle from the entrance! Really convenient parking spot. Good dining places in the same block. The hosts were attentive and helpful, and flexible with our check-in and check-out times. Would definitely stay here again. 
26613	9374358	10.0	10.0	56334383	Sharayah's place was perfect for my trip, super cozy space with everything you need to feel at home. Centrally located to food and nightlife. Will definitely recommend to anyone visiting. Thanks Sharayah!
26614	9374358	10.0	10.0	57255525	"The studio is a great place to stay! It's excellently located, just few minutes from Pike's market, and few minutes from the Needle. There's a small supermarket 2 doors away in case of need, and the parking is super easy to access. The suite's kitchen has anything you need to make breakfast, and everything was perfectly clean and in place when we arrived. A thing that we appreciated was the wifi, which was reliable and strong. 
Although we didn't get to meet Sharayah, she left us clear instructions of how to access the suite, and her husband was available in case of need -- very nice people both. We'd stay here again and recommend it to everyone!"
26656	6228474	10.0	9.0	35675583	"From the very first contact to the day of our departure, I will say that this experience has been phenomenal. Absolutely everything exceeded our expectations. The condo was very modern and spacious. The bedroom was large and the bed was super comfy. the televisions were great. The bathroom was fantastic! The kitchen was perfect and the view of Puget Sound was stunning. The condo is located in Belltown and if you want to experience down town Seattle, this is in a great location. We rented bicycles and had them delivered and picked up. Very convenient way to get around in a big city. Takes a lot of the hassle of parking and the fees associated with renting a car out of the traveling experience. I would highly recommend renting bikes if you are going to stay in town. There is a great Pizza place right next door to this condo and a bunch of very fun bars and night clubs on the same block. In my opinion, the owner of this unit which I had the pleasure of meeting on the second to last day of our trip, did an excellent job of decorating and furnishing this condo. It truly shows that they care about the people that rent it from them and that they are not just cashing a check when people use it. As a consumer and customer, this makes me feel like I got a great deal and that makes me feel good!

Thank you so much for everything, really!

26657	6228474	10.0	9.0	40961895	"We had a nice time in this apartment ‚Äì it is very comfortable, well-decorated, and even included small amenities like shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom, which was nice. It is centrally located within Belltown, walking distance to downtown Seattle and with easy access by transit or otherwise to other parts of town. I should note that with this listing you are getting less of that true Airbnb experience and more of a ""hotel-like"" stay. The check-in process and overall accommodation confirms this. In fact, many units in this building are used likely exclusively for short-stay listings (Airbnb or otherwise). Also, the hosts run their own short-stay company and they co-list on Airbnb ‚Äì they'll even direct you to their own application and website for parts of the check-in process. And I would advice checking their own site for lower rates on the same unit."
26658	6228474	10.0	9.0	51925080	"I was pleasantly surprised to find that the photos shown in the listing were exact representations of the place itself.  The place is clean, tidy, and extremely welcoming.  From the initial conversation with the host (answering my many questions) to making sure I was prepared for check-in.  The apartment itself had all the amenities of home, including fantastic tips on local areas (some popular, some lesser known).  Location is fantastic, within walking distance to major Seattle attractions and fantastic restaurants/bars are steps away from the front door.  

Best of all, this place is just...complete.  What do I mean?  Many other airbnb listings seem to throw together features to form one complete place, quite reminiscent of my bachelor days.  This place is so well put together that I'm now re-evaluating the choices I've made in my own home!

I'll definitely be staying here when I visit Seattle again.  Thanks Darik and to all the team members that were a part of my stay."
26808	3673759	10.0	10.0	16524058	This place was great! The apartment is in an excellent location and has everything you could possibly need. Comfortable bed, nice layout, TV with Roku, and even a guide on what to check out in the area. Amy was extremely helpful whenever I had any questions and everything went smoothly. If I'm back in Seattle anytime soon this will be my first choice in accommodations. Thanks again Amy!
26809	3673759	10.0	10.0	16801598	"The apartment is really cute and very clean. The first night I arrived late, so Amy left the keys in a lock box. It was a bit warm that first night, but when I told Amy she quickly brought over a portable air conditioner, which worked great. 

The neighborhood is great, and I would stay there again. "
26810	3673759	10.0	10.0	16937804	"I really enjoyed my one night stay in this apartment. The place is small - I'd recommend it for one person or two people if you were planning on spending most of your visit outside exploring. I walked to Pike Place Market (15 min ) walk and Portage Bay Cafe (15 min in the other direction) and Whole Foods (10 min on the way to Portage Bay). The apt had everything I needed, including Amy's binder of things to do and see around Seattle.

I didn't get to meet Amy, but she did provide SUPER clear instructions on how to get into the place and made it clear that she was available if I needed anything. 

The kitchen had everything you need to cook a meal at home, including my very favorite kitchen tool - an electric tea kettle!"
26811	3673759	10.0	10.0	17303163	Amy was very friendly & had all the info I needed in a binder.  The place was very clean & she even provided a few groceries for me.  It was great that she installed an a/c since Seattle can be hot in the summer.  The neighborhood had plenty of great restaurants & was convenient to attractions.
26812	3673759	10.0	10.0	17466551	Host was very nice and accommodating. She even bought a huge AC unit which helped on two very hot summer nights in Seattle, which is very rare to have AC in Seattle. This place is in the PERFECT location, 5 minutes to the space needle, pugent sound, and so many restaurants and bars, it was hard to pick one. Parking was also surprisingly easy to find, would come back again.
26813	3673759	10.0	10.0	17702059	This place was great! Right next to the space needle and a short walk to downtown and pikes market. Very clean inside with everything you may need for your stay including maps and attraction information. Very easy to reach Amy with questions. I would definitely stay here again next time we are in Seattle!
26814	3673759	10.0	10.0	17862520	Amy's condo in Belltown was perfect for our weekend trip to Seattle. The location was the best part-walkable to Pike's market, the Space needle, anywhere downtown. The space was clean and very well laid out. Amy was wonderful in answering any and all questions we had and her response time was very fast. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to explore the heart of Seattle. A couple things-if you love pizza, you have to try Serious Pie. It's a ten minute walk from the condo. Amazing! Also, there is a rooftop community area in the building. Gorgeous views of the city with seating areas and BBQ's. It was the perfect place to sip wine in the evening. 
26815	3673759	10.0	10.0	18487747	"This apartment is an awesome location.  We arrived by train and took a quick ($10 with tip) cab to the location.  It was very easy to get in and then we walked everywhere during our vacation including Pikes Place, Space Needle, and even down to Pioneer Square.  It was so great to not have to worry about parking because we were right in the middle of town and could walk everywhere.   

Amy was awesome to work with, she communicated clearly and we had no problems at all.  It was a very enjoyable stay in Seattle"
26816	3673759	10.0	10.0	18624542	Amy was a delightful host. She met us in person the day we arrived, was very accommodating with an earlier arrival time and made a point to make us feel at home. Her place is lovely, central and very comfortable. 
26817	3673759	10.0	10.0	18730161	Amy made us feel so welcome in her apartment, which was super clean and comfy! The location was awesome - right near the space needle! The view from the rooftop patio at night was really great. There is a secure place to lock your bike, and it's easy to get around to Seattle sights from the apartment.  If you're in Seattle, this is a great place to stay! 
26818	3673759	10.0	10.0	19137607	"This was my first airbnb experience, and it was great! I was in town for a wedding, and the apartment was very centrally located, so I could go to any of the wedding events, and still be in a great area to walk around in and explore in my off time.
Amy was very welcoming and communicative, she was very helpful and kept in touch to make sure that we had made it in ok, and that everything was as expected.
I could not have asked for a better experience with airbnb, it was comfortable, easy and cost-efficient. I would definitely stay here again!"
26819	3673759	10.0	10.0	19605929	Place was great, everything you need. Great location in the heart of Belltown. Amy was super accommodating.  Would definitely stay again.
26820	3673759	10.0	10.0	20426944	Very cozy and clean apartment in a perfect location!  Host was very easy to reach and provided tons of useful information about the apartment and things to do nearby.
26821	3673759	10.0	10.0	21224668	We felt very welcome. Access was easy from the highway or about 8 blocks from the airport Link. The apartment was clean and comfy. We slept very well. The location was great. We walked everywhere throughout Belltown to the market, to South Lake Union, to Capital Hill. Amy was very accommodating and helpful.
26822	3673759	10.0	10.0	21874764	Amy was a great host and made sure our trip would be awesome by leaving information out about the surrounding neighborhood. The location of the apartment is ideal since there are a lot of bars and restaurants within walking distance. I would recommend this place if you want to  have a good home base to walk Seattle.
26823	3673759	10.0	10.0	22293855	Amy's apartment was great and exactly as pictured. It was ideally located to walk to everything in the downtown area. She was communicative and provided lots of information.
26824	3673759	10.0	10.0	22663569	"I don't think we could have asked for a better host for our first time using Air BnB. She left great instructions on how to get into the unit, provided a binder full of information such as places to eat, play, and shop, there were snacks, television, and the place was clean and tidy! The listing was definitely accurate. The surrounding neighborhood was exactly what we were looking for. We were walking distance to the Space Needle (which you can see if you step outside onto the sidewalk of the apartment building), there were plenty of restaurants and bars to eat and drink at within walking distance, and Pike's Place Market was a pleasant walk as well!

My girlfriend and I were very happy with the well-equipped, well-kept, and comfortable accommodations. We would definitely stay here again."
26825	3673759	10.0	10.0	22801996	"Very cozy, just enough room for 1-2 people maximum.  The bed is a double/full size so not huge but comfortable.  Location is great!  Walking distance to the space needle, downtown, the ferry or a short bus ride away.  There is a nice little seating area on the rooftop with views of the space needle.  

Amy's directions to getting into the place was easy and she had a guide that was useful.  The place was very clean, with all the kitchen tools/utensils you will need.  Host was very responsive throughout the stay and overall we had a great time."
26826	3673759	10.0	10.0	24053257	It was a piece of cake getting into the apartment. The neighborhood is highly accessible from the monorail (once you know what you're doing). The apartment itself was clean and comfortable. The roof was amazing. I would stay here in a heart beat. 
26827	3673759	10.0	10.0	25250174	Amy was great. Emailed back with answers to my questions promptly and made the process smooth and easy. Met my daughter, who was on her first trip alone, and explained the ins and outs of Seattle. Everything was perfect and as explained.
26828	3673759	10.0	10.0	25517123	I highly recommend this place! It was wonderful, great part of town, and Amy was very accessible, friendly and open.  Great price and really accurate listing!
26829	3673759	10.0	10.0	25701221	Excellent place, easy to get to, easy setup that Amy has for entry and egress. I enjoyed my stay very much.
26830	3673759	10.0	10.0	25780613	The place was great, even more comfortable than the pictures look. Amy is a great host and I would absolutely stay here again. 
26831	3673759	10.0	10.0	26007977	My girlfriend and I had an amazing time in Seattle thanks to Amy's studio located right in the heart of Belltown.  The area was super spacious, clean, and even had a bunch of goodies for us to enjoy!  Amy also provided us with a binder that contained multiple brochures for different places to eat and visit in Seattle.  I loved that it was the entire place to ourselves and how everything was at most a 7 minutes walk away.  We really enjoyed our stay with Amy and would definitely stay here again. 
26832	3673759	10.0	10.0	26660608	My boyfriend and I stayed in Amy's cozy home for three days, two nights and absolutely loved our entire experience. We never met Amy, but she was readily available if we needed to contact her with any questions. Her apartment is simple, yet so adorable, and was the perfect size for us. If you want to experience the city life, but not be in a super congested area, it is in a great location. It took us probably about 15 mins to walk (very casually) to Pike Place and shops downtown Seattle. It is near grocery stores and many restaurants/caf√©s-all walkable. The best perk of staying at her apartment, hands down, would have to be the rooftop deck that we were able to access at the very top of the apartment building. It has such an incredible view of the Space Needle and Seattle at literally any time of the day (seriously it's beyond breathtaking). Everything about Amy's apartment was perfection and we will absolutely be staying there when we come back. 
26833	3673759	10.0	10.0	27267265	"Amy was great. From being able to provide additional amenities for my boyfriend's surprise birthday in to the apartment, to always being really attentive and caring of how our stay was- she was a really helpful and welcoming host!

The apartment was really cute and comfortable for 2 people. It provided everything we possibly needed and even had 2 umbrellas if necessary! The location of the place was great because it was walking distance to Pike Place, the Space Needle and in a really safe, quiet neighborhood."
26834	3673759	10.0	10.0	28178993	Amy was very responsive and detailed in her instructions for a comfortable and easy stay.  She was incredibly accommodating to my early morning arrival, and even greeted me upon arrival.  The place was cozy, clean, and centrally located.  Thanks so much Amy!
26835	3673759	10.0	10.0	28313976	"Amy was an amazing host! The apartment was perfect for my friend and I. The place was clean with fresh sheets and towels. Perfectly located in downtown Seattle, with just a 5 minute walk to the Space Needle and a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market. 

Will definitely come back to Seattle and definitely stay at this apartment again! Thanks for everything, Amy! "
26836	3673759	10.0	10.0	28569230	"Amy is amazing! Her cozy place was perfect for my best friend and I. Amy was very responsive and quick to answer any text messages or phone calls. Her apartment has everything in it, even though we brought mostly everything we needed (thanks for having a beer opener). Amenities from wifi, washer and dryers, to wine bottle opener to towels! Amy did a great job at providing all the necessities just in case you forgot them! She also took the time to provide a binder filled with Seattle's best places & nearby restaurants. 

The apartment is also only key accessed from the outside, so it is very safe. The neighborhood was also very peaceful and great! 

The apartment was clean and well stocked. The apartment is also conveniently located above a cafe (yummy sandwiches), beer shop (the manager is an amazing lady that knows her beers and is passionate about working there, a few blocks away from the space needle, pikes market, and the downtown scene. We walked everywhere except to the airport! 

Amy also shared that her apartment complex has access to a rooftop which provides an amazing view of the city and space needle. It is a great place to sit down, relax and just enjoy. 

Thanks for the amazing stay Amy! 
"
26837	3673759	10.0	10.0	28707667	Amy's place was perfect for my 3-night stay.  It was surprisingly well stocked and organized, very clean, comfortable, and quiet.  The neighborhood is very safe and an easy walk to everything, including a grocery store around the corner.  I loved having the washing machine in the apartment and access to Netflix/Roku, digital TV, and wireless.  Amy was very responsive before and during my stay and is an amazing host.  Thanks Amy!
26838	3673759	10.0	10.0	29059375	"My girlfriend and I loved Amy's Cozy 1 BD in Belltown!   

Amy was extremely helpful and hospitable.  She made sure we checked-in okay and had everything we needed.  Thank you Amy!

The space was very clean and came as advertised!  It was everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.   The place is relaxing and filled with enough amenities to stay in on a rainy day, but with so much cool stuff around you'll want to grab that rain jacket (or umbrella if you don't want to blend in) and stroll down to the plethora of amazing bars, gastropubs, fine dining, and tourist sights.  

What's not to love when you are a stone's throw from the Seattle Center, around the corner from the famous 5 Point Cafe, an easy 15-30 minute walk from Downtown, Pike's Market, or the Waterfront.  

The high walk score is no lie.  We especially loved the area on 1st and 2nd Ave between Blanchard and Bell.  My walkable neighborhood suggestions:   If you like dive bars with arcade games, pinball machines, skeeball, and shuffle boarding go to Shorty's, Lava Lounge, and the Rabbit Hole (they are all right next to each other).   If you like great pizza by the slice with a cocktail at midnight, go to Rocco's.   For fancy cocktails in Belltown, see Bathtub & Gin Speakeasy, the Upstairs, the Lost Pelican, or Some Random Bar.   All great places!"
26839	3673759	10.0	10.0	30613496	This cozy little apartment was the perfect space for my boyfriend and I. It was walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do. We were very comfortable there and it felt clean. Amy and her boyfriend Ben were also VERY accommodating and allowed us to check in early and check out late, which helped us out so much.  
26840	3673759	10.0	10.0	30832982	"Amy couldn't have been more accommodating. The apartment was in the perfect place! Do yourself a favor and take Amy's advice: visit the rooftop terrace. It offers an amazing view. This may sound silly, but we really felt that the location of the apartment (and ease of access to everything)  really ""made"" our trip. "
26841	3673759	10.0	10.0	32470123	Amy's place was great: clean, comfortable, plenty of space to hang up clothes, great kitchen etc.. The building and neighborhood are awesome, quick walk to pretty much everything. Amy was very accommodating on check-in time. The rooftop terrace is lovely- comfy chairs, views of the space needle and sound. 
26842	3673759	10.0	10.0	33437436	The location is incredible! Only a couple minutes from the Space Needle and surrounding attractions and it's in a relatively quiet residential area. At about a 15 minute walk from Pike's Place Market, we felt like we got the best of both connectivity and solitude. Amy was very communicative and very flexible in working with our travel schedule. Also, the apartment isn't posh or super fancy but it felt like home.  It had many amenities and items that made the stay convenient and comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here.
26843	3673759	10.0	10.0	33592656	Amy and Ben were great hosts. The apartment was exactly as the listing described. We loved the rooftop terrace! I definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to visit Seattle.

26845	3673759	10.0	10.0	34415874	"We arrived late with the train in Seattle and Amy could unfortunately not be there in person. Nevertheless she had arranged a perfect way to make sure we could get into the apartment. Because I didn't have a US mobile number, she even installed an app on her phone so we could communicate through wifi.
The apartment was spotless and perfect for our stay in Seattle. The rooftop of the building has an amazing view over the city and shops/restaurants and sightseeing are all in walking distance. The area had a safe feel to it, which was nice. All in all we were very happy with everything!"
26846	3673759	10.0	10.0	34720773	Our visit was a great success. Amy's apartment is very convenient to downtown seattle. She had great recommendations and was extremely well organized.

26848	3673759	10.0	10.0	35236893	Amy was a wonderful host! She has an adorable (and truly cozy) little apartment in Belltown, within walking distance of all the places we wanted to visit in Seattle.

26849	3673759	10.0	10.0	35541807	"This was my first experience with airbnb and it was awesome! Amy's apartment was just as desribed. It was more like you were staying at a friends place instead of an impersonal hotel. The kitchen had every utensil and dish you could need and all of the other rooms were equally stocked. The neighborhood is safe and the building very clean. Amy always responded promptly and was readily available. 

Lastly, please checkout the rooftop deck. The view is amazing!!"
26850	3673759	10.0	10.0	36523424	So cute, cozy, and perfect!!! Amy's place is exactly as described and more.  It was clean, there was A/C (Seattle is having or was having a heat wave!), and getting around to everything was within walking distance.  The buiding's rooftop deck was amazing!  Great views of the city and of the Space Needle.  Communication and entering and leaving the key was seamless.  Definitely would recommend Amy's place!

26852	3673759	10.0	10.0	38011269	We loved it! Comfortable and cozy, and the location is a dream--less than $10 cab ride from the train station and the easiest walk to Seattle Center. We'd love to stay here every time we're in Seattle.
26853	3673759	10.0	10.0	39297067	Great experience. Amy was easy to work with and very flexible with check in / checkout times. The place was quite nice, very clean. Great location, just a 1/4 mile from the Space Needle. And the rooftop deck was great!
26854	3673759	10.0	10.0	39778072	Couldn't ask for a better first experience with Airbnb. We usually stay in a hotel when we go to Seattle, but this Airbnb experience has changed our minds about that. Amy was great! Very flexible with our check in and check out times. The apartment was more then enough space for 2 people, and was provided with everything we needed. You can walk to anywhere from here and transportation was easy to find if needed. The roof was amazing, can truly see how close you were to everything! Next time were in Seattle, I will def stay at Amy's apartment again! 
26855	3673759	10.0	10.0	40600968	"Amy did a great job hosting for us. She made sure that we had all the info that we needed prior to arrival and then checked in to make sure we had everything that we needed upon arrival.

26867	3673759	10.0	10.0	50697719	Amy's apartment is a perfect one for groups of 2 or solo travelers. It is a nice/clean apartment in a great building. Amy was very helpful in providing all of the necessary check-in/check-out information and was readily available for any questions I had during my stay
27812	4240933	10.0	10.0	28652416	Everything was perfect! Felt like home in Jordan's apartment. It was quite convenient to walk to Pike Market, 5th Street (Monotrail to Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly glass museum, etc.) and many other amazing places to explore.
27813	4240933	10.0	10.0	32563929	The apartment was nice and it was just as described. Perfect location and very nice building. Great common areas and beautiful view. 
27814	4240933	10.0	10.0	35208898	Very user friendly 
27815	4240933	10.0	10.0	38504062	The apartment as a whole was adequate and very central to where we needed to be. It was clean and spacious. However, I'm disappointed that the second bedroom had no mirror or adequate lighting - it only had a side lamp which made the room very dark. The fold out sofa bed was terribly uncomfortable. Because of this, I'd say it is overpriced.
27816	4240933	10.0	10.0	39932262	There were a lot of Little details that the host payed attention to, which made us feel right at home. We ended up renting two condos because 12 of us came down, in the host was very accommodating. I would recommend stay Alfred to others looking to stay in Seattle
27817	4240933	10.0	10.0	42397621	Great location and great facilities. Couldn't ask for more for a stay in downtown seattle!
28355	8147986	10.0	10.0	47823274	"A true urban retreat.  I was met by Arif personally who took the time to point out all the features of his live/work loft.   The space was clean, hip and well stocked for a stay (hairdryer, iron, well outfitted big kitchen, nice towels,etc.).   The location was perfect for us, a block from the Olympic Sculpture Park and 2 blocks from Aqua restaurant (one of my favorites) at Pier 70.   But, I will note, it is a ground floor work/live space right on the street.   The windows are good, so the street noise is not bad and the bedroom is interior and very quiet.  The neighborhood is safe.  We didn't mind being right on the street, but it may not be for everyone.   

The roof deck is great with nice barbecues and an awesome view.   There is also a workout room.   (You do have to go down a couple of doors to get to the entrance to the residential portion and the deck and work out room.)  The bathroom was nice - dual sinks  - with a washer and dryer in the unit.   The electronics are great, if you have time to watch a movie.   

This is a good unit for 2 people. And would be perfect if you wanted a place to work too.  High speed internet and a dining room that is also a conference room - complete with glass ""white"" board.   My only negative is that it is not the most comfortable bed and the small bedroom can be a bit warm.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
28356	8147986	10.0	10.0	49359475	"Arif was a great host and did a great job of making sure I knew my way around and was comfortable throughout my stay.

The loft was a fun place to have as a base of operations while enjoying a vacation in Seattle and is super close to downtown. It was super clean, had everything available that I needed, and was nice to relax in between adventures.

Highly recommend it, enjoy the stay!"
28357	8147986	10.0	10.0	51095104	Arif has an amazing space in Belltown. We walked from the studio to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and to a few of the restaurants we ate at. I loved that the studio was a workspace- there's a whiteboard and a nice table that doubles as a desk that I ended up actually utilizing while there. He had the place fully stocked- from coffee to beer to pens and paper. Netflix, HBO and the works were set up in both main rooms and there was a way to play music at all times as well. I really appreciated Arif's hospitality and definitely wouldn't hesitate staying here again! PS- He even supplied a dog bowl for our baby, as well as bags and treats. I don't have a single complaint. 
28358	8147986	10.0	10.0	51570810	"Arif was very helpful at check-in when we circled the block a couple times figuring out where the garage parking was. He showed us around the building and apartment. Neighborhood was nice and a great location within walking distance to a lot of ""touristy"" sites: Space Needle, Pike Place Market, EMP Museum, Chihuly Glass Museum and more.  Only a couple streets away from buses to go downtown and lots of restaurants in the vicinity. City and water views from the rooftop patio. My husband had a great run along the waterfront. On-site parking is a HUGE plus. 

The space was inviting, floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room let in plenty of light, even with the blinds closed. Full kitchen, with plenty of utensils and supplies would definitely be useful for those wanting to stay in and cook (we didn't). Washer and dryer was another bonus, should have packed a lot less! 

The bedroom is smallish, even with just two of us we ended up keeping our luggage in the dining room to keep the floor clear. There was a closet with hangers and a dresser, but we don't usually unpack like that for only a few days. I was worried the bed wouldn't work out well for the two of us since it seems to be a fold-out/convertible couch, but we were comfortable.

28359	8147986	10.0	10.0	52890724	I really enjoyed staying here. The place was well kept and the neighborhood wasn't too busy/noisy. This apartment is centrally located, and only a few blocks from multiple metro stations.

Allen was easy to communicate with and checking in and out was simple. The condo is in a great location by the Sculpture Park with lots of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. We got there just in time to watch the sunset from the rooftop deck overlooking Elliott Bay. Gorgeous! I would definitely stay here again.

I definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle.

She even drove into the city when I‚Äôd accidentally misplaced the keys to the apartment. The apartment itself is in great shape and the location is right near the water and several great bars. I‚Äôd definitely stay there again if I was in Seattle!
28752	7699356	10.0	9.0	43846973	"Alexandra was a very responsible host.  She responded to several of our emails in a prompt manner.  Met us at the condo and gave us quick tour of the condo, parking, etc.  She checked in with us during our stay to see how things were going.    
The condo is in a prime location.  Near the Key Arena and Space Needle, monorail to downtown and walking distance to Pike's Market. The condo has a its own parking space if you have a car.  If you are sensitive to traffic noise this may not be the location for you.  Beautiful view of Puget Sound and the ferries crossing the bay. "
28901	4520179	10.0	10.0	24939345	Joy and Jeff are wonderful people. They were very welcoming, kind, and helpful from the get-go. They provided me with wireless internet when I asked for it and understand that I have an extremely busy schedule to work around. They would come and check in on me to make sure everything was replenished and that my stay was enjoyable. I enjoyed living here so much, that I have already created another rental for the next couple of months.
28902	4520179	10.0	10.0	27550730	It is so glad to meet Jeff and Joy. They are so kind and considerate.  They wait until 12:30 AM to meet me on the first day because of my  flight delay.  What is more,  they put some Chinese stuff in the unit  such as chopsticks, slippers and also Chinese version instructions for machines because I am a Chinese. These make me feel very touched. They also checked on me very day to make sure I enjoyed the stay and I really did. I will definitely recommend my friends to stay in their unit when they come to Seattle.
28903	4520179	10.0	10.0	31054190	"Before the trip Joy and Jeff were quick to answer our email queries and gave clear and simple instructions for check-in and out.
We found the flat to be clean and quiet and in a safe location close to amenities and tourist attractions. There was a lovely spot on the roof for sunning and relaxing. There was however a problem with the internet which never worked while we were there.  Also the apartment was sparsely outfitted with bare essentials for cutlery, dishes, utensils and towels.  None of this however dampened the enjoyment of our visit."
28904	4520179	10.0	10.0	33397191	Good location near many attractions. Apartment has a lot of amenities  (rooftop and gym) which are great pluses.
28905	4520179	10.0	10.0	33681956	"Joy was a great host, with good communication prior to and during my visit, and very clear instructions. Thank you!

The apartment was clean, two bathrooms are nice, W/D in unit are great, internet worked perfectly, and I made use of the exercise room in the building. It's a great building in a convenient neighborhood! As a previous reviewer noted, the supplies in the unit were sparse, particularly in terms of the kitchen, so keep that in mind if you are planning to cook. Also, the couch that folds down to the 2nd bed is not comfortable as a bed; I guess it ultimately got the job done, but it might be a problem for some."
28906	4520179	10.0	10.0	40426228	"I had an summer internship in Seattle and lived here for two months, and the experience was really amazing in all aspects!!
 
1. Location: very very convenient, 10 min walking distance to a great waterfront park, downtown financial and shopping area, pike market, Amazon campus, wholefoods, 2 min walk to space needle. The neighborhood is also very safe and quiet!

2. Apartment: the apartment is very new and nicely furnished. The washer and dryer in the unit are especially helpful. Joy and Jeff prepared pretty much everything you need in the unit. The building also has a nice gym and an amazing rooftop area with great scenes and good for gatherings.

3. The super nice hosts: Joy and Jeff don't live in the apartment, but they would frequently check in and ask what I needed. They gave me great advices on where to visit and regular updates on summer events going on in Seattle. 

I would tell two (website hidden) that I was particularly impressed by.

*Anecdote 1: I was especially impressed that they even bought a TV and Netflix account for me not long after I moved in because they wanted me to have more entertainment options in the unit. 

*Anecdote 2: I had a friend visiting me in the middle of the summer. As soon as Joy and Jeff heard about that they bought a memory foam mattress and brought it to the unit to make the downstairs bed more comfortable! 

Overall, they really provided a very comfortable and amazing experience. I felt really at home. I highly recommend it to everyone from those who are only looking to spend a few days in Seattle to those who are staying for more than a month like me."

Overall I had a great experience and would recommend this place to anyone."
28908	4520179	10.0	10.0	44185519	Joy is a well organised and a friendly host who made us feel very welcome. Prior to arriving, Joy sent through very detailed instructions on how to check in and even how to get from the airport to their apartment - which was extremely simple and much appreciated. The apartment is very clean and comfortable with ample space for 3 people. The location is fantastic, clean and full of friendly locals. The apartment is walking distance to the markets, space needle and downtown shopping area.  Thank you so much for a great stay. We'd definitely stay here again.
28909	4520179	10.0	10.0	44754860	We were greeted by Jeff (Joy's Husband) on our arrival at the apartment. He kindly showed us how to access the building and showed us through the apartment. It was clean and spacious and on the top floor. It was really quiet at night. It is in an excellent location and there are many restaurants a few minutes walk away. We were also able to walk to the Space Needle, EMP museum and the Chihuly glass and garden exhibition. It is a 30 minute walk to Pike st markets or there is public transport available nearby. We had a lovely time in Seattle and really enjoyed this apartment.
28910	4520179	10.0	10.0	46143024	Location was GREAT! Joy was very attentive and was available if we needed anything! Would recommend this listing to anyone who is wanting a great SEATTLE experience.

28912	4520179	10.0	10.0	49624518	Joy was the best host and the house was cozy. I will be back :)
29189	4776823	10.0	10.0	24284623	"Ben and I had a great time staying in this studio apartment in Belltown. You can't beat the location, as it's only about six blocks from Pike Place Market; there's a Starbucks on the main floor; you can see the Space Needle from the windows; there are cute chickens in the morning on the rooftop across the alley; and there's garage parking available. The numerous shops and local restaurants nearby are bountiful as well.

Jen was a great host and did everything she could to make sure our needs were accommodated. We would definitely recommend this location to a friend, and will probably stay here again."
29190	4776823	10.0	10.0	24616213	"I loved this place! The pictures don't do it justice, AT ALL! One wall is entirely windows. I was here with 2 teenage boys and we had plenty of space. We actually fought over who got to sleep on the couch, because you woke up to such fun views of the city. Granted, we're not urban folk, so all the views, the restaurants, the underground parking, the fact that there was no need for a car, we found it all pretty cool. My son took one step inside and said, ""This is the type of place I want to live in one day!""  It was small, but perhaps because of the windows (which can be opened), never felt claustrophobic or cramped. Super quiet, never heard the neighbors, just the hum of the city. The rooftop across the alley (the hostel) had chickens and mini gardens‚Ä¶fun to watch.  Jen was quick and thorough with her communications, and had stocked the studio with maps of the area and the attractions, which we relied heavily on.  It was super clean,
had everything we needed and then some, including nice linens / towels, and comfy throws.   But best of all, we arrived on a freezing winter day,
and she had the apt already warmed for us. Not an ounce of regret. Oh! And she was very gracious when I botched the standard check-out procedures. :/"
29191	4776823	10.0	10.0	24785416	We had such an amazing time here! The location was absolutely perfect. Everything was very well kept and clean. Jen was always available if needed for anything.

29192	4776823	10.0	10.0	25059473	Jen was terrific and the apartment was lovely!! Great location - my friends and I recommend the Belltown Pub and Macrina Bakery, especially.  Tons of places to hang out within walking distance, so the reserved parking spot made it easy to just leave our car and go.  That definitely helped to make it a very affordable way to stay downtown.
29193	4776823	10.0	10.0	25319781	My husband and I traveled to Seattle for a fun get away. Staying at this location which was centrally located to Pikes Market, the aquarium, space needle, and other tourist attractions. The restaurants were great around the apartment as well. The apartment itself was very welcoming. The essentials were provided which was great. The views were amazing at night. And so was the views on the roof. I would definitely recommend staying at this apartment again if we were visiting Seattle again.
29194	4776823	10.0	10.0	25564344	"Awesome experience! This listing was very comfortable and had a great view of the city (including the Space Needle). The quarters were very clean and updated. Beautiful bathroom and full kitchen. The surrounding neighborhood was great and felt comfortable walking around at day or night. Also, the listing is only a 5-10 minute walk to Pike Place Market or to the Space Needle which was exactly what we wanted during our stay in Seattle. The location felt very secure with keys required for entry into parking or main lobby. The building itself is beautiful with large wooden beams and historic decor.
Our host was very accommodating and responsive to make sure that everything was clear, providing a booklet of instructions for Wifi use and nearby attractions.
Overall, this experience made our stay in Seattle unforgettable. Highly recommend staying here if you would like to have all the comforts of home!"
29195	4776823	10.0	10.0	25797554	"The Loft in the Austin Bell Building provided the perfect, cozy haven each day and night of our 4-day Seattle stay. From communication prior to our travel  date to our arrival at the front door for a late check-in, Jen is a perfect host to our first Airbnb experience.  She welcomed us to Seattle even as we were landing at SeaTac and made sure we had everything we needed to begin our visit. The location is spot on‚Äîa quick elevator ride to the building lobby and you are in the middle of Belltown and immediately part of a lively neighborhood scene. We never had to drive but walked to discover and try local restaurants next door or no more than two blocks from our Seattle home. And how cool to view the rooftop urban chicken coop just across the alley?!! This is indeed a ""Best (historic) building + garage"" and Jen's care and attention helped make our stay  fun, comfortable, meaningful and memorable. Thank you, Jen!
Steve and Char"
29196	4776823	10.0	10.0	25864534	Jen was amazing with my stay. I had multiple issues which need her assistance and probably would have considered myself more of a pain but Jen was super helpful with everything and was always pleasant to talk to. The apartment is in an amazing location close to all the main attractions as well as restaurants and bars. The water is super close meaning on days when you're lucky to get awesome weather the water is right there to walk along! Thanks so much Jen!
29197	4776823	10.0	10.0	26103141	This was the PERFECT place for my boyfriend and I! The property was very CLEAN &SPACIOUS for two people. Pictures did not do the unit justice; one side of the apartment was all window & there was so much light in the unit! I loved looking at the fog and rain from the windows. Most importantly, the apartment is situated at an IDEAL LOCATION! It is a 0.5 mile/15 min walk to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. My boyfriend & I went jogging along the waterfront, which was only 3 blocks away, and then made our way down to the aquarium and Pike Market. There are also a lot of highly rated restaurant & bars within a 2-block radius, and there is even a Starbucks downstairs! There is also a market one block away. My boyfriend was ecstatic that there was a super cool sports bar (Buckley's) right around the corner that played the Golden State Warriors games (or any sports channel you request). I highly recommend this listing to everyone because all the hot spots are within walking distance, and I felt SAFE walking around even at midnight. The check-in and check-out process was very easy. Jen was promptly responsive when we needed her. This was a great first Airbnb experience for me, and the apartment made my birthday weekend that much more perfect! I'm excited to try Airbnb for my next travel!

It's a great place to come back to after exploring the city during the day. I will definitely be booking here again. 
29204	4776823	10.0	10.0	27783870	"The review merits one star because the apartment itself was quite nice.   We're really sorry to say that after several really positive experiences on airbnb, this overall experience was a minus - big time. 

We were passing through Seattle for one night, and thought it'd be nice to stay downtown for a birthday celebration.  We contacted the host and relayed that we liked the place, but thought the price was a little high.  

Here is exactly the message that we sent to this host:  ""Here's what I'd like to propose. If you are willing to waive the cleaning fee and simply rent at the advertised rate of $99/night, then we are all in. If not, we'll just move along and get in touch with the other places that are nearby. Thanks for the response and the understanding."" 

We received no response from the host, but we did get an airbnb approval, and thought we were all good to go.  

Sadly, this was the last good news we got from this rental. 

Prior to our arrival, it was clear that Jen was not in the least bit happy about having to waive the cleaning fee or what she considered a discounted price.  As we neared Seattle after a long day on the road, we emailed at around 5 pm to let her know that we were on the way.  Here is her message to us: 

""It is ready so I don't mind checkin now but I have scheduled the next guest tomorrow AM-  Sorry for any inconvenience. I need check out by 10am and linens washed, tidy up, etc as we discussed."" 

Firstly, we never discussed anything as she had barely communicated anything other than copy/paste instructions.  Secondly, we had booked according to her listed terms - 2 pm check-in and an 11 am check-out.  Nothing else was discussed.  The communication was so bad that as we went to check-in, we were ""buzzed in"" (by Jen, we can only assume) with no ""hello"" or other greeting, and it wasn't until a phone call was placed that we were told to ""go on in the door is open"".   Thirdly, there was no guest booked the next day (easy to see from the calendar after all).  She even said in a later exchange we could book it another night (!!).  

All in all, this was an incredibly disappointing booking and put a real damper on an otherwise awesome trip to a great city.  And this was the first negative experience we've had on airbnb.   

We're sorry that it turned out this way, but if you can find a way to work with Jen then the place itself is not so bad.  Just don't make the mistake of not paying her full asking price as an airbnb property manager, or you might find yourself wishing you had booked elsewhere.   

Best of luck to you!  "
29205	4776823	10.0	10.0	27995425	My boyfriend and I stayed in Jen's studio this weekend (March 13-15th) It was a great location for the price, very close to shopping and tourist attractions.

A quick 10 minute walk to Pike Place, a 15minute walk to downtown, and having parking included was great also. It was very convenient and I'd stay here again. The only thing I'd mention was the apartment tends to get really stuffy and warm - but that will clear when you open the large windows!

Not to mention, Jen even accommodated my early check-in and she was very helpful when I had any questions!"
29208	4776823	10.0	10.0	28779950	"Jen's apartment came exactly as advertised and I had a great stay.  The apartment is clean and comfortable.  The location is excellent, it is surrounded by bars and restaurants and an easy walk to so many sights in Seattle.  The parking spot made it very convenient to have a rental car which helped immensely since I needed to go out to some of the towns south of Seattle.

I didn't end up meeting Jen, but she was always available and got back to me promptly.  Fortunately I didn't have any problems with the apartment but I'm sure if I had she would've gotten them resolved quickly. 

Thanks Jen!"
29209	4776823	10.0	10.0	29053398	Visited Seattle for a few days with my boyfriend. The location of this apartment is ideal - walking distance to everything downtown. The apartment is cozy and perfect for two people. However, we were unable to use the wifi and Netflix because the bill had not been paid. The apartment has excellent views of the space needle, especially from the roof of the building. The building itself is well protected and we felt extremely safe the whole time. 
29210	4776823	10.0	10.0	29504567	First airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better! Jen has the coolest little place in Seattle, walking distance to just about everything!

The apartment is a ten minute walk to Pike's Market to the south and a 10 minute walk to the Space Needle and Seattle Center to the north. There are tons of restaurants just a few steps away and   if you feel like driving it has a parking spot, which is worth it's weight in gold in Seattle. As for the apartment itself, it had all the essentials and was clean with a nice size kitchen and TV. The check-in and check-out processes were a breeze and the host Jen is willing to help with anything you need. 
29219	4776823	10.0	10.0	32886816	Jen was very friendly and responsive. Apartment was beautifully decorated and nice. And best of all, location was one of the best you could ask for in Downtown Seattle. Thanks for the amazing stay Jen!

My husband and I were able to walk to the Space Needle, the waterfront, Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square. There are also lots of great restaurants within walking distance of this condo. Jen was easy to contact and suggested some places for dinner after we arrived late. I would recommend the restaurant 360 just down the street, which Jen suggested. Overall, great location and great condo.
29225	4776823	10.0	10.0	34273449	 We enjoyed our stay in Seattle! The description and photos of the apartment were accurate. It was very clean and had everything we needed for our short stay. While small, it was plenty of room for two of us. Fantastic location! Walking distance to restaurants, bars, and the big tourist attractions!  We never actually met Jen, but did call her with a question and she was helpful. 
29226	4776823	10.0	10.0	34620123	The room was in a perfect part of the city! We could walk to pikes place and the needle within minutes. Beautiful building with Starbucks right outside! The laundry in the room was a life saver- we brought home suitcases full of clean clothes!
29227	4776823	10.0	10.0	35063876	We stayed in Seattle for 5 nights . This was a wonderful location . Walking distance to all Seattle has to offer . Plenty of restaurants in walking distance . Jenn had great communication throughout our stay . She called to make sure we were ok the first night . Although we had things planned out therefore we didn't need her assistance . Although she was there in case we needed her. I traveled with my two boys ages 11 and 12. The apartment was completely comfortable and enough room . Traveling with 4 adults might be a little two cramped . But we were more than fine . You are located in Belltown in a heart of a city so if you want peace and quiet and expect to sleep in late , that might be an issue . A little noisy but that is city life and was expected . It did not bother us . The only downfall is that there is no AC . During the day it got a little hot , but we were touring the city most of the time and it is June , so we were not exposed to that often. At night it cools down and with the addition of the fan present . Sleeping temperature wise it was very comfortable. I would def stay here again . The building is safe , comfortable , secure , and updated . Much better than any hotel . Highly recommend and Jenn was great !!! You will not be sorry if you stay here . 
29228	4776823	10.0	10.0	35767040	"Enjoyed ourselves. Loved the neighborhood,and could easily walk everywhere. Nice view of the top of the Space Needle.The apartment, a studio really, was adequately, if somewhat sparsely furnished. Jen was really helpful, answering any questions, and was even available( electronically) to let us in early to drop off our bags. The building was very quiet, and we only saw a couple of people all weekend.
We have lived in urban settings all our lives, so ambient street noise doesn't bother us, but without air conditioning, we had the windows open, and it was VERY noisy at night: the appartment was a couple of floors above a large restaurant that seemed to have air conditioning and an exhaust fan running all the time. Could be a problem for some people.
Overall, we had a good experience, and a good introduction to Seattle."
29229	4776823	10.0	10.0	36085390	This was our first time in Seattle, and Jen's place was great -- just a short walk to everything, a view of the Space Needle from the large windows, garage parking, and everything we needed to make us feel at home. While we didn't get to meet Jen in person, her directions to the apartment were spot-on, she was very responsive, and even checked in to make sure we were settled and to answer any questions we had about the apartment and the city.
29230	4776823	10.0	10.0	36337779	"Was easy, fast and clear communication. Room like shown in pictures and explained in description. nice neighborhood, easy to walk to everything. would definatly recommend to others and would use it again. 
Little bit hot if you go in super hot time of year. 
"
29231	4776823	10.0	10.0	36860342	"We loved staying at Jen's place. It's a charming studio in a great location in a walkable neighborhood. 

The  online description is accurate. Jen made check in go smoothly.  We will definitely consider Jen's place when we get back to Seattle."
29232	4776823	10.0	10.0	37036827	Thank you Jen for making us feel welcome in a new city and with our first AirBnB experience! We were in walking distance to everything we wanted to see in Seattle! We were a little concerned about no AC but it cools off at night and the fans helped. Check in was super easy and loved the Starbucks next door (:
29233	4776823	10.0	10.0	37835337	We stayed at this loft for two nights for our first trip to Seattle.  What a great location.  Downstairs there is a great little bar and a Starbucks - although we walked the few extra steps down the street to Cherry Street Coffee.  Another quick walk south and you're at Pike's Place market and north you're at the Space Needle.  The loft itself is perfect for two people - simple and quiet.  There is no A/C, but even in summer with the windows open it was comfortable.  Jen was a helpful host and let us park our car their early before check-in.  Highly recommended!
29234	4776823	10.0	10.0	38257881	Great Stay!  Jen took care of everything!
29235	4776823	10.0	10.0	38618852	"Our stay was better than expected. Having never been to Seattle, Jen opened up this sweet pad for our short stay and made us feel welcome and at home. Her instructions and feedback were on-point, and she was always checking in to make sure we were accommodated. 

The apartment itself was small, but perfect size for two people. Within a two minute walk there is everything from amazing sushi, Italian food, bakeries and markets--not to mention the Starbucks that is directly below the apartment building. A ten minute walk in either direction will put you in ether Pikes Place market, or the Space Needle. 

 We're already planning our next trip for January, and we'll definitely be coming back! "
29236	4776823	10.0	10.0	38984117	My husband and I had a great time at Jen's loft!! The view was great and it was the perfect location for everything we wanted to do!! Thank you Jen!
29237	4776823	10.0	10.0	39330991	This is a great centrally located condo and we enjoyed staying here.  Jen was great at communicating with us about our stay and any questions we had.  The only issue we had with the place was that the mattress on the bed really needs to be replaced.  Enjoyed our stay!
29238	4776823	10.0	10.0	39923314	The unit was overall very nice. Modern and updated. We have 4 people staying one night. Wouldn't recommend more then 3 people. Jen allowed us to check in early - which was a huge plus. Would definitely suggest this unit to others. 
29239	4776823	10.0	10.0	40200224	We (family of 4) enjoyed our time at Jen's place and in Seattle. The apartment was as described with everything we needed. Thanks Jen!
29240	4776823	10.0	10.0	44277681	Jen was very responsive, friendly and helpful. The apartment was exactly as listed - no surprises! It was clean and located conveniently within a 10 min walking distance to Pike Place, the Space Needle, and many many good places for food and drinks! The apartment was perfect for my trip because it had all the amenities I needed - wifi, Netflix, parking, washer/dryer, AC unit and fans. I was very thankful for the AC unit since it was surprisingly hot during the first part of my stay. I couldn't have picked a better apartment!
29241	4776823	10.0	10.0	44788144	"Excellent location within walking distance to most sites. Location is  noisy between the police sirens and the restaurant next door emptying their trash at 1 am. But, that may be part of staying in the city. We were not able to check in early, so that was a problem walking around town with our suitcases. There is a TV, but no cable, good for net flex etc only.
"
29242	4776823	10.0	10.0	45063148	Location, location! This studio apartment is in a perfect location.  We didn't have much communication with Jen while we were there, but really didn't need to. The unit is perfect for 2 people (I was there for a girls' weekend getaway), but could also be good for a small family with 1 child.  Kitchen doesn't have a ton of supplies (we didn't need it, and neither will you), but there are the basics if you need it! There was cold water in the frig. Unit was clean. There is a portable a/c unit that makes noise, but in our opinion, helped circulate the air and provided some white noise.  The unit is great.  SHORT walk to Pike Place and lots of great shopping, great cafes (check out Cherry Street Coffee), and lounges/food. You don't want to miss Umi Sake House around the corner (make reservations - you won't be sorry!) and Sarajevo for a cocktail and appetizers - just downstairs (try the flaming cheese - amazing!)...Easy in and out of the building. Building is very charming. Did I mention...location?  We used Uber a few times, including to the airport (it was $27).  Thanks, Jen! I will definitely spread the word!
29243	4776823	10.0	10.0	47044865	Jen's place is in a great location, close to restaurants, coffee, and pikes place is a short walk away. The apartment had many more (nice!) amenities than I was expecting. All bathroom and kitchen necessities were provided in addition to oatmeal, popcorn, games and other goodies. I will say the pillows were pretty flat and the bed wasn't very comfortable. It's neat that you can see the top of the space needle from the rooftop deck but it's not a very scenic place to hang out otherwise. Jen was courteous, quick to respond to messages and very accommodating with an early check in. The building has a beautiful lobby and Starbucks next door is a plus. We had an overall good experience! 
29244	4776823	10.0	10.0	47654343	Jen's place was perfectly located downtown and to Starbucks (right downstairs). Lot's of great restaurants in the area and just a short walk to Pike Place market. We loved the area. Thanks so much :)
29245	4776823	10.0	10.0	48713501	What a great location for a visit to Seattle. The apartment was nice with all the needed amenities. We had a car so we were grateful for the parking. Loved that SBUX is right there. The apartment is located at centrally for walking to all the major sights and is surrounded by great restaurants. Thanks for sharing your space with us. 
29246	4776823	10.0	10.0	49069306	Jen was a great host and answered any/all questions we had, and even gave some recommendations for shopping and food in the area. The neighborhood was perfect, and we were walking distance to most of the things that we wanted to see/do over the course of our short visit. Found a couple great restaurants in the neighborhood, including an amazing sushi restaurant around the corner. We loved Seattle and wouldn't hesitate to stay at this same location again in the future.
29247	4776823	10.0	10.0	50387442	Jen made herself available to me upon arrival, she also gave me all the detailed info I needed to access the property. The loft was just as described and in a great location, in a very nice building. The loft was well appointed wit everything I needed to make my stay comfortable.
29248	4776823	10.0	10.0	50480379	Apartment was clean and nice and in a great location. We really enjoyed our stay and would go back again! 
29249	4776823	10.0	10.0	50803751	We had an amazing time at Jen's place. The location was perfect, walking distance to so many stores and restaurants. The place was modern and extra clean with an amazing view, and Jen was super welcoming. We will be back when we will travel to Seattle again!
29250	4776823	10.0	10.0	50863621	Jen was a really great host. Her place is essentially set up like a hotel suite: the place is spotless, conditioner and shampoo and clean towels, and plenty of info on Seattle's attractions. Her place is an easy walk to Pike's Place, and she was very helpful when I had questions. The free parking made life easier too. 
29251	4776823	10.0	10.0	51452896	"Great first-time Airbnb experience! The space was the perfect size for two people. Location is GREAT, surrounded by some of the city's best restaurants and walking distance to major attractions (Seattle Center, Pike Place, waterfront, stadiums). The parking was super convenient since we had a rental and Jen let us use the parking spot after checking out since our flight was later, which was nice.

Heads up for people bringing/renting cars! The parking spot is tight (as is the general parking situation in downtown Seattle), on a slight slope, and between a pillar and an SUV, so plan accordingly unless you're a parking rockstar. "
29252	4776823	10.0	10.0	51658495	Stayed here during some travel for work. Great space! Jen was very kind, communicative, and responsive. Place was clean, bed was comfy. Loved the location too, great food and coffee close by and convenient to downtown Seattle.  Would happily stay here again next time I'm in town!
29253	4776823	10.0	10.0	53264060	We loved this place.  It was clean, comfortable and had everything you need for a great stay.  Jen really knows how to make guests feel welcome. The beverages and snacks are so very much appreciated after a long day of travel. We would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle, so close to everything.
29254	4776823	10.0	10.0	56058252	"This may be my favorite place we've stayed in Seattle. Awesome view from a great historic building in a great spot. We were happy to call this our home for a few days. We took full advantage of the Starbucks downstairs and enjoyed watching the rain fall outside the awesome view.

Jen was responsive and attentive. She made our stay stress free and fun. The place was very clean and comfortable. Definitely made it our home.

Hope we can visit again soon!

29255	4776823	10.0	10.0	56197328	Had a great experience staying at Jens apartment. It was in a great location with lots of food options. A close walk to lots of shopping and pikes market. The apartment was a good size for 2 people and was very clean. 
32510	6773472	10.0	10.0	35605273	The apartment itself as well as its location were perfect. Jarad was so helpful, down to earth, and available that it made any apprehensions about using airbnb quickly fade away (this was our first time).  Will definitely be contacting Jarad for future stays in Seattle if he's available.
32511	6773472	10.0	10.0	38012256	Jarad's place was wonderful! My boyfriend I stayed here while attending a wedding in Seattle. The apartment was bigger than expected and impeccably clean. Jarad was always accessible by phone if we needed any help and we were able to walk from the apartment to visit friends in the Capitol Hill area. Overall, this was my favorite place we stayed in the week we were in Seattle. I wish this was my apartment!
32512	6773472	10.0	10.0	38159594	Jarad's place was exactly as described, clean and what I wanted in a property. The building is next door to a nice hotel so there is literally a taxi outside waiting for you at nearly all times. Jarad also provided some great suggestions for restaurants and texted me half-way through my stay to make sure everything was going well. I would stay there again
32513	6773472	10.0	10.0	38521608	Great location! If you're in Seattle for a convention at the Washington State Convention Center, definitely stay here. I loved the bay window and hardwood floors. Plenty of room for a solo traveler or couple. Also, this place has A/C, which was a welcome surprise with the summer heat wave that's hit Seattle recently! Jarad made it easy to check in and out, and was available by email and text message. Would definitely stay again!
32514	6773472	10.0	10.0	38878170	Jared was a great host and his apartment was very clean and in a great location, walking distance from downtown.  
32515	6773472	10.0	10.0	39107864	Jarad's place was a great place to stay. It is in a perfect location right in downtown Seattle. The place is extremely clean and has air condition. I would highly recommend staying at Jarad's place if you are visiting Seattle.
32516	6773472	10.0	10.0	39231751	Jarad made me feel welcome, was in close contact via phone, and had everything set-up for when I got there. His kindness made my first b n b experience a great one. 
32517	6773472	10.0	10.0	39457955	This place was clean and perfectly spacious, and the minimalist design made for a very relaxing, hotel-like stay (nothing better than white linens!). Jarad made check-in and check-out easy and responded to messages quickly. The location was awesome, within walking distance to downtown and Capitol Hill. I'd definitely stay here again.
32518	6773472	10.0	10.0	39664602	Jarad was great host. The room was very clean and comfortable, also very nice location. He was very responsible person that we can easily contact with when we had questions. We totally recommend Jarad as a host and his room. 
32519	6773472	10.0	10.0	39837520	"Jared was a peach!
Very accommodating and answered texts right away. 
And he was also very understanding when I lost the house key!
The space was bright and had AC - very comfy. It was only an overnight visit and the space was perfect. "
32520	6773472	10.0	10.0	45311880	Great host, quick reply for questions. Room was clean and easy access to shopping area.
32521	6773472	10.0	10.0	47055719	Jarad's apartment was a great way to have our own space in downtown Seattle without spending a fortune. All the popular tourist activities are within a walkable distance ( 1 mile) but you should be aware that the building is at the top of a pretty big hill so walking back from the water can take a while. There's a hotel next door which serves as an easy reference point when getting rides. You can always get a cab from there but we used Lyft instead which worked great. The building is centrally located within Seattle though it's more of a business area so there aren't many bars/restaurants close by like there are in say Belltown. Light rail to the airport stops about a 10 min walk away at Pioneer Square and works very well.  The apartment itself was clean and the bed was very comfortable and Jarad was a pleasure to deal with :)
32522	6773472	10.0	10.0	49733038	Great location for first-time visitors! Walking distance from all the tourist locations (i.e. Pike Place , Space Needle, Chihuly museum, etc.). The studio was spotless with an amazingly comfortable bed and maximum privacy. There was a bit of confusion on how to enter the apartment, but Jared promptly responded. Overall, had a great stay. 
34976	5218550	10.0	10.0	26854339	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
34977	5218550	10.0	10.0	27977690	I had to fly to seattle last-minute because my mother was in the hospital. Susan was extremely accommodating and sympathetic, and her room and the entire flat are lovely. Great location, very clean and the bed is extremely comfortable. Thank you for helping me through my difficult time, Susan. I highly recommend you!
34978	5218550	10.0	10.0	28395338	"This trip was our first time using Airbnb, not really knowing what to expect we are so thankful and appreciative of  Susan. She was the best host for us, we are so happy with our decision to stay at her lovely flat for 5 days. Her hospitality is so wonderful and she is very thoughtful and detailed with having tea out and giving us snacks in our room as well as bath and body products for us to use. The bed and pillows are comfortable and the room has great natural light and the street is quiet. We enjoyed it more than a hotel because it was so nice having conversations with Susan during our stay. It made our Seattle experience even better. She was laid back and gave us the flexibility to ""check out"" whenever is best for us. The location is amazing, walking distance to anywhere downtown. We would recommend anyone to come and stay with Susan in the heart of Seattle! "
34979	5218550	10.0	10.0	28698786	"Susan was super accommodating, I ended up coming into town a little late and Susan had it worked out so that I could access the apartment even when she wasn't there. 

The building is a fantastic 110 year old property and is in excellent condition! Some of the floors are a little creaky but that gives it more charm. It's centrally located near several major streets and downtown is just a few blocks away, as is the convention center.

The room is very comfortable and welcoming when you walk in and the bathroom is easily accessible right off the hall. The bench at the foot of the bed is great for storage and putting on your shoes before you leave to go out. 

I would definitely stay with Susan again the next time I'm in Seattle. "
34980	5218550	10.0	10.0	29133193	"Susan was extremely hospitable and accommodating. We were Canadian travellers visiting Seattle and Susan made us feel right at home. Her apartment is very well kept and located in a quaint area of Seattle. The apartment itself is a Victorian style building with an interesting history of its own. The location is within walking distance to the downtown area and located on some very convenient bus routes. 

She was an excellent hostess and we will most definitely keep her in mind the next time we visit Seattle."
34981	5218550	10.0	10.0	29467974	We had a lovely time at Susan's place. The apartment is gorgeous. Smartly furnished, very clean and orderly, and sun-drenched. Susan was just as lovely! She was smiley and welcoming. We very much enjoyed her conversation, she is very worldly. The room was like a private oasis. The bed was comfy, the chairs next to the wonderfully large windows were so inviting. Susan had little snacks out for us. The bathroom was terrific as well. Susan had a generous spread of toiletries and fresh white towels for us to use. (Obsessed with the sugar scrub and Shea butter lotion!!) Would definitely recommend Susan and her apt! 
34982	5218550	10.0	10.0	30034202	Susan is so amazing. Her apartment is very lovely and gorgeous. It is a wonderful experience to stay in her apartment when I was traveling in Seattle. I felt very cozy because Susan prepared everything I need: clean towel, hairdryer, shampoo, electric kettle, heat and warm blanket. I love to talk with her about what I did and where I went every day, and glad to know her daily life too. It made me feel the local style of Seattle, very interesting experience. Susan also gave me many useful advises for exploring Seattle. Thank you so much, Susan. I hope I can be back soon :)
34983	5218550	10.0	10.0	30387284	Susan was such a great host! She is very accommodating and thoughtful. This a quiet retreat from all the noise in downtown, and walking distance to downtown, the convention center and Pike/Pine. There are at least 5 Starbucks within 5 minutes walking, so you'll never be lacking in caffeine. The pictures accurately show the charm of the apartment. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Susan!
34984	5218550	10.0	10.0	30694381	"Susan was very kind and helped us with everything we asked of her.
Her apartment is in a charming 100 years old building. 
The location is very nice - 5 minutes walk to Pike and Pine streets, near their intersection with Broadway street - lots of restaurants and night clubs in that area. In the same time the apartment itself is on a quiet side street. And it's not far from the city center - 10 minutes of walking downhill and maybe 20 minutes walking back uphill, if you don't take the bus."
34985	5218550	10.0	10.0	30936337	Susan was awesome and her apartment was lovely and I'm a great location :) we loved it!! We will absolutely come back :)
34986	5218550	10.0	10.0	31427483	Susan was wonderful! Very sweet lady. The room is a good size which we had 3 luggages. The home is old but it is charming. The are a few steps to get to the door but totally manageable. Susan was never in our way &  sharing a bathroom was not an issue. I highly recommend this space because of its location. It's literally walking distance to everything.
34987	5218550	10.0	10.0	31593957	Susan has a lovely home and was welcoming and helpful. Her apartment was a perfect location to explore downtown Seattle. We really enjoyed staying with her and would certainly stay there again off available if in Seattle again. 
34988	5218550	10.0	10.0	31710580	Susan's apartment is lovely, and so is she! We did not get to spend too much time with her since she was away in Park City, but she is very friendly and helpful. Her place is in a great location--close to everything, but quiet! 
34989	5218550	10.0	10.0	32095866	A beautiful home in a wonderful part of the city and an owner with a wonderful heart too ! 
34990	5218550	10.0	10.0	32239356	Susan was an exceptional host and I loved staying with her in her lovely apartment.  She is warm, interesting, and incredibly helpful.  We even went to a fantastic exhibition together just outside of Seattle.  First Hill is a great neighbourhood too.  I would highly recommend staying here.  
34991	5218550	10.0	10.0	32517035	Susan was a great host.  She was helpful and knowledgable as well as very patient with questions and directions.  The area is beautiful and the building is old but full of all the charm that brings.  Bring ear plugs though as there is a bit of road noise and floors and be creaky.   The room and bathroom were very clean and exactly as shown in the pictures.   All in all, Susan's place was great for us and we would stay there again!
34992	5218550	10.0	10.0	32838475	Our host was incredibly sweet and hospitable.  The place was clean and comfortable. 5 stars all around!!
34993	5218550	10.0	10.0	33070431	Susan was very welcoming and generous. She worked to coordinate with us on getting into the building and offered to help carry luggage. My boyfriend and I were so busy on our trip that we didn't get to socialize with Susan much, but she was very accommodating and a very open, great person, especially considering she just moved into this particular apartment. The room was quiet and peaceful and the location was perfect. Susan had towels ready for us, bathroom amenities to use, and a nice bed made!
34994	5218550	10.0	10.0	33611647	Susan is an amazing hostess in Seattle, just like the city, sophisticated, warming, friendly and neat. The house is in a great location in downtown Seattle and is a piece of art itself.

34998	5218550	10.0	10.0	34961093	Susan was a fabulous host! Very friendly and offered many useful tips for enjoying my time in Seattle. The location of her apartment couldn't be more ideal...easy walking to both the Capitol Hill neighborhood and downtown Seattle. The guestroom overlooks the street so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. The room is spacious and well appointed as is the rest of the apartment.

Susan was a fabulous host-- so friendly, thoughtful, and welcoming. We arrived late and found everything prepared for us in such a lovely and cozy apartment: towels, shower essentials, and even snacks and lots of travel information (although we had our plan and didn't use it)!
The bed was very comfortable. Her kitchen was also very well equipped, which benefitted us a lot during our stay. The apartment is located in a lovely and quiet community, where you can easily walk to downtown or bus stops. We really appreciated that there was such a nice ""home"" to return to after a very tiring sightseeing day. :)"

Susan has a beautiful and tastefully appointed apartment in the heart of the city, well within walking distance of many of the popular attractions. Susan was our first AirBnB experience and she turned out a terrific Ambassador for the concept. Susan was generous with her hospitality and willingness to share her home. She was genuine in her interest to chat about so many topics, ready to give advice and answer our numerous questions. We found this invaluable, far better than staying in an impersonal  hotel where the staff know little of the locality. We would thoroughly recommend a stay with Susan.

35033	5218550	10.0	10.0	53322660	This is a great place to stay and Susan is a most gracious host.  She went out of her way several times in order to take care of us and make us feel welcome.

The apartment is beautiful and it is located in a quiet neighborhood just a couple of blocks from everywhere you want to be.  Great experience.

The room and apartment are clean and comfortable, only a short walk from Pike Place markets and the monorail to the Sky Needle.

35037	5218550	10.0	10.0	54984524	Everything is great in Susan's place! The house is lovely and bright, and it is close to everywhere in downtown Seattle. Living in the house with a history of 110 years is also very special and intersting. The room enjoys great street view and we have lots of space for our staff. There is a wardrobe in the room and the bed is also very comfortable. Shared bathroom will not be a problem, and we work well with different timetables. I cannot come up with anything I will need in her house. Susan told me about lots of activities happened during homy stay here, and I really had a nice time!
35038	5218550	10.0	10.0	55180783	My husband and I were in Seattle over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend for a wedding at the art museum, and we thought that staying at Suzan's would be just the thing.  As it turns out, Seattle is worth visiting just to meet Suzan!  She is an extraordinary woman...a story for another time.  What you need to know: her home is warm and inviting and imbued with a beautiful sense of taste and style.  The guest room has a soothing and restful atmosphere, and because of our hectic travel schedule, on Saturday before the evening wedding, my husband and I just sat around and relaxed rather than taking in the city.  This quiet respite was just what we needed.  I enjoyed the tea, the art, and the overall hospitality.  Suzan was even kind enough to take some pictures of us in our finery, the only pics of our vacation that were taken.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I hope you enjoy your visit to Suzan's bnb as much as we did. --Wendy
35039	5218550	10.0	10.0	55598899	Seattle is a beautiful city.  I grew up here and can't believe the transformation.  I visit regularly as my children live here but they are both in small apartments.  I love spending the day with them but allowing them their own privacy in the evenings.  Susan's place was just what I needed.  Its within walking distance from everything.  She was very welcoming and kind.  I highly recommend this lovely place.
35040	5218550	10.0	10.0	55796273	We had an amazing time! The location was perfect, right next to down town. Susan was a wonderful host and provided everything we could think of. I would recommend her to friends and family!

35046	5218550	10.0	10.0	58114278	"Susan is such a pleasant and upbeat host who will gladly welcome you into her inner-city oasis. Her entire apartment is cozy and has nice views of the surrounding neighborhood. Susan wants to ensure you feel at home by giving you full access to her specialty teas and providing spa-like shampoo, conditioner, etc. Also, I had the best sleep of my life on the room's bed - certainly a restful escape from the busy city. She has lots of tourist resources and brochures to help you decide how to spend your time in Seattle. She will gladly give you recommendations on restaurants, activities, etc, or let you be if you wish for peace and quiet. Her place is a convenient 10-15 min walk to pike's market. 

The surrounding neighborhood is relatively safe. Just be aware and smart when walking home at night from the downtown area.

This was a wonderful place to begin using airbnb and I will certainly return the next time I visit Seattle. I highly recommend for anyone - whether you are a tourist seeing Seattle, on a business trip, or just need a relaxing staycation. "
35657	9318524	10.0	10.0	54493803	Jocelyn's listing was great!  The space was clean and comfortable and located in a safe neighborhood.  Lots of things were walkable from there as well.  Plus, the view from the roof was breathtaking.  I highly recommend this listing!
36429	1159226	10.0	9.0	11534288	Such a cute place! Christine was so nice and accessible for any questions my group and I had during our stay. The rooms were comfortable and the apartment was very clean. The location is in the heart of Capitol Hill and there is a 24 hour grocery store across the street! Starbucks is nearby as well. We really enjoyed the neighborhood and could easily walk downtown. The apartment building was quaint and there is an intercom that you can page directly to your room so you can get in when other people in your group are in the apartment. It was a great stay and I would definitely stay again. 
36430	1159226	10.0	9.0	13322406	Great place for a family: clean, well-appointed, centrally located. The block is a bit noisy, but the windows have good sound insulation so it wasn't a problem at all. Would definitely stay there again.
36431	1159226	10.0	9.0	14578470	"If you were ever reticent of using Airbnb to visit Seattle, this place is an excellent reference point. It seems very similar to a 2-bedroom hotel suite, nicely appointed, with a small kitchen. This place is not at all like invading someone's home. And, it is right downtown--about 8 minutes drive to Pike Place--in a really nice little eclectic neighborhood of Seattle.
"
36432	1159226	10.0	9.0	19331852	"Listing was accurate. Very convenient. Neat, clean, modern amenities. Would use it again next time in Seattle. 
Neighborhood in transition - lots of construction.  A bit noisy, but aircon meant we did not need to leave windows open in August, so no worries."
36433	1159226	10.0	9.0	20425556	Great apartment in Capitol Hill. Walking distance to tons of great restaurant and bars. Super easy check-in and checkout procedures. Will definitely stay here again and it has my highest recommendation.
36434	1159226	10.0	9.0	21829932	St Johns apartments are as described - right in the heart of Capitol hill activity.  It is a very busy area with people talking outside until 4 AM, but it didn't cause me any sleep problems. The bed was very comfortable! The apt was well stocked and organized with lots of room.  Really like an old hotel but more space. It is an old building but everything worked.  The rental people were personable, professional, and accessible-have an office downstairs.  I feel for the price they should include parking which is a hassle unless you pay for the parking pass- but at least there was parking available. Overall a good palce to stay.
36435	1159226	10.0	9.0	23912691	The apartment was great - exactly as expected. Christine made sure to prepare the apartment for our arrival. The apt was in a great location as advertised, central to everything that we wanted to do. Would rent here again if we visited Seattle.

36437	1159226	10.0	9.0	32601085	"We had a great time at St. John's Apartments and would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Seattle.  It was in a perfect location, Capitol Hill is a very fun vibrant neighborhood with lots of great restaurants, bars and people watching.  Downtown, Pike Place market, etc. is only a 15-20 minute walk down Pike street, and a cab ride home from downtown was $8.

Christine was also very easy to communicate with, and I had no problem arranging our check-in etc.

The apartment itself was also great.  The beds were super comfy, and the kitchen has everything you could hope for and more.

Overall, I would highly recommend St. John's Apartments if you are looking for a great place in a really fun neighborhood!  "
36438	1159226	10.0	9.0	45391315	This apartment is great!  It's spacious, clean, and the location is fantastic.  Johnny and Christine are very flexible and accommodating.
36439	1159226	10.0	9.0	51712217	We had a great stay @ St. Johns Apartments. The neighbourhood can be a bit louder during the night but was never a trouble for us. The apartment is very conveniently located, close to Interstate, parking space available, close to the bus stop, and with a gourmet supermarket in front. How much better can it get? The interiour is perfect, clean and you feel at home immediately. I travelled with two 78yo ladies and yes the stairs were part of their daily exercice :-), but they managed with ease. Everything we needed was available in the apartment, Christine is a charming host, the information book contains everthing I could come up with. We had a great time in Seattle and I long to come back soon!
36440	1159226	10.0	9.0	54185920	We had a great stay!  The place was in such a good location.  You can walk anywhere from here!  There's also a lot of great dinner and drink places nearby! The apartment was nice and clean with great amenities!  Christine was extremely nice too!  Thanks again!

36723	4616695	10.0	10.0	24431307	This was one of the best Air BNB experiences I've had, from start to finish. Raven is very good about being in communication and she is very clear with her information. And she will give you A TON of info on how everything will work, where to eat, what to do, etc. She was incredibly helpful in that way. In addition, her condo is fabulous. It's small, but well appointed and very clean. The artwork adds a lovely touch, as well. Getting into the apartment was easy and the building feels very safe and secure. Between walking, Uber, and taxis, you can get anywhere you could want as a tourist in Seattle. AND when we arrived at the condo, Raven had even set out a bottle of wine for us and left us chocolates on our towels. There was nothing I would change or wish to be different. Raven is a very thorough, very friendly, and excellent host.

She provided a ton of useful information about the area and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival.  Raven's condo is in the perfect location and we walked to many of our destinations.  The building is secure and the neighborhood is safe and clean.

36733	4616695	10.0	10.0	36186032	Check in was simple and her place is charming and spotless. Appreciated the fresh coffee beans and milk.  The condo is nicely located, convenient to downtown and Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Walked to the new Starbucks roasters and Serious Pie on Pike.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thanks Raven!
36734	4616695	10.0	10.0	36380990	Absolutely loved Raven's condo. Everything was exactly as described and tips were extremely helpful. We loved her taste in decor and the condo was spotless. The location was great as you can walk most places. We parked the car for the weekend and used Uber for longer distances. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks for sharing your home with us 
36735	4616695	10.0	10.0	37183297	"Raven's apartment was lovely and exactly as described. 

Location: 
The apartment is in a great location within walking distance to restaurants and shops in Capitol Hill. It's also about a $9 Lyft ride from the tourist sites downtown. 

Raven: 
Raven was super easy going and communicated very well. She also made a list of tips for restaurants, places to visit, etc. which was greatly appreciated : ) 

Apartment: 
The apartment itself was exactly as advertised. Clean and well designed, stocked with bathroom and kitchen amenities. The place doesn't have AC. It was unseasonably hot when we were there (90+) but Raven left fans and the place cooled off pretty quickly. 

All in all, I'd totally stay here again!    "
36736	4616695	10.0	10.0	38872794	Raven's place was very comfortable and in a great neighborhood. She had awesome suggestions for places to eat and things to do. It was a convenient and cozy base camp for exploring the city. 
36737	4616695	10.0	10.0	40798015	I am so glad to choose this property, the access and process to get into the apartment was great, all shown in the website is what it is available, great location.
36738	4616695	10.0	10.0	41751304	Raven was so helpful, thorough in her information and friendly. Great at communicating and making me feel welcome! The photos don't do the place justice--it is gorgeous and kept meticulously clean and tidy! The art in the apartment is beautiful and the location is great (easy walk to Pike's Place + fun neighborhood shops). I especially loved all her recommendations for area businesses--it was great having the inside scoop. Thank you for the hassle-free, comfortable stay!
36739	4616695	10.0	10.0	42814463	"Despite we never met Raven in person, we have to say she was a perfect host. 
The condo was very clean and comfortable. 
The location is very good and Raven gave us great tipps to explore the City. 
We had bad luck with our luggage and raven helped us to call the Airline and to contact the delivery service. We were very thankful for the ""first aid kit"" with hygiene products like Shampoo and for ms wife a comb. 
If you are in seattle, stay at Ravens condo. "
36740	4616695	10.0	10.0	48535727	Raven's place is great and just what my husband and I needed for our short trip to Seattle.  The rooms were clean and cozy.  The chocolates on the bed (which was very comfortable) and basket of toiletries we might have forgotten were a nice touch.  We slept great and appreciated the quietness in the building and neighborhood.  We took Raven's city recommendations and all were spot on.  This was our first trip without a rental car because we didn't need one and walked everywhere.  It felt great to be a pedestrian and I'm glad she gave us the nudge to ditch the car for the weekend.  We've already recommended her place to a family member and look forward to being welcomed back to her place again.
36741	4616695	10.0	10.0	53365692	Raven was a wonderful host. The apartment was clean, comfortable and she made sure there were plenty of amenities. It was also very easy to check in and out, plus the location cannot be beat. Plus Raven provided many nearby recommendations on places to eat and drink, all of which were fantastic. I would stay here again, and recommend it to anyone who wants to be in the Capitol Hill/Downtown Seattle area. 
37365	4811583	10.0	10.0	24163691	My husband and I stayed at Garo's place when we visited Seattle. The one bedroom apartment is spacious and everything is nice and clean. It is very close to the downtown, Pike Place, Space Needle and all other main attractions of the city and has the best view of the harbour. Garo is also very nice to talk to and helpful. I will definitely come back again!
37366	4811583	10.0	10.0	24619628	The apartment was quiet, clean and serviceable; however, the pictures used to advertise it were misleading and did not show the actual space we rented. (Picture shows an ocean view, but the apartment actually overlooked a brick government building.) There were many advantages! Garo (the host) was super friendly (as were all the Ginosi Apartments staff) and quick to respond. They accommodated us when we arrived on Christmas day. The apartment was within close walking distance of many downtown attractions as well as Pioneer Square Station, which made it very easy to take the Central Link light rail to/from the airport. Also the neighborhood was nice. If you don't care about the view and just want quiet convenience while you explore the great city of Seattle, then I would recommend this place.
37367	4811583	10.0	10.0	51596114	The listing photos accurately reflect the space.  The flat is beautiful and quaint. The location is close to the waterfront. You can Uber down to the pier or pike place market for less than $25.
38092	5651254	10.0	10.0	29853908	"We traveled to Seattle to celebrate our first wedding anniversary... It was a beautiful spring day.  We rode the ferry from Bremerton into the Emerald City, got gorgeous flowers at the Pike Street Market... drove to West Seattle and found the ""Beautiful Craftsman Style Home""... And it was! Amy set everything up for us, the house was so comfortable, location perfect for our needs. It is close to all the culture of the neighborhood, dining, shopping, craft-breweries and of course the natural beauty of the Puget Sound region! The bed was super-comfy! Ahhhh! The only part that was unfortunate is that we were only there for one night! Thanks for your hospitality, Amy! We'd like to come stay with you again! "
38093	5651254	10.0	10.0	33321354	We had a fantastic time at Amy's home this Memorial Day weekend!  Amy, herself, was a flexible, generous host and the house (especially the guest bedroom) was delightfully cozy; complete with a dog possessing an equally cozy coat of fur and personality.  On top of that, Amy's home is in a great location; it is within walking distance of the ferry to Vashon Island (which we regrettably ran out of time for), a handful  of great places to eat, and several bus stations (of both land and sea) which can take you downtown in a flash.  By the third and final day of our stay, it became apparent that even a three-day weekend at Amy's was not long enough.  While we did get a chance to talk to Amy and sight-see downtown, we did not have our fill of either.  We are grateful for her hospitality and generosity for welcoming us into her home, and we hope to make a return visit someday.  If you would like to stay somewhere close to downtown Seattle but would also like a comfortable, relaxing environment, then Amy would be an ideal host.
38094	5651254	10.0	10.0	35477002	Amy is a gracious host and her home is lovely. We had a too-brief stay but loved the local pizza and coffee house choices and walk to the park.
38780	117165	10.0	10.0	452241	This property is absolutely beautiful, newly~built house with full view of Puget Sound from living room and large deck. Judith is a real person, just beginning as a BNB host. The guest bedroom is in the back, own bathroom and also a separate desk area. Total quiet, which is not as easy as it sounds in Seattle. The only problem with staying here is that you won't want to leave the deck, so peaceful and inviting.
38781	117165	10.0	10.0	467740	"This experience was absolutely wonderful.  It was my first time in Seattle and I was visiting a friend, and low and behold I made another friend through this service.  
The home was absolutely stunning, and Judith was more than welcoming and friendly.  The part of Seattle that she lives in is gorgeous.  Reminded me a lot of San Francisco, except that you have a view of mountains beyond the sea!  The back porch rivaled my view that I have in Colorado.  Close to a great market, bike shop, Alki beach (which is just the greatest place in Seattle), and lots of shops, restaurants and bars.  
The home is a quiet place to relax after enjoying the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle.  Easy to ride a bike from her home, down Alki Beach and to downtown.  
I am certain this home made my trip as amazing as it was.  Without this home and the friendship gained with Judith, it would have just been another trip to another beautiful city. 
I will not stay anywhere but Judith's home when visiting Seattle!"
38782	117165	10.0	10.0	479689	"It as a pleasure to stay at Judith's lovely place. The view from the deck is amazing, I was there in summer so I was catching the water taxi into town, which was a real treat - (you have to get a shuttle to the wharf).  I'm not sure how frequently buses go if you're bussing it, the place is a walk and bus ride to shops so keep that in mind if you're not driving.

Judith is a delight - and helpful with information. I'd definitely go back there. "
38783	117165	10.0	10.0	482104	Judith is an amazing person and her place is equally stellar. The experience is one of a kind with a home this gives you a feeling of being both in the air and at the ocean. It's one of the most amazing travel stay experiences I've ever had. Quiet, spacious, private and with Judith you are graced by a host is who is both worldly and down to earth. Really incredible overall!
38784	117165	10.0	10.0	491237	"Judith,

Thank you again so much for a wonderful weekend. My mom and I truly enjoyed staying with you in your beautiful home. Although we didn't get to spend much time together, I can tell you are a wonderfully spirited human being and I am glad to have met you. Sorry again for the surprise dog and working with us to make it comfortable for everyone. We really appreciated getting to spend more time together. 

Hope all is well,
Jessica"
38785	117165	10.0	10.0	511578	The house is great.  Wonderful view from the deck.  Judith is extremely helpful in planning your stay in Seattle and surrounding areas.  She knows the area very well.  Judith also provided us with fresh towels and access to her kitchen and intriguing conversation.  I would recommend this stay to anyone.
38786	117165	10.0	10.0	609864	"Do yourself a favor: stay here! The home boasts an incredible view from the patio (on my next visit, I would probably just get a book and hang out on the patio all day!). The house itself is spacious and clean, and Judith was very open to us sharing all of the common space on the first floor (kitchen, dining, living room). The guest suite has a comfortable bed, a huge bathroom (both super clean). We didn't use the office space, but there's that too.

It really is good to have a car...we rented one for four days and didn't regret it. Plus, Judith will recommend the best places to visit in the nearby area and it is worthwhile to have a car.

The best part our our stay was Judith! We felt more like friends that strangers renting a room. Judith greeted us with hugs and refreshments, had coffee and muffins every morning for us, and throughout are visit we had opportunities to share conversation and get to know her. She is an incredible person and so interesting to talk to! She was also so kind in recommending us places to go or visit, and even loaned out her own personal gear since we came ill-prepared. If you stay here, don't miss out on getting to know her!"
38787	117165	10.0	10.0	642853	"Judith& her cat Kody are all very friendly and easygoing, also won't disturb u anytime. She is a graceful woman who can take good care of herself and the guests. The responsible and positive attitude to life can gives u a very wonderful feeling. Judith also have a good taste in art. You can feel it from her beautiful house which has a fantastic waterscap vision. I will miss u,Judith&Kody(^.^)
This is my first time using airbnb, fortunately it was so amazing and cool!!
The house was just looks like the pictures shown in Internet.  I hope I can have more chance to feel the home-like feeling with airbnb & remarkable host:)"
38788	117165	10.0	10.0	652878	Judith was a great host. She worked most of the time and we chatted in the morning over coffee. The views from here deck were spectacular. One afternoon  I decided to work from the deck and watch the sunset.

Judith is an amazing host and very friendly person. Her house is quite and gorgeous, with specious living room and incredible view over Puget Sound.  She provide us with access to the kitchen, coffee and muffins every morning.  We've had conversations and  get to know each other.
  The house is a short walk to the public transportation  - water taxi shuttle or city bus, couple minutes down to Alki beach and surrounding restaurants.  
 
Definitely  recommend this stay to everyone.
 
We'll miss you Judith and Kody!

38790	117165	10.0	10.0	692385	"Awesome views and a wonderful host. I would stay here anytime I'm in Seattle. It was our first time ever to use such form of accomodation. Now that I've discovered this other great and more affordable way to stay in Seattle, I would not wish to stay in any hotel ever again if this place is available.
Locationwise it's convenient to the best spots in Seattle.
Judith generously offered us her living room and I used her dining table everyday to do some work away from home.
Thank You for a wonderful stay.
"
38791	117165	10.0	10.0	706506	"We stayed twice at Judith's place and loved it. She is the best host that anyone could have. She gave us lots of space to use and was always available to answer any questions that we had.
I would'n t want to stay anywhere else if i'm in the area.
Her place is home away from home.
"
38792	117165	10.0	10.0	711964	This was my first Airbnb experience and I was pretty nervous about staying with a stranger. Judith was warm and welcoming--her house is fantastic (the view is phenomenal)--and the stay couldn't have been nicer. Comfy bed, clean and roomy accommodations and I came and went as needed for work, though it felt like a retreat getaway. I'm hoping to stay at Judith's place every time I come to Seattle!
38793	117165	10.0	10.0	723428	I looked forward to meeting Judith as she was a highly recommended host. I appreciated her kind consideration and willingness to book me on such short notice. Immediately evident was that her home was beautifully built and kept. She provides first rate accommodations with private bathroom and office off master bedroom. Arcadian architecture features spacious living area with stone fireplace, hardwood floors, and wood planked cathedral ceiling with rustic rafters and great gabled wall of windows welcoming picturesque waterscape of Puget Sound. Enjoy majestic mountain views and spectacular sunsets from the comfort and convenience of this home, whether inside or out on the deck. It's a short distance to town where shops, eateries, and restaurants are along Alki Beach waterfront that boasts the most beautiful panoramic view of downtown Seattle day or night. Sublime seascape meets lofty landscape stretched by spectacular city skycrapers hugging the  horizon. Bring your camera! Pictures are worth a thousand words but the experience of being here says it all. This is one of those places you'll want to write home about and visit again... 
38794	117165	10.0	10.0	734660	First experience with Air BnB and what a great way to start! Terrific home,and wonderful host. I would definitely do it all over again. Thank you Judith.
38795	117165	10.0	10.0	746994	"Judith's house has the most unique architecture of any home I have been in.  The interior is very well maintained and spacious. For the chance to be somewhere quiet yet still a fairly brief drive to the airport or downtown you couldn't find a better place. If you enjoy going for a walk on the beach it is accessible by walking about 8 blocks. For those who want to ""shop locally"" there are many shops at the Alaska Junction (2 miles away, car recommended) . There is also a well furnished kitchen which is great if you want to fix some breakfast in the morning or, as a tourist, fix a bite to eat at the end of a long day. "
38796	117165	10.0	10.0	805362	Everything about Judith's place is amazing, she's the kind of host I hope to find at airbnb. The home was well maintain and clean with wonderful views easy access to food and entertainment. Judith made sure that I had everything I needed including special dinners with friends. Also, I had to say that Kodiak the cat(my new friend) is a wonderful pet. My visit and first experience with airbnb and Seattle were wonderful. 
38797	117165	10.0	10.0	866845	Everything about my experience in Judith's home was top-notch.  The house itself was clean, well-maintained, and comfortable.  The house itself is beautiful and the view was incredible, as expected.  Communication with Judith was easy and companionable.  I hope to stay here again soon!
38798	117165	10.0	10.0	898540	"Judith is a most graceful & warm host - very open, extremely easy to talk to, and very welcoming to her guests. 

The house itself is even more beautiful and cozier than the pictures, if that's possible! I've had a lovely time and I can't wait to return in the near future. "
38799	117165	10.0	10.0	903187	I was fortunate to stumble on this listing. Judith's place is beautiful and cozy with a comfortable en suite/office arrangement. The unusual warm(ish) sunny day in Seattle that allowed me to enjoy sitting on the deck in February added to making this a wonderful experience.  
38800	117165	10.0	10.0	923585	Judith's home is wonderful! It is just as beautiful as advertised, and Judith's graciousness and her warm welcome were terrific. I couldn't recommend this location any more highly!
38801	117165	10.0	10.0	935295	We had an awesome stay with Judith and an even better Sunday morning breakfast/brunch in her lovely home. Me and my fiance Heidi stayed in Judith's home on the Presidents Day long weekend for my first ever trip to Seattle (from Vancouver). We were held up at the border and were about 4-5 hours late to our ETA at Judith's home but she was still waiting for us. The  home is beautiful and our was very cosy and clean. We also had a lovely companion in Kodiak (the ragdoll cat). The views from the home are fabulous. I would recommend Judith and her home to anyone looking for a quiet and indulgent place.
38802	117165	10.0	10.0	1015727	Gorgeous place - it's crazy to think the house is only 20 mins or so from downtown! The view overlooking the water is worth it alone, but Judith is a super accommodating host, and great for a chat on a rainy day!
38803	117165	10.0	10.0	1081789	We were looking for a quiet place to celebrate our anniversary and the views and the home certainly lent themselves to a great celebration. 
38804	117165	10.0	10.0	1129149	A wonderful place to stay, with views over the mountains and sea and beach walks nearby. We saw seals playing in the bay and sunset over the water. There are good local restaurants and the city is just a 10 minute boat ride away. Perfect for anyone who wants both the city and the outdoors.
38805	117165	10.0	10.0	1236611	Judith was a pleasant and competent hostess. The place was exactly as described. The view was truly awe inspiring. The suite in back was private and accommodating. No complaints whatsoever. A delightful stay.
38806	117165	10.0	10.0	1466346	Judith's home is absolutely breathtaking. She was a very pleasant housemate to live with. I would recommend this accommodation to anyone who is looking for a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. Kody the cat is a cutie pie as well and has been fun to live with!
38807	117165	10.0	10.0	1484173	"I had never believed it possible to arrive to an ""old friend"" instead of a regular host! But that is the way it was. Complete match host, guest and house with surroundings. Welcome to Norway Judith! "
38808	117165	10.0	10.0	1514827	"I have never stayed in a home and rather stay in hotels so I was a bit nervous about how everything works.  Judith did an amazing job at answering and communicating things along the way prior to my trip so that when I was on my trip I could sit back, relax, and just enjoy life. And that's just what I did.

Judith was a very gracious host and her home was truly a mark of beauty on the West Seattle hillside.  I could have sat and starred out off the deck at the lovely view for days on end.  It is truly breathtaking and a sight to see!  The house was everything and more than I get out of a hotel stay so in my opinion I am glad I came across this place!  Everything was placed neatly to accommodate anything a  traveler/visitor could want.  A nice breakfast bar, table, reading nooks, and the front deck of course!  All very quaint!  I love how this house was put together!  Very decorative and the pictures don't lie, only seeing it in person IS much, much better!  Thank you for your courtesy Judith!  I will be back after I leave my mark in other cities around the world!  THANK YOU!"

38812	117165	10.0	10.0	2048777	This was a great place to stay, beautiful view, and a very welcoming hostess.  We were in the area for a family wedding, Judith was very gracious, allowing my son and stay in the afternoon between the wedding and the reception.  My Mom spent the night, and enjoyed the whole experience.  I would not hesitate to suggest this location to friends and family, and would love to stay there myself sometime.  
38813	117165	10.0	10.0	2140632	A stay in the house of Judith Cederblom is like a stay with your favorite cousin.  She is warm, friendly, intelligent and funny.  Her house is immaculate and beautifully located overlooking Puget Sound.  We took breakfast on the deck, as well as wine and cheese, watching various boats passing by..  Our room  had a comfortable bed and chair and a spacious private bath.  We spent several evenings together, sharing stories and conversations in her living room, overlooking her large stone fireplace.  When you visit with Judith, you are visiting with your new best friend.
38814	117165	10.0	10.0	2207112	Judith's home is a treasure. Looking out from her deck is one of the most beautiful views I have ever enjoyed. She is a charming hostess who made us feel like close friends, while allowing us all the privacy we wanted.

It really was quite a problem realising that we had to go back to England after our final couple of days with Judith. Our final dinner in USA was on Judith's balcony overlooking Puget Sound as the sun came down.
Thanks Judith"
38816	117165	10.0	10.0	2456679	WOW!  What a wonderful and beautiful home!  The view, the location, the view, the host, the view, the deck...  did I mention the view?!  :-)   We had such a great time at Judith's home for 3 days; so relaxing.  Alki beach area in west Seattle was great.   The area felt like you were in a lil' island community.  You are out of the city, but only a quick water taxi ride or car ride away.  Next time we are in the area we will definitely stay with Judith!!   
38817	117165	10.0	10.0	2665883	"I was about to arrive to Seattle.
I wanted a nice place with Wifi and an ocean's view.
And I shared much more !
Judith was nice, very helpful before my arrival. I had some last moment issues but she was very accommodating. She invited me to go to a very interesting event with her, she helped me for grocery shopping,... And we had very pleasant moments together. We had long talks and funny times. I really enjoyed staying with her. Judith was part of my great meetings of my trip.
Plus, she has many leaflets or other helpful documents to make your way to Seattle.

The room and attached bath are on the main floor, everything was very clean and comfortable.  Judith also has a great selection of tea to accompany the coffee.

I would highly recommend her home for a great place to get away and relax!"

Thank you for having us over :)"
38820	117165	10.0	10.0	3526772	While planning a trip to Seattle,  my daughter suggested I try airbnb to select a place to stay.  I chose Judith's lovely home based on the location and the reviews.  It was perfect.  She is a wonderful hostess and went out of her way to make me feel welcome in her home.  She has a wealth of knowledge about the area and a wide variety of activities.  Sipping coffee in the morning with her and taking in the view from her deck is a perfect way to start the day.  
38821	117165	10.0	10.0	4842841	"This was our second time staying with Judith.  In fact, there was another place on AirBnB closer to where we needed to be, but the chance to see and catch up with Judith again was not worth passing up!  Judith is a wonderful host, an amazing woman, and I can not say enough good things about her, her hospitality, and just the warm feeling you get by being welcomed in to her home.

Everything is clean, comfortable, convenient, and the views of the sound in the morning (especially on sunny days) just make you feel happy all over!  Don;t hesitate - book now!"
38822	117165	10.0	10.0	4929745	Judith's home is beautiful, peaceful, and so very relaxing - exactly as it appears in the pictures but even better because you can feel the breeze from the water, hear the birds, and enjoy the views from the huge glass windows (or even better, from the deck when the weather cooperates).  Judith is a delightful host who knows how to strike the perfect balance between interacting and allowing for privacy.  I stayed with her the week before I was moving and was very busy with work and details, and only wish I had more time to connect with her, but appreciated her allowing me the space I needed to focus on tasks while also relaxing.  I didn't feel like I was intruding on someone else's space, and I also didn't feel like she was having to change her routine - really, a perfect balance.  Highly recommend Judith's beautiful home to anyone looking for a location outside of the city to relax and recharge.  
38823	117165	10.0	10.0	5106919	Judith's house is beautiful and in an awesome location.  My husband and I had the best time there and even shared drinks and stories with Judith and some friends of hers.  We felt so welcome and at home there.  I will definitely stop by again if I am in the area.
38824	117165	10.0	10.0	5360986	Judith is a sweetheart.  Very easy to work with and condiderate.  The house has spectacular views and it is a very comfortable and clean place to stay.  Location is a convenient walk to Alki Beach.
38825	117165	10.0	10.0	5496223	"This place has one of the best views! Beautiful deck over the water, mountains with snow cap mountains, 15-20 minute walk to the beach! The house was very architecturally unique, beautifully decorated, and the rooms were very clean. Judith was very welcoming and treated us like a true guest.

The profile for this place is very accurate. Since my girlfriend is Turkish and Judith speaks turkish, they hit it off really well, and the whole trip was superb. Also, it was sunny and warm almost every day we were there. Maybe Judith did that as well?

Very relaxed environment both with Judith and when she is not there. A great home away from home if you do go to Seattle.

38826	117165	10.0	10.0	5662112	This was our first airbnb experience and what a fantastic discovery Judith and her lovely home were for us.  The pictures are incredible, but in actuality the setting is even more beautiful than captured on the pics.  Judith‚Äôs home is neat, clean and inviting with shared space for visiting and private space for resting.   What could be better than starting one‚Äôs day with coffee on the deck and finishing the day with a beautiful pastel sunset?  Judith was a wonderful host and her home is a retreat/respite for any traveler.    Thank you, Judith -- for making us feel welcome, relaxed and content.    You are truly special!  (Bob and Mary)
38827	117165	10.0	10.0	5798262	Judy was an amazing host and her place sure is beautiful. I especially liked hanging out on the deck in the mornings and late afternoons. She had some good recommendations for my stay here and even drove me to the bus stop when I left!
38828	117165	10.0	10.0	5894415	We had a fantastic time with Judith - she's smart, well read, full of energy and has a wicked sense of humour!  We ended up staying up well into the early morning, putting the world to rights.  The house itself is beautiful, with a deck looking out over the Puget Sound.  Very sad to leave as it felt like we were parting with a friend. See you in Barcelona, Judith!
38829	117165	10.0	10.0	5968677	I almost hate to share because I want to keep this spot for myself. Judith is truly a beautiful person, her house is wonderful and the view of Puget Sound extraordinary. We would still be sitting on her deck looking over the Sound if it had been possible. I'm not sure what was more lovely, Judith's personality or the view from her home, both were fabulous. The next time we need to recharge our life batteries we're going to Judith's.

She was very accommodating and extremely helpful in guiding us to our journey around the city. She knows all the cool spots, sights to see and events going on.

When we go back to Seattle, we are going to see if Judith is available first, and plan our trip around her vacancies! That's how much we would want to stay with her again. 

If you get a chance to stay here and interact with Judith, don't miss it.  "
38834	117165	10.0	10.0	7331779	My favorite thing about the house was the view, and what a view it has! absolutely gorgeous! Judith's house is very sweet and cute as well as full of light. The entire house is completely soaked with the most beautiful sunset in the evening, if you are lucky with the weather. Judith is a very engaging person and we had a lot of fun talking about a lot of things over wine and meals together. The area is very quiet and remote so you need a car to get around, but I would definitely stay here again instead of the busy downtown area. 
38835	117165	10.0	10.0	7424537	Quiet,serene place.The view is beautifull! Bedroom is clean, comfy.
38836	117165	10.0	10.0	7491539	We had a great experience at Judith's place.  Both my wife & I agreed that staying with Judith contributed significantly to our enjoyment of our time in Seattle.  She was a warm, welcoming and humorous host.  Great bedroom & bathroom.  And the postcard-perfect views from her home were beyond expectations!  Hope we have the opportunity to visit again...

Could you ask something more?
This is perfect if you stay in Seattle, a corner of peace, silence, culture and light.
Judith is a special person, she will share with you not only the house, but also her culture, humor and tips.
We really had a very pleasant time there, and Judith‚Äôs home has been determinant.

You'll realize you've chosen the right place when you see the breathtaking Puget Sound view and then meet your host, Judith.  She truly cares that you have a nice stay, but even more, she is wonderful to get to know.  She had everything we needed for a comfortable, cozy stay in her beautiful home.  A 10 minute ferry from beautiful Alki Beach in her neighborhood is a fun and easy way to go to downtown Seattle.  And we loved just being in Alki Beach.  We will be back to stay in Judith's house in West Seattle.  It was perfect!"
38842	117165	10.0	10.0	14556622	Perched on a hill with panoramic views of Puget Sound, this really is a Room With A View. The house is fabulous and the deck is the perfect spot for breakfast while watching ships go sailing by. It's also a tranquil location; a great place to think big thoughts without disturbance or outside intrusion. Judith's a wonderful host with a wealth of good books and music that you're welcome to share, With a little encouragement, she might even recite some Shakespearean sonnets or Persian poetry for you. 
38843	117165	10.0	10.0	15405194	"A beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood with a stunning view!  Many thanks to Judith, our hostess, for making our first airbnb stay such a wonderful experience.  She made us feel at ease and at home during our four-night stay.  Judith is also a pleasure to spend time with and to get to know.

The room is very private, quiet, and comfortable.  There is a large private bath directly attached to the room, and there is also an adjacent work space.  My partner and I were surprised to find that we slept better in this room than we do in our own home!

Close by is a very good and very popular Italian restaurant -- an easy 7-minute (or so) walk down the hill towards the waterfront.  The main Alki strip is about a 20-minute walk away.  While we had a car, we often walked to the restaurants at Alki Beach because we enjoy the exercise when we are on vacation.  The Alki Beach / West Seattle neighborhood is a little gem that is often overlooked by visitors. It has many interesting shops and good restaurants that will not disappoint."
38844	117165	10.0	10.0	15859447	What a beautiful home and beautiful person.Everything is exactly as it appears in the picture, however cannot capture just how beautiful it really is.  Judith waited up to make sure we got settled after long flight delays.  The room was comfortable and sparkling clean.  Judith is an amazing host and so very thoughtful.  She is one of those people you cross paths with and feel like she is an old friend.  She has an amazing feel for knowing what you need and when you need it.  We truly loved staying here.  The view, the home and the host will remain with us!  
38845	117165	10.0	10.0	16077141	Our stay in Judith's home was the best beginning of our west coast trip we could imagine. We had inspiring discussions having breakfast on the terasse deck of her house with this amazing view over pudget sound. She helped us in any kind (restaurant tips etc.) and was the perfect host. We would come back at any time.
38846	117165	10.0	10.0	16540450	Judith was a wonderful host. She welcomed us on arrival, and made certain that we had everything we needed. Her home is lovely, peaceful, and quiet. The view of the Puget Sound is unbeatable, and we spent most of our time sitting on the deck looking out over the water and the Olympic range. The neighborhood is high on a hill, but it's an easy walk to Alki. We loved it!
38847	117165	10.0	10.0	17752900	More amazing then the picture...The home and views are beautiful!..Thank you Judith for thinking of all the important details...we had a restful, fun holiday...Location is great to get to beach, downtown all that the Seattle area offers! 
38848	117165	10.0	10.0	18259431	We can't imagine staying at a more ideal place in Seattle than Judith's beautiful home. This was our first experience staying at a personal residence instead of a hotel, and we're so glad we made that choice. Located a few (hilly) blocks from Alki Beach, this wonderful house surrounded us with beauty, comfort, and peace while still allowing us to easily access downtown Seattle via water taxi, bus, or car. The accommodations are lovely, and from the deck, we enjoyed world-class sunsets and fantastic views of Puget Sound and the mountains. Judith is the perfect hostess. She made us feel very much at home, offering information and suggesting resources while allowing us to come and go at will. Judith is a treasure, and we look forward to staying at her home again.

Hope to stay there again on our next visit to Seattle!"
38850	117165	10.0	10.0	18979255	The home is beautiful, the view is fantastic, the location couldn't be better and Judith is absolutely fantastic. What a marvelous host! She helped us plan our days in and around Seattle and Mt Rainier and her knowledge was invaluable. My girlfriend and I had the time of our lives staying at Judith's! Already looking forward to coming back some day! 
38851	117165	10.0	10.0	19278986	We really loved our stay in Seattle with Judith. The setting was wonderful and Judith's home was so lovely and cozy. We loved all the facilities and wished that we had a rainy day so that we could cuddle up on the sofa directly in front of the large window front to enjoy the beautiful view over the English Bay. Instead of that we got three very sunny days which we use to explore the city. And Seattle is awesome! Thanks so much to Judith for sharing her home with us. All the interesting talks and the time we spent together made our stay in Seattle so much more memorable. We will definitely come back!!! Thanks, Judith! Andreas & Katja, Germany
38852	117165	10.0	10.0	19631051	What a wonderful time we had with Judith! A beautiful comfortable home along with an even more precious lady. We'll be back!

38854	117165	10.0	10.0	20357251	If other hosts are as gracious and as interesting; if other airbnb homes are as comfortable and as beautiful; who could want to stay in a hotel? Judith is one of a kind, managing to carry on her own life and still care for and care about her guests. We experienced the best of two possibilities: we came and went as if it were our own place, and at the same time, we met a new friend.
38855	117165	10.0	10.0	20568567	Judith's home is beautiful and  the view is fantastic,How confortable that I stay here.I have a good time staying at seattle,thanks Judith. I'll come here again ..miss you !

38857	117165	10.0	10.0	21984392	We arrived at the house and Judith was there to welcome us and get us settled.  She is warm and friendly.  The house itself is gorgeous, as described.  Everything you require is there ready for you.  The views from the deck really are beyond description.  Whether it is a sunny or stormy day, the views of the Puget Sound are mesmerizing.  
38858	117165	10.0	10.0	23495610	"I was moving to Seattle from across the country, and spent my first month at Judith's house. I could not have asked for a better place and better first impression of Seattle!

The place is absolutely amazing - unbeatable views of the Puget Sound and Olympic Mountains, extremely well designed and decorated, in a beautiful, quiet, peaceful neighborhood. 

Judith was a wonderful host and great person to get to know - I really enjoyed her company during my stay. We had many great conversations, and I learned a lot from her. Kiri, the cat, was great company as well - even if she can be a bit of a brat at times! There's also the neighbor, Gary, who was very nice and helpful as well. 

The location is wonderful is you want something peaceful and beautiful. It doesn't feel like being in the city at all, and yet it's just a 20-something minute drive to downtown DURING RUSH HOUR(d readily recommend it to anyone coming to Seattle!"
38859	117165	10.0	10.0	24527040	What a fantastic home! The views from the living room and deck are amazing, looking over Puget sound and the snow capped Olympic mountains.  We actually saw a pod of Orca whales swimming and breaching in the sound! Judith's home is clean, in a safe convenient area,comfortable and very quiet. Judith is so welcoming and full of great knowledge about the surrounding area and offered some wonderful ideas about day trips, wine bars, and ferry rides to the islands.  There was a hot pot of coffee waiting for me each morning and I enjoyed chit chatting with Judith. She is so welcoming and made her home such a comfy place for me. I now have a new friend in Seattle and plan on staying with her again when I visit  my daughter who recently moved to Seattle.  
38860	117165	10.0	10.0	25333354	Very nice house. Judith was a very gracious host and was very sweet us. the view is amazing and we enjoyed the fires at night watching the city lights Thanks
38861	117165	10.0	10.0	25687120	I loved Judith's home. Very bright, excellent view and comfortable bed. I have never seen such a peaceful cat Judith has, a white ragdoll. We went for a stroll together :) The house was clean, very warm (underfloor heating and 2 fireplaces) and pictures are very accurate.  And above all, Judith is an excellent host!
38862	117165	10.0	10.0	29880445	My husband and I stayed in Judith's home (which far surpasses the photos seen in this listing) over a weekend while I had training in Seattle. We had a changing, inflexible schedule and Judith was very accommodating. It's about a 12 minute drive (scenic and beautiful the whole way) from downtown Seattle and has absolutely beautiful views of the Olympics, the Sound, and occasionally, huge bald eagles who nest nearby. Judith has a very comfortable home (the bed was so cozy and wonderful, the bathroom was spotless and private) with many eclectic decorations and souvenirs from her life's travels-as well as a profound gift for hosting and making her guests feel welcome. Her rag doll cat, Kiri was also a pleasure to be around (my husband didn't think he liked cats until he was around Kiri). Judith's home is within walking distance from Alki beach and several restaurants and shops, and she is a pleasure to get to know. We didn't want to leave! I am sure we will be back! 
38863	117165	10.0	10.0	30045245	"Judith's house is an incredible structure situated in an amazing (though also slightly out of the way) location. It sits at the top of the hill and overlooks towards the Puget Sound with 3 and half stories worth of giant windows. The porch is big and comfortable and the house itself is spacious. Judith was a fantastic host and I had a great time just talking with her. She was accommodating and my room was kept to high standards. She was also very helpful with anything I wanted to know about Washington.

Kiri, her cat is also very sweet and amusing. I walked to Alki beach a couple of times and the nearest bus stop is about a 10 minute walk. If you're thinking about going anywhere besides Alki beach, I would recommend renting a car."
38864	117165	10.0	10.0	30609716	"I stayed at Judith's with my husband on our 1st year anniversary during our adventurous trip to gorgeous Seattle and Washington. I have never felt more welcome or more connected to a place as I did on that one heavenly week, hovering above the color painted waters of Puget Sound in our own private suite in the trees. We had the great pleasure and honor to come to know Judith, an exciting, energetic, insightful personality with many stories to share. As an unexpected benefit, we both felt for that brief but memorable time with her as a part of the family, spending quality time enjoying the company of her plush kitty, her neighbors and friends, be it the frequenting fowl on the front deck or the kind and open-minded conversational humans.
Staying at this utopia of a home, carefully and sensitively designed with details of personal history and a natural taste for comfort and spiritual wholeness ‚Äì made our time go by with a peaceful smile and many good random fortunes gravitating our way with every new day. 
As far as the neighborhood is concerned ‚Äì we took it all in by landing nearby in the ferry and exploring hilly West Seattle with our rental car. We indulged on scrumptious local eats and dinners we've prepared ourselves in Judith's splendidly equipped kitchen.  We had everything we needed at our disposal and savored the magnificent sunsets, the greens and blues and spring flowers that surrounded us.      
This was far more than just a place to crash; this was a comforting, soulful, beautiful place to call home for a while ‚Äì and someone new to call a friend. 
I look forward to being back there when our lives allow us to venture far and long once more, this time hopefully with our baby girl which we are anticipating to meet this July.
Thank you Judith for everything and be sound,
               Einat & Niv

The long and great talk between us that evening will always in my memory. Judith is so smart and we learned a lot from her. I like sitting in the dining room or standing on the deck watching sunset over the mountains. It's great. Kiri ,the cat , so cute, ""escape artist"",made a funny story when we lived there. The house located by the side of Alki beach and takes about 20minutes drive to downtown Seattle . Worth to try!"

The living room with the astonishingly beautiful view is our favorite. We like the window, Kiri (a cute cat), the plant judith have been working on ... well, we like almost everything. 

Regarding the host: Judith is a very kind lady, who picked up us at the train station and always glad to have a conversation. I wish we could have more time to talk with her, but we have a tight schedule in Seattle. 

I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends, and come back again next time visiting Seattle."

38872	117165	10.0	10.0	36005245	I came to this place really needing a place to relax because I had a really intense training I was coming to the city for. The minute my GPS led me down the road to Judith's house after a 10 hour day of training was just what I needed..The road leading up to Judith's is a treat as you are right down by the water (Puget sound) and it relaxed me even before I got to her house. Her cat Kiki (sp?)is waiting for you when you get to the house as was so adorable! And Judith makes you feel right at home...Thanks for the great place to stay Judith...I will be recommending your place to others and will come back for sure! :)

The room was comfortable and the bed was warm - we slept very well. The bath was clean and lovely. All in all, I've rarely felt so welcome, and if we get the chance to come back to Seattle in the future I would be delighted if we could stay again. 

Seattle is an easy water taxi ride, drive, or Uner/Lyft from the city, if you're worried about the distance. "
38877	117165	10.0	10.0	46013296	Me and my girlfriend stayed with Judith over the labor day weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Judith is a remarkably wise, generous and welcoming host and shared lots of tips/suggestions for our short trip. The house is very well managed and has great collection of books and varied art. It is also easily accessible from I-5 and just 15 min from the airport. Due to our packed schedule we came home late pretty much on all nights but she was very accomodating. We'll definitely try to rebook her place on our next visit to Seattle ! Thanks.

In truth, my review should go under her ""entire-home"" version of this posting, as Judith graciously let us book the whole place. With that, I'd like to mention its worth every penny doing so. The jetted tub and fold-out bed in the loft (best view of the Sound) made for some pretty unforgettable mornings. For my second ever AirBnB stay - this place made up for my less-than-impressive debut stay ten-fold.

If you're staying in Seattle. Book with Judith.  "
38879	117165	10.0	10.0	57703036	We so enjoyed our time at the Judith‚Äôs home, exceptional hospitality and we felt like one of the family. The main house, common area rooms are all beautiful, spacious, clean and comfortable AND THE VIEW! The photos don‚Äôt lie. Tranquil night sleep in the Suite room and good strong coffee in the morning. We are pretty low maintenance so we didn‚Äôt require much of Judith, though she graciously offered.  While it was good to have a place to lay our sleepy heads, the pleasant surprise was the great time getting to know our hostess. Thank you Judith, we‚Äôll be back!
38890	7455068	10.0	10.0	41705902	Francesco was very warm and welcoming.  He checked in with us every day to make sure we were at ease.

38893	7455068	10.0	10.0	45638093	The place was exactly as listed and is in an incredible location in Alki Beach.  It is not difficult to find, and the area is fairly quiet for beinh near bars and restaurants.  There are quite a few nearby, as well as shops and little cafes.  My favorite was Ampersand Cafe between 58th & Marine.  Pay close attention to this listing, there is no WiFi at the location but plenty of the places nearby offer it up for free.  If you're going to cook at this listing, be sure to bring all the essentials you'll need.  They have coffee filters, salt, pepper, dishes, pots & pans.  Parking - no free parking at the location (as listed) but parking is allowed on the street.  They were doing road work while I was there though, so there were restrictions with towing notices.  So, just be careful!  I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone I know and even those I don't :P  The owner was very communicative and quite helpful with my last minute reservation.  Thanks for the great listing Francesco!

The bungalow is in a great location on Alki, less than a block from the beach and restaurants. The house and furnishings were just perfect for our stay (kitchen, living room, 1 bed/1 bath). Definitely recommend this place as your base camp while staying in Seattle.
38895	7455068	10.0	10.0	46401759	Francisco was a great host... Recommend highly!
38896	7455068	10.0	10.0	46646095	"This was a perfect place at a great price!
It is exactly as described. Right off the beach, walking to lots of fun places. Francesco was very easy to get in touch with, although we never met. The apartment has basic amenities, including a coffee pot and some basic cookware. The bed was soft but comfortable.
I would definitely stay again, when heading to West Seattle.
(I recommend having perfect weather too, like we happened to have during our stay!)"
38897	7455068	10.0	10.0	47392545	I absolutely loved staying here! It was just the right size for me! Perfect! Francesco was extremely nice and I really liked that he was around if I needed him, which I didn't but still, I thought it was really nice that he checked up on me. This place is very close to the beach - a short walk and also a short walk to the shops and cafes around the corner as well. Will definitely stay here again when I come back to Seattle. 
38898	7455068	10.0	10.0	48603979	"Although I didn't meet Francesco, It was a pleasure to stay at his place, the place is described and very clean, it was close to a lot of nice places to eat and the beach. 

Francesco checked in to make sure everything is going well. 

To me, the only down sides are not having wifi  or the usual Airbnb personal touch which might be a good thing for some people. 

Overall a very good experience and is very recommended. "
38899	7455068	10.0	10.0	49042072	The host was very helpful and receptive. The neighborhood was peaceful and pleasant, and the accommodations were all to our liking.  Everything we needed was adequately supplied.
38900	7455068	10.0	10.0	50450124	Great experience. The apartment was very clean and less than a block from the beach. There are multiple restaurants and coffee shops also within walking distance. Would highly recommend.
38901	7455068	10.0	10.0	53254464	I rented this condo for a coworker who was staying for an extended work trip. He said that the owner was very nice and shared the wifi password. He was very happy to stay there for 3 weeks.
38902	7455068	10.0	10.0	53901305	"Francesco was a wonderful host. Although we did not meet in person, he was very patient, professional and available when I had trouble booking my stay. He also checked in several times to make sure I had everything I needed. The space was exactly as described and very comfortable and close to the water and restaurants. Note that there is no internet service and street parking wasn't always available directly outside the space, but could be found less than a block away.
I would definitely stay again in the future! Thanks Francesco!"
38903	7455068	10.0	10.0	55317415	Yes, my host was friendly over text. I never checked in for other reasons (the complexities of travel during the holidays), but he was kind throughout the process.
38904	7455068	10.0	10.0	58697946	"This small apartment presents in person as it does in pictures and is less than a block from good places to eat and a great view.  The private entry to the rental is nice.  The kitchen has the basics for a pleasant stay.  It was good to have a separate bedroom with a closet to hang cloths.  I could see coming here for a longer stay easily.

It was a quiet and cozy place and I would be happy to stay there again some time.

40069	6657574	10.0	10.0	41036150	Elizabeth is wonderful, welcoming and very accommodating.  The space and room is perfect, private and comfortable. And, the location is close to tons of fun stuff and minutes to Ballard, but a few minutes away that the location is quite. Highly recommended. 
40070	6657574	10.0	10.0	43123733	Elizabeth was a wonderful welcoming host. Very helpful with any questions I had.   A lovely quiet neighborhood. All round a great place to stay.  
40071	6657574	10.0	10.0	44366291	"I really enjoyed staying at Elizabeth's place! Everything was super comfy and easy. The room is really beautiful and you'll get a lot of space and privacy. Elizabeth was always eager to help me out when I got questions or problems (e.g. forgot to buy some butter & salt) and if you wish to, you can have great and interesting conversations with her. The house, which is located in a lovely neighborhood, is perfectly clean and has a really beautiful view. Grocery Stores and more are within 10-15 Minutes walking distance and you got access to downtown with a cheap busride (2.25) which will take you there in about 45 minutes. Thank you so much,Elizabeth, for everything! The coughing-candies really helped me out! 

Ich habe meinen Aufenthalt bei Elizabeth sehr genossen! Sie ist eine grosszuegige und interessante Person. Alles war so einfach und ""heimelig'. Am ersten Tag, nach einer warmen Begruessung, bot sie mir an, mich zum Lebensmittelladen zu fahren, da ich doch muede sein muss, was, wie ich finde, fuer sich selbst spricht. Der Raum ist grosszuegig eingerichtet und man hat seine Privatsphaere, wenn man will. Man kann sich aber auch gut mir Elizabeth unterhalten oder einen Trip nach Downtown machen, was mit dem Bus ca. 45 Minuten Fahrtweg in Anspruch nimmt. Ihr Haus ist in einer schoenen, amerikanischen Wohnsiedlung und man hat einen wundervollen Ausblick von Ihrem Balkon. Ich kann dieses Angebot nur weiterempfehlen!"
40072	6657574	10.0	10.0	45615542	"The neighborhood was nice and quiet. Nearby food spots were interesting, groceries were accessible. The 5 was just a couple of minutes away. Parking directly in front of the address was easy.

Elizabeth was very eager to make me feel welcome. Fridge space was already available, coffee was offered, and the room was tidy.  She was very accommodating to the sometimes strange entering/leaving hours I held, and was happy to talk about the Pacific Northwest and life near the Puget Sound. Very friendly.

Windows on each side of the room allow for a strong breeze to pass over the bed - great for someone who enjoys it cold like I do. I didn't spend much time at her place during the day (work trip), but the living room was lovely and the deck a great spot to spend cold mornings.

The cat was very friendly too, when she was around!"
40073	6657574	10.0	10.0	46081472	Elizabeth was such a delight! I truly enjoyed being in her presence. He has such a positive energy and loves life. I was touched by her love for people, her interest area in life with her work in healing. The room is very warm and clean. The whole house have a calming energy and amazing sky view from the living room. I wish I could've stayed longer :)
40074	6657574	10.0	10.0	48019464	I had great communication with Elizabeth before my visit and she was very welcoming upon my arrival and we chatted. She offered suggestions of places to visit and was very helpful. She also has a lovely cat, though I didn't see her very often. She also gas a nice deck to sit on and enjoy the outside views. The bed is also comfortable and the water pressure on the shower is fabulous. 
40075	6657574	10.0	10.0	49178940	I enjoyed my stay at Elizabeth's house immensely.  It was in a very quiet neighborhood which allowed me to get plenty of rest between my work shifts.  The room was large and accommodating, the bed was very comfortable, and most importantly the shower/bath had plenty of hit water, and allot of pressure.  I would stay here again if the opportunity presents itself.  Great Value!
40076	6657574	10.0	10.0	49834557	Elizabeth was very quick to contact me with information on the location, and a phone number to contact her with.  The pictures are accurate.  The neighborhood is very nice, quiet, with a park nearby which is used for woodland walks.  There is a parking space off the road right in front of the house.  There are restaurants and a small neighborhood shopping area on Greenwood Avenue which is about a half mile away.  The room was really nice, clean, had flannel sheets, with a thick comforter, and blanket.  This made sleeping really nice.  There was plenty of closet space, and she put out soap and shampoo for me to use on arrival.  Elizabeth is a generous host, and is very sincere in her care for the individual staying with her.  She allowed use of her washing machine, and everything was neat, clean, and tidy.  I would stay with her again when I travel to Seattle.  
41411	3544964	10.0	8.0	16325702	Chris is a wonderful host! From the moment I arrived she made me feel right at home. The location is just a short walk to the Link railway that takes you right into downtown in about 20 to 25 mins, so for me it was perfect. Chris is so chatty and was very considerate to my needs, and I loved wondering around her garden! The room was very comfortable and cheery and was a pleasure to come back to in the evening after a long day of walking around the city. I left here feeling like i was leaving a friend. I would definitely consider staying here again.
41412	3544964	10.0	8.0	16376449	Cris was a fantastic host and honestly, could not have been any more helpful.  She was very welcoming and kind, and was extremely responsive and attentive to all of my questions and needs both before and during my stay.  The room and bed were also very comfortable and I got a great night's sleep.  Highly recommend her and the place and would gladly return!
41413	3544964	10.0	8.0	16759369	Good stay. Hospitable people and a clean house/room. Only negatives were that the bed was a little firm for my liking and that the neighborhood was confusing during the evening. 
41414	3544964	10.0	8.0	17015661	Cris's place was nice! The neighborhood wasn't amazing but it wasn't that bad either. It was a pretty short walk to the light rail and bus. Her dog was also really sweet!
41415	3544964	10.0	8.0	17320816	It was great to stay at Cris house. The location of the house is just 10 minuets walking to the Light Rail. The room was clean and neat. Cris is a great host and helped me to know the restaurants nearby and how to go to downtown. Thanks Cris!
41416	3544964	10.0	8.0	18901026	"I put my family members up (a couple in their 50s) up with Cris and her husband, and right of the bat, they all had a great connection. Drinks and food in the kitchen came complimentary with the room and the guests could enjoy a guest bathroom.

They still keep talking about the way in which staying with Cris made their trip so much better. Thank you for that!


For people looking to book: right between Othello and Columbia City light rail stations. # 8 bus runs right by.  It is not in the heart of the city, but conveniently located and easy to reach by public transportation.

Clear recommendation if being very close to downtown is not a high priority for you.

"
41417	3544964	10.0	8.0	20210879	"Cris is a great host who is doing a very professional job. The house is clean, organized and amenities have easy access. Cris and husband share the common areas with guests, but it's fine since they are friendly. I'd recommend this place for a short or extended stay.
"
41418	3544964	10.0	8.0	21013523	"Cris and her husband were warm and friendly hosts. The room was as described and the minor issue with the TV channels were fixed before I returned from work by Dan (the manager) the next day. 

I'm glad I had a car, as the hill to get to the buses and/or light rail would have been a challenge. Cris watched a Seahawks game with me on the big TV in the living room, and though she didn't know a lot about the game, her enthusiasm for the Hawks to win was adorable. 

I was not aware that there are dogs living in the house (one belonging to the host and another with a guest), and would have liked to have known that prior to booking. 

Overall, it was a welcome respite during this time of transition in my life, and I hope to see Cris and her husband again in the future to thank them for their hospitality and kindness. "
41419	3544964	10.0	8.0	34261960	"Cris was great at responding to my late request to stay. The room was quiet, clean and comfortable and Cris was a terrific host. I was even given a lift from the light rail stop nearby so my rather tired, jet lagged body didn't have to cope with the walk. 
My main reason for the trip to Seattle was to visit the Boeing museum and while this was a great spot to stay for that purpose, the convenience of the light rail made getting into downtown really simple too. I would be happy to stay again if I return to Seattle."
41420	3544964	10.0	8.0	34812563	Cris was the ideal hostess. Room was perfect. In fact the entire home and yard were fabulous. Super clean. Quiet. Her little dog fell in love with me cause I gave her popcorn. She was so generous. Coffee YUM! Parking was good. Neighborhood was safe. I would definitely stay here again. Their air conditioning was not good so if it is going to be hot in Seattle rethink your stay.
41421	3544964	10.0	8.0	36902290	"I had a great experience staying here! I stayed for about a week and half when I first moved to Seattle for a new job. I was pretty blown out from the move and new job and it was wonderful to have such a welcoming and quiet home to come back to! Cris is extremely kind and a very welcoming host. They really have set up their home to make their guests feel as comfortable as possible, even if that just means giving them space. Cris gave me a tour right away and worked to make sure I felt at home. I would definitely stay here again!

        HIGHLIGHTS:
‚Ä¢ The shared bathroom was very clean and right next to the room.
‚Ä¢ They have coffee, croissants, and fruit available for you every day!
‚Ä¢ She gave me fridge space and I was able to cook when I needed to.
‚Ä¢ I was able to do laundry and the washer and dryer are new.
‚Ä¢ You get your own room key and the house code when you arrive.
‚Ä¢ There is filtered water in the kitchen.
‚Ä¢ The bed was comfortable and the room was clean and exactly as shown (but with new comforter and sheets).
‚Ä¢ There was always plenty of parking and easy Light Rail access.
‚Ä¢ I was in Seattle during a heat wave and there is no AC in the house, but there was already a fan in the room and Cris brought me an extra one and checked in just to make sure I was comfortable!
‚Ä¢ Cris has a little dog who is very sweet and quite smart. She might bark a bit when you first arrive but not in an excessive way and is very well behaved. I loved having her around!
‚Ä¢ I think smoking is allowed on the porch and outside. So you might smell it a touch but I have asthma (and am quite sensitive) and it never bothered me once. Cris and guests are very considerate."
41422	3544964	10.0	8.0	37244550	Staying with Cris and her husband was very nice, they were very welcoming and the room was nice. They also gave us nice advice on what to do in Seattle. The room doesn't have any aircondition though, so it was a bit hot. Buy a very nice stay and I would definetely recommend staying there!
41423	3544964	10.0	8.0	37515613	"The room was great!  The room was very pleasant and the entire house (room, kitchen, bathroom, etc) was clean and neat.  Cris is extremely welcoming, helpful and has a very wonderful energy about her.  The train is an easy ten minute walk away, which takes you directly downtown.  Good location.
I was a really warm weekend to visit (mid 90s), however there were two fans provided and kept us quite cool through the night.
Would recommend staying with Cris!!

41424	3544964	10.0	8.0	38309278	"Thank you Cris for providing us with a great room for our trip.  Your hospitality and warm personality made us feel welcome; and we enjoyed your dog too! Bed very comfortable, space immaculately clean, quiet at night. It was perfect for us!
"
41425	3544964	10.0	8.0	42544881	"The room was fine, it's called sunset because the sun hits the window at sunset :D 

Cris is a great host, there are some included extras (like free coffee) that should be an example to other Airbnb's; also Cris is well organized and she will assign you an allocated space in the bathroom for your personal things and in the fridge or freezer.

I loved her dog Jening, it's lovely and well trained. 

Location is 10 minutes walking to the link station and 5 min to bus 36. If you are going to downtown at morning, its worth those extra 5 to catch the link and avoid traffic. Safeway is next to the station as well.

Nice place, nice host, just exactly what I expected :D"
41426	3544964	10.0	8.0	42763381	Cris is a warm-hearted and charming lady. Her house is tidy and cozy, and her dog jennie is so cute! Apart from her house, the neighborhood is also quite, safe and clean. I thank her for holding us and truely mading us feel like home.  
41427	3544964	10.0	8.0	42914669	"Chris and her husband, Raul, were awesome hosts! They were friendly and made us feel at home. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable; exactly like the photos. 
The location was a short walk to the train, which made it easy to get around. Great experience!! "
41428	3544964	10.0	8.0	43136618	We had a great experience here and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Seattle area. The room and house were very welcoming and clean. 
41429	3544964	10.0	8.0	43710602	This place has been the most successful place ever since I started airbnb. Cris and her husband were so nice and friendly, and the room was perfect with tourist books and a map of neighborhood including markets and restaurants. They kindly answered whatever questions we asked. The room, kitchen, and bathroom were so clean, and well organized. I highly recommend this place. 
41430	3544964	10.0	8.0	44342685	Thanks for the great place to stay Cris! Everything was as described and the location is excellent. The walk to the train terminal was sub 10 minutes for me and it was easy to find, a short and easy 2 minute drive off of I-5. Cris is an excellent host and had a great little sheet with some helpful details about your stay, and some of the restaurants within walking distance. The bed was a little firm for my taste but some people might prefer that. Thanks again for the accomodations and hospitality. 
41431	3544964	10.0	8.0	44791070	I'm a traveller and have been to so many places around the (website hidden) one week stay in Cris and Raul's house is one of the best. Their house is super neat and cozy. Every small details can tell the host takes good care of their house and truly love their home.Plus, their lovely dog Jenning always kept me company. As host, Cris and Raul are very kind and considerate. We did have a good time sitting together and sharing our happy memories. So,the stay makes me feel like living at home with caring families, not just simple B&B.Thumbs up!Highly recommended.
41432	3544964	10.0	8.0	48546318	Cris and her husband made me feel very welcome. They are extremely accommodating. My room and bathroom were very clean when I arrived. I went in and out of the house freely, and parking was not an issue. There were always yummy pastries and coffee in the kitchen that were free to all guests. Cris and her husband were kind enough to cook for me when I was home, so I felt like I was staying with family. They were also very accommodating to guests that were visiting.  There are a lot of local eateries in the neighborhood that made getting food very convenient. The drive to seattle is less than 15 minutes. I would definitely recommend staying here if you plan on spending some time in seattle.
41433	3544964	10.0	8.0	49408528	Cris was great, had great conversations with her. She was flexible and helped with me checking in late. The house was in a prime location close to the freeway and public transport. The room was very comfortable and clean. Cris was a great host with a great room. 
41434	3544964	10.0	8.0	50260176	Cris was accommodating of my late arrival and early departure.  The home is nice and a great location for my early morning client.  I'd love to stay there whenever I visit.  Cris was gracious and welcoming.
41435	3544964	10.0	8.0	51993142	Very comfortable and pleasant stay. Cris is very friendly and caring. i enjoyed my stay . Thanks for hosting me.

Host is really kindly!
She is really nice!
A room is clearn.
"
41437	3544964	10.0	8.0	56817708	The room and house were a great value and everything was accurate. Bathroom was clean and all details were covered regarding entry, wifi, etc. I was only there for just enough time to sleep, but they also offer a few basic food items for breakfast/coffee which was nice. I would recommend them for a stay.
41438	3544964	10.0	8.0	57189294	We felt very much at home! The hosts were very friendly and helpful :)
41439	7763298	10.0	9.0	42482073	Jennifer was very welcoming and responsive. I arrived a bit late and was kindly greeted by her. She was kind enough to let me check out later than the scheduled checkout time. The room was very spacious and clean with a balcony. There are two nearby rooms with guests coming in and out occasionally but overall it is quiet. Would recommend to others.
41440	7763298	10.0	9.0	42968714	Jennifer met us at the door when we arrived, was very friendly, gave us the keys and showed us to our room.  The room was amazing for the price: very spacious, comfortable beds, nice little balcony, large bathroom.  Everything was very clean and there was bottled water left for us.  Apparently, we could have used the kitchen if we wanted, but we really were only there to sleep.  I think we would have had to walk through the family's living area in order to use the kitchen, which may have been a little awkward.  Unlike a hotel, there is a no shoe and no food rule while staying there.  This makes it a little inconvenient, but I'm sure it helps with wear and tear.  There is also no TV, so bring your own entertainment if that matters to you.  The street is very narrow and parking was a little tricky our second night because the car parked in front of us didn't leave a lot of room, so we ended up having to park in front of the gate, which didn't leave a lot of room between the car and the gate.  The house is in a convenient location, just off of I-5 and only about 7 miles from downtown Seattle.  Overall, this is a great place to stay, especially for the price.  I would definitely stay here again:)
41441	7763298	10.0	9.0	45352415	Very straight forward, the room we stayed in has all general amenities such as shampoo and toothpaste and if u forgot they supply towel, also clean and tidy.  If u need to stay in a private room with convenient access this place is a pretty good one.
41442	7763298	10.0	9.0	45632555	It was nice and easy to stay there...using the washing machine n check-in at any time helped us a lot
41443	7763298	10.0	9.0	45860902	Fantastic place to stay! Jennifer always replied immediately and was very welcoming. The place was exactly as described. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone staying in the Seattle area!
41444	7763298	10.0	9.0	46795895	"Everything and everyone seemed very open and welcoming.  The room was very cozy and a ton of space for any luggage and moving around.  I enjoyed my stay for sure.
Only about 5-10 from inner Seattle. Then, being out of Seattle little more, it was easier to drive around in a new area along with getting out to attractions outside of the city.
The only downside was needing to do street parking a few days, just because of the amount of people staying at the time.  The street parking is a bit precarious; a bigger car would have made it difficult to street park near the apt."
41445	7763298	10.0	9.0	47084203	"We (two couples) enjoyed our two-night stay very much! The room is VERY spacious with a lot of natural lighting and a lovely balcony with a table and two chairs. We never actually met Jennifer but we did met her daughter, 9-year-old Cindy, who was just a wonderful little host! She showed us around the whole house, told us the house rules (VERY reasonable: no shoes inside the house, no eating in the bedroom but you can use the kitchen/dining room, and quiet time after 10:30 pm), and handed us the key... she was so adorable! Don't be alarmed, she was under the care of a lady but she mainly stayed in the kitchen and didn't speak much English so Cindy ran the show :) 

Jennifer had left water bottles and indoor sandals for us in the room. I texted her to see if she had an iron and it appeared at our doorstep when we got home later that day (along with an ironing board). The bathroom was equipped with a hair dryer, shampoo, body wash, toothpaste, four towels, and four glasses. There's a HUGE walk-in closet and another smaller closet in the bathroom as well. I also texted Jennifer the day of our check-out to see if we could leave our luggage there so we wouldn't have to haul it around town with us and she was very accommodating and allowed us to leave it in her living room until later that day. 

LOCATION: we found it to be very convenient, right off the i-5 and a short 15-20 min drive from downtown attractions (depending on the time and where you're going). Not having to worry about crossing downtown on our way back to the airport when we left was a plus too since this is on the Southern side of Seattle. The streets don't have sidewalks and are narrow so you sort of have to park your car either close to the bushes across the street or on top of where the side-walk would be right in front of their gate. No parking in the driveway is allowed. It honestly wasn't bad at all though. "
41446	7763298	10.0	9.0	48748447	"
Thanks for having us. It is good."
41447	7763298	10.0	9.0	49246318	Jennifer's place was very nice, clean and spacious. Han and I felt welcomed and very comfortable there. It was close to the bus line and access to the kitchen and laundry were convenient. Thank you!!
41448	7763298	10.0	9.0	50666080	We got to meet with Jennifer's cute daughter. The room is really clean and has a nice view. I love it. I go Seattle pretty often. Will definitely stay here again. 
41449	7763298	10.0	9.0	52230116	The house and neighborhood were exactly as described! We were greeted by a young girl while trying to open the key box. Other than that we didn't have a lot of in person meetings with anyone from the house. The room was clean and home-like. The room was also very spacious and comfortable for 4 people, or even more to stay in. The bathroom was also clean and very nice with two sinks, perfect for our group. There was also a spacious closet and balcony!
41450	7763298	10.0	9.0	52945587	I would definitely recommend this place for a small group of individuals looking to visit that area of Seattle. Jennifer is very responsive once you make your booking. The private room was just as nice as some hotels. A well decorated, spacious, colorful room with all the items you need to relax.
41451	7763298	10.0	9.0	54191072	This was an awesome place to stay! Very friendly people and a very welcoming atmosphere!
41452	7763298	10.0	9.0	54289274	It was an amazing huge space...surprising given that it looks like a small house from the outside!  We loved our stay.  Clean, comfortable, and quiet.
41453	7763298	10.0	9.0	55935473	Very spacey and clean room !! I will definitely recommend friends and family to this house if they are visiting Seattle
41454	7763298	10.0	9.0	56320343	Jennifer's place is very clean and cozy, we had a good time staying there. Jennifer is very thoughtful even tho we never had the chance to meet her. There were bottle waters  in the room for the guest, blow dryer in the bathroom drawer (which is very awesome!!) Thank you Jennifer!  
41455	7763298	10.0	9.0	57371308	The host is very helpful with our questions and requests. The place is big and clean and it is only 15 minutes away to downtown. I will definitely go back if I visit Seattle again in the future. 
41456	7763298	10.0	9.0	58007223	My stay was very pleasing and enjoyable due to the spacious room. The pictures that are presented are an accurate depiction of the room. The host was accommodating as well because he provided toiletries when the supply was low. Overall, I was pleased with my experience!
44225	3986788	10.0	10.0	38973822	Pauline was an exceptional host, and knows how to provide the perfect experience. She has a great attention to detail, which is evident from the moment you arrive. She provides a key box outside the unit, which allowed for us to enter and get settled without having to worry about waking anyone up. There were instructions laid out clearly on the counter as well as an extra key to use during the stay. The place was CLEAN! The bed was so comfortable and the sheets were very nice. I loved the Robes available in the bathrooms even though we didnt use them. Very nice touch. The Kitchen had everything we needed, although I didn't end up cooking, I could see this being a really nice option for longer stays. We went to Endolyne Joe's for dinner, and I would totally recommend- its literally a few blocks away. There was a cute patio set up outside as well for our morning coffee. I really enjoyed all the lovely flowers and garden. Perfect location, couldnt have asked for a better spot. Pauline and Beau were also wonderful. She communicated right away and send me special directions to her place. I felt welcome and at home from the moment I arrived. Her Fauntleroy Cove is a West Seattle gem!! 
44226	3986788	10.0	10.0	41898703	Cute and well cared for little place, great location for being out of inner city but close enough to enjoy downtown. Parking is off street but very tight for an SUV. Make sure and use google maps street view to familiarize yourself with the road and drive way to the house if you arrive in the dark. Highly recommend for a short stay. We did discover that fighting raccoons came out one night,.. You don't get that experience in the inner city 
44227	3986788	10.0	10.0	42324895	Beautiful place, close to marina and Fauntleroy ferry. Pauline was very friendly and accommodating. 
44228	3986788	10.0	10.0	43656162	Clean, spacious, and very convenient location. Directions made it easy to find and access. Apartment is in a quite location and within walking distance to Lincoln Park. A nice feature for those with children or others wanting to take a long beach walk.
44229	3986788	10.0	10.0	54050564	Pauline was very warm and welcoming. The home was spotless as I walked in. She was very understanding with the changes I had to make. Thank you for a friendly experience.
44230	3986788	10.0	10.0	56379494	"My wife and I stayed during winter for a week and a half, and found the entire process effortless and supremely comfortable.  We drove a very large Ford Expedition and had no trouble whatsoever parking in our own off-street space.  We arrived late at night, and really appreciated the exterior lighting and the toasty warm apartment.

The furnishings, towels and linens are extremely high quality, the shower gets very hot quickly and has great water pressure, and the gas stove, quality knives and cookware were a pleasure to use.  The clothes washer and dryer have a large capacity, and both complete a load on regular cotton settings in under an hour.  The neighborhood is high class, very safe, and very quiet.  We slept quite well in the comfortable bed, thanks especially to a selection of very nice pillows.  The wifi internet reaches all corners of the apartment, at speeds of at least 30Mbps.

The attention to detail is excellent.  For example, much of the floor is an attractive tile, and comfy disposable slippers were provided so we did not need to wear socks (or shoes) to keep our feet warm.  Pauline and this apartment are an unbeatable combination, and we would love to stay here again!
"
47909	7902330	10.0	9.0	44247721	My Mom and I were super happy we chose to stay at this location! Dario was excellent at communicating. Upon arriving, we were given a brief tour of the space, and then shown our room- which was extremely clean, and up-to-date. There was an abundance of fresh towels at all times, and the bathroom was also kept extremely clean. We felt very welcomed and enjoyed our short time here- would definitely recommend!
47910	7902330	10.0	9.0	44380852	Nice clean room in a nice clean house. Everything well organized and comfortable. Handled my early arrival gracefully. For a simple place to stay, I'd recommend it.
47911	7902330	10.0	9.0	44604734	Comfortable bed in a nice room and friendly people. 
47912	7902330	10.0	9.0	45454675	Dario and Amanda were awesome and their place is the perfect stop if you need a comfy bed and a great breakfast. It was so clean and perfect. Would stay there again
47913	7902330	10.0	9.0	46078050	It's a great place to be. They are really nice and welcoming. It's a great nice and clean room.
47914	7902330	10.0	9.0	47131199	"I used the instant book option. Everything was straightforward. I arrived pretty late in the night, around 11:30 PM and Amanda (Dario's in house host), sent me the details for the code to enter. Room and the shared bathroom was clean as shown in the pictures. 

The only slight inconvenience was that the house was marked ""9311"", as opposed to the actual ""9317"". I had to call Dario to confirm that's the correct house"
47915	7902330	10.0	9.0	49292702	This was my first AirBnB experience and I had a great stay at Dario's! Amanda was very friendly and helpful. The house was very clean and tidy. Breakfast was a great addition! 
47916	7902330	10.0	9.0	49755145	Really nice house 
47917	7902330	10.0	9.0	49869395	Enjoyed my stay! The upgrades Dario has made are perfect. Especially the newly renovated bathroom !
47918	7902330	10.0	9.0	50236439	A stay at Dario's place is more like staying in a small private hotel more than a persons home. Which I like. There are several Airbnb rooms so the house is setup for guests with common areas and kitchen access. Bathroom is shared by several people, but there was never a problem with wait time. I will be returning.
47919	7902330	10.0	9.0	50402636	"Very nice and clean house and a very cosy bedroom. Everything well described, lots of space in the shared areas. 
I would defenitely recommend it to anyone. 

"
47920	7902330	10.0	9.0	50587916	Great easy convenient place near the airport  
47921	7902330	10.0	9.0	50995155	House was very clean, room was comfortable, other house guests were friendly. Met the host of the house and she was very nice. In a convenient location to the airport and near the Kubota Garden! Would stay again.
47922	7902330	10.0	9.0	51257853	"Great room with plenty of comfort for a great price! Enjoyed my short overnight here before work; the only concern I had was the lack of towels when I had to shower. 

Overall it was a fantastic experience and I would stay with Dario again! Great and helpful host. "
47923	7902330	10.0	9.0	51481510	The house/room is just as pictured- organized. Owner is very generous with kitchen and bathroom necessities. However, bedroom floors were dirty... Dusty and lots of hair.. and bathroom would've been better if it were cleaner. The iffiest part was we weren't sure if our sheets were washed prior to our arrival as there were strands of hair underneath the duvet and pillow shams and the bed sheet was wrinkled as if someone had just slept on it. Was going to reach out to the owner/host, but we didn't really see them and we were only there for 2 nights. Not the nicest area of Seattle, as we were also told by local lyft and uber drivers, but very close to airport and downtown. 
47924	7902330	10.0	9.0	51589931	Great place. Dario helped with restaurants etc in the area. 
47925	7902330	10.0	9.0	52290527	Amanda was absolutely delightful (Dario's roommate). The house was quite well kept and everything (kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms) was helpfully labeled. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows (nice and full, not flat). Amanda was full of great ideas about where to check out and eat. The neighborhood was quiet and easily accessible to the 5, a grocery store, and gas station. We would definitely stay here again!
47926	7902330	10.0	9.0	52386960	I didn't meet Dario but the communication was good!  The place is cozy, clean and private.  I'd recommend it to others.  
47927	7902330	10.0	9.0	52642890	"The entire experience was amazing!!  Actually better in person then posted.  The pictures do not do justice for this house.
Available breakfast, coffee, OJ, WiFi.
The backyard is really peaceful,  relaxing and soothing.
I enjoyed my time so much that I extended my say and booked a different room in the house."
47928	7902330	10.0	9.0	53302558	This was my first B&B experience and I must say it went pleasantly well. You can be as outgoing or to yourself as you'd like. The one bathroom for he house wasn't an issue as I made sure to wake up early and do my morning routine. Amanda was very hospitable and everyone in the house was really nice, this is B&B done right! Thanks
47929	7902330	10.0	9.0	53522756	the sophie room was great! clean and comfy! My friend and I really enjoyed our stay! I highly recomend this room to all travelers.
47930	7902330	10.0	9.0	53997091	The room is really nice, and the house is clean and tidy. Breakfast makes me feel like at home, and people there are always friendly. Grocery Store is just 5 minutes walk and the bus stop is nearby. I really enjoy the experience in Dario's house. Thanks! 
47931	7902330	10.0	9.0	56683557	I arrived on short notice but everything was organized and very welcoming. Dario was busy that evening but the person who helped me arrange my arrival was great. The room was exactly as described and clean and ready for me. The house had all the breakfast items, the shower was hot, I couldn't have asked for a better stay. I met Dario later in my stay and he is kind and helpful and seemed genuinely concerned about my stay. The neighborhood is quiet as is the house. A big grocery store is several blocks away and the kitchen had all the essentials for preparing my own food. Even the guests in the house were friendly and we had great conversations a few evenings. There is a bus stop two blocks away if that is how you travel. Lake Washington is one block away and beautiful even in this time of year. Being able to do laundry in the house is a big plus. A great place to stay in Seattle if you don't have be downtown in the middle of everything. I really enjoyed the peaceful area where the house is located. Any of the rooms in this house would be recommended. 
48635	215882	10.0	9.0	694346	Julie's place couldn't have been more ideal for me. I felt zen. Totally comfortable. Enjoyed a dip in her hot tub under the moon and had lovely walks around her neighborhood. Julie is an absolutely delightful soul. I think half of the books in her cottage are titles I already own. I loved browsing her collection of spiritual and poetic texts. The fireplace and complimentary tea were the icing on the cake - doesn't get more cozy than that! 
48636	215882	10.0	9.0	722198	My wife and I had a fabulous stay at the Garden Cottage.  We really enjoyed walking near Lake Washington and eating in Columbia City.  We can't wait to book another trip and stay with Julie.
48637	215882	10.0	9.0	736146	Julie's cottage is a beautiful, balanced space of open light and close comfort. Wonderful for a respite yet easy to re-route into downtown mode - a straight shot into the city. Thank you the warm welcome in the cold, late night, Julie! Look forward to a return some day. 
48638	215882	10.0	9.0	771827	The private garden cottage is a lovely place in a great Seattle neighborhood, near Seward Park, Lake Washington and the delights of Columbia City.  The cottage is clean, quiet, and the hot tub was a special treat after long work days.  Julie was a wonderful host and check-in and check-out simple.  I would recommend her place and hope to stay there again.
48639	215882	10.0	9.0	925921	Julie was fantastic. The cottage was so warm and welcoming. It was super clean, and even cozier than the photos. The fireplace was more than sufficient to heat the place and although the hot tub looked extremely inviting, I didn't get a chance to indulge - maybe next time! I will definitely stay here again.
48640	215882	10.0	9.0	972375	Julie's Private Garden Cottage is beautifully designed and appointed. Though a small space, it has a cheerful, uncluttered feel. If we had visited during warmer weather, we would have taken advantage of the patio space in Julie's lovely garden, and might even have used the hot tub which she generously offered us the use of. Julie is a thoughtful hostess. She quickly provided us with a few small items that added greatly to our comfort. We enthusiastically recommend her garden cottage to anyone looking for an attractive, tranquil place to stay in south Seattle.
48641	215882	10.0	9.0	1005392	Julie's cottage worked out great for me.  It is very light, airy, quiet and peaceful, with beautiful and simple decor.  The outdoor hot tub, set in a zen garden, was very inviting but I didn't have time to use it due to a busy week with family.  Julie provided a floor mat for an extra guest I had two nights and I understand it was comfortable.  The pilot light of the gas heater went out due to a power shortage one night but Julie came promptly to restart it.  I was there during a cold snap but the cottage held heat well and there was a back-up electric heater in addition to the gas heater so no problem.  This location is convenient to public transit.  All in all a fine experience.
48642	215882	10.0	9.0	1067198	Even though it rained pretty much the entire 4 days, the property is very beautiful & peaceful.  Julie was very kind, thoughtful and helpful.  We had a wonderful stay here.  Considering I had to remain in the room for a last 48 hours of our stay (after my surgery) this was the ideal place to be stuck in!
48643	215882	10.0	9.0	1127445	Lovely airy and bright studio with a very comfortable bed and lovely heater that took the morning chill right out of the air.  the hot tub was very clean and comfortable.  Julie was the perfect host with many recommendations of places to visit and eat. We will definitely be back!
48644	215882	10.0	9.0	1150055	"Julie was a very gracious host, and her cottage is just as appears in the photos.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the room, the bed, the kitchen area, and the atmosphere.  The only downside was the internet, which although fast in the seating area outside, became significantly slower inside the cottage.  It was certainly sufficient for email and web browsing, but Skype is difficult to use inside.  

Overall, I would recommend Julie's place to anyone looking to experience Seattle and have a nice relaxing time!"
48645	215882	10.0	9.0	1217190	Great location! Great host! Great Stay! Charming cottage with easy access to both the SEA airport and downtown seattle.
48646	215882	10.0	9.0	1242415	"Our stay here was perfect! The cottage is just as lovely as pictured, and has a light & bright feel to it. We loved using the cozy fireplace and relaxing in the hot tub. The icing on the cake was the amazingly beautiful garden...so impressive! Julie was extra sweet as a hostess, and her kitty Ursula was friendly and absolutely adorable. We would love to return if we're ever back in Seattle.  

"
48647	215882	10.0	9.0	1373455	Julie's cottage is beautiful, in a great location near the Columbia City shops and convenient to the light rail to go downtown. We had a really lovely stay and Julie was a wonderful and accommodating host.
48648	215882	10.0	9.0	1390892	Julie was a gracious host, very helpful. The cottage was very beautiful, but the location was less than desirable. I went out for a walk one night to enjoy the nice weather and was warned by the police that it was a very bad neighborhood and I shouldn't be walking around...that I was in the middle of gangland.  
48649	215882	10.0	9.0	1454786	Great stay with Julie and we will return often.
48650	215882	10.0	9.0	1481247	We stayed for three nights while visiting Seattle. The location was great- easy access to downtown, highways and the airport. The property was thoughtfully designed and landscaped nicely. Free parking was available right in front of the property. The other homes on the street were well maintained.     
48651	215882	10.0	9.0	1524865	Nice, clean, and serene.  Enjoyed our stay.
48652	215882	10.0	9.0	1557060	Very nice place and within a few minutes drive of the downtown area.  Came to town to watch my fianc√© do the Rock and Roll marathon.  He loved having the hot tub to come back to!  We loved the cat - who seemed to be waiting in front of the door every time we opened it, waiting for a head scratch! Overall, a very good first time experience with airbnb
48653	215882	10.0	9.0	1614174	Julie was very nice and gave us lots suggestions for restaurants and things to do in the area, which was very helpful. The cottage was adorable, but sadly we did not have time to use the hot tub! :( But we still had a great stay! 
48654	215882	10.0	9.0	1675818	"This is a very clean and welcoming space in a quieter part of the city. The hostess is very friendly and willing to help as needed.
Rating: Both thumbs up!"
48655	215882	10.0	9.0	1699847	We stayed here for 3 nights. It was a very sunny and relaxing place.  The bed was comfortable.  It was very clean and fresh smelling.  The gardens were beautiful, and the hottub was a treat.  The host was friendly and offered directions to local places to dine and things to do.  Overall, it was a great experience, and I would not have traded it for a hotel.
48656	215882	10.0	9.0	1824105	Great and very clean cottage in Columbia City (short walk from Rainier which has lots of nice restaurants/cafes) with a friendly host, which gave us very good tips for activities and restaurants for our short stay.
48657	215882	10.0	9.0	1889737	My husband and I ended our honeymoon trip to the PNW with 2 nights at Julie's Zen Garden Cottage. We were greeted by Julie, who gave us directions for local transportation and restaurant recommendations in the Columbia City neighborhood. We loved the tranquil space of the cottage, which was clean, calm, and comfortable. The hot tub was an excellent way to relax after walking the hills of Seattle. We were so pleased with every aspect of our stay and Julie's affable and helpful communication throughout the process. We would love to visit again!
48658	215882	10.0	9.0	2110500	Julie's cottage is clean, cozy and private with lots of sunlight and a friendly cat for company. We loved waking up early, turning on the radio, grinding our own coffee and taking a dip in the hot tub each morning before exploring the town. I'd love to stay in this place again sometime in the future!
48659	215882	10.0	9.0	2193699	Excellent cottage. Location is great as well; close to nice restaurants, Seward Park and also both the airport and downtown Seattle.  Julie kindly accommodated a couple of my last minute requests, and she makes sure that you feel at home at this nice property.  I highly recommend Julie's cottage to anyone visiting the area.
48660	215882	10.0	9.0	2253317	Had a great time! Such a lovely place and Julie was very friendly and informative of community events, etc. 
48661	215882	10.0	9.0	2276315	"My boyfriend and I chose garden cottage while traveling Seattle. we LOVE and enjoy it!  it is a lovely and quiet place for (email hidden)nvenient location to go to downtown Seattle and Seattle int' airport. Julie is so nice giving us suggestion for restaurants and places. She knows Seattle really well. OH! and the lovely cat Ursula. both of us miss her so much after we left. 3
I highly recommend garden cottage! "
48662	215882	10.0	9.0	2321956	It was nice‚Äîexactly as described.
48663	215882	10.0	9.0	2430710	Julie was very pleasant and her cottage was really cute and comfortable. If I could give her an extra star for the jacuzzi, I would =) It was so nice to relax in the jacuzzi after a long day out in the city.
48664	215882	10.0	9.0	2497427	We have only one 'complaint' about our stay and that is having arrived, it was hard to leave! All to say, the place is lovely, the setting restful, the moon cooperating 'fully' with our hot tub experience and Julie was truly a lovely and responsive host. This is the place you want . . . 
48665	215882	10.0	9.0	2721444	Julie's garden cottage is a lovely tranquil spot - small but comfortable and cozy.  
48666	215882	10.0	9.0	2809184	We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary with a Seattle weekend get-away and Julie's Garden Cottage was perfect!  It was such a wonderful change from the typical motel experience.  It was private, quiet, and beautifully restful.  We hope to return sometime.
48667	215882	10.0	9.0	2937506	The cottage was as described. Just the feeling of never have left home. I would come back & experience it all over again.
48668	215882	10.0	9.0	2982653	"My partner and I had a great experience at Julie's garden cottage.

The hot tub was the perfect way to warm up after spending the day exploring Seattle in chilly November. A tiny gas stove was enough to keep the cottage warm and cozy. The bed was comfortable, and the light and airy space was a joy to come home to. 

Julie was particularly helpful in giving structure to our spontaneous (aka unorganized) trip. She recommended a great diner a few blocks away, and even wrote up an itinerary for the rest of our trip to Point Roberts and Vancouver. 

The last day, Ursula the cat made a cameo appearance. She and Julie made us feel right at home.

I'd be back to the Garden Cottage to experience Seattle in the Spring or Summer!"
48669	215882	10.0	9.0	3028200	We were very comfortable in Julie's guest cottage. The weather was mostly blustery west coast winter rain but the gas fireplace kept the cottage cozy and the hot tub was great after a run along Lake Washington. Julie was a welcoming host and  gave us a list of local places to eat and activities in Seattle. We enjoyed exploring Columbia City. We would like to return to Julie's cottage in warmer weather so we could enjoy her beautiful garden, morning coffee on the cottage porch looks like it would be heaven. 
48670	215882	10.0	9.0	3477255	"We had a great time at Julie's. I loved the proximity to Columbia City as it's one of my favorite Seattle spots and close to good friends. Staying with Julie allowed us the autonomy to do our own thing but visit who and what we wanted without all the small talk. I enjoyed the hot tub! 

"
48671	215882	10.0	9.0	4216973	My Granddaugher and I loved our stay at Julie's Garden Cottage.  It was homey and bright and provided for our every need.  Having such a quiet retreat after our busy days in bustling Seattle was just what was needed to make the visit perfect.
48672	215882	10.0	9.0	4341597	My husband and I enjoyed our comfortable stay at Julie's garden cottage while visiting our son and daughter-in-law in Columbia City. The cottage is in a great, wonderfully diverse neighborhood, and is lovely, inside and out. Every object in the cottage reflects Julie's discerning aesthetic and desire to create an enjoyable experience‚Äîfrom the twinkle lights to the bamboo flooring to the prints on the wall. And the garden is delightful‚ÄîI enjoyed sitting on the deck in the mornings, smelling the lilacs. Julie is thoughtful and interesting. I enjoyed talking with her about her work and gardening.
48673	215882	10.0	9.0	4484296	The cottage is great, and Julie is very accommodating. Would recommend over a hotel. The only slightly inconvenient thing is the location, but Seattle's public transportation is reasonable that this isn't really an issue if you have some patience (this place is close to the light rail).
48674	215882	10.0	9.0	4604882	Julie's place is very relaxing and she is a great host. The hot tub is great after a day exploring Seattle - it was the perfect retreat for a quick weekend away.
48675	215882	10.0	9.0	4692311	When my husband and I pulled up we were a little concerned we might not get the privacy we are accustomed too.  We were pleasantly surprised that even though the cottage was in Julie's backyard we completely felt we were alone.  The cottage is so charming and the hot tub was an excellent addition.  We would definitely recommend Julie and even stay again if we are in the area. 
48676	215882	10.0	9.0	4972075	"What a GREAT cottage! The garden was very relaxing and it was just far enough away from Downtown Seattle. It felt like we could really get away from the crowded streets.  The bed was comfy and the ceiling fan really helped, it was pretty warm for early June.

Next time we might even get into the hot tub :( 

The trip was for my wife's birthday and she loved it!"
48677	215882	10.0	9.0	5025932	We enjoyed staying in Julie's cottage. It was very clean and simple. Easy to feel comfortable and relaxed in. It was very quiet at night. Great area, close to Seward Park. 
48678	215882	10.0	9.0	5346984	"Julie's cottage is really nice and I had a relaxing time, chilling out in the sun and hot-tub!

She's very attentive to any questions you might have."
48679	215882	10.0	9.0	5387926	"This place is lovely!! The cozy studio has many windows including skylights, smells great and had great energy. We had just come from staying in a place 4x the size, but loved this one so much more. Not to mention you have access to a hot tub! Julie was great and so helpful. 

It is somewhat of a distance from city center, so you need to be ok with that. The result though, is that you get to escape the city intensity and stay in a space that doubles as a yoga studio."
48680	215882	10.0	9.0	5509550	My mother and I stayed in the garden cottage for five days while i was in town looking for apartments. It was so nice to come back every evening to a homey place! The cottage gets a lot of light and the garden area is beautiful. Julie made sure we were comfortable the whole time, giving us tips on places to check-out and even putting in an air conditioner when we got very un-Seattle temperatures of 90 degrees. The cottage is in a great location, as it is an easy walk up to the main restaurants in Columbia City and to the light rail (we returned out rental car early because it was so easy to get around on the light rail) which is 20 minutes to both downtown and the airport. Additionally, if you like to run- or take a nice walk, it is also very close to Lake Washington, which is beautiful. I definitely recommend staying here to have a comfortable visit while you are in Seattle!
48681	215882	10.0	9.0	5600688	We were very happy with our stay at the Garden Cottage.  It's an adorable place with everything you could need!  
48682	215882	10.0	9.0	5700397	I cannot recommend Julie's cottage enough. It was the perfect space for the two of us and Julie was an amazing host. She was attentive yet allowed us private use of her beautiful back yard. We considered kidnapping her to come landscape our home! It is a zen retreat in the middle of a bustling city and is perfect for a couple or single person. I don't know how well it would work for families but I did see she had extra bedding gear available.  Tips and tricks: if you're like us and are used to a dark bedroom you might want to consider an eye mask. The window shades here are light and there are also great skylights but it all makes for bright mornings! :) Second tip it took us a minute to figure out: the best way to get some cool air in at night is to crank open the windows and clip the shade up a bit. Works so much better than the fan on the window unit (and you don't need air at night in Seattle with the cool temps).  Again, all the positive reviews are for real; Julie's has created such a unique space and we recommend it completely. 
48683	215882	10.0	9.0	6152446	"My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay at Julie's Garden Cottage for three days this July. The place is just as described, only better and more beautiful. The hot tub was heaven.  The cottage itself couldn't have been cleaner or more attractive, and the garden -- gardens, really -- were a delight. This ""relaxing garden cottage with hot tub"" has our highest recommendation."
48684	215882	10.0	9.0	6269860	My college roommate got married in a community center just 5 blocks away from this cottage, so the location was perfect.  We never needed a car since the light rail was able to get us from the airport to the cottage and to the International District, Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market in no time.  I recommend getting an Orca card before arriving for easy public transportation.  We soaked in the hot tub, used the mini fridge and coffee maker and lounged in the serene garden space on a daily basis.  Staying in the cottage really made me feel like I had a 'home' during our Seattle visit.  Julie was quick to respond to my questions before our visit and was able to accommodate our request for two keys for the cottage with only a days notice.  Thank you for sharing your space, Julie.  
48685	215882	10.0	9.0	6372703	We had a wonderful stay at Julie's place.  Although we didn't get the chance to try out the hot tub, we really enjoyed relaxing in the chairs outside.  Her backyard is very well landscaped, and was wonderful to retreat back to after our days exploring Seattle.  Her place is a short walk to the light rail station, and an even shorter walk to some great restaurants on Rainier Avenue.  Julie was a great host! 
48686	215882	10.0	9.0	6420963	Amazingly calm, relaxing retreat. Julie couldn't have been more accommodating. 
48687	215882	10.0	9.0	6512703	Julie's Relaxing  Garden Cottage is indeed very relaxing with a pleasant space and wonderful garden to enjoy. Julie is friendly and easy to deal with and her space is clean and comfortable. The cottage is located within walking distance of Columbia City, a great neighborhood to visit while in Seattle, and also close to Lake Washington and all it has to offer. I highly recommend the Relaxing Garden Cottage.
48688	215882	10.0	9.0	6598314	This cottage is very private, and comes with a bonus kitty cat! The inside is clean, comfortable, and has details that make your stay that much better - dvds, books, tea, etc. I would highly recommend this place, especially if you have a car to get around Seattle (we did not try public transportation, but I hear it works well too). The park nearby was great for a morning jog as well.
48689	215882	10.0	9.0	6663727	Wonderful community! Great local places to eat such as Geraldine's and Both Ways. Lot's to do within walking distance. The cottage is light and peaceful, Julie is an excellent hostess.
48690	215882	10.0	9.0	6807039	Julie was such a great hostess! She even offered to pick us up from the light rail since we arrived late at night! The cottage was beautiful, clean, and in a great location for nearby activities as well as access to downtown. We only wish we could've stayed longer!
48691	215882	10.0	9.0	6900768	"Derek and I made our way from Portland to backcountry (email hidden) Helens and Mt Rainier to Seattle. Instead of sleeping on an air mattress at a friend's studio apartment in Ballard, we opted to book two nights at Julie's cottage.

The cottage was a lovely space; bright and airy, small but not cramped. Both nights we quickly fell to sleep on the super comfortable mattress. In the mornings, we opened the French doors to the patio and adjoining garden to enjoy the cool summer morning. I would have loved to have seen the garden in full summer bloom!

Central Link, the light rail system, was a great way to get downtown. It was a bit of an uphill hike to get to the station but we didn't find it strenuous, just worth noting.

We spent most of our time exploring and enjoying the city so we didn't see Julie much but she was very friendly and responsive to emails and text messages about our trip plans. Her garden cottage provided us with some inspiration for the small house that we'll be building in the coming year."
48692	215882	10.0	9.0	6942944	What a lovely home and great location! Julie was extremely hospitable. The little apartment is separate from the house, and we had the backyard space all to ourselves when we wanted, including the hot tub... but we also really enjoyed bumping into her and having a chat. I can't say enough about what she's done with the garden and how relaxing and homey it was. Also just a few blocks from the thriving Columbia City neighborhood with good food, funky shops, and even a VERY convenient light rail station to downtown. The drive isn't that bad either if you're used to Seattle or city driving. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend Julie's place for its charm, privacy, and warmth. It made me want to move to Columbia City!
48693	215882	10.0	9.0	7223273	Great relaxing space. The hot tub at the end of the day was fantastic. A little bit out of downtown but the little local Main Street had some great restaurants. Would definitely stay here again especially if we just wanted to relax and see the parks and neighborhoods close by. Julie is a great host.
48694	215882	10.0	9.0	7311540	Really enjoyed our stay at Julie's cottage. Secluded and super comfortable bed - also Julie was really helpful with nearby food choices and spot-on. We ate well! all in all, thoroughly recommended
48695	215882	10.0	9.0	7398394	We stayed here right after our wedding - it was a little piece of heaven. Very quiet, clean, smells great, and great hot tub. We would walk to breakfast just 10 min away. We got some much needed R&R. 
48696	215882	10.0	9.0	7529702	"Lorrie and I enjoyed our weekend retreat at Julie's cottage. It was everything we hoped for. Julie was a gracious hostess although we spent most of our time in the city so we didn't have much of an opportunity to visit with her and her kitty Ursula.  

The accommodations including the hot tub were great. The bed was very comfortable and although I prefer a darker room to sleep in, I was able to get two great nights of sleep.

The cottage was very clean and peaceful.

I especially appreciated the Keurig coffee maker and complimentary coffee in the morning.

At Julie's suggestion, we had dinner at Tutta Bella's and breakfast at Both Ways Cafe.  Both were small and friendly with lots of character and good food."
48697	215882	10.0	9.0	7603813	Julie's space was beautiful! Clean, bright, comfy, and exactly what we were looking for. Julie was welcome and friendly but also gave us space to ourselves. We enjoyed the hot tub, access to the well-stocked kitchen area, and comfy bed. The amount of natural light in the space was delightful and you can see how much she paid attention to each detail in making it a comfortable space to stay. Highly recommend staying here!
48698	215882	10.0	9.0	7705983	We LOVED the garden cottage and had an absolutely fantastic time! Julie welcomed us warmly, offered totally on-point advice when we asked (including directing us to the Columbia City Bakery about a 3 minute drive away which BLEW OUR MINDS with deliciousness), and gave us our own space when we wanted it. The cottage was a perfect, bright, warm, cozy hideaway with easy access to all the awesomeness Seattle has to offer. We'd definitely stay there again! 
48699	215882	10.0	9.0	7887598	This was an exquisite experience. Julie's cottage is full of light, very clean and well represented by the photographs. I slept peacefully and naturally enjoyed my stay in Seattle. If you want to treat yourself to a special gift, book in here. 
48700	215882	10.0	9.0	7986920	"We stayed with Julie for 4 nights.She was easy to communicate with, even leaving a key out for us when she couldn't be there when we came in.She was full of information about Seattle. The location is good with many nearby restaurants. The light rail is a reasonable walk, and that made the city very convenient. 
    The room is comfortable and clean. There were plenty of towels and extra blankets. I was expecting a bit more of a kitchen-there is only a microwave for heating food. The only other thing missing is closet space. We pretty much had to live out of our suitcase because of the small size of the rack for hanging clothes.
   The hot tub was nice to come back to after a day of walking and exploring. It was always ready for us. The room and garden yard are very private, which was nice, although the window and door coverings are really thin."
48701	215882	10.0	9.0	8030482	This cottage was a clean and cozy gem.  All of the small touches like tea maker, hair dryer in the bathroom, and clean soft sheets made it feel like home.  We would definitely stay here again.  
48702	215882	10.0	9.0	8114498	"This was the first time we have ever used AirBnb and were not sure what to expect.

There are definaltly some pro's and con's to staying here. 
Pro's- It is a beautiful setting! Juie has done up the backyard beautifully! 
- The neighborhood was charming and we felt safe walking around at night.
- The hottub was amazing! So relaxing after a long day of shopping.
- Some really good restaurants within walking distance (10 blocks)
-Julie was nice and made sure you had you privacy.

Con's
-The location is quite a distance from downtown and if you have plans to be doing alot of things downtown or at stadium you are looking at a $25 cab ride or a 5 block walk to the the train.
- The bed was terrible! A futon on a metal frame, the pillows are older than I am and the bedding was terrible! Old and scratchy!
-The bathroom was ok, but so tiny it was hard to get ready . 

We would not stay here agin as it just wasnt convenient for us."
48703	215882	10.0	9.0	8156221	We had a wonderful, peaceful stay the last 2 days of vacation. The space was relaxing and the hot tub was heaven!  It was the perfect place to finish our vacation time.  Julie was friendly, gracious and provided all we needed to be comfortable.  I loved the choice of lighting-- every ambiance of mood was available.  The space was clean, quite, and felt very private. Thanks Julie!  We hope to share your space again sometime; hopefully more than just two days!
48704	215882	10.0	9.0	8234257	"We had a wonderful 2-night stay at Julie's Garden Cottage. Would definitely stay here again!

Super convenient location just a 5 minute walk to the center of Columbia City. The cottage was tastefully decorated and I loved the ambience both inside and out in the garden. "
48705	215882	10.0	9.0	8372248	"We enjoyed the heck out of our stay at Julie's wonderful cottage. She was attentive on our arrival, even though we arrived quite late. She showed us the ropes of the place and got us all set up for our stay. We didn't see her the rest of the weekend, as we were mostly gallivanting about Seattle.

The neighborhood is pretty awesome and we ate a coupla' meals in Columbia City and loved it. A great, diverse, comfortable, friendly vibe. We also did a huge walk along Lake Washington on Saturday morning - maybe the highlight of our trip.

For starters the cottage is SO clean. Coming from a bit of a clean freak, this is always such a delight. Wifi worked great. Bathroom was tight but very clean and good water pressure. A very quiet night's sleep.

The train to downtown Seattle is a little bit of a hike, but totally doable, and once you're on it..zip..you're there.

We loved our stay..we'll be back!

-Ryan"
48706	215882	10.0	9.0	8646237	Really beautiful quarters, and such a gracious host! She was really great to work with, and helped us out with everything we needed. Highly recommended! :)
48707	215882	10.0	9.0	8693218	We spent two lovely nights in Julie's cottage. It's super charming, a short walk up a paved path lined with twinkling lights and opens into spacious courtyard complete with a hot tub (which we were very grateful for after training 6 hours a day). The cottage itself is clean, bright and we'll appointed and Julie is sweet and responsive.  If I end up returning to Seattle, I'll definitely be staying here again :)
48708	215882	10.0	9.0	8821982	Beautiful little cottage meticulously set up-- I was very pleased
48709	215882	10.0	9.0	8910108	We had a very enjoyable stay! Comfortable cottage, relaxing hot tub, walking distance to Columbia City. A bit further to the light rail to Downtown, but very manageable. Highly recommended!
48710	215882	10.0	9.0	9067285	"This was our first Seattle vacation, but definetly not our last!  Julie's cottage is precious. It is light, airy, open and peaceful. It is nicely appointed and comfortable.  We really enjoyed our stay there. 

Room darkening option would have been perfect, but that is the only non provided amenity.  There is no television and for most people that would be a non issue. However, it is football season and my husband is addicted. Fortunately there is a friendly, cozy, tasty sports bar just around the corner,,,perfect!"
48711	215882	10.0	9.0	9425961	The cottage is very nice and cozy, and the view of the garden is lovely. Liked watching the birds outside while have morning coffee. The only disappointment was not getting to use the hot tub due to maintenance issues.
48712	215882	10.0	9.0	9505945	Julie was an incredibly gracious host.  Her cottage is cozy and comfortable, and the hot tub is an added bonus.  Make sure you check out the Columbia City area, which is just a short walk away.  Julie had fantastic recommendations for food and entertainment, particularly Geraldine's.  She was easy to communicate with, and we enjoyed talking with her.  Her cat is sweet, too.  Highly recommended! 
48713	215882	10.0	9.0	9738973	"Julie was a fantastic hostess! She met us at our car and was superbly nice and attentive. She made recommendations of what to see and do and her home was very welcoming. Make a point to jump in the outdoor hottub each night and stare at the stars. A major perk of this lovely home
"
48714	215882	10.0	9.0	10352187	"Julie's relaxing garden cottage is a true hidden gem! Upon arrival Julie was a very accommodating host telling us all about her charming Columbia City, which is the quaint town with some excellent restaurants and shops nearby. The cottage itself is very cozy, clean and nicely decorated and is the perfect size for a traveling couple. The bed was VERY comfortable and the electric fireplace heater kept us warm at night. Julie let us use the jacuzzi every night and was even sweet enough to turn it on upon request when we were out to let it warm up. She was easy to communicate with and I'd give her an A+ for all her help and generosity.  
Great proximity: It was a very convenient 15 minute drive from the airport and only 10 minute walk to the nearest light rail public transit that takes you right into downtown Seattle. Also it was only a short walk to downtown Columbia City. The location was just far enough outside Seattle to not be located in the hussle and bussle of the city, but still only about a 20 minute drive/light rail ride into Seattle. I would highly recommended this location based on our amazing stay! Must Go!"
48715	215882	10.0	9.0	10394890	My partner and I had a lovely time staying at the Garden Cottage! The space is calm, clean, and smells nice. We really enjoyed soaking in the hot tub and snoozing in the comfy bed. Two thumbs up!
48716	215882	10.0	9.0	10547405	Super cute place!  We really enjoyed staying here. The hot tub on a chilly rainy night was perfect. Julie was so nice and went over everything we needed when we got there.  The lite rail is just a short walk (10 mins) away, used it to go downtown.  Would definitely stay here again!
48717	215882	10.0	9.0	10707152	Steve and I had a great time here. The cottage is cute and warm with a comfy bed and an AWESOME HOT TUB! The landscaping in the backyard and the abundant natural light inside the cottage were added bonuses too. Great location because of the cute community, close restaurants, parks and walk on Lake Washington. Thanks you Julie! 
48718	215882	10.0	9.0	11065451	Julie's cottage was a pleasure to stay at. Everything was very clean and relaxing. There are several windows in the small space so everything feels very fresh and airy. The hot tub was also definately welcomed! 
48719	215882	10.0	9.0	11360893	Julie's cottage is a very comfortable place to relax, especially during a rainy Seattle weekend. Great light and very quiet. Quant neighborhood with lots of restaurants and places to walk. Julie is a wonderful host.  
48720	215882	10.0	9.0	11560193	Julie is a gracious host and the garden cottage is absolutely amazing!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
48721	215882	10.0	9.0	11732103	Julie's place was absolutely perfect for what I needed! I messaged Julie last minute and she was immediately responsive to let me know her availability. The hot tub was on when I got in and it was, on the whole, an incredibly relaxing experience. She also gave us tips for our adventure that day and it was spot on advice. Couldn't have asked for more!
48722	215882	10.0	9.0	11906035	Lovely spot. Welcoming and cozy. Julie is a top notch host. 
48723	215882	10.0	9.0	12301815	What a gorgeous place!  Julie was a wonderful host, very responsive and eager to provide recommendations for local restaurants and public transportation.  We really lucked out with the beautiful cottage, backyard garden, and hot tub!
48724	215882	10.0	9.0	12666985	"Lovely little cottage!! Had such a relaxing and refreshing stay, with the hot tub, the garden, (the rain!), and the fresh, clean feel of the inside. Julie was a great host -- communicative and nonintrusive -- and I'd recommend the cottage, for sure. The little center up the street had some great restaurant and it was a fun area to explore. It's a private spot, great for one or two people. 

One thing -- It's super bright inside of the cottage in the mornings because of the skylights, windows, etc., so if you're hoping to sleep in late, this isn't the place. Otherwise, it's probably the place :)"
48725	215882	10.0	9.0	12716646	My husband and I visited Seattle for the time, and this was our second experience using Airbnb. We stayed with friends for a few days during the first part of our trip, visited Portland by train for a couple days and then spent our last two nights in Seattle. Julie's garden cottage was the perfect place to unwind and relax before going back home. Julie was very friendly and communicative the whole time and extremely knowledgeable and helpful in offering advice on public transportation and recommendations on dining. The cottage is very airy, cozy and beautiful. It has amazing light and lovely French doors, and I loved waking up to natural light streaming in during the morning hours. The bed is very comfortable, and the hot tub is a nice bonus! Columbia City is a charming little neighborhood with plenty of restaurant options. Access to the light rail is about a 10 minute walk away, and the #7 bus stop to downtown is a quick couple blocks away through a park. Beautiful cottage and a great neighborhood! Thank you, Julie, for your gracious hospitality.
48726	215882	10.0	9.0	12783751	This is a fantastic place!  It is beautifully designed and appointed.  It's also a very cozy place to be on a rainy day.  It had everything I wanted and I highly recommend it.
48727	215882	10.0	9.0	13186436	My friend and I had a lovely stay in Julie's cottage. It was our first visit to Seattle, and we found Julie to be very welcoming and helpful. The cottage was clean and bright, and the hot tub was a wonderful way to relax after a day out on the town. We enjoyed the Columbia City district, which is within walking distance of Julie's cottage, and has some super cute restaurants, and some great live music. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle, and I would stay with Julie again in a heartbeat.  
48728	215882	10.0	9.0	13431227	Julie was wonderful.  Her place is very nice.  Beautiful garden.  The cottage was perfect for our romantic getaway.  Wonderful location.  Just a really good choice all the way around.
48729	215882	10.0	9.0	13578829	Julie has a great place in an interesting part of Seattle.  Julie knows quite a bit about the history and makeup of the neighborhood.  Her garden cottage is well set up and is a great and convenient place from which you can explore and discover.  I'd like to stay there again.
48730	215882	10.0	9.0	13734168	"Such a lovely sanctuary with a helpful and generous hostess! We watched goldfinches flit in the birdbath and garden with Buddha peering through the leaves. We used the hot tub on sunny days and starry nights. The cute town with good restaurants (Geraldine's - great for breakfast!) was an easy walk and there was lots of convenient public transportation to different points in the city. There was a long city park a block away and Seward Park with its redwoods and water a short bus ride away.
The cottage was small but light-filled and pretty. We were writing in the mornings so spent quite a bit of time there."
48731	215882	10.0	9.0	14397136	"I am so glad I picked Julie's cottage for my trip, my first experience with Airbnb and first visit to Seattle. The space was so lovely--luxurious and yet back-to-basics at the same time. The bed was delicious, and the shower was plenty hot and tall. It was wonderful to come back to the hot tub after long days of gallivanting, and to wake up with light from the skylights and birds chirping in the garden. You can really tell how much care she's taken in creating the space; it's incredibly relaxing. 

I'm not sure it's pictured, but she has a Keurig in the kitchen, which meant I didn't have to hunt down caffeine each morning in a pre-coffee state (which I, and I'm sure the baristas nearby, appreciated). There's a toaster, microwave, electric kettle, and mini-fridge as well. The audio player was awesome--I plugged my iPod in and heard my favorite album in more detail than ever before. 

I rented a car for part of my trip to do a little more widespread-exploring, and I walked and took the Link to and from downtown the rest of the time, which was very easy. Julie is a public transit expert. Ask her about the Gandhi walk! 

Julie was very accommodating when I arrived late at night, and gave me a ride to the Link when I left. As a first-time young solo-traveler, I really appreciated that she checked in on me from time to time, and let me know that if I had an emergency I could call her. After I took a day to drive around Mount Rainier (I hugely recommend this if you have the time), she even called to make sure I hadn't had any trouble and had gotten back okay. 

It was way too easy to fall in love with Seattle and the Northwest from her place, and I'm already planning my next visit.  "
48732	215882	10.0	9.0	14680003	The Garden Cottage was great! My sister and I were able to leave our luggage there after an early flight in, and Julie was wonderful. The property is 1/2 block from a park and about 10 blocks from the light rail. There are great little townie restaurants only about 5 blocks away. We were in town for the Seattle Marathon, and it was wonderful to have a place to stretch out after the event. We walked the 1+mile to Seward Park with a picnic and books and it was well worth the walk! Thank you, Julie!
48733	215882	10.0	9.0	14834375	The cottage is absolutely perfect! The backyard is perfectly manicured and the hot tub is wonderful after a long day of walking around. We would certainly stay again.
48734	215882	10.0	9.0	15002550	"Julie was such a warm and gracious host. Everything in the cottage was clean and it was nicely appointed. Julie was able to inform us of places to visit, eating spots, and the best ways to get around the area. Such a knowledgeable and pleasant person.

The single cup Keuring machine and the yogurts and fruits Julie left for us was a pleasant surprise for breakfast!

I cant say more about our experience and visit to Seattle. We will most definitely be staying here again on our next trip to the gloom Northwest. 

Thanks again Julie!"
48735	215882	10.0	9.0	15380275	My stay couldn't have been more wonderful! Julie was so pleasant & down to earth. She really knew the ins and outs of Colombia city. It was a Staycation for me being a new mom and the hot tub, quiet atmosphere, walking up to the beautiful birds and we'll kept garden was exactly what I needed to work on music, relax, and pamper myself. I will for site be back! Julie was even so nice to invite me to a 4th of July party with her and some friends!  I had other plans arranged but she truly made me feel welcome. She also has a very nice and eclectic book and movie collection. I started reading 3 cups of tea on my down time and truly enjoyed it. Upon my arrival Julie had some breakfast snacks in the refrigerator that I enjoyed and offered me some fresh veggies from her garden. I can't say enough great things about my stay at the cottage! Julie has truly been thoughtful about all of the hard work she has put into the cottage to make it the most relaxing & unassuming getaway! I would go back any day vs. Getting an overrated hotel. Not to mention is located in the PERFECT spot in Seattle. I'll be keeping in touch as I'm local to pierce County, any time I need a little getaway! 
48736	215882	10.0	9.0	15542951	This wonderful retreat was just what we needed after the stress of looking for a house.  The place is exactly as advertised.  Julie was super helpful and a wonderful host.  We liked it so much we are moving to the neighborhood!  If you're around on Wednesdays, check out the Farmer's Market.  We also liked the restaurants and the ease of taking the light rail to downtown.
48737	215882	10.0	9.0	15819610	Julie's place will stay on my list of great experiences for years to come. Every element of her space is considered; you'll feel like you're in a spa or sanctuary. Also, public transportation makes getting to great sites and activities a breeze. However, the neighborhood is cool enough and close enough for great eats, all with a good variety for tastes and budget. Julie made every aspect of getting there, from approval to check-in, easy as well.  Best treat: watching hummingbirds feed when we opened the French doors that open out to the Zen patio and garden. 
48738	215882	10.0	9.0	15989211	This is a very nice little cottage, ideal for one person or a couple. It is well located, close enough to touristy areas by public transport, but far enough to be quiet. Julie was a great host, always ready to give suggestions; interaction with her was moderately high. 
48739	215882	10.0	9.0	16898966	The experience was perfect! We could not have asked for a better location and house. The cottage itself has everything that we needed and more. Its a very efficient use of space and has even inspired me with my future living space plans. The cottage is exactly as described with plenty of privacy! The neighborhood seemed really nice as well! All the houses had their own flavor and style. We were walking distance from the seafair which was the biggest plus! An Uber fare to Seattle was super reasonable and took little to no time at all! It was as if I lived there!
48740	215882	10.0	9.0	18059082	Julie was out of town but she had a friend meet me and make me welcome.  I thoroughly enjoyed my week's stay in this relaxing, quiet environment.  I was visiting my granddaughter and we were able to walk to the playground.  I agree with a previous reviewer that you do need a sleep mask because the cottage has skylights and lots of windows.
48741	215882	10.0	9.0	18397495	The cottage was just as described, clean, light, airy, very convenient to family and wedding we were attending. Julie was friendly, accessible, a great host, providing us with lots of information.
48742	215882	10.0	9.0	18789319	"Hands-down, this beat out any hotel I've stayed in as of late. The cottage Julie has set up is quiet, secluded, and is amazingly well furnished (it also gave me an idea or two to try when I renovate my house).

Julie herself was incredibly friendly, very open to offering information on local places to visit, and was flexible regarding the time-window allotted (I showed up a little early, due to my flight schedule, and she let me drop off my stuff). Adding on to this, she went out of town while I was staying, and she was still reachable via text-messaging throughout this period.

Definitely the best place to stay in the area, I'd say. I'll be putting her cottage at the top of my list for my future visits to Seattle!"
48743	215882	10.0	9.0	19303587	Julie was very helpful and the garden cottage is a beautiful and relaxing place to stay. Recommended!
48744	215882	10.0	9.0	19525519	A spotlessly clean, sunny, open-plan cottage set in a meditative Japanese style garden. The cottage is lovely and situated in the great neighbourhood of Columbia City, with easy access both to the downtown and the airport on the nearby light rail. Communication with Julie worked like clockwork. Julie was a pleasure to deal with. We would definitely stay here again.
48745	215882	10.0	9.0	19738964	Julie was great! She greeted us with some fresh fruit and coffee, and helped us figure out how to get around town. The room was tiny but charming and fit our needs well. You must eat at Columbia City Bakery or Geraldine's down the street!
48746	215882	10.0	9.0	20090655	Henry and I had an amazing time. We love the cottage, felt right at home. The area was very quiet and peaceful. It was close from the airport as well as down town Seattle. We are looking forward to our next visit and will look to book this location again.  
48747	215882	10.0	9.0	20754947	Julie was a great hostess (although she wasn't there much, which was fine with us).   It is a wonderful place to stay in a great part of Seattle.  My wife and I kept commenting on how glad we were that I discovered this place!
48748	215882	10.0	9.0	21048058	"What a wonderful bungalow Julie has set up for her guests. 
It was more than perfect for me as I could come and go without having to go through her home. 
So clean and nothing left undone and all the amenities you need and then some. Wonderful neighborhood with park just across the street. Julie was helpful as she gave me all the locations I had asked for and the area space around the bungalow was so private and quiet. I will be staying with Julie next time in Seattle. "
48749	215882	10.0	9.0	21167925	Julie's garden cottage was exactly as the pictures described! It was clean and cute. The jacuzzi was a big plus! Amazing after a tiring day! Julie was a very gracious host. She gave us recommendations on places and transportation, which was very much appreciated. The location was perfect! Just a short walk from the light rail which was amazing! Would definitely stay again!
48750	215882	10.0	9.0	21341545	We LOVED everything about staying in Julie's guest studio. It was just as she said it would be and even more. Julie was always available and her help in navigating the sights of Seattle was spot on!
48751	215882	10.0	9.0	21545984	Julie was very welcoming and the cottage was beautiful. It was as if the home sprang up organically from her beautiful garden. This was my first time using airbnb and Julie showed us how awesome it can be. Thank you. 
48752	215882	10.0	9.0	21879581	"This cottage is every bit as inviting, rejuvenating and peaceful as the pictures make it out to be - not to mention, the garden surrounding the property is beautiful! The neighborhood itself offers plenty of opportunities to experience life as a local and when you're ready to leave the cottage access to Downtown Seattle and the sights is easy and comfortable to navigate. 
Julie was a wealth of suggestions and they all lived up to the reviews.  She was so gracious and welcoming and has thought of every detail to make the cottage an exceptional get-away."
48753	215882	10.0	9.0	22529070	Julie was a wonderful host! We loved being able to come and go with no hassle. The landscaping on the property is so beautiful. She's really created such a comforting environment.The jacuzzi was so great to come home to after a long day of exploring. The covered patio is great for sipping coffee in the mornings. I can't say enough how perfect this location is. 10 minute drive to pikes market/space needle. 15 min drive to the airport. The downtown Columbia city district was so cute. AMAZING sushi restaurant ( wabi sabi ). Columbia city bakery was delicious as well ! Julie was always available if we needed anything at all or had any questions. I'd highly recommend this cottage for your stay in Seattle ! 
48754	215882	10.0	9.0	23106079	This is an adorable serene private cottage and the hot tub was a perfect addition to an amazing weekend! Julie is super sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. I was in Seattle for a concert and this was hands down a better choice than any hotel! Is very homey an extremely clean and well lit and I loved that there are white Christmas lights neatly hung near the ceiling, they were a great addition! Absolutely loved it.
48755	215882	10.0	9.0	23647167	Julie, was AWESOME!  She accommodated our very late arrival and was very friendly during our entire stay.  The Cottage is very cute. It sits behind her residence. The Cottage includes a wonderfully comfortable bed, a nicely designed bathroom, skylights throughout, a kitchen sink and counters. There was a microwave and refrigerator in the room, and a Keureg Coffee maker. The room was decorated well. The hot tub was a wonderful addition and was very private! 
48756	215882	10.0	9.0	23931942	Very nice stay. Cute cottage with beautiful landscaping and hottub as described. The hot tub alone made it for us. It is about a 15 minute walk to the lightrail and then another 15 minute or so ride into downtown as described... so not bad at all, but not REALLY central, if that's what you're after (it is much more relaxing than downtown though). The area around the house is cute, too - we did end up staying in the neighborhood for one of our nights. Julie was a charming host and she's done a great job with this property.
48757	215882	10.0	9.0	24490112	We didn't get a chance to meet Julie since we were staying over Christmas and she was (reasonably) away with family. Despite that, she did a great job of communicating with us and told us that she was available if needed and set us up with the contact information for her house sitter. This space was really, really pleasant. We LOVED the hot tub at night- perfect for relaxing after walking around the city and we did A LOT of walking. We liked that the place was in a quiet neighborhood but that we could easily access the city. The light rail was a short walk away and it was so easy and cheap from there to get to downtown. We didn't rent a car and were fine. There is a Safeway and a liquor store about a 15 minute walk from the cottage if you want to get some groceries. I would say if you don't plan on renting a car then you should plan on walking quite a bit. The bed really is so comfortable. We didn't really explore the neighborhood a lot because we went in the city everyday but it seemed like there were restaurants within walking distance from there. Overall a great stay at the garden cottage.
48758	215882	10.0	9.0	24682170	Julie was great all along the process - from initial engagement through check-out, she was available and attentive, but also gave us our space to make the place our own. Can't complain about anything except the price, but Seattle is an expensive market overall and this didn't seem to far out of line with the rest of the options on AirBnB.
48759	215882	10.0	9.0	25164637	My boyfriend Calisto and I stayed in the cottage for a couple of days to celebrate both of our birthdays and anniversary in Seattle. Julie was very warm and welcoming. And we were wowed by the cottage that is an oasis amidst the fog. It was nice to stay in a neighborhood that we may not have seen if we stayed in a conventional hotel downtown. Everyone in Columbia City was extremely welcoming. We especially liked the wine tasting and jazz at The Royal Room as well as the all day breakfast spot, Geraldine's Counter (for us late risers). When we wanted to venture to the city, either the number 7 bus or link brought us there in no time. Overall it was a lovely stay. Thanks, Julie!
48760	215882	10.0	9.0	25749473	"Lovely cottage beautifully maintained. Compact. Quiet. Peaceful. Near good restaurants, Empire Espresso, Columbia City Bakery and the link rail station. Easy to downtown and the airport. Excellent neighborhood. Julie's the perfect host. What's not to like?

Highly recommended. 
"
48761	215882	10.0	9.0	25857005	It was a clean beautiful bright quiet place to relax and unwind. Julie was very kind and gave me all the privacy I needed. 
48762	215882	10.0	9.0	26563883	"What a great experience. I asked my girlfriend to marry me at the edge of the bed. It was the perfect setting.

The place was so clean and smelled amazing! It was exactly what we were looking for. I can definitely see why she would use this space as a yoga studio. 

In LOVE! I will be coming back for sure!"
48763	215882	10.0	9.0	26951486	I am a return guest at Julie's cottage and plan to return again. It is bright, cozy and extremely clean, with all the amenities one could need. I highly recommend it. 
48764	215882	10.0	9.0	27567111	The amount of care and attention Julie put into building her garden cottage is apparent the minute you walk through the gate. Such a bright, warm, and comforting place to rest. Beyond the general aesthetic of the studio, Julie herself was an incredible host. She took extra care to introduce me to the city and, on my first night there, went out to dinner with me. It was an absolute treat to stay with Julie, couldn't recommend it more, really.
48765	215882	10.0	9.0	27703793	We loved our stay at the cottage. It was clean, private and comfortable. So bright and lovely. Great location. Julie was great at communicating, she made us feel right at home and gave us great recommendations for places to eat. Hot tub was wonderful after a day of exploring the city. We will definitely be back. 
48766	215882	10.0	9.0	27862559	My wife and I were looking to stay in a relaxed spot in an up-and-coming neighborhood and we hit the jackpot with Julie's cottage. Very clean, quiet, with peaceful vibes and a fantastic garden with several visiting bird species and a lovely view up the hill at night whilst sitting in the hot tub. Everything you need in the little kitchen, and a cute little porch overlooking the garden for breakfast! Walking distance to all the local-owned restaurants and pubs. Also walking distance to a lakeside trail and the old-growth forest in Seward Park which is perfect for a nice walk, hike, bird-watching, nature center. It's a quick drive right into downtown Seattle. Columbia City is a diverse and buzzing little community and Julie's cottage couldn't be in a better spot. We will definitely stay here again. 
48767	215882	10.0	9.0	28228558	Julie's space was a little oasis! It was just as described and the backyard was so peaceful, the perfect setting for a hot tub. Julie was a pleasure and offered wonderful suggestions for food around the city. It is a magical space I would love to stay in again.
48768	215882	10.0	9.0	28365952	Julie's cottage was simply wonderful! Everything was clean and lovely. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Columbia City. 
48769	215882	10.0	9.0	28807814	"I lived in Columbia City for 15 years until moving to Atlanta 2 years ago. Staying at the cottage felt like the sweetest, most comfortable and perfectly located little nest to welcome me back. Julie is a lovely and accommodating host. I didn't get to spend very much time with her with all of my running around, but she is the kind of person you would want to grab coffee with and hang out with at Columbia City Bakery (don't miss it!) Her kind-heartedness is reflected in the space she provides and I'm pretty sure she knows that she is offering a great deal. She could easily change more for the accommodations she is providing given the location and space. 

If you aren't familiar with the neighborhood, Columbia City is exactly where you want to stay in Seattle. It is one of the jewels of Seattle--a cute neighborhood with a lot of local flavor, great restaurants, great coffee, fun shops, and easy access via the bus and Lightrail that is within walking distance. You can take an easy walk to Lake Washington for views of the water and Mt. Rainier, or you can take a walk in the other direction and be in the midst of a fun urban neighborhood. It is also close in to the downtown area, but feels like a peaceful get-away in a quiet neighborhood. 

I plan to come home to Seattle fairly often and the cottage will be my first choice when I return. Thanks Julie! You made my first trip home so comfortable.
"
48770	215882	10.0	9.0	29317443	Julie and her space were both fantastic. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. She warmed up the hot tub when she knew we were heading back, offered an extra key, and was very responsive whenever we had a question. Thanks, Julie!
48771	215882	10.0	9.0	29760795	"Julie's cottage is exactly as advertised--full of warmth and character, comfortable and quiet, and very, very Zen. Julie herself is a fantastic host; she made sure to say hello and chat with us about her favorite things to do in the city. The cottage is well located, and extremely walkable. The exceedingly charming main drag of Columbia City is a short 5 minute walk away, and there you can enjoy great food (Island Soul and Geraldine's Counter are must tries), fantastic art and even live music. Further, the light rail which goes right into Downtown Seattle is a quick 10 minute walk, and even better, it connects to Seattle-Tacoma airport. Our favorite thing was the quiet of the neighborhood. It was great to come home to after long days exploring bustling neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and Fremont. The next time we're in the area, we'll check Julie's house for availability first. We recommend you do the same. 
"
48772	215882	10.0	9.0	30572938	We recently spent two nights at Julie's cottage. It was fantastic, and exactly as advertised -- actually, probably even better. It was very clean, had everything we could have needed, and was very close to public transportation stops. Julie greeted us when we arrived, showed us around, and provided some dining recommendations which were also spot-on. It is also very close to many restaurants and little shops in Columbia City, as well. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Would definitely recommend to others, and hope to utilize this space again on future trips to Seattle! 
48773	215882	10.0	9.0	31128869	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Julie's cottage. It was a nice little private place close to many Seattle hot spots. I definitely recommend staying at the cottage. Communicating with Julie was also easy, and she was very responsive.
48774	215882	10.0	9.0	31488306	Julie was an incredible host. First time airbnb and I'm hooked! The place was exactly what we wanted... friendly, helpful host, private, and in a great location! If you're looking for a relaxing and comfortable location in seattle, this is it!
48775	215882	10.0	9.0	31702128	I really enjoyed Julie cottage. It was very beautiful, peaceful and she was very warm and welcoming. Julie did everything to make sure we settle into the place. Her garden cottage is perfect for a vacation due to it location and proximity to downtown. Also if you are a early morning jogger, there are great parks around where you can go jog. I will highly recommend Julie place for a stay in Seattle and will definitely be coming back!!! 
48776	215882	10.0	9.0	31964730	Julie's place was absolutely perfect. A little adorable place in her beautiful garden with everything we needed to be comfortable during our stay. It was clean, and private. The location was perfect, within walking distance of all kinds of things. Julie was a great host. I highly recommend this for two people exploring Seattle. 
48777	215882	10.0	9.0	32246044	Julie's abode is truly lovely. The accommodations are very comfortable and relaxing. Julie keeps the space immaculately clean and the layout is well thought-out. There is even a small porch area where one can sit and enjoy the garden area (read: pretty wonderful). As well, we fell in love with the Columbia City area surrounding the cottage. There is no shortage of fun places to eat, shop, and stroll. Would highly recommend!
48778	215882	10.0	9.0	32879933	This was my second time staying at Julie's Cottage.  As before, it was cute and comfortable.  The location is great for enjoying the tranquility of Seward Park or walking to the light rail for a quick trip into the downtown.  Julie is a wonderful host and offered excellent suggestions of areas to visit, places to see, and current performances or events to attend.  The cottage was comfortable and clean, and offered a calm place to relax in her garden and hot tub.  Overall, a very positive experience.
48779	215882	10.0	9.0	33636801	Excellent host. Beautiful place. Accessible and accommodating. Hope to return soon!
48780	215882	10.0	9.0	34244087	Absolutely amazing! We had such a wonderful time in the cottage! It was cute, clean and had the most beautiful garden to enjoy! We will highly recommend to others and hopefully get to stay again ourselves! Julie was such a sweetheart and so helpful! 
48781	215882	10.0	9.0	34534911	The Garden Cottage was excellent! Great location (easy walk to shops/restaurants in Columbia City), comfy bed, and Julie was friendly and accommodating. It was a wonderful experience.
48782	215882	10.0	9.0	34710910	Julie is very friendly and accommodating! She's always willing to help you with anything and also giving an introduction to the neighborhood. Her cottage is just gorgeous and cosy!! My sister and I enjoyed our stay a lot. The cottage is in Columbia City where you'll be able to try some great tasting local food (Empire Espresso and Salted Sea are highly recommended). Also, you can easily get to Seattle downtown from Columbia City by taking 7 bus. Julie's cottage is highly recommended and for sure that we'll be back! :)
48783	215882	10.0	9.0	35074133	This was only our second Airbnb experience, and we are hooked! Julie was a great host ‚Äì available if we needed her, but gave us complete privacy, too. She responded very quickly if we needed directions or info. Her place is so peaceful, clean, and airy. We loved having the french doors open to the garden and listening to/watching the birds. It was hot when we visited, and appreciated that we could have used the A/C if we wanted, but it was enough to open up the doors for air flow. We also didn't need to use the hot tub or little fireplace heater, but could see that it would be very cozy in inclement weather. We had a very full, long weekend of family reunions, graduation, and other events to attend, and it was so nice to come back to our little oasis at the end of a busy day. It was pretty easy to zoom into downtown Seattle (and elsewhere) from there, and the Columbia City neighborhood is delightful! We had breakfast one morning at Geraldine's Counter (excellent, crowded, and very popular), but picked up croissants and coffee to go at Columbia City Bakery for the days when we had to be somewhere. Have to say, those were the BEST croissants this side of Paris. We'll be dreaming of those... Had a great dinner at La Medusa (Italian/Sicilian). The arancini starter was fabulous... pastas were really good, and garlicky (!). Also loved dinner at Salted Sea - don't miss that one. They have a great oyster selection and the crab cakes were out of this world. Fast forward to the most amazing banana wet-cake with caramel dessert ever. Ever. My husband wanted chocolate mousse, so we ordered that and the banana dish (normally we'd share one), and ended up practically fighting over the banana. He was ready to do a face plant into the dish... Anyway, great stay, fun neighborhood, lovely accommodations ‚Äì we can't wait to come back!
48784	215882	10.0	9.0	35403083	Julie's place is wonderful!  We felt right at home the moment we arrived, and Julie was a kind, understanding and accommodating host.    Having the hot tub available was a huge treat for us, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending Julie's Garden Cottage to anyone!
48785	215882	10.0	9.0	36062202	Cottage was super cute! We enjoyed our brief stay. We did not get to meet Julie while we were there but she was easily reached by airbnb message. Would definitely stay here again!
48786	215882	10.0	9.0	36655041	My wife and I were in Seattle for work. We turned it into a vacation and stayed at Julie's garden cottage. The accommodations were excellent and we enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub in the cool evenings. Julie was a wonderful host and has a wealth of knowledge of the area. Definitely would stay there again. 
48787	215882	10.0	9.0	36970162	Julie's garden cottage was wonderful for our stay. It's very easy to get to from the airport and we really enjoyed wandering around Columbia City. Julie was friendly and helpful, even installing a larger AC unit in the cottage during the very unusual Seattle heatwave to make our stay more comfortable.
48788	215882	10.0	9.0	37741047	Julie's little cottage was perfect for our two nights in Seattle! The hot tub was so relaxing after a day touring the city. Julie was so gracious and had lots of great tips for us!
48789	215882	10.0	9.0	37986112	A lovely little getaway space.  Came for a Seattle weekend adventure and though this is away from downtown and a bit off the beaten path we had no problem getting where we wanted to go by using public transit or uber.  In fact it was nice at the end of the day to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and have a quiet space to go to relax.  Will without doubt stay again on future trips to Seattle.
48790	215882	10.0	9.0	38371154	I had a good experience in this cottage for my honeymoon! It is enoough to feel the common house style in U.S. We hope to visit again someday!
48791	215882	10.0	9.0	39372794	Absolutely loved staying here! The cottage was bright and airy. The location was close to several bus stops and the train station, which made getting around via public transportation super easy. It was really nice coming home and relaxing in the hot tub after exploring the city all day.
48792	215882	10.0	9.0	39734476	Great experience! Easy booking, Fabius host and lovely, private stay. Thank you Julie for helping us have a great trip.
48793	215882	10.0	9.0	40892732	The Garden Cottage is comfortable for people who simply desire to relax and spend lots of time exploring Seattle. It is only a few minutes walk away from a street full of restaurants, and a 15 minute drive from the downtown area and several other fun neighborhoods worth visiting. The cottage is clean, with a refrigerator, wifi, and great air conditioning. The bed is comfortable, and the deck is a perfect spot to relax. The week we stayed there was a festival in town, and Julie ensured that we had a saved parking spot and even free passes to the festival. We loved our stay! 
48794	215882	10.0	9.0	41355743	The cottage is great, has everything you need and julie was helpful even though she was out of town. We had no problems communicating with her. The hot tub was perfect after a long day in the city center. It was clean and as you would excprect it. Columbia city is a great neighborhood easy to reach from the airport and the city. I defenetly woud go there again!
48795	215882	10.0	9.0	42116745	Such a great place! looks just like the pictures! Julie was such a sweet host, and had such an elegant little place for us to stay. We are grateful for the opportunity to stay in a relaxed neighborhood rather than a hotel!
48796	215882	10.0	9.0	42587902	Our stay with Julie was wonderful!  We were elated to have air conditioning at this property, due to the unseasonable heat wave.  The Garden Cottage has so much wonderful natural light, with windows and skylights everywhere.  We had the most restful nights and were able to relax for half of a day when we were exhausted after hiking.  The location of the Garden Cottage is perfect for those who want to explore Seattle, without having to stay in the downtown area.  Columbia City was also wonderful to explore, with a lot of great restaurants, parks, and stores nearby.   We felt very welcome here and Julie did a wonderful job providing suggestions of what to see/do and where to dine.    Also, Hot tub!  Who wouldn't be happy to use a hot tub after a long day of hiking... perfect for my aching muscles or just to relax!    Lastly, Julie's yard is amazing!!  You can tell she has put a lot of heart into her landscaping and it was much appreciated.  
48797	215882	10.0	9.0	43034192	Julie was an excellent host and her garden cottage was in a great location within walking distance to Lake Washington, a grocery store and a street with shops/restaurants.  The Light Rail train stop is nearby and easy to get to downtown Seattle.  The garden was beautiful and the hot tub was great to relax in.
48798	215882	10.0	9.0	43662959	Our stay was an excellent experience, Julie was warm and inviting. The cottage was cozy and well appointed with amazing sun light pouring in. and a few blocks away from the light rail station. Columbia City has a great bakery called Columbia City Bakery off of Rainier Street walking distance from the cottage. We would definitely want to stay at her cottage when we visit Seattle again. Thank you Julie hope to see you again in the near future.
48799	215882	10.0	9.0	45065376	Great host & location! Stayed at the cottage two years in a row now, no regrets!
48800	215882	10.0	9.0	45505882	We really enjoyed our time at the cottage! It was close to downtown, reasonably priced, and very quiet and peaceful. The wind chimes were especially lovely and we enjoyed a quick dip in the hot tub after a long day walking around. The town the cottage is in is also very neat to explore! Thank you for a great stay.  
48801	215882	10.0	9.0	45802747	"Julie and her garden cottage were absolutely amazing. The cottage was wonderfully decorated with lots of natural light and extremely clean. Julie was available through phone with anything that you needed and was extremely flexible and accommodating. 

The cottage was within walking distance of the Light Rail station and close to a few parks and was in a nice and quiet neighborhood."
48802	215882	10.0	9.0	46284525	We had a great time staying at Julie's! The cottage was cozy and the hot tub was an added bonus! She gave us some great ideas for things to do in Seattle!
48803	215882	10.0	9.0	47028891	Julie made me feel very welcome as soon as I arrived.  She was full of info and readily available if I had any questions. 
48804	215882	10.0	9.0	47692932	Thank you, Julie for a wonderful stay at your cottage. The cottage is very peaceful, light and relaxing - everything you'd want while on vacation. The hot tub was also great to relax in after a long day of walking around Seattle. I'd definitely stay at this cottage again! 
48805	215882	10.0	9.0	48291383	We had a fantastic time staying at Julie's cottage! She was very helpful and had great recommendations of places to go and eat. Within walking distance of some cute shops, restaurants, parks and the light rail which can take you into downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying here and would love to again in the future!
48806	215882	10.0	9.0	48891426	"Julie was a wonderful hostess! The adorable cottage was cozy and had everything we needed. The hot tub was very relaxing and a wonderful way to end our day.

Julie was so thoughtful and uber helpful. She alerted us of traffic the morning on our departure. :)

The location is also wonderful! So close to Rainier shops and restaurants. We'll definitely be staying at the cottage should we visit Seattle again!

Thank you Julie!"
48807	215882	10.0	9.0	49219941	We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle and Julie's cottage was perfect ‚Äî very close to every place we wanted to visit but far enough away that we could get some quiet R&R. Loved coming back to the cottage after hiking or exploring the city. Thanks Julie!
48808	215882	10.0	9.0	50451078	Julie's Garden Cottage was great.  It's located in a nice, quiet neighborhood, and it's a short drive downtown.  We enjoyed our stay.  Julie was pleasant and quick to respond to questions.  
48809	215882	10.0	9.0	52780490	nice host  .had a good time 
48810	215882	10.0	9.0	53118247	Excellent stay, loved the place. Didn't get to spend anytime in the hot tub, but will definitely see if Julie's place is available again on a future stay. 
48811	215882	10.0	9.0	53596187	Julie was fantastic, easy to get ahold of and very respectful. The cottage was absolutely adorable and was everything I expected and more. I took my partner who I proposed to on this trip and had a blast in the city. This location makes getting anywhere in the Seattle metro area a breeze and the atmosphere Julie set up is perfect for a cute romantic get away. The weather was not the best but we did mange to get a little hot tub time in the rain which was a lot of fun. Also want to note, my partner and I are pretty big guys, both 6'4 and around 280lbs, and this place was super comfortable. Overall I highly recommend this listing and plan on booking again come the time. 
48812	215882	10.0	9.0	54361237	Julie was a great communicator and friendly host.  The property is exactly as described.  She made sure I found my way and that I had everything I needed for the duration of my stay.  Nothing but positive things to say... 
48813	215882	10.0	9.0	56369139	Julie‚Äôs cottage is a nice, clean, peaceful, well-appointed place to stay.  At first we thought it would be small, but it is so well thought out that it fit us perfectly.  It was bright and airy, even on a weekend that lived up to Seattle‚Äôs reputation for rainy weather.  It‚Äôs well built and cozy on chilly nights, and the hot tub is only a few steps outside the door.  The neighborhood has some funky, fun restaurants and a small-town feel, even though it‚Äôs only a short drive from downtown.  We really enjoyed our time at Julie‚Äôs place, and would not hesitate to recommend it to couples traveling to the area.  
49236	2721575	10.0	9.0	12868544	Debbie was wonderful and the apartment was a perfect, quiet getaway! Will definitely stay there in the future! 
49237	2721575	10.0	9.0	13109151	The apt was wonderful. Very clean and comfortable. Debbie is an awesome host. We didn't meet but she checked in from time to time to see if all was ok and whether I needed anything. She thought of every little necessities i.e. shampoo, coffee, creamer & soap. I felt my privacy was respected. 
49238	2721575	10.0	9.0	13377921	"Debbie was a terrific host! She checked in a couple of times to make sure we had what was needed. We'll definitely stay again next time we are in Seattle.
Great location, easy parking, nice host!"
49239	2721575	10.0	9.0	13552146	Staying in the Columbia City Apartment was the best decision we could have made for our house hunting trip to Seattle. It is close to downtown and in a beautiful neighborhood. Good food and sight seeing attractions were easily accessible. And our host was gracious and thoughtful. Debbie was an absolute joy! We would have never gone back to reality, given an option. 
49240	2721575	10.0	9.0	13692850	Debbie's apartment is wonderful!  It's well decorated, spacious, and clean.  It's also located very close to some great amenities, including the Columbia City strip and a couple of big parks.  The light rail is fairly close as well.  Debbie made check-in and check-out very easy, and also checked in after the first night to make sure everything was OK.  I highly recommend this great apartment for visiting family or anyone looking to get a great Seattle experience.  With the light rail fairly close, much of Seattle is just a short walk away (downtown, pike market, stadiums, airport, etc).
49241	2721575	10.0	9.0	14453945	I had a very positive experience with Airbnb and with my hostess, Debbie. She was very prompt with information and helpful with all the details as well. The apt is very quiet and neat as a pin. The decor is comfortable with everything one might need for their stay. The neighborhood of Columbia City is a favorite and has the best farmer's market on Wed and great restaurants. Having beautiful Seward Park and Lake Washington in the back yard was nice too.
49242	2721575	10.0	9.0	14617311	Debbie was a wonderful host!! I couldn't have asked for a better experience. She went out of her way to make the stay comfortable, even cooked dinner one evening and invited me to join.  The location of this apartment is perfect - about a 15 dollar cab ride to downtown and walking distance to many shops, restaurants  and the light rail in Columbia City! During the week there was a farmers market. Lake Washington with views of Mt. Rainier was a short walk as well.  The apartment itself was meticulous and spacious. I felt like I was staying at a friends house. I will be back to Seattle again and I wouldn't stay any where else! 
49243	2721575	10.0	9.0	14873075	We had a wonderful time in Seattle, and we were so glad we stayed in this AirBnB. It was spacious and so clean! The (king size) bed was heavenly. The kitchen had everything you need to make meals, which we did twice a day. There are bus stops and grocery stores, parks and a movie theater within walking distance. There was even a closet in the bedroom, so we unpacked for the week. This place has all the little things necessary for a very comfortable stay. We never met Debbie but she checked in to see if we needed anything. We will definitely recommend this place to everyone we know.
49244	2721575	10.0	9.0	14985905	"Debbie was extremely communicative from when I booked the apartment. She was helpful and friendly throughout before and during my visit.

I enjoyed my stay as the apartment is in a great neighborhood with views of Lake Washington and of downtown Seattle. 

The apartment was comfortable, although head's up on the low ceiling. All in all, I would stay here again and I absolutely would rent a room/apartment again from Debbie. "
49245	2721575	10.0	9.0	15358205	This was our first experience with an AirBnB booking. Debbie's apartment was easy to find, off street parking, quiet neighborhood. It is a basement apartment, which was very nicely finished. The only problem we had was the low ceilings vs. my husband's height. We had everything we needed, and more. I would recommend this listing.
49246	2721575	10.0	9.0	15679352	"I had a wonderful 4-night stay at Debbie's apartment. The photos were accurate - the place was spacious, comfortable, and very clean. Loved the king bed and huge closet. It's a basement apartment, but the windows let in so much light you'd hardly know it. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything you'd need to cook for yourself - but honestly we never did with all the fantastic restaurants nearby. 

Debbie was the perfect host. Friendly, communicative, and offered recommendations for what to do during our stay. I would definitely return here in a heartbeat! "
49247	2721575	10.0	9.0	15837552	"Debbie was such a gracious host!  The house is so Cute and Artsy (;lot's of treasure throughout)  Surpise greeting was an amazing book and home movie collection!

Please venture out and see Columbia City!! It's diverse, fun, and funky! 

Light rail is not too far away- while walking stop and smell the roses-- Lot's of interesting neighboring homes with nice gardens (some with with large sunflowers), organic vegetables, and cleverly designed one of a kind homes! 

The bed and sofa was ""ah"" so comfortable!

I loved the added touches Debbie provided!

49248	2721575	10.0	9.0	16070440	The reservation was canceled 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
49249	2721575	10.0	9.0	16296140	Debbie was very accommodating.   The mattress was a little too firm for my osteoarthritis and when Debbie found this out, she brought two extra soft pillows to see if that would help.  The apartment looked like the pictures online.  Debbie has the kitchen stocked with all the items needed to do light cooking.  The place was clean and well mantained.  The apartment does not have cable, but a variety of dvd's were available in the apartment to watch.  The apartment was very convenient in using the light rail to downtown Seattle.  Just a few blocks from the apartment were local restuarants.  It was very nice having an off street parking spot.  
49250	2721575	10.0	9.0	16433351	Very enjoyable stay! Our flight arrived late evening & Deb gave us excellent directions. Approx 15min cab from airport ran about $30... 12min Uber to downtown ran $14. The space was cozy basement with lots of natural light. the king sized bed was comfortable and the bedroom had small nook area for yoga in AMs.. ceiling is very low in areas. The neighborhood was great for walking with parks and waterfronts to enjoy. Never had been to Seattle we figured we could grab a late night dinner in the neighborhood on a Thursday but most places closed between 9-10.. (probably different on weekends?). Great stay!
49251	2721575	10.0	9.0	16832058	My husband and I spent a week at Debbie's place to have a remote working vacation. We loved staying there. She was super helpful with tips on what to do in the area and how to get around. She also made sure we had reliable internet connectivity throughout the week. Her apartment was clean and spacious and had exactly what we needed. I was especially impressed with how well-appointed the kitchen was. The neighborhood is great, too. Just a short walk to the main street of Columbia City. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area.
49252	2721575	10.0	9.0	17100844	"Of our five airbnb experiences thus far, Debbie's was clearly the most prepared and thought-out. Without exaggeration, she had thought of everything needed to make our stay in Seattle enjoyable and worthwhile--from coffee beans, grinder, and French press, to a fully equipped kitchen, to reading material as well as DVDs, and to a nicely organized binder with maps, things to see in Seattle, information about the  main street of Columbia City with its many shops and restaurants, and instructions about the apartment.
      All this was most helpful, as we had only brief personal contact with Debbie, a contact that confirmed the conscientious, flexible and most pleasant person we had imagined Debbie to be through our frequent and rapid e-mail exchanges.   
     The apartment is unbelievably spacious, private, and very comfortable. It has been meticulously designed and furnished. As a half-submerged basement apartment, it does still lack some natural light and, as one other reviewer noted, can present some problems for quite tall people (by my estimation, those 6'5"" and taller) with its lower ceilings. As an older couple who has some difficulty negotiating hills, we were thankful that we had a rental car at our disposal, since the apartment is located in a quite hilly section of Seattle. This is probably not the ideal location for anyone who has problems walking up and down hills, but Seattle itself was, to our surprise, also quite hilly. 
    In sum, however, a delightful place hosted by a delightful person! We recommend Debbie's apartment with great enthusiasm, especially for those under 60 and 6'5""!"
49253	2721575	10.0	9.0	17350668	Debbie was great, very welcoming.  It's almost like you are staying in a Bed and Breakfast.  Coffee, tea, KIND bars and chocolates left for you.  There is even a view of the city from the bedroom window.  Also it stayed nice and cool with minimal help from a fan.
49254	2721575	10.0	9.0	17766699	"Stayed here for two nights. Debbie was a welcoming and accommodating host. The room was comfortable and well appointed. Everything was provided that a traveler would need and then some (iron/ironing board, q-tips, blow dryer, kitchen supplies, French press, coffee bean grinder etc). We loved the location and Columbia city. Many caf√©s and shops are within walking distance as long as you don't mind some hills. Parking was never a problem. Only thing we wish travelers to note is that this is a basement apartment with low ceilings. My husband is 6'5"" and had to duck most of the time but this obviously won't be a concern for most people. Nevertheless we would definitely stay again. "
49255	2721575	10.0	9.0	17947168	"We've had a wonderful stay at Debbie's apartment. The place was very clean, tastefully decorated, well equipped with all of the necessities. The bed was very comfortable. Parking in the driveway and private entrance with coded lock was a plus, we didn't have to worry about loosing keys or locking ourselves out. Debbie was a very attentive but not intrusive hostess.  She was available by text to answer any of our questions and it was very easy to communicate with her. We would definitely stay with Debbie again. Thank you Debbie. 
Lilla & Steven "
49256	2721575	10.0	9.0	19384682	"Debbie was a fantastic host, who thought of every possible detail to make our stay as comfortable as possible: Full stocked bathroom and kitchen, local guides and restaurant menus, books, DVDs, iron with board, and so much more. Beyond the apartment itself, I was most impressed with Debbie's proactive communication via text and email. I was never in doubt or had any questions because of how thorough she was. 

Debbie, thank you very much for making our first Airbnb experience such a pleasant and memorable one!"
49257	2721575	10.0	9.0	19523347	"We had the pleasure of staying with Debbie for a weekend. The apartment is so well-kept and charming, and very spacious for 2 people. It was very easy to communicate with Debbie beforehand and during our visit. I knew exactly what to expect when we arrived, and she let us check in early to leave our bags, which was so helpful. 

The house is in a wonderful neighborhood, just a few blocks from restaurants, coffee shops, a movie theater and more. Plus, it is within walking distance of the light rail, which made it very easy to get there from the airport. 

All in all, we loved staying here and felt like we got a more ""local"" experience than just booking  a hotel. We also appreciated the little treats that Debbie left for us! If we are ever in Seattle again, this will be our first choice."
49258	2721575	10.0	9.0	20832584	We loved Debbie's Colombia city apartment! The place was really cute and cozy, and had everything we needed. It was just a 5 minute walk to the main street in Colombia which had some great restaurants and we loved the Colombia City Bakery! And the light rail was an easy 10 minute walk from the house and was super convenient to get around on, and go downtown. Debbie was super helpful, and easy contacted by text. We would definitely stay here again! 
49259	2721575	10.0	9.0	21763745	"Debbie was an absolute gem and made our brief stay VERY easy! Check in/check out was flexible and her apartment was perfect. Seriously...when I say perfect, it was the right size and cozy for the two of us traveling. She gave us plenty of space, but also kept tabs to make sure we arrived safely and had no issues.

Two added pluses: Parking available in the front/or separate driveway and easy access/egress with lock.

Combined with price and good location, this would be a place we highly recommend.

Thanks, Dave and Dennis"
49260	2721575	10.0	9.0	22036074	Debbie's place was fantastic! She was very welcoming and texted us to provide all of the pertinent details a few days prior to our stay.  She also provided a detailed booklet with information about Columbia City and how to get around the area, as her place is about 15 min from downtown.  We loved her DVD (The Big Lebowski!) and book collection.  We also appreciated how well-appointed the accommodations were.  Extra towels and blankets, coffee, breakfast items, and even q-tips were thoughtfully provided.  Definitely recommend this while visiting Seattle and would love to stay here again - Debbie created a perfect AirBnB experience!
49261	2721575	10.0	9.0	22523723	"Great space (bigger than it looked in photos) and a welcoming host. What more could you ask for? 

Debbie was very responsive via text, and we didn't have any problems with the space. Private entrance made the whole stay feel very, well, private. 

Recommended. "
49262	2721575	10.0	9.0	22680612	"What a wonderful place to stay! So comfortable, so beautiful, so convenient, and such easy logistics with a gracious host. We never met Debbie in person, but her texts were thorough, timely, and conscientious. She took great care of us and made everything easy.

Our visit was too short, with only 2 nights on a trip home to Seattle for a job interview and to visit family and friends. As others have noted, everything you need is here. It is so spacious, especially the near-palatial bedroom with its large ""changing room"" area and full-size closet. And the bed! So big! So comfortable!

We loved the earth-tones color-scheme and art and artifacts used in the decor. Note that the floors are concrete, so bring your slippers or your house socks if coming in the colder months. The cadet wall heaters do a great job keeping the space warm, and it probably stays deliciously cool in the warmer months.

If you require a dining table, you won't have one here. That didn't bother us: we like cozy meals on the sofa anyway, and the breakfast bar stools are there, too. Both of us are under 6'/2m tall, so we hardly noticed the low-ish ceilings. The windows are well-placed to let pleasant daylight in, too, as you can see in the photos.

We loved the neighborhood--Columbia City is so much fun to explore. Easy to do on foot, and connect with all the good transit nearby. Having the dedicated off-street parking space was a big bonus, especially on a steeply sloping street.

Not too surprisingly for a basement apartment, where it's hard for signals to reach, the wi-fi was a bit slow and sometimes dropped signal for us. Debbie generously offered to let us come upstairs into her home for a stronger signal, but our visit was brief and jam-packed so we were OK.

Thanks, Debbie, for everything! We hope to be back! "
49263	2721575	10.0	9.0	23236603	Although we never met Debbie, she came across as a very kind and hospitable lady who was always checking in to see if everything was ok during our stay. My friend got sick whilst we were staying at Debbie's place and it was so comforting to know that she had somewhere so homely and comfortable to recuperate. Debbie's place was immaculately clean, very tastefully and nicely decorated and conveniently situated to transport links. We had a lovely stay in Debbie's apartment and thoroughly recommend it! 
49264	2721575	10.0	9.0	23317793	"We were e-welcomed by Debbie McGibbon throughout the entire process...when arranging to stay at her airbnb location.  The description was accurate and accommodations lived up to all that we envisioned and hoped for.  
I didn't personally get a chance to meet Debbie, but this in no way effected our stay;  her professionalism in replying to each inquiry was quick and very helpful.  She was also very friendly in our correspondence, which is encouraging when travelers [us] aren't sure what to expect.  "
49265	2721575	10.0	9.0	24330394	"My mom stayed at Debbie's over Christmas, and we both thought it was delightful. It's a spacious, clean, one-bedroom unit and very tastefully appointed with everything necessary for a cozy stay--a comfy living room with a supply of books and DVDs, and a kitchen stocked with coffee, milk, and fizzy water. You could cook full meals here if you wanted to. The location is also great, about a five minute walk from the area around Columbia City's main strip, where there are some excellent restaurants (try La Medusa), cafes (try Empire), a great butcher and a great bakery, a yoga studio, and a movie theater. Highly recommended.
"
49266	2721575	10.0	9.0	25306457	Great apartment, tastefully and comfortably furnished. Very attentive and friendly host. Fabulous neighborhood.
49267	2721575	10.0	9.0	25572669	Very cozy and welcoming! Perfect for a weekend getaway. It's location is so nice. Super close to some great shops and restaurants- you can't stay there without going to Tutta Bella! Debbie is such an accommodating host!! 
49268	2721575	10.0	9.0	26247731	Debbie was warm and welcoming. Since no one was arriving for a stay the next day she offered us a later check-out time. The apartment is clean, quiet and cozy. The bed is very comfortable. We liked the location because it is close to where our daughter and family live and also close to our favorite restaurant: Geraldine's. We hope to stay here again on our future visits to Seattle.
49269	2721575	10.0	9.0	27764408	"Yes,  this is a complete  one bedroom basement apartment{  with windows}>   The kingsize bed has a wonderful mattress and the closet space and ""dressing room""  is awesome.   It is very quiet apartment even though it is in a bustling community on bustling street.  There is an off-street parking place  right in front of the apartment.   It takes some practice getting the skill and
courage to back out of the parking space because  street parking is dense  and you cannot see oncoming traffic.  You will not find a better equipped apartment or a roomier  one,  I don't believe.

49270	2721575	10.0	9.0	28197546	Very clean apartment. Debbie was a great host and accommodated our late arrival. 
49271	2721575	10.0	9.0	28356662	"We had an absolutely fantastic weekend relaxing in Debbie's place! It's exactly as pictured, if not cuter. Debbie clearly has the gift of hospitality. There wasn't a single touch missing. We felt very much ""at home"".  Clean, tastefully decorated and really welcoming. I can't say enough about how nice her apartment is. Did I mention the King size bed? Awesome, I slept like a baby!  High recommended! Would definitely there stay again! Thanks Debbie :)"
49272	2721575	10.0	9.0	28964647	The place was very comfortable in a safe and popular location. The layout was bigger than I expected and very clean. I would recommend.
49273	2721575	10.0	9.0	29403441	This was a perfect location for us to walk to our family members' house in Columbia City.  It is very tastefully decorated and the bed is super comfortable. There was everything we needed in the kitchen and snacks were provided in the refrigerator.  There was also a good selection of tea and coffee.  Debbie was very quick to respond to communications, and the number-pad key mechanism made access to the apartment very simple.  
49274	2721575	10.0	9.0	30198191	We have stayed with Debbie before. She is very warm and welcoming and has a detailed notebook about the area. We appreciate the privacy, the quiet, and the comfortable bed. Our favorite restaurant, Geraldine's, is within easy walking distance as are many other restaurants. Debbie is always available if we have a question.
49275	2721575	10.0	9.0	30842473	"My husband, our toddler and I celebrated my birthday weekend here and are already planning a return trip! Debbie was a gracious and welcoming host and respected our privacy. She was quick to respond to texts and even let us stay a little later since she didn't have a guest staying the night we checked out. We appreciated the welcome/information notebook with menus and info of the neighborhood. 

The apartment was beyond our expectations - very clean, very spacious, cozy, well-lit and the decor is beautiful. The kitchen was well stocked with cookware, cooking utensils, leftover containers and even Ziploc bags and foil/cling-wrap. The bed-sheets and towels smelled fresh and were soft and clean. There was ample storage and wardrobe space, with a separate little private area in the bedroom to get dressed. The off-street parking was very convenient as well. The neighborhood is quiet and the houses are adorable and well-kept. We felt safe and right at home!

This location is situated a short 5 minute walk to a large park equipped with a toddler-friendly playground, and a 10 minute walk along a nature trail to Lake Washington. Columbia City main street is another 5-10 minute walk, here we enjoyed (and highly recommend) Geraldine's Counter and Empire Espresso Bar. It took us about 15 minutes to drive downtown and to the aquarium."
49276	2721575	10.0	9.0	32458579	Debbie always makes us feel welcome. She is friendly and always checks in to make sure we have what we need. We enjoy this apartment. It is clean, quiet, comfortable, and close to our favorite restaurant and close to the light rail. Plus, Debbie has beautiful flowers in her yard.
49277	2721575	10.0	9.0	32810667	We had a great first Airbnb experience. The basement apartment was very comfortable and nicely furnished. Debbie is a wonderful host and went above & beyond to make sure we had a comfortable stay. The apartment is conveniently located and within walking distance to restaurants, shops, parks & Lake Washington. It was an easy drive into the city and it was refreshing to retreat back to the apartment. 
49278	2721575	10.0	9.0	33103787	Debbie was fantastic, as was her apartment. The place is very clean and you can tell has been designed and renovated carefully with lots of great attention to detail. Couldn't have asked for better, and the location is great. Debbie herself was very helpful and communication was perfect. I'd recommend to anyone!
49279	2721575	10.0	9.0	34156620	Debbie was a great host!  She kept in touch before and during our stay and made sure we had everything we needed.  The apartment was so adorable!  The keyless entry was convenient.  The kitchen was well equipped and stocked with snacks, coffee and tea.  The living room was cozy and comfortable and have library of DVDs and books.  But the best part must be the memory foam king sized bed! It was so comfortable, you might not want to leave!  She also provided us with off street parking when we had the rental car.  For those commuting, the bus stop is less than 10 minutes downhill walk from the apartment.  Although someone taller might have an issue with the ceiling height, we didn't. This apartment was perfect for us (shorter people)!
49280	2721575	10.0	9.0	34721685	"We had a fantastic stay in the Columbia City Apartment! Debbie was a wonderful host and we felt right at home. The apartment itself is well decorated and cozy, and includes all of the conveniences you will need while visiting Seattle. The location is excellent, with easy access to all of the big attractions downtown and lots of great local restaurants in the Columbia City area.

We did an enormous amount of walking in Seattle, and our evenings in the apartment were very relaxing at the end of each day. We don't have a single negative thing to say about it! We're looking forward to coming back.

49282	2721575	10.0	9.0	35814038	Debbie's apartment worked very well for our short stay there. It was very clean and has a large and comfortable bed. It is centrally located to the area and has a good selection of restaurants nearby in particular an excellent bakery where we had breakfast each morning. 
49283	2721575	10.0	9.0	36136793	"This ""English Basement"" apartment is conveniently located between Sea-Tac airport and Seattle, making it very convenient to both and easy for visiting Seattle. Debbie's attentive directions made it easy for us to find and get into at 4:30 am after delayed flights and missed connections from the East Coast. The space was very cute, well appointed and Debbie made us feel welcome. It was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Since we rented a car at the airport, we did not negotiate public transportation. Driving in, out of and around the City was easy."
49284	2721575	10.0	9.0	36362254	"We can't wait to return to Debbie's apartment and have already referred it to friends. While Seattle was experiencing a very hot spell, we were comfortable and cool. 
The furnishings are lovely and Debbie is a gracious host."
49285	2721575	10.0	9.0	36957044	I had a great experience, Debbie is responsive and very communicative. The apartment is fresh, clean and inviting, I will stay again!
49286	2721575	10.0	9.0	37191641	Debbie's apartment was clean, cute and cosy! The pictures online represent the place accurately and I had no complaints. There were extra towels in a cabinet if needed and she also provided some protein bars and nice cold bottled water, which was a kind gesture. There's also a nice selection of books and movies to choose from if you wish. The bus stop to downtown  is about a 5-8min walk and takes less than 30 mins to get to downtown. Although I did not meet Debbie in person, she kept in contact through text to make sure everything was okay. Overall very satisfied and happy with our stay! Thanks Debbie! 
49287	2721575	10.0	9.0	38126229	"Our stay was wonderful! The house is in a quiet neighborhood, close to the city. The apartment had easy private entry, easy parking, was wonderfully clean, and all the amenities you could want. 
 
The bed was super comfy and the neighborhood was quiet which allowed for great sleeping. 

This is the perfect comfy and cozy sat in Seattle.

Debbie was wonderful!"
49288	2721575	10.0	9.0	38865463	Our experience at Debbie‚Äôs place was fantastic from start to finish. The apartment exceeded our expectations, being beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable, with an eye for aesthetics and attention to detail evident throughout. Checking in was as easy as it gets, with Debbie providing information about accessing the unit well before our arrival and being very responsive to our communications throughout. Debbie left a comprehensive set of menus for local restaurants, and made herself available to provide recommendations about places to eat and things to do. Being near a Link metro station made Debbie‚Äôs place a great location to explore Seattle, and having amazing restaurants close by made for nice transitions to and from the larger city itself. Should we need a place to stay in Seattle again, Debbie‚Äôs place will be at the top of our list.
49289	2721575	10.0	9.0	39151684	Debbie's apartment is a favorite of ours in Columbia City. Love the decor, it's quiet and a great place to relax and return to at the end of a busy day with family. Hope to return often.
49290	2721575	10.0	9.0	39487862	I had the opportunity to spend 4 weeks at Debbie's place in July as I used it for temporary corporate housing.  First off, since it's a partial basement apartment it stayed nice and cool which was such a relief in an unexpectedly hot Seattle summer.  The apartment is quite spacious and the impeccably clean.  The kitchen is well outfitted, and all the furniture quite nice and very comfortable.  Debbie lives upstairs, but I never heard a thing.  There was a little difficulty with the Wifi in week 3, but she got a new service and by week 4 it was working perfectly.  She was great with texts to stay in touch and was super helpful.  I would highly recommend Debbie's place if you're looking for a good location with a great little apartment. 
49291	2721575	10.0	9.0	39831313	"Debbie was great and I loved this apt!  Beautiful neighborhood and fairly close to food and link train.

"
49292	2721575	10.0	9.0	41328418	Debbie's little apartment was perfect, everything we needed was there. The neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet. Debbie was also a great host, she answered any questions that I had right away. There was more than enough supplies inside the apartment and everything was pretty much accurate as to what you see on the pictures. I recommend her airbnb apartment to anyone who is interested! 
49293	2721575	10.0	9.0	42523529	"Our stay here was wonderful in every way. The place is exactly as listed and decorated in a charming way that made us feel at home and comfortable. The kitchen has everything needed and then some. Debbie was responsive to questions that we had, friendly and helpful. I can not say enough about her perfect blend of helpfulness and professional attitude. Thank you, Debbie! 

The location was perfectly situated for us, outside the city center but close enough to get there within a few minutes. The neighborhood has a charming historical center as well with some great restaurant and cafe choices. 

We would absolutely recommend this place, and Debbie as a host, to anyone at any time. And we will!
"
49294	2721575	10.0	9.0	43357439	Debbie was a fantastic host. She left thoughtful recommendations and the apartment has everything a hotel can offer plus more! We loved the neighborhood and downtown was a short uber or light rail ride away. I'd highly recommend this for a Seattle visit!
49295	2721575	10.0	9.0	43652051	My daughter and I stayed two nights at Debbie's apartment in Columbia City (Seattle) Washington.  The apartment was clean and very comfortable, especially the king mattress!  We spent most of our time in downtown Seattle sightseeing but also discovered breakfast ---coffee shops, bakeries and restaurants--- were definitely a short walk away.  Debbie was excellent in keeping me informed prior to my stay and making herself accessible by text should we have questions.  I would highly recommend the apartment!
49296	2721575	10.0	9.0	44445911	"The place was great, the city is awesome, and the weather was perfect!  The location and cleanliness of the apartment was the best part.  It's a very nice and cozy spot perfect for a couple.  Me and my wife really enjoyed the place and the provided toiletries and chocolates were a plus!  Didn't get to meet Debbie because of how busy me and my wife were but we were in contact with her the entire time.  She would respond within minutes and is very polite!  Would love to stay here again if we take another Seattle trip.
Thanks Debbie!!"
49297	2721575	10.0	9.0	44902935	My sister and I stayed at Debbie's apartment for a long weekend trip to Seattle.  We spent most of our time out and about exploring but the apartment was well situated for our trip. It has all the amenities, very spacious, and nicely decorated. It's just a few blocks from shops and restaurants in Columbia City, the light rail, and an awesome market called the PCC. Debbie was easy to contact via text and made sure that we were settled. We had a wonderful time!
49298	2721575	10.0	9.0	45947547	Debbie was great!  I only met her once, and she was very nice (again sorry for my friend waking up so early).  She was very attentive and kept in touch during our stay to make sure we were ok.  The neighborhood was great, close to restaurants and grocery stores.  The area is very quiet.  I am keeping this listing contact information for future trips.
49299	2721575	10.0	9.0	47268952	Clean, pleasant, very nice. Felt safe and secure
49300	2721575	10.0	9.0	47733721	"Staying at Debbie's place was wonderful. Location very convenient, walking distance to shopping and restaurants and very close to downtown.  Debbie made us feel very welcome and promptly responded to any questions or concerns. Columbia City is a great place to be, very diverse.  If we visit again, we will definitely stay at Debbie's place.
"
49301	2721575	10.0	9.0	48510922	We have stayed with Debbie several times. We sleep so well when we stay there! The bed is comfy and the neighborhood is very quiet. It's an easy walk to the light rail and also to our favorite restaurant, Geraldine's. Debbie is very pleasant and lovely to work with. We look forward to our next stay with her.
49302	2721575	10.0	9.0	48954460	"My best friend and I took a road trip to Seattle, and we couldn't have been happier with the accommodations! After a long day of driving we were so happy to be welcomed with hot tea, Pellegrino, and a room full of dvd's and great books. The apartment was beautiful and comfy; the size was much larger than expected. 

I will say, however, that while the apartment was perfect height for both me and my friend (we are 5'2""), the ceilings are really low and would most likely be problematic (and/or claustrophobic) for anyone over 5'8"". 

I would 100% recommend this listing to anyone staying in Seattle!

"
49303	2721575	10.0	9.0	49113352	"Awesome place to stay! Very accommodating and very clean! We would definitely stay here again. Debbie was a great host!
"
49304	2721575	10.0	9.0	49897372	We had a great time at Debbie's apartment. It was super clean and neat and had everything we needed-including yummy artisan chocolates waiting for us on our arrival. The apartment itself is charming and comfortable. Debbie is very organized. She contacted us by text message prior to our arrival with check in information and again the evening before we left-offering us a later checkout time. The neighborhood is great (and convenient to public transportation). We had a rental car on this trip and street parking was always available in front of the apartment. We will definitely stay at Debbie's again-although I suspect we will have to book well in advance as word gets out that this is a great place to stay!
49305	2721575	10.0	9.0	51127245	Debbie was very warm, friendly, and welcoming. She went above and beyond. The apartment was beautifully decorated, spacious and clean. There was a welcome binder with local shops listed and restaurant menus  so we could better experience Columbia City.  Debbie accommodated us flying in the afternoon with the code and how to park since she could not be there right when we arrived. We were able to meet her our first day. Debbie was so sweet and helped us find a place for dinner. She was available via text if we needed anything like Seattle suggestions to B&B needs. We were very comfortable with blankets and towels, etc. The apartment had a full kitchen and everything we needed for cooking too. This was the best first Air B&B experience!
49306	2721575	10.0	9.0	53977026	the apartment was clean, comfortable, and very nicely furnished! we only stayed for two nights but would happily have stayed longer in comfort. i slept incredibly well on the bed. i also loved how the host thoughtfully provided whole coffee beans and a grinder to go with the french press. thank you debbie! 
49307	2721575	10.0	9.0	54488403	Debbie was extremely responsive and communicative. I booked last minute and she made the entire process so easy. Her place in Columbia City is perfectly located, comfortable and well priced. I would recommend staying with Debbie to anyone looking to experience the best Seattle has to offer... 
49308	2721575	10.0	9.0	54631819	It was a fantastic location for what we had planned...very convenient to park the car in the off-street parking spot, walk down to the 'village' of Columbia City and have a meal, go shopping, and check out the music at Columbia City Theater and the Royal Room. The apartment was clean and tatefully decorated, the kitchen was stocked with coffee, and the bed was super comfortable! The ceilings are definitely low and there isn't a lot of window action so you do feel like you're in a basement suite but the location and the comfy bed make up for that. 
49309	2721575	10.0	9.0	55362594	"
Great space. Very gracious, accommodating and attentive host. Fabulous neighborhood. Highly recommend."
49310	2721575	10.0	9.0	56376821	We have stayed with Debbie several times. She is always friendly and welcoming. She contacts us prior to arrival, while we are there, and when we leave. We've always enjoyed our stay and have no complaints at all.
49311	2721575	10.0	9.0	57243877	We were very comfortable in Debbie's cozy and beautifully decorated apartment, where she made us feel very welcome. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting our host, but she was in close communication and even offered us a late checkout. The king-size bed was excellent sleeping, the kitchen and bathroom included all the necessities and many extra niceties, and there was a generous closet in the bedroom. Her color choices and art objects were well chosen and enjoyable without being intrusive. Our stay was peaceful and quiet with complete privacy, though Debbie was right upstairs. We have already booked a second stay!
49312	2721575	10.0	9.0	57633625	"Debbie stayed in touch w/me all along the way...when booking and during our stay.  To sum the experience up, Debbie goes above & beyond.  We love staying at her place....all the amenities are as advertised:  roomy, comfortable, a very comfortable bed (I wish were my own!), full kitchen, tv, and so forth.  Thank you, Debbie ~ you've taken our initial hesitation out of the mix.  The entire process and stay...seamless and terrific!

49522	4922836	10.0	9.0	28355342	Andrew's place was great and beautiful; very spacious. Andrew was such a great and helpful host, my husband and I had a great time staying at his place. We recommend staying at Andrew's place. He gives you your privacy. If we return to Seattle, we will most definitely be back to Andrew's place. His place is also very conveniently located to the Link light rail station which made it easy to get around in Seattle.
49523	4922836	10.0	9.0	29475672	My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience staying with Andrew. His apartment is beautiful, spacious, clean, and exactly as pictured. It is conveniently located next to the train, which made it easy to get to and from the airport. As a host, Andrew replied to all messages very quickly, made accommodations for our check-in and check-out times,  and was very generous in making our stay feel comfortable - he even stocked the fridge with fresh produce for breakfast and snacks for us! We only interacted a couple of times due to our schedule differences, but he was friendly and gave us privacy. We definitely recommend his place to all and would love to stay there again if we are ever in the area!
49524	4922836	10.0	9.0	31667099	"Andrew and his private room was what I was looking for. Andrew provided a pleasant and clean living quarters where I would be more than glad to return again. 
Andrew provided me with privacy and also time to communicate with him on the surrounding areas here in Seattle.
Andrew's neighborhood was near to everything to provide for any requirements that you would need. It was also close to downtown Seattle and where I had to be on business. 
Thanks for the great stay Andrew."

Andrew was a generous host. He had breakfast items available for us in the kitchen and his home was spacious and clean. The location is excellent, conveniently located next to the Light rail that takes you straight into downtown. This will save you a lot of time and money as parking in the city can get expensive. 

Thank you Andrew for hosting us in your home. We had a great stay! "
49526	4922836	10.0	9.0	32907303	Listing was as described. Bathroom was clean. Convenient location to bus and about a 10 minute walk to light rail that goes to downtown Seattle.

49528	4922836	10.0	9.0	34232321	The house is very clean. The location is good and not far from the SEA airport. Everything looks very new. The host is very nice. When we have problem to ask himÔºå he will response immediately.
49529	4922836	10.0	9.0	34872476	My wife and I stayed at Andrew's home for a week, and both of us can say that it was a great experience.  Andrew's home was conveniently located in Seattle, making travel time easy and the experience worthwhile.  Andrew was extremely accommodating with check-in/check-out times, and offered much knowledge about the city and what to do in it.   He was also very friendly, and respectful of privacy.  His space was just what we needed as we had access to the kitchen, washing machine/dryer, and own personal bathroom in the room. 
49530	4922836	10.0	9.0	35144109	This was our first time booking through Air BnB and Andrew definitely made it a great experience. His place was super clean and the neighborhood was very calm and easy to find. He was very accommodating and gave us a lot of advice in terms of events that were going on around us. Definitely recommend for future bookings. Oh and can't forget about that kitchen, very on point.
49531	4922836	10.0	9.0	35557934	This was our first time using AirBNB and the experience was great.  Andrew was very flexible with check in and out time as well as making himself available for questions or info on Seattle.   The neighborhood was in a safe location, close to the train and the bus stations which made traveling Seattle easy.  The house was very clean and accommodating.  The bed was almost to comfortable, smile.  We suggest Andrew get a coffee maker, but even then, Starbucks is only a 15 minute stroll through quant neighborhoods.  If we ever get to Seattle, we will certainly see if Andrew has any vacncy.  Thanks Andrew for a great experience.

49538	4922836	10.0	9.0	38399559	This was a great house, and exactly as described. It was within 10 minutes of the light rail, which made it very easy to go downtown or the airport. Columbia City itself has a nice downtown area if you wanted to spend the evening within walking distance. The room was a bit small, but clean and had a comfy bed. The en-suite bathroom was very nice, and the shower had great water pressure. Andrew was friendly and made us feel welcome.

I highly recommend staying at Andrew's!
49543	4922836	10.0	9.0	42834061	Andrew's place was our first Airbnb experience, and he set the bar high. Superb location, extremely clean home, comfortable bed and pillows, parking 20 feet from front door always available, safe neighborhood. Andrew told us about a cool little strip of restaurants and shops within walking distance (about 1 mile) from his house that we would not have known about if he had not made us aware of them.  I felt the price was a bargain for what we got. 
49544	4922836	10.0	9.0	43336595	Everything was just as described and pictured. Our schedules never crossed paths so we never met, but there was everything I needed there. I found some good spots to eat close by and had a comfortable home to relax and unwind at at the end of the day.
49545	4922836	10.0	9.0	44205058	Andrew provided everything he said he would! The neighborhood is comfortable and the room is within walking distance of public transit. Although he was often busy and out of the home, we were left wanting nothing.

His place was very clean and tidy and it was great having a private bathroom as it lent the space a nice blend of a well appointed hotel room, with all of the warmth of a private home. The small park area just outside the front door was a pleasant surprise as well.

With the lightrail lines being so close it was extraordinarily easy to get around - to get right into the heart of downtown only requires a short 5 minute walk to the nearest station and around 16 minutes to get downtown from there.

I would definitely recommend Andrew's place for anyone needing an excellent base to explore everything that the Seattle Metro area has to offer, but would enjoy a place to come back and relax at the end of the day."
49547	4922836	10.0	9.0	49924711	Andrew was the perfect host! The accommodations were all that I had hoped both in terms of amenities and location. The check-in/out process was seamless, and Andrew was easily accessible via mobile for any questions I had. A great stay!

We almost didn't want to leave after settling in, but when we finally did we found that downtown Seattle was just a short, pleasant drive away.

We rented a car and drove everywhere, but there is a lot of public transportation nearby (metro station just a few blocks away) that could have made things even easier.

I'm happy to give my highest possible recommendation to anyone planning to visit Seattle!"
49549	4922836	10.0	9.0	50799536	Andrew was responsive and accommodating, letting me stow my bike in his garage. The room is comfortable and the apartment is in a nice neighborhood, nearly adjacent to the light rail and within easy distance of good places to eat and drink.

I had told Michelle I was visiting friends so I knew the area okay, and she left me be for most of the weekend. She was always helpful and prompt when I texted her questions. The place itself - I could not have asked for a better one! It is right next to a great running/walking trail that runs along Lake Washington and a very safe neighborhood. Her dog was also the calmest dog I have ever met.
50081	6274351	10.0	10.0	35425702	Michelle 's home was comfortable and very nice. Michelle is a very nice and very helpful guiding me. She picked me up from dropping my car off to be shipped. Thank you for making my stay in Seattle so pleasant.

My stay at your place has been beyond my expectations. I feel blessed to have been your first guest. I loved the privacy, cute place you have set up here, full of love vibrations. The view and setting is amazing, only 3 minute walk for beautiful vieuw on Lake washington and much more. This place has real hosts, living from the heart and that's what touched me the most, and... Mehrit, i got so inspired by your stories of Ethiopia, you felt like a sister to me. All and only the best for you two. Marina"
50959	7956337	10.0	9.0	57177013	We really enjoyed our stay in this room and house. Mehrit is really nice host, she advised us what to see and even gave us a ride. Airbnb place including kitchen and bathroom is really nice and clean. We couldnt choose better place in Seattle.

heads up rules are strict for no friends over, you have to put them on your air b n b list , which can be very expensive. "
51357	3258213	10.0	9.0	15775255	"Donna was kind and considerate. Our long vacation got to be too much and we just wanted to move in a day early. She was quick to accommodate. Thank you! 

About the house... The photos are a great representation of the home. It was warm and inviting. It was also very clean. The beds were comfortable and Donna left us plenty of information to enjoy the kayaks at the very close lake! Also, there are a lot of great places to eat nearby with full kitchen facilities.

The washer and dryer were a great addition to our vacation. We did bring quite a bit of clothes and other things with us, but it was great to have the w/d close to leave with all of our clothes clean.

I highly recommend this home if you are looking for a centrally located place to call home for a little while. We stayed here for 15 days and we were very sad to leave.

Parking was never a problem. There was plenty just read the signs because there is a school bus area with earlier hours.

We just can't thank Donna enough for making us feel welcome during our first days of living in Seattle!"
51358	3258213	10.0	9.0	16140438	"We spent a marvelous 3 days in Donna's house in Seattle.
The location is perfect for ""the museum of flight"" or an incredible helicopter tour with Pacific Northwest Helicopter or for kayaking on the lake.
Access to downtown Seattle is easy with the I-5.

The house is nestled on top of a hill with a nice garden in the back (we saw hummingbirds and a Jeller's jay).
We specially enjoyed the wide terrace in the back in the house.
The rooms are big and welcoming.

Of course the kayaks are a major bonus, we went on the nearby lake and had a wonderful time (the waters are very quiet).

Donna went out of her way to make our stay memorable (kudos for the fresh raspberries from the garden when we arrived).

We will definitely try to stay there next time we are in the area and recommend the house to our friends ."
51359	3258213	10.0	9.0	17973051	"Donna is such an awesome lady who made our 5 days trip in Seattle. Donna's house is just like a house in fairytales, which is so adorable and so nice. You don'y need to worry about the transportation even if you don'd drive. Because it's so convenient to take bus number 7 to go out. You just need to walk 5 mins to go to the bus station from her house. Nothing is better than have such a great staying experience with this reasonable price. What is more important is you will get to know this awesome lady---Donna!!!
By the way, Cassie is totally recovered now. Thank you again for your care and help, and don't need to worry about her. We miss you so much!!!! We love you! Hope your life will treat you well just like how well you treat it. Have great days. "
51360	3258213	10.0	9.0	18495145	Donna, our host was excellent. From my very first interactions with her, she was more then willing to share information and helpful tips with me about the area of Seattle in relation to her home. She picked us up from the airport and even let us stop on the way to her home, at the grocery. All this was a tremendous help to us and made our travel  much easier. She gave us helpful directions to different places we wanted to go and informed us on bus routes, areas to visit and good restaurants. 
51361	3258213	10.0	9.0	18746937	Staying with Donna was great! She was welcoming and helpful from the moment that we booked with her. She also had great recommendations to help us make the most of our vacation! The room was very comfortable and Donna made sure we felt at home.

We especially appreciated to spent some time with her, talking about travelling, cultures and so many different subjects.

51365	3258213	10.0	9.0	19641522	Staying at Donna's place is AWESOME!  She accommodated us last minute and was extremely helpful.  She also extended the bed so that my very tall husband was able to sleep comfortably.  We were not able to use the Kayaks this time, but will definitely do so when we stay with her the next time.  I recommend staying with Donna as this was a positive experience using airbnb.  Thanks again Donna for all your helpful tips and if I am in the Seattle area I will send you a message.
51366	3258213	10.0	9.0	20104256	Donna is not only a host, but also a care giver and a wonderful friend. My mom and I were in a speedy vocation and Donna went out of her way to make sure our stay was comfortable. She have great recommendations for places to visit and eat, but the kayaks at Lake Washington was definitely a highlight of our trip. I have had some bad experiences with my airbnb host previous to this trip and I was honestly expecting the worst. But Donna made our visit in Seattle so wonderful I fell in love with the city as soon as I met her at the airport. I would give Donna a six star out of five, stay with her! You won't regret it!
51367	3258213	10.0	9.0	21088945	I had a great time while my stay at Donna's place. I loved the peaceful atmosphere, the most beautiful patio and the backyard. Donna is truly a great human being, she is kind, generous and very helpful. I felt absolutely at home. Donna's place would me my first choice to stay next time I visit seattle. Also do go kayaking if u are staying here the kayaks are the icing on the cake. 
51368	3258213	10.0	9.0	21243677	Donna was lovely!  She totally made me feel at home.  I had the best time sitting over tea and chatting about our families, life, travels.  She was ready to help me navigate the streets of Seattle, so I could find what I was looking for!  The room is bigger than the pictures and I melted at the view and how comfortable the bed is.  Thank you for a wonderful, quiet time.
51369	3258213	10.0	9.0	21561799	Staying with Donna is like staying with a good friend. We had a great stay at her lovely house in a quiet and safe neighbourhood of Seattle. The room was above and beyond our expectations, with everything we could possibly need, and an incredibly comfortable bed. We didn't see much of Donna but when we did she was very hospitable, helpful and kind. She went out of her way twice to drop us off at the station. And her knowledge and suggestions of things to do in the area were very much appreciated. I thoroughly recommend staying with Donna!
51370	3258213	10.0	9.0	21985575	"Donna was a wonderful host.  She made us feel so at home.  We did not see much of her (her busy schedule) or her of us (our busy schedule).  We had a key and came and went as needed.  
Her home is very comfortable and clean.  Could not have asked for more.  
Thanks for everything.  We will be back!"

"
51373	3258213	10.0	9.0	33391940	Donna was an amazing hostess! Our only regret is that we couldn't spend more time with her. She and her home are incredibly warm and inviting and we couldn't be happier with our stay. The space is very comfortable, private and has everything you might need. Donna has great recommendations for what to do and how to get around the city like a local and great places off the beaten path. The neighborhood is awesome, diverse and filled with beautiful gardens, cool little houses and great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. It was also a great location for us since it's close to the highway and allows easy access to hiking outside the city and to gorgeous parks nearby. We didn't have time for the kayaks but we are making it a priority for our next visit! Thank you so much, Donna, for opening your home to us and the opportunity to share stories. Hope to see you again soon!
51374	3258213	10.0	9.0	33630971	Donna is such a great host, warm and very attentive to our confort. The house is so cosy, clean, with a beautiful terrace (perfect for taking your breakfast). We had a big light room with a private bathroom and breakfast. Easy access to public transportation and free parking in the street. We didn't have time for kayaking but it is a good thing to do. Thank you Donna.

51376	3258213	10.0	9.0	34683792	Do not think twice, book it right away if it is available! Everything was great, if not better! Donna is really welcoming, sweet and accomodating. The place itself is way better than the photos & description; the room is very spacious, comfy and cozy! Great location & awesome experience! Thank you!
51377	3258213	10.0	9.0	35810379	Donna was the perfect host. She left the keys easy to find and the room ready to be used. She lives about 10-15 mins from Downtown, depending on traffic. She was really nice in recommending places to go around Seattle. We even met her sister who is as fun as her.  The room is big and comfortable, it was clean and with lost of homey feeling.  Donna found out it was my birthday and help my sister have a mini celebration. My sister and I felt at home and would recommend Donna any time. I would definitely go to Donna's again if I visit Seattle in the near future. 
51378	3258213	10.0	9.0	36133794	"Just like Iwona (a couple reviews back) said: ""Do not think twice, book it right away if it is available!"". And I'm glad I did. The room was perfectly sized, with 2 tables (one on each side of the room), and accompany chairs for you to do some work. Everything is clean and set aside for you. Donna even had bath towels, hand towels, and bathrobes with slippers for me to use. Donna even allowed us to check into the house earlier than usual (9 am) to make sure we won't have to wait around after landing in Seattle. 

In short, staying with Donna was the best decision we made on this trip. She was sweet, kind, wonderful, and a thoughtful host. She made sure we were able to get to our Zipcar by taking us there and stayed up past her bedtime to offer to drive us back home from that location. 

Like many things in life, it's the little things that matters and Donna got it covered. I won't be staying with anyone else when I'm in Seattle. Thank you Donna!"
51379	3258213	10.0	9.0	37002299	I had an incredibly enjoyable stay with Donna. I found that the room and space exceeded my expectations. She even has AC! She is lovely to chat with in addition to being very welcoming and friendly. I would love to stay here again and I am sure I will!

The room is very spacious and has all that's needed for a comfortable stay. 
The location is very convenient, very close to lake Washington's beaches and parks and short drive to Seattle downtown area.
We would definitely recommend on staying at Donna's. "
51381	3258213	10.0	9.0	37811521	"Whenever I'll be able hosting myself Donna would be my ideal example. Not only that she offers a big room and a comfortable huge bed in a wonderful house close to Lake Washington and a bus which takes you downtown day and night,  but also she's a warm and helpful person who is just delightful to have around and talk to. She gave us a lot of good advices how to make the best out of our short stay in Seattle. We're very very thankful for her great hospitality and hope to manage coming back one day, also to try the kajaks after all. :) 
All the best to you, Donna! 
T&M"
51382	3258213	10.0	9.0	38400062	We loved staying at Donna's house. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with big windows overlooking a leafy backyard. Every morning, we had fresh fruit, cereal and yogurt before beginning our day. Although we were very busy, we finally did get some time to sit and enjoy talking with Donna. She had many good suggestions on what to do in Seattle. The neighborhood was convenient, with a bus stop just down the hill that took us downtown quickly. I would stay here again when in Seattle.
51383	3258213	10.0	9.0	38629902	Donna is the nicest and friendliest host we ever had. Our journey through the country started at her home and it was the best decision we made. She gave us so many useful advices for our trip and borrowed us camping staff we forgot to bring with us. Her house is easy to find with car and the bedroom is quiet huge for two persons. Everything was clean and she also had breakfast for us. All in all we enjoyed our stay very much and were so thankful for her hospitality. 
51384	3258213	10.0	9.0	40125530	Donna was a dream host! Her home is comfortable and clean, exactly as represented in the photos with gorgeous porch and gardens off the kitchen. From the moment that she greeted me on the porch, Donna made me feel at home. She continued to make my visit fabulous by providing everything that I could need - tea on the porch after a long flight, robe & slippers, lots of information on places to see and suggestions of restaurants to enjoy. Donna was kind and went out of her way to ensure that I was able to get everywhere I wanted to go. The neighbourhood is not in the centre of Seattle but it is close to a nice big park which was great for getting to see the lake and going for walks.  It didn't take long to go downtown when I wanted to explore, and the evenings were nice and quiet when I returned. I highly recommend Donna and her lovely room. I couldn't have wished for a better first Airbnb experience!
51385	3258213	10.0	9.0	40733214	"My boyfriend and I had the most amazing time staying at Donna's.  She is friendly, generous, and gave us amazing restaurant recommendations.  She let us borrow her kayaks, along with her van!  My favorite part of the vacation was kayaking on Lake Washington.  She also instructed us to feel free to anything in her cabinets/fridge.  This was very generous and convenient for us in the mornings.  
    Donna has a gorgeous house surrounded by large trees.  We loved sitting on the large balcony and having coffee/breakfast while bird watching.  The house is near several convenient bus lines and a 20 min walk to the light rail station. If public transit isn't your thing, you can get downtown with an Uber for under $15.
   This was our first airbnb experience but, after staying with Donna, not our last. As gracious as a host as we could have hoped for!"
51386	3258213	10.0	9.0	41221980	Donna was a fantastic host! Her home was cozy and adorable and she was very accommodating and friendly.  She left us plenty of snacks and provided us with plenty of information.  I would definitely stay with her again!

I don't think you will find many hosts more kind and accommodating than Donna.  The pictures were accurate; the room delightful and the street tree lined.  It felt like a home away from home.  She also has interesting art throughout her lovely home.
She was quite willing to give accurate advice on museums, transportation and secrets of Seattle.
Hope she has room in the future.  Finding her airbnb ad was lucky!  Thanks, Donna for everything!

51393	3258213	10.0	9.0	45855661	Donna made us feel very welcome from day one. The room and the neighborhood was exactly as described on the listing. We had nice conversations in the mornings during breakfast, fresh fruits, cereal and coffee :) Donna is a very caring and welcoming person and if we had any questions she would reply very promptly. There is also a nice patio/deck with a nice view. This would be a place I would definitely recommend my friends to stay in the future. Thanks Donna for everything. Hugs :)

Privacy, freedom, good breakfast, warm welcome, help at any moment needed... I can't say any bad thing about the place or Donna. I'm very grateful for staying at this place. It makes my long weekend trip to Seatlle much more enjoyable.

A big advantage about this place, kayaks, was exactly as Donna explain. We took the van, we did kayaking for a few hours and come back. Being so close to the lake and having a great Van makes everything a great experience. I won't forget.

Thanks Donna."
51395	3258213	10.0	9.0	46707542	"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely wonderful experience staying at this home. Our host, Donna, made us feel so welcome even though she had to be away for the duration of our stay. From the moment I requested to reserve a date, the communication with Donna had been warm and welcoming. She was so helpful with the planning of our trip! In her messages she also included detailed advice on how to get around by public transit and restaurant recommendations. We also appreciated that she would occasionally check in on us to see how we were doing since she was not there.
When we got there, we pretty much had the whole first floor to ourselves (minus the study). She has family renting out the basement but we never had an encounter with them and they were mostly quiet. The decor was lovely! It felt like home away from home. Donna left us fresh picked plums, which were delicious, and an assortment of goodies laid out in our bedrooms. Maps of Seattle, things to do, and periodicals are provided to aide your trip. She also has a washer and dryer, slippers and bathrobe, Netflix and basic cable, and a backyard patio you could eat your breakfast on. 
The entire home was clean, the bed was comfortable, the neighborhood was quiet, and our overall experience was excellent. Thank you so much for hosting us, Donna! We'll be back :)"

I'm very thankful that our first airbnb experience was so positive :)








"
52990	5236979	10.0	9.0	27380613	What a lovely experience!  Sha'Ari (pronounced Shari) is a delightful & responsive host.  The room is cute, and more spacious than it looks, with a sweet little couch and plenty of room for your things.  Everything is well-designed and super clean.  The dogs are energetic and fun.  Delridge neighborhood is maybe just a 5-10 minute drive from the fun shops on California, or the beach at Alki.  There's tons of green space in walking distance, with parks, a trail, Camp Long, a climbing rock and more.  We'd definitely like to stay again.
52991	5236979	10.0	9.0	28037180	Sha'Ari made my husband and I feel very welcomed with a sweet note, chocolates on our pillows, and a bottle of sparkling grape juice.  We had access to a kitchenette within the room, a clean bathroom, and had no trouble coming and going as well pleased.  Sha'Ari was extremely kind to us and we would recommend her home to our friends for sure.
52992	5236979	10.0	9.0	30319747	A terrrifc place to stay.  Sha'Ari has a wonderful home and is an excellent host.  The location is perfect, close to downtown, easy access by car as well as public transportation.  Highly recommend.
52993	5236979	10.0	9.0	32385738	My daughter and I stayed with Sha'Ari when visiting family in Seattle.  She was a gracious and delightful host with two wonderful dogs.  The Garden Cottage was comfortable and very welcome.  She went out of her way to make sure that we had a successful and happy visit.
52994	5236979	10.0	9.0	34145930	Sha'ari was a kind and conscientious host, and her dogs are sweet and were rarely in the shared space. The house is a very short walk to several bus stops going downtown, which was awesome, and close to a great caf√© called Pearl's. Sha'ari surprised us with Northwest Blend apple cider and was very willing to give tips for the area. We had a pleasant experience here!
52995	5236979	10.0	9.0	35217015	I thoroughly enjoyed my 5 day stay at the cottage. The bedroom and private bath were exactly as pictured and had everything I needed. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the beautiful gardens, but I will the next time! The location was quiet and very convenient and most of all, I loved the dogs! I highly recommend booking with Sha'Ari.  She was a great hostess.
52996	5236979	10.0	9.0	35558781	Sha'Ari is very coming. She even prepared snacks, drinks, and yogurt for us! The room is really stylish and comfortable. We got to use the bedroom and the living room - enough space for me and my parents. Her two dogs are adorable :)
52997	5236979	10.0	9.0	36674683	"This is a lovely, comfortable, eclectically-furnished space, and Sha'Ari was an extremely accommodating host. She went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of, and was friendly and available without being intrusive. Due to the somewhat quirky bathroom access, the space is not totally private, but it all works and we were very happy to have found such a special place to stay. Highly recommended.
"
52998	5236979	10.0	9.0	37459728	This was the perfect accommodation for us in Seattle.  We wanted to spend two full days in the city touring, including the July 4 fireworks at the waterfront.  Since Sha'Ari's guest quarters are separated from the rest of the house, we were able to return (quietly) late in the evening without a fuss.  Sha'Ari met us on arrival and introduced the house and the procedures to us in a clear and congenial manner and kept in touch with us on a daily basis.  Her two dogs are very friendly and well behaved.  Before our arrival, she even sent an email asking whether we would prefer to have A/C in our room since Seattle had been unusually hot for a few week. Her house is close to the city and easy to find.  We will look to stay there again the next time we're in Seattle. 
52999	5236979	10.0	9.0	37803559	"Sha'Ari was warm and welcoming! She responded quickly to emails with directions and suggestions for bus lines. Her house was just as described and a very comfortable respite after a long day. The bedroom was very comfortable and inviting and the living room was also available for extra seating.  
Sha'Ari had thought about the needs of travelers and provided granola bars and yogurt as well as cold water and a coffee maker.  I fell in love with her dogs, who were very friendly but not intrusive.  Getting to the house was easy with Uber, but the bus stop was very near.  I walked to Pearl's right around the corner and brought back a delicious salmon crepe to eat outside in the cool evening air.      
While Sha'Ari was available, I did not see her again after she welcomed me to the house.  The house plan allows for a feeling of privacy, yet I know she was available for anything I might have needed.   I enjoyed my stay at Sha'Ari's and would definitely consider staying there again on a visit to Seattle.

53000	5236979	10.0	9.0	38742814	"We had a lovely stay at this Garden Cottage.  Sha'Ari is delightful, friendly and helpful. (The dogs are just as friendly) She not only accommodated our arrival schedule but she also helped us navigate the Seattle traffic.  Best of all, she turned us onto a new pizza place that is now my favorite.  Sorry Pagliacci's.  

The suite is set up in a way that is private.  Though you do have to cross the adjoining kitchen to get to it, we never ran into Sha'Ari.  We had the place to ourselves.  It was even nice to just sit on the front porch steps and watch the sun go down.  I highly recommend this cottage."
53001	5236979	10.0	9.0	39177755	"Sha'Ari is delightful!  We had one of those ""the world is so small"" connections as soon as I booked my reservation.  She was kind and welcoming to us and our 11 year old son who spent some time loving on her two dogs.  The room was comfortable for three and offered all the personal touches to make the stay nice.  She even got to AC going for us because it was over 90 degrees while we were there.  Her location is great yet quiet with easy access to neighborhood restaurants and beach. You can even walk down the street and watch a club soccer match.  "
53002	5236979	10.0	9.0	39943254	Sha'ari messaged us right around our arrival in town to check our trip had been safe and to make sure we knew where we were going. The suite is clean with a relaxed atmosphere. There were some nice extra touches such as chocolates on arrival, and high-quality hair and bodywash products in the shower. The price and location combination is not to be beaten! Would definitely stay again.
53003	5236979	10.0	9.0	40372141	The space is very nice and super clean. The dogs were sweet and easy going. We barely saw our host, as we were out enjoying the town so much. Neighborhood and house quiet and peaceful. Recommended to all.
53004	5236979	10.0	9.0	41091400	I stayed at Sha'Ari's with two of my friends and our stay was great! We didn't see much of her but she was very easy to get a hold of when we needed her. Her two dogs are so friendly and welcoming! Overall our stay was wonderful. Thank you Sha'Ari!!
53005	5236979	10.0	9.0	42133793	Sha'Ari and her two big dogs were a gracious and sweet hosting trio! Her place is lovely‚Äîand the neighborhood is cool old West Seattle. I can't wait to get back up here to stay here again!
53006	5236979	10.0	9.0	43195490	Although we did not meet Sha'Ari in person, she made us feel very welcome in her house. There were granola bars, yogurts, grapes, purified water and chocolates waiting for us next to the hand-written welcome sign. Sha'Ari has made a very useful map with all kind of information about the neighborhood and downtown! The place was very clean and looked really nice. Although her dogs are big and sometimes in the kitchen (you cannot use the kitchen unless you make arrangements with Sha'Ari, but you have an own fridge and microwave!), they are very sweet and quiet. They just look at you and that is it. Sha'Ari checked by text if we needed anything on the day after arrival and contacted us when we were leaving. We loved staying in her place, which is very easy to get by from the airport and from downtown with public transport (bus).  One more extra tip: use the airbnb app for the wifi password.
53007	5236979	10.0	9.0	43577530	I had a wonderful stay at Sha'Ari's lovely, cozy Garden Cottage in Seattle.  She greeted me upon arrival and showed me around the super cute - and comfortable suite.  I felt safe - welcome and she even provided coffee and yogurt for breakfast - so sweet.

The location is great and I never had a problem finding parking right out front.  Would definitely recommend and stay again. 
53009	5236979	10.0	9.0	45245133	Sha'Ari was wonderful and checked in on us regularly to make sure we were comfortable and making our way around safely. The dogs were dolls and quite impish. We were surprised to find a wonderful supply of granola bars, yogurts, fresh plums, filtered water, teas and coffee waiting for us. Great stay!
53010	5236979	10.0	9.0	46129488	The stay was a lovely as the home. Also the area was just as pictured quiet and chill. We got there pretty late, but the set up to greet us along with the little notes made us feel welcome. Shar you were so informative about where to go we would definitely stay at the cottage again. Oh and the pups were adorable and lovable!

53014	5236979	10.0	9.0	48078337	My stay with Sha'Ari was wonderful! She met me when I got there and was very friendly and welcoming. Her house was in a cute neighborhood not far from downtown, only a short bus ride away. She provided information on good places to eat and things to see, including a fabulous breakfast place right around the corner. The suite was amazing: comfortable and beautifully decorated, with plenty of space to hang out. The bed was extremely comfortable as well. I never wanted to leave! Her 2 dogs were also very laid back and sweet, and I loved playing with them. This was my first Airbnb experience and it vastly exceeded all my expectations. I would wholeheartedly recommended staying with Sha'Ari and will definitely do so again if I ever find myself back in Seattle!
53015	5236979	10.0	9.0	48706856	I enjoyed staying at Sha'Ari's house.  The bed was very comfortable.  Her dogs were wonderful.  Sha'Ari gave me great ideas for restaurants and attractions in Seattle.

53017	5236979	10.0	9.0	50624195	Sha'Ari  was there to let me in, give me a tour and  introduce me to the two puppies, who were wonderful and sweet. Then she let me explore. Anytime I needed anything, I could text from anywhere in Seattle and she got back to me with answers or help. She had a lovely guide book with a listing of places to see, things to do and a couple recommended places to pick up supplies or grab a cup of coffee. Couldn't be better. 
53018	5236979	10.0	9.0	53341103	"The cottage is beautiful, as is the sitting area in the garden. The location was conveniently close to downtown and consistently had parking. Sha'Ari was a lovely host. She provided everything we could have possibly needed, and more. 

Words cannot describe the level adorableness achieved by the dogs."
53019	5236979	10.0	9.0	54371655	The posting was pretty spot on! The bus ride literally took 10 min into Downtown Seattle (with rush hour traffic). Sha'Ari was a perfect host with much recommendations. She checked in from time to time and also gave the needed privacy. My week stay here was just perfect. Sabu and Mikah were a joy, they also greeted me when I came back for a few (website hidden) This was my first AIRBNB booking, thanks for everything again Sha'Ari!
53020	5236979	10.0	9.0	55101049	Sha'ari was a wonderful host and her dogs were so friendly and sweet. The bed was very comfortable with plenty of blankets.

I would definitely stay here again!
53021	5236979	10.0	9.0	55534280	"Just what I needed--quiet, solitude, and an understanding host. Sha'Ari welcomed me with open arms (including her sweet doggies) and the vibe of the house was chill. The location was great with easy access to freeways, local stores, and proximity to downtown.

Thanks again for a wonderful stay :)"
53022	5236979	10.0	9.0	56311290	Sha'Ari is a very cool and passionate host and so are her two dogs. She left me with private space just as what I want. We arranged the first meet before I arrived. The room and decorations are perfect and I have a totally private living room to enjoy free time. Free parking is on the outside of the house. 10 Mounties to downtown without commuting traffic.
53023	5236979	10.0	9.0	57015550	My stay with Sha'Ari was rejuvenating. She and her lovely dogs welcomed me warmly and made me feel comfortable and at home from the start.  Her place has a positive and peaceful energy.  I took full advantage of her Sound Healing option which was divine! I will definitely be returning.
54954	5959816	10.0	10.0	32635043	Linda's place was a gorgeous space!  It had everything we needed for a full stay (kitchen goods, TV, internet, laundry).  The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance to UVillage, with easy access to downtown via bus. Linda was very welcoming and we would highly recommend it!

54956	5959816	10.0	10.0	34498443	Linda was very welcoming, the neighborhood is generally quiet--as it is set off from the traffic on 25th ave.--and the listing and description does indeed reflect what you will find upon arrival: a newly renovated, comfortable, clean, and separate basement area with a bath, bedroom, kitchen (with appliances), and living room (with television).  It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the university.  There is convenient street parking with a permit, which Linda gives you upon arrival.  I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely return again.
54957	5959816	10.0	10.0	34968431	"An extremely comfortable apartment, with plenty of space and well equipped. Perfect for visiting my son at UW. I much enjoyed be able to enjoy the Seattle sunshine in Linda's beautifully kept garden. I am also very appreciative of her flexible check-in check-out policy; I arrived an hour later than expected after flight delays in London and my flight home was not until the evening and Linda had no hesitation in say check-out was flexible and she was very happy for me to stay as long as liked on the departure day (I left at 15:35).
Thank you Linda. "
54958	5959816	10.0	10.0	35501104	Linda's home was very cozy and clean, we were very impressed with the space and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in seattle.

54960	5959816	10.0	10.0	38452442	The listing description was very accurate.  The place is very very clean, everything seems fresh and new, and there are plenty of nice touches too numerous to mention.  Great lighting, lots of windows (yes, its a basement unit, but has plenty of windows with natural light), and great lighting too.  Coffee, a few snacks, fully stocked kitchen, etc. were just a few things that will welcome you.  The neighborhood was ideal- walking distance to plenty, including the bike trail, and bike rentals.  Linda was available and responsive.   Very quiet.  Location, super nice and clean, great host.  I highly recommend staying here.  I can't think of any downsides.
54961	5959816	10.0	10.0	38840274	Perfect!  Just as pictured.  Many thoughtful touches.  Linda and Robert are lovely.
54962	5959816	10.0	10.0	39228673	"What a wonderful place. Robert met us as we drove up and walked us through everything. There was a book with all the local restaurants, transit, and other points of interest. He even provided a guest parking pass for the street parking.
The space was very comfortable and clean. Nothing was lacking. Met Linda the morning we left (so sorry we could only stay 2 nights!) and she was great, too. This will be a high-priority stay for us on our next trip to Seattle!"
54963	5959816	10.0	10.0	40099273	We stayed here for a week when we visited Seattle for the first time. To be honest, I doubted that it would be as close to everything as described, but it really was! We could pretty much get anywhere in the city under 15 minutes. We were able to park on the street with no issues thanks to our guest parking pass. The guest house was very neat, quiet, and comfortable. Linda and her husband were very respectful and seemed happy to host us.
54964	5959816	10.0	10.0	41470652	Linda made us feel very welcome and comfortable even though we showed up much later than we had originally planned. The place was great! It was clean, cozy, and in a very cute neighborhood. It has a private entrance and a wonderful shower :) There was plenty to do within walking distance, we walked to coffee and to the University of Washington. Linda provided coffee and a few snacks, a map of the area, a binder with suggestions for activities, as well as Internet access. I would definitely stay here again.  
54965	5959816	10.0	10.0	41946224	Linda was a great hostess, very helpful and attentive. I needed very little in the way of recommendations since I was there to visit friends who had everything plotted.

54969	5959816	10.0	10.0	45107790	Lots of welcoming touches - a pitcher of filtered water, snacks, coupons for visitors, coffee.  Quiet Ravenna street with ample parking, but just one block from tons of retail along 25th.  VERY comfortable and private basement apartment that still gets great natural light and ventilation.  Will return with pleasure...

54981	5959816	10.0	10.0	57475641	I arranged for my aging mom to stay at Robert and Linda's during Christmas. My mom has mobility issues (she uses a cane) and this little apartment was an accessibility dream!! This was Mom's first time at an airbnb and Linda and Robert went out of their way to make my mom feel welcome and to help her figure out the idiosyncrasies of the space. It is beautifully finished and decorated and my mom reports that the bed is very comfy! I will definitely recommend Linda and Robert's to friends and family visiting in the future.

She had given me her neighbour's phone number, and he came with his charming little daughter the minute I called.  He was concerned I understood how things worked and whether I was hungry.  

I enjoyed staying at Lizbeth‚Äôs very much.  It was convenient to all I had to do in Seattle  -- even though once I got there, it‚Äôs so quiet and pleasant, I really only wanted to relax in the most welcoming swing on the deck!  The cats are well-behaved, beautiful.  And not only are her next-door neighbours great, several people I stopped on the street to ask directions or information about the bus stops were also kind.  Thank you, Lizbeth!

Even though I didnt get to stay long it really was like having a home away from home.  It was also very convenient for biking with coffee shops, parks, restaurants and pubs just down the road.  A great place in a great community in an awesome city!  Doesn't get much better than that!
55965	2822984	10.0	10.0	45134041	Lizbeth's house is adorable and located in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The 71 bus stop that goes straight to downtown is just steps away, and it was only $17 Uber ride. She was always quick to communicate, and offered great suggestions.

Ann was so helpful, responsive, welcoming, and truly made our stay feel like home. The studio is absolutely beautiful, with fabulous furnishings, including a very comfortable bed. The kitchenette was well-stocked, and Ann was thoughtful to include travel books and provide excellent recommendations for restaurants and walks. The neighborhood is close to many wonderful parks and is a great place to explore the city. Ann's lovely home made our trip so memorable. We came home feeling restored and wishing we could have stayed far longer! 
56949	7070169	10.0	10.0	40128485	Ann is a delightful and thoughtful host.  She has set up a very comfortable living space in a great location.  The kitchen area is small but adequate for travelers who want to eat out most of the time:  coffee, tea, snacks, mini fridge, washer/dryer.  The neighborhood is quiet but has easy access to both the University district and Capitol Hill.  Ann was there to welcome us and point out features of the apartment and was forthcoming with suggestions on nearby restaurants and coffee shops.  Loved having some neighborhood places to visit. She left several Seattle magazines in the studio for our perusal and she has a great book collection in the apartment. There is a sweet private patio in the front surrounded by a lush landscaping.  Street parking is easy.  We really enjoyed our stay and plan to return.  
56950	7070169	10.0	10.0	40518978	Ann's studio was clean, cozy and private. I had a great time staying there and will definitely recommend it to anyone!
56951	7070169	10.0	10.0	41458105	Ann was an excellent host!  Her place was very nice and conveniently located to Capitol Hill, downtown, and the University of Washington areas.  Ann went out of her way to make our stay and our travels as convenient as possible.  Highly recommend Ann's place and would definitely stay there again.
56952	7070169	10.0	10.0	42151394	Ann made us feel very welcomed and took excellent care of us.  In fact, we would have to say we felt pampered!   The studio was just as pictured and very comfortable.
56953	7070169	10.0	10.0	43252792	"Ann welcomed us warmly when we arrived.  The location was great for us because her home is only 2 blocks from our daughter's home.
The apartment is spacious and very well appointed.  A nice touch for us was the clothes washer and dryer as we had already been traveling for a week.  We will definitely stay with Ann again! 
"
56954	7070169	10.0	10.0	43588064	"I recently stayed in Ann's apartment at the end of a long and exhausting work trip in the US so that I could relax for a few days before heading home to Australia.

Ann is a fantastic host and has thought of and done everything to make a guest feel pampered yet very much at home. The apartment is large, stylishly furnished and exceedingly comfortable - very comfy bed, large sofa to relax on, great desk to work at that overlooks the garden, well appointed bathroom and speedy wifi that works just as well in the apartment as it does in the very peaceful and private front garden! I found the garden to be an absolutely delightful area for breakfast or just to relax.  The kitchenette was also great - well equipped appliance wise, and Ann‚Äôs welcome gifts, including some fruit, yoghurt and her homemade granola couldn‚Äôt have been more delicious (and appreciated), as was the full size washer and dryer after being away from home for a few weeks!

Ann‚Äôs neighbourhood, and the location of Ann‚Äôs apartment is fantastic. I didn‚Äôt have a car, but there is ample parking out the front. I caught the bus into town from the stop at the bottom of the street.  The stop is only 2 minutes away, and after a 15 minute ride through the surrounding very picturesque neighbourhoods I was downtown to take in all the sights.  It couldn‚Äôt have been easier.  Other areas that I visited on foot that are all a short/very easy walk from Ann‚Äôs house were the Arboretum, Interlaken Park, the University of Washington and Husky Stadium and the University Village shopping area.  I had a very nice dinner at the Italian restaurant at the end of Ann‚Äôs street, which is only a couple of minutes away.

I would highly recommend Ann‚Äôs apartment to anyone, or any couple with plans to visit Seattle.  Of all my airbnb experiences, and there have been a few and in multiple countries, this has absolutely been the best."
56955	7070169	10.0	10.0	44182901	This was my first time using Airbnb and it was fantastic!  My boyfriend and I stayed at Ann's beautiful home and she was so gracious and so hospitable. Not only was she easily accessible she was very flexible especially since our flight in was delayed 4 hours and we didn't arrive until after midnight. She provided us with information about the town, fun activities along with how to get around via bus or taxi /uber. Her space was clean,and had all the things we needed including coffee,  water,  homemade granola and even a bottle of wine. It was an incredibly comfortable experience and we would definitely stay there again.
56956	7070169	10.0	10.0	44922453	"Montlake Studio was very comfortable, clean and inviting. The variety of books and lovely amenities that Ann provides makes it even more comfy. There is information available for exploring the city and the house is near a bus line to downtown. The Arboretum is a stones throw away. Ann herself is gracious ,lovely and very very helpful. I would highly recommend Montlake Studio.

Easy 20min bus ride to downtown,  Had fruit and snacks, coffee etc in the unit ready for us.  Would stay there again.  The place is in the basement of the house she lives in but you have total privacy. She makes sure you know she is available for info or questions but is not at all intrusive.

56959	7070169	10.0	10.0	47479177	Ann is a wicked awesome host! Her cozy little studio apartment was stocked with goodies for us and is conveniently located for walking to the UW district and around her charming Montlake neighborhood.  She is very solicitous regarding her tenants' needs: there are   guidebooks, maps, and even a convenient terrace for enjoying Seattle's sunnier days. 
56960	7070169	10.0	10.0	48011709	Ann's Seattle location and outstanding accommodations could not have been better.  We were only there for a couple of nights, but it felt like home.

I stayed at her house just for two days but could feel she was not just a host,but my ""real host mother"". We took a tea (website hidden) was really good time.She lent me her great kitchen and dinning.And kindly drove me to my next airbnb house.Second,her listing was so so so amazing place for comfortable staying. It was very clean and perfect.She prepared a lots of organic foods(some fruits,granola,coffee,honey,milk,beer,snacks,and so on) and high-quality products(shampoo,conditioner,soap,body lotion,clean towels,tooth blush sets,and so on). I could feel her polite lifestyle from what she gave me. She is amazing,awesome,and definitely everyone's Super Host:) "
56964	7070169	10.0	10.0	50094477	Ann was incredibly accommodating yet respectful of our privacy.  The studio was immaculate and beautifully appointed.  We had everything we needed and more.   The neighborhood was an established area of lovely homes conveniently located near the the University, downtown Seattle, and Bellevue and amenities.  Public transportation was very accessible.  Walking to the Arboretum and on the trails was a real treat.  We will definitely come back.  
56965	7070169	10.0	10.0	50508816	Ann is definitely a super host! She went above and beyond to make our stay in Seattle easy and comfortable! She made us feel so welcome upon checkin! The space is perfectly decorated, with touches throughout to make the guests feel right at home! Her neighborhood is charming and safe, and very central. We were able to enjoy morning and afternoon walks through parks, to cafes, and through the neighborhood! I would recommend Ann's place to anyone who is looking for a very comfortable, safe, and relaxing space! 
56966	7070169	10.0	10.0	51951195	This is a very cozy studio in an amazing area!! Check out the Arboretum park with the trails connecting the islands...so beautiful! And Ann was such a wonderful host!! She checked out on me every single day, helping me out with anything that I needed. The last day we have the chance of chatting more over a glass of wine and we had a great great time. Highly recommended!!
56967	7070169	10.0	10.0	53053711	"Ann was a wonderful host, and her place is just incredible. My husband and I doubt we could ever stay anywhere better! 
Ann is easy to communicate with, left us snacks in the kitchen area, and even a couple beers in the fridge! We used the washer dryer for a few loads of laundry, and felt safe and cozy in what feels like a downstairs luxury apartment. Ann had everything we wanted and more. "
56968	7070169	10.0	10.0	53629057	"I loved everything about this stay! The unit is better than the pictures; I opened up the door and was immediately excited with how warm, welcoming and cozy it was. I was there for work, so spent most of my time at the University, but had a morning to kill and checked out an hour-isn long walk that Ann recommended... on the walk I not only feel in love with her neighborhood but also Seattle in general. I'm dying to go back, and will definitely be staying in Mountlake again.

56970	7070169	10.0	10.0	54459263	Staying at Montlake Studio revolutionized our trip to Seattle and made it a refreshing experience.  Graciously providing a peaceful space with cleverly arranged amenities, Ann Duncan gave us room to relax and enjoy a charming home atmosphere. We loved the convenient neighborhood shops and parks.  
56971	7070169	10.0	10.0	55353015	"We just returned from Seattle where we spent a week at Montlake studio through airbnb.  It  was quite handy to our son's house and well situated near the arboretum.  Ann was a gracious hostess providing us with healthful snacks and a well equipped studio.   Her house is located across the street from an elementary school up a big hill.  You  needed  to walk up 14 steps to reach her house and then down 14 steps to reach the lower level of her house.  The studio is  spacious with a separate kitchenette area.  The bed is against two walls so getting in and out requires a bit of crawling.  Closet space under the stairs is limited. There is a small mini market down the hill as well as a nice local coffee shop. The Montlake area is very close to downtown.  We took a Uber to the space needle and it was around $14.  There is also a bus at the end of the street.  Seattle is lovely and a great city for billy goats as it is very very hilly.  Thanks Ann for your hospitality... We'll be back.   Marlene B.

The Internet worked great and so did the appliances. The laundry is a nice touch. Everything was clean and there were freshly washed towels waiting for me. I will definitely look to stay here again on my next trip. 

There was no in person interaction with the host, but there was assistance available via phone/email as needed. "
58610	8919372	10.0	10.0	55259685	"I didn't actually meet Khanie, but we had a great stay at the property. The building was undergoing some renovations, so we weren't able to use the elevator, but this wasn't too much of a problem. There were very clear instructions left on how to get into the apartment and check-in was easy. 

The apartment is incredibly clean and has all the essentials you need in the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and living room (kitchen supplies, toiletries, extra towels & blankets, etc). The apartment is also centrally located: nice to walk around, close to public transit, and in an area where there is plenty of nightlife and things to do--even on Thanksgiving day! Overall, we had a really comfortable stay. "
58611	8919372	10.0	10.0	55740841	Good experience overall.  Had some difficulties getting into the building at first because no one was there to assist, but once we got someone on the phone everything was fine.  There was construction going on when we were there so there were noise issues, but that's not khanies fault.
58612	8919372	10.0	10.0	58365554	The place was clean and well kept. The hallways were just a bit messy but the location made up for it ten fold. Very prompt replies to any questions and very professional. Quite a late check in but all in all a good experience! Thanks

I had never been to Seattle before and I'm really glad we stayed in Capitol Hill - it's close to a ton of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and book stores, and Nicole gave us a great list of places in the neighborhood to check out. It was the perfect place to get a sense of Seattle. The house was comfortable, clean and warm. 
64692	9727857	10.0	10.0	57103116	Great host, informative about the area and was very understanding when I had issues affecting my arrival time. Great location at a great price too, right in the heart of downtown Seattle

66401	3882930	10.0	10.0	19401439	Morgan's home is beautifully furnished, and one step inside has you feeling as comfortable as if you'd been living there for years. You'll be staying in a very nice room complete with a cozy loveseat and enormous television (with clear instructions on how to use it), in addition to the twin sized bed. Morgan's attention to detail is what made my stay a pleasant one. Anything I could've asked for was already taken care of and waiting. Your time at Morgan's home will be enjoyable.
66402	3882930	10.0	10.0	19572848	"Morgan met me at the door and introduced herself and her super sweet dog, Maisy. They were both very kind. Morgan was very pleasant and  I felt I had a lot of privacy in the house. 
The room is super cute decorated with such curious flare. Colour and patterns that I would never dream of putting together just  look awesome and it makes the room very special. 
The lighting in the room is soft and dramatic. An amazing wood carved screen is placed tastefully in front of a lamp and it casts such a warm subtle light in the room.
The room also had some neat looking antique trinkets which add a lot of charm. It's not a huge room but it does have a big comfy chair to sit in and is way more cosy than a hotel room. 
The bed was very comfortable and the fact that the room had two windows (a first for me for a bedroom) made it very refreshing with the cool summer air whispering in. 
I would love to stay there again if I travel again to Seattle. "
66403	3882930	10.0	10.0	19987685	"I really enjoyed staying in Morgan's house. It's beautiful, I would have appreciated to have more time to enjoy the garden. The room is perfect, with everything you need. 
The neighborhood is quiet, but you're not so far from Ballard so you can go out not so far from the room. 
And above all, Maisie is great to feel comfortable with! "
66404	3882930	10.0	10.0	20729113	Morgan was quick to respond and easy to reach. Her space was as she represented it to be. It was easy to stay and to come bs go. It was a great neighborhood to be in, as well.
66405	3882930	10.0	10.0	22161918	The Heart Home! Morgan and Mazie Dogg are very warm and welcoming hosts in a warm and welcoming home. The house is a quiet neighborhood and an easy walk to parks and a longer walk to Golden Gardens park. I would stay here again in the beat of a heart. 
66406	3882930	10.0	10.0	25952226	What a great airbnb experience! Morgan was very helpful in regards to recommending cute shops/places to eat in and around Ballard and her and her adorable dog Maisie were very welcoming. The house and room itself has a very warm, homey vibe and Morgan even has coffee/tea available for guests in the morning. As a travelling nurse, I had a more extended stay and Morgan was extremely accommodating. When I come back to Seattle, I would love to stay with her again! Glad to say I not only had a nice place to stay but also gained a new friend :) 
66407	3882930	10.0	10.0	27785851	Staying at Morgan's house was so comfortable that I booked with her a second time. Morgan is such a warm and helpful person. I felt at home in her house right away. Not to mention the bed is super comfy!! I slept great there. Also, her house is in a great location, I walked pretty easily into Ballard most nights to grab a bite to eat at the fun restaurants there. I definitely recommend staying at Morgan's place, especially if you're traveling alone and want a comfortable retreat to come back to!
66408	3882930	10.0	10.0	27973560	Morgan and the pup were amazing hosts. Falling asleep in that cozy bedroom with the sound of rain out the open window lead to one of the bests night's sleep in a while. Highly recommend!
66409	3882930	10.0	10.0	46047391	Staying with Morgan was the highlight of my trip to Seattle. It actually felt more like what I expect to experience at a regular bed and breakfast, namely having wonderful conversations with the hosts. Morgan was a totally engaged hostess and wonderful person. The accommodations were better than advertised, and I felt totally at home during my stay. 
66410	3882930	10.0	10.0	46671659	Morgan's place felt very cozy. She was very nice as well as her little dog. I rented a car and was able to park it on the street with no problem. Bed was very comfortable and the area was fairly quiet. Overall, it was a very nice experience.

Well appointed room.  Very nice house.  Bed was a little short for me, but I'm 6'4"" and short beds are nothing new.  Would stay there again."
66412	3882930	10.0	10.0	46942125	My dog Jack and I had a wonderful stay with Morgan and Maisey. I felt right at home, as if staying with an old friend.

I highly recommend Morgan's place and would absolutely stay again. Thank you Morgan and Maisey!
66413	3882930	10.0	10.0	47055220	Morgan was a wonderful host, ready with suggestions, a little reference book in the room for local eateries, bus schedules around town, etc.  The room was cozy and welcoming, with a snack basket available, toiletries and coffee and tea in the kitchen.  The bed was so comfortable I would have taken it home with me!  I highly recommend this location for your next stay in Seattle and it certainly felt like home to me!
66414	3882930	10.0	10.0	48523536	Great location with an easy walk to downtown Ballard. Room was right next to bathroom and provided plenty of space to spread out. Morgan got a new bed while I was there and upgraded the room for free while I was out one night, coming home to a comfy new bed. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy the Ballard community.
66415	3882930	10.0	10.0	49228258	Perfect. Would stay every time I'm in Seattle
66416	3882930	10.0	10.0	52227695	From the first steps into the house, this was a most wonderful experience. The room is an oasis, the bed...well I wish the one at my home was as comfortable! The Heart House certainly lives up to the name. Located in a quiet area yet within easy access to shops and restaurants. Morgan and sweet Maisy make you feel so welcome. So nice to open the door and be greeted by them both! My first time with airbnb and I really hope I have an opportunity to stay with Morgan and Maisy again. 
66717	6821407	10.0	10.0	35056139	Beautiful spankin new home in a hip, safe part of town. I don't think the pictures do it (website hidden) was a very accommodating host and great to communicate with for last minute needs. Definitely hope to stay here again next time I come to Seattle!
66718	6821407	10.0	10.0	35518713	"Steve's place was perfect for me.  I was in Ballard for work and it was walking distance for me.  I was able to enjoy lots of great restaurants, and desserts...top of my list were the Molten Cake place, Red Mill Burgers, Morsel and Bean as well as the Locks where there were huge birds dive fishing for salmon swimming up stream.

Steve is easy going and easy to communicate with.  His place is close to lots of indie shops and public transportation.  I had the bottom floor for myself and a private restroom.  The house was clean.  I would definitely stay here when back in town."
66719	6821407	10.0	10.0	35615074	Steve was a great host that helped me figure out how to navigate Airbnb for my first stay, and based on this experience, I would definitely love to stay at his place again! Steve's house is brand new and situated in a great location that allowed us to walk to everything in Ballard, and it was a quick drive to downtown Seattle.  My fiance loved the neighborhood so much, we were thinking about possibly moving there!  Steve was friendly and accommodating, and he effortlessly balanced being a good host while helping us with any questions, as well as giving us great recommendations of places to visit.  
66720	6821407	10.0	10.0	36719972	Steve's home is a brand new and modern construction, so the room and bathroom fittings are contemporary and very nice. The location in Ballard, north of Market and just off 24th, is residential and quiet, with ample street parking right near the house. The bus stop to Downtown and the main road in Ballard is a couple minutes walk, so overall it's very conveniently located. At the time I stayed, Steve hadn't yet had wifi installed, and FYI, the 2 coffee shops that are closest by also both don't have wifi, which is strange for Seattle. The bed is comfortable and Steve kindly also left some bottles of water on my arrival. Water pressure in the shower is good and it's also nice to have the option of taking a bath. Steve has a few rules for keeping his house clean and safe (no shoes inside, lock the dual locks, don't open the window too wide, etc), so I'd recommend talking through those so you have the same expectations.
66721	6821407	10.0	10.0	38036479	Steve is a great guy & his place is in a great location! Only a short stroll from all the good restaurants, bars & shops in Ballard. We had a whole floor to ourselves...the place is brand new & very clean! Perfect
66722	6821407	10.0	10.0	38212255	It was fine. Clean and simple. sung Joon was accommodating and helpful. 
66723	6821407	10.0	10.0	38363530	"Host:
He helped me to figure out how to get to his place and welcomed me wholeheartedly. He is really easy to communicate and easy going. 

House:
The house looked like brand new with modern construction, I asked to host when this house has been built. He said it was built in June 2015. So, it is clean and nice hose to stay. It is same as on the description, but much better than photo you see on this post. I think Steve should do another photo works to show this place in more attractive way. :)
I could use whole first floor with private bathroom, so level of private was pretty good. 

Town:
This house is located in downtown Ballard. That's one of the main reason why I choose this place. It's only 15 minutes walk distance to there, and there were many soulful cafe, restaurant, theater, bar and shops. I could definitely enjoy the town."
66724	6821407	10.0	10.0	38629756	Steve is accommodating and polite host. The room is in the very nice, clean brand new building and comes with private bathroom. It is in the Ballard neighborhood, which is quite, safe and cozy location with ample nice coffee shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay at this place in the future.
66725	6821407	10.0	10.0	38893168	Sung made us feel  very welcome. The apartment is ideally situated in Ballard, as advertised. The actual room is a little bit small, but it's ideal for a person or two staying for a short stay. The building itself is very modern and clean. 
66726	6821407	10.0	10.0	40523484	I had a wonderful stay at Steve‚Äôs place. Steve is a very nice guy and a wonderful host. His house is clean, quiet and is conveniently located in Ballard. The rooms that are available to me are exactly as described/pictured. In addition, he left lovely welcome gifts (bottles of water and a couple of bags of Kukuruza popcorn) on the bed :). I had the bottom floor to myself with private bathroom, and during my stay I hardly heard any foot/floor noises from the floors above. If you are a light sleeper, this is the place for you! I highly recommend Steve‚Äôs place and will definitely book here again.
66727	6821407	10.0	10.0	40960530	Steve was such a great host. Our flight arrived late and he stayed up and got us settled right in despite the hour! The room was extremely clean and we felt very comfortable staying with him. The shared space was lovely and Steve gave us some great suggestions for visiting Seattle. I actually loved being in the Ballard neighborhood and found it to be a lot of fun and easy to get in and out of Downtown, I would stay there again in a minute. This was our first experience with Air BnB and I'm now a huge fan.
66728	6821407	10.0	10.0	41141365	Steve was a very gracious, accommodating host. From booking to arriving, he stayed in touch, providing sightseeing and restaurant suggestions. When we arrived to his clean, well-appointed space, he had left us a half-sheet with house rules, two waters, and his favorite local artisanal popcorn. The common space separated the guest suite from his, so we felt we had enough privacy. The quiet neighborhood was only a 10-minute √úber or 30-minute bus ride from downtown--though there are plenty of things to do in Ballard.  Our only regret is that we only had one night to spend here!
66729	6821407	10.0	10.0	41653174	He was very accommodating and very available. The room and bathroom was very clean and easy to access. Great experience. Steve had a couple of water bottles and sone local speciality popcorn redy for us when we arrived.

66731	6821407	10.0	10.0	42325328	Room was clean if a little minimal. Bed was very small for a couple, but overall a pleasant experience. 
66732	6821407	10.0	10.0	43537169	Steve is very welcoming, polite and friendly host. He organized and prepared everything I needed for the room. He knew that I was on a working trip and he got me a small desk for the room. I really appreciated it. The apartment is conveniently located in Ballard. I can walk to the happening spots in less than 15 mins. To get to downtown, there is a bus stop, just a block away. It takes less than 30 mins to get to downtown. As for the apartment, its a brand new building (modern style). The room and the bathroom are very clean. I have enough privacy on the first floor and the private bathroom is definitely a huge plus! The wifi connection is strong and you can find nice graphic arts hanging around his place. The neighborhood is very quite so it's work out great for a light sleeper like me.  I had a wonderful stay and will definitely book here again :) Thanks Steve for being a great host!
66733	6821407	10.0	10.0	44327610	"Steve was very responsive - his house was super clean and the stay was great. Nice neighborhood - close to everything - parking easy and accessible.

66734	6821407	10.0	10.0	44709613	"Our stay at Sung Joons apartment was so nice.
He is such a friendly and helpful host.
The room and private bath were really great and 100 percent clean.
The second floor with kitchen and living room were spacious and we had a lot of fun cooking there. 
We enjoyed the time and definitely recommended it."
66735	6821407	10.0	10.0	44808354	Sung Yoon made us feel welcome, and everything was nice and clean. Bed was small for two people but other than that it was great. Common area was very nice but we never used it. Bathroom was spotless too which is a big plus in my book
66736	6821407	10.0	10.0	44959817	Awesome host, nice clean and tidy apartment. Would definitely want to stay here next time. 
66737	6821407	10.0	10.0	45333277	"Steve was a wonderfull host. From the moment I arrived he guided me to a private parking lot, I was excited about that. The living room looks way better in real life than in pictures, it`s simple, elegant and usefull. The room where I was hosted was on the first floor, so I had privacy, plus the bathroom was next door, so handy. 
 The neighborhood was quiet, close to downtown, the perfect place for what I needed. 
 I would defenetaly book a room at Steve`s if I`m going to be in Seattle !

66738	6821407	10.0	10.0	45616655	Absolutely amazing air BNB the space is exactly as advertised complete wonderful experience would totally stay here again. 
66739	6821407	10.0	10.0	46446468	"If I could describe our stay at Steve's place in three words, I'd have to say ""quick and easy."" Not only was Steve very welcoming and readily available to answer questions, but his clean and tidy apartment was the perfect accommodation for two folks needing a place to spend the night on a budget.

Pros: Very friendly host, clean room, zero hassle, Ballard, excellent price for what is offered.
Cons: the 2 person bed is only suitable for slender folks (this wasn't an issue for us)
Overall: 5/5"
66740	6821407	10.0	10.0	46978180	All was accurate and check in and check out went smoothly
66741	6821407	10.0	10.0	47111479	Our room in Sung Joon's apartment was nice but pretty small (would recommend it for one or two nights, though). It is situated in a very nice area where bars, caf√©s and restaurants are in walking-distance. Sung Joon was very friendly and made great suggestions of which caf√©s we should check out. Thanks for that!
66742	6821407	10.0	10.0	47407691	"Steve was a most excellent host during our stay with him.  We felt at home and comfortable in his lovely, clean, well decorated home.  The neighborhood was quiet yet close to lots of action. A beautiful area to explore. Whatever you do, don't miss the locks!

We highly recommend staying with Steve, he is a great host and kind as well.  Hope to see him again soon! "
66743	6821407	10.0	10.0	47781508	I had a flight that came in pretty late at night and Steve stayed up until 12:45AM waiting up for me! It was a really comfortable stay and I definitely appreciated the kind gesture of a water and towels. The room was clean and rules were simple to follow. I'd definitely want to stay here again!
66744	6821407	10.0	10.0	48149701	Steven was very accommodating for us to check in and was very friendly and welcoming. The place was very clean and new. I would recommend it!
66745	6821407	10.0	10.0	48357983	We stayed two nights at Steve's house, what I can tell is that his place is really convenient, clean and you have the first floor just for you so you can have your intimacy. I highly recommend this bnb and this host (too bad we didn t see him much as he was busy working).
66746	6821407	10.0	10.0	49382122	Host was very helpful through out my entire stay. Quick to respond to my questions and texts. I couldn't find the place but he came out to find me and direct me to the place. Good location. Convenient parking. House is clean. 
66747	6821407	10.0	10.0	50539692	Steve was really nice and friendlyÔºåand the place was warm and welcome.
66748	6821407	10.0	10.0	50884450	We stayed 2 nights at Steve's. The room was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable. Steve was great too, although we did not see much of him.  The location is ideal with a bus stop 2 blocks away with downtown 30 minutes away. Ballard is also a great neighbourhood, with loads of restaurants and shops. We definitely recommend staying here.
66749	6821407	10.0	10.0	51195517	Steve is very nice, accomodating and fast to answer questions. The place is very modern,clean and close to seattle. We rented a car so the parking space available was very convenient as well. Something worth considering and will definitely stay here again when given the chance to go back to seattle :)
66750	6821407	10.0	10.0	52270357	Thanks steve warm and helpful hosting, the room is clean and new, especially guest has indepent space and can use kitchen. this     is a good experience for me to live in a airbnb room and have a opputinity with host.
66751	6821407	10.0	10.0	52884166	The room was in a great convenient area. Steve's home was very clean and just as described in the pictures. He was also a very responsive host and was quick to answer any questions or concerns we had. Our primary use of this room was just for a place to sleep which worked out great. Overall a very clean and convenient location! 
66752	6821407	10.0	10.0	53079185	This was a wonderful, comfortable stay. Home was really clean, well maintained & had everything I needed. Host was very accessible by text. Places to eat & hang out were all close by as well :). Had a great experience and would definitely come again!
66753	6821407	10.0	10.0	53165680	"The listing description was pretty accurate and the neighborhood around it is pretty nice and has many families around so safety concerns seem to not be an issue. Parking on the street is much easier than on the private premise offered by the host as the space and driveway is pretty narrow for normally-skilled drivers. 

The house itself is newly constructed so everything inside seemed brand new. The host also cleans pretty well and offers very clear instructions about the stay and all other aspects of the Seattle experience. 

If you are a couple, or a single person, and has a car, I would definitely recommend to stay here, particularly for its affordability, location, simple amenities, and host helpfulness. 

However, if you don't have a car, it seems like the public transportation will take about 45 min to get to downtown. "
66754	6821407	10.0	10.0	55284831	Steve was super welcoming and friendly! My week staying there was very enjoyable and he was really helpful with suggestions about Seattle and its different neighborhoods. He met me right when I arrived and was always very responsive by text. I needed to extend my stay for a couple days and was able to do this no problem. His house is super clean and comfortable, the room was warm and the bed cozy. Use of the large kitchen was appreciated and I was able to store some items in the refrigerator. Even though we didn't see too much of each other because we were both quite busy, it was always a pleasure to chat for a few minutes. His place is just a 15 minute walk to many great restaurants and coffee shops, yet is in a very peaceful and quiet area. All in all this was a really great stay, and I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a clean and chill place in the Ballard neighborhood!
67380	5031357	10.0	10.0	31796843	 The  Neighborhood Is very nice,  great view of the water. Easy access. Archana gave great info and was available if needed,but we had no problems. 
67381	5031357	10.0	10.0	43835895	The space was perfect for what we needed for a few nights in Seattle. Great location and easy access in and out of space, and perfect size for couple. Thanks so much! 
68959	8086294	10.0	10.0	45453538	Absolutely fantastic stay. Joe and Heather were outstanding hosts that made me feel welcome in their home. 
68960	8086294	10.0	10.0	46670634	Serene describes the setting perfectly. I spent a very quiet, comfortable time in Joe and Heather's home while searching for a permanent residence. They were fantastic about providing their own personal insights into the various neighborhoods (I was unfamiliar with most of them). I always felt welcomed and well-accommodated.
68961	8086294	10.0	10.0	48832201	Joe and Heather were excellent hosts, and I would recommend the room to anyone! They provided the comforts of home, and were very accommodating with my weekend schedule.  I really appreciated the thought they put in to welcoming me and providing great local information. And the coffee to go was a very sweet touch - thank you!
71541	555182	10.0	9.0	8521658	Deb was timely, helpful, and easy to communicate with. Her house was clean and accessible. I would recommend staying here to anyone. 
71542	555182	10.0	9.0	9134751	Deb's space was absolutely perfect for our purposes, and quite roomy.  The amount of sleeping space was impressive and diverse and felt very cozy.  The availability of immediate street parking was great, and the location was near enough to lots of districts in Seattle proper.  Definite choice for families or a gang of couples vacationing.
71543	555182	10.0	9.0	13844536	"Me and my family (5 members) stayed on Deb's place for a few nights, and it was great. The place is peaceful and relaxed.

Not in downtown (as we knew before), but you need to have a car anyway to get around the city - and supermarket, parking etc are close by.

Deb was informative and available, of course. Recommended for sure.
"
71544	555182	10.0	9.0	13969970	Deb is really accommodating. The house is warm and has a homey feel in it. The set up was fantastic.
71545	555182	10.0	9.0	14465666	"Deb's house is great! Kitchen, refrigerator, bathrooms, living room, bedrooms were all well groomed. It was a little chilly at night but, she left heated blankets for us! Very clear space once checked-in. Artsy touch was not an obstacle. As ""First-time Airbnb-ers"" it was totally perfect.
Thanks Deb!"
71546	555182	10.0	9.0	15266862	"We had a great experience staying at the ""Artistic House"".  Deb was a courteous hostess but did not intrude.  She had no problem with our late arrival time, and went out of her way to get a French press for us (her old one had vanished at some point. )  The neighborhood - Wedgewood, in NE Seattle - is lovely, filled with charming bungalow homes, many with interesting gardens and landscaping.  Also the house is within walking distance of a grocery store which was very handy.
Note however that this is not like getting a vacation rental house where everything is brand new and set up just for you.   This is like staying at a friend's house while they are not there.  So their ""stuff"" is still there - in the closets,the fridge, etc.  And this is an older home, not a brand new ""McMansion"" - it has small rooms, a small, minimal kitchen, and a very small washer-dryer unit.  There is no air-conditioning - the norm for older Seattle homes.   (It cooled off beautifully every July evening we were there, down in the 50's, so with (screened) windows open it was just lovely.)
This was exactly what we expected from the listing, and none of this was a problem for us.  In fact, it was an excellent value for the price.  But if you are looking for a luxury vacation rental home, need lots and lots of closet space., and/or just can't survive without A/C.. this home is not likely to work well for you."
71547	555182	10.0	9.0	15676370	Very old house, photos made it look a lot nicer. host not very personable. Would not recommend. 
71548	555182	10.0	9.0	17093263	"Our family of five stayed here for 2 nights and Deb made sure we had everything we needed and was very helpful and friendly.

The house has lots of character and charm . As another review said it is just like staying in a friends house. If you like a good value house, in a good neighbourhood, handy for Safeway which has everything you need in a homely and quirky way then it is a great place to stay."
71549	555182	10.0	9.0	17434239	My son and daughter-in-law and their 4 children aged 1-10 stayed here for a 4 day weekend. I inspected the place shortly after they arrived. The house is located on a quiet pretty street that is walking distance to excellent shopping.  I found the bedrooms large and well appointed with nice sheets and plenty of blankets for the cold Seattle evenings.  There is one small bathroom but I didn't hear any complaints.  This house was good for our family for two reasons: It is on the ground floor with no steps.  Our one grandson uses a wheelchair and I would highly recommend this house for anyone using a wheelchair.  Also it is located  near the Jewish community so the synagogues are within walking distance.  My daughter in law also invited her brother for 2 days and the house accommodated everyone. We made use of the frig, freezer and tea pot. The living room, kitchen and bathroom of the house have many old-timey features, so if you like that you'll really love this house! Our family used the front yard and the back patio every day-where there was lots of seating and a picnic table.  We were lucky to come on a hot sunny weekend. My son also found some nice parks for the kids nearby and there is a large Safeway two blocks away.  The house had pretty landscaping and garden.  The one thing that didn't match my son's family was the small eating area. But there is a table that seats three and a counter that seats 2 more but they worked it out. Deb had lots of chairs for us and I thank her for that.
71550	555182	10.0	9.0	19248752	Deb met us upon arrival and gave us the tour - I loved the decor; marks of world travels. Located in a nice neighborhood, it was a great location for our business trip - Thank you!
71551	555182	10.0	9.0	23277866	Deb was very easy and pleasant to work with.  The house is definitely one of a kind in Seattle with many interesting objects to enjoy.  Great overall experience!
71552	555182	10.0	9.0	40933893	Deb's home is cute, cozy, and comfortable. She left us fresh blueberries from her sister's farm on the first day! The neighborhood is quiet and safe. Perfect for our young/artsy group!
71553	555182	10.0	9.0	41467608	our whole family of 6 stayed at Deb's artistic home for 1 night .we met with Deb and she showed everything that we needed to know about her space and was friendly.The space was very clean and enjoyable for all of (website hidden) is interesting to look at all that is part of the house ...very whimsical! It worked well for our family to stay there , it is very quiet neighborhood and close to Safeway for any grocery needs. 
73046	1851863	10.0	9.0	8947510	The apartment was exactly as described: simple, but exceptionally clean and comfortable. Susanna went out of her way to insure that my stay was pleasant and that I had anything I might need. Thanks again Susanna!
73047	1851863	10.0	9.0	12596850	Absolutely wonderful place to stay! It was clean and welcoming! Susanna was so kind and helpful. We would stay again! 
73048	1851863	10.0	9.0	13815006	I had a very pleasant stay at Susanna's duplex. With good bus routes nearby, I got around easily without a car. The kitchen is minimally stocked with cookware and dishes, so it might be difficult to host a dinner party there, but I had everything I needed. 
73049	1851863	10.0	9.0	14161175	Susanna is a fabulous host! She is very sweet, welcoming, and available all the time to answer my questions. She makes sure that my stay is comfortable and I have what I need. The apartment is super clean and beautiful. It's simple, spacious, and comforting. The whole unit has a great air flow and enough windows to allow natural lights getting in. Parking space is available right in front of the apartment, internet connection is fast, most furnitures are brand new. The apartment is close to both local and Asian grocery stores; it is located in a great neighborhood and very close to any point of interest in Seattle. This is the best apartment option in the area. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Seattle or looking for a temporary housing. 
73050	1851863	10.0	9.0	14439563	"Susanna was a very gracious host.  We were happy that she reached out to us to get the check-in time and procedure set for our arrival - not everyone does that and we appreciated it very much!

When you rent this apartment, you are renting the entire place - and it is YOURS.  Too often homeowners who rent their place on Airbnb simply push their stuff aside to try to make room for you.  But while you are living here, the entire place will feel like your own.  Loved that.  :)

Cannot say enough about how clean and neat this apartment was.  And while the decor is minimalism at its finest, Susanna has added some nice touches, it doesn't mean that quality has been sacrificed.  We loved the organic teas and spa-like bath soap.  And the washer/dryer are awesome - very powerful yet energy efficient and we appreciated being able to wash our clothes during our travels. We loved that Susanna was available if we needed anything (she lives right next door), but she left us to our own devices and we had complete privacy.

The home and neighborhood were super quiet.  And we slept like babies in the amazingly comfortable firm bed - and the pillows were perfection. We love to go for walks, and while it is one block to a busy street that was not very pretty to look at, simply heading in the other direction brought us through quiet streets.  We didn't know until we left that if we would have kept on going in that direction we would have run into some very cute restaurants and bars.  So be sure to ask Susanna how to get to them.

Thanks, Susanna!  :)"
73051	1851863	10.0	9.0	14703989	Susanna's place was great! It was very clean and even more spacious than the pictures. I would definitely stay at her place on my next visit to Seattle!
73052	1851863	10.0	9.0	14845152	Susanna was a good and kind host. She was easy to reach and tried to resolve whatever issue there was. Her place was very comfortable and exactly what was shown in the picture.
73053	1851863	10.0	9.0	16344606	"I relocated from New York City to Seattle for my new job and before I could lock down on a neighborhood and apartment I needed a place to stay for a month. I'm glad I found Susanna's place here. I had the entire fully furnished apartment to myself. Clean furniture, bathroom, kitchen, comfy bed, included wifi, and a parking spot - it has everything. Also since I stayed for a while the new washer and dryer were perfect. This place literally is the best of both worlds - equipped like a luxury hotel suite but has the roominess and privacy of a house.

Compared to NY, Seattle's summer is cooler and dry. But there were still hot days in the peak of July but the place stayed completely cool throughout. It is right by a main arterial to downtown and has access to the RapidRide which is a quick 20 minute from downtown Seattle. The neighborhood is quiet and noise-free. I also frequently ran in the nearby Green Lake Park - nice large park with tons of activities. There are restaurants, fastfood and supermarkets all within walking distance.

Susanna was very attentive and great in making sure everything is up to spec and even the little details like a fruit peeler is stocked in the kitchen (which I broke!) She even made sure my UPS packages are safe when they left it on the doorsteps. She is always reachable via text. 

I now moved into a smaller apartment downtown, so I kind of miss that Greenwood / Green Lake area. If I ever have friends coming over to Seattle (hopefully to visit me) I would definitely recommend Susanna's place."
73054	1851863	10.0	9.0	16483119	Loved our stay! The place was very clean, close to caf√©s, restaurants, and a grocery store. Susanna was wonderful. She answered questions we had I a timely manner. I'd recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle.
73055	1851863	10.0	9.0	16753238	"My wife and I stayed here for a few days and it was perfect for what we needed. 

Here is the lowdown on this place:
-your own place. 
-Susanna is awesome to deal with and very helpful and kind 
-easy access to downtown. 15mins max on bus and you can also use car2go (get an account if you don't have one yet) so easy and awesome. 
-very clean and comfortable 
-exactly what you see in the pictures and even nicer. 
-20 min taxi ride from the airport 
-you can easily walk to restaurants close by 

we will stay here again if we are in the area. 

thx again Susanna.

73056	1851863	10.0	9.0	16872509	This was a GREAT stay!!! The space is super cute and exactly what I wanted!! it was clean, convenient and Susanna was an excellent host! 
73057	1851863	10.0	9.0	17157112	We had a really good time staying at Susanna's place. She was really accommodating, had great tips for us and even supplied our kids with some sand toys. Thanks so much for having us :)))
73058	1851863	10.0	9.0	17445518	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Susanna's suite. The suite comes with a private entrance, so you have the entire place to yourself. It is also very clean, modern, and extremely comfortable, which was much appreciated. I was really impressed by the washer and dryer in the unit. As a host, Susanna was extremely accommodating, thoughtful, and easy to reach. She went out of her way to make sure I had everything I needed in the unit, and was happy to answer my questions about the area. The house is located close to a main arterial, which means really great public transportation to downtown Seattle. Green Lake Park, located a mile away, is accessible by both foot or bus. I got around by bus for most of my stay and rented a car for one day. During that day, Susanna made sure I had a parking space right in front of the suite. All in all, I highly recommend staying in Susanna's suite and would not hesitate to stay there again. Thanks Susanna! 
73059	1851863	10.0	9.0	18090846	Susanna made me feel very welcome. The unit was exactly as described. It was very clean and quite spacious for a single traveler like me. The kitchen is equipped with plates, silverware, and cooking utensils to make simple meals. The washer and dryer are a big plus. The neighborhood is quiet and centrally located for any day trips you may take throughout the Seattle area.
73060	1851863	10.0	9.0	18324115	We had a great stay in Susanna's home near Greenlake. It was a short drive away from the park and easy access to other Seattle neighborhoods. Her home was spare and minimal, but very clean and comfortable. Communication with Susanna was great and she was always available if we needed anything. Thanks Susanna!
73061	1851863	10.0	9.0	19398508	Susanna was awesome as a host, easily reachable and attentive. The place was very clean and comfortable as well. I enjoyed my stay and would stay again. Only downside is that you must drive to any of Seattle's attractions. 
73062	1851863	10.0	9.0	19639518	We arrived via rental car, easy to find , right off a main road, only 15 to 20 min from Seattle.  The place was very clean, kitchen had what you needed(all most) expect small things like sugar and condiments  which would have been nice. No TV, which we did not need but it would be a nice addition. We were there in Sept so no heat wave but it was a little warm, and unfortunately there is no a/c, but I think that is the norm in the north west coast. Otherwise it really isn't a walking around type of neighborhood,  you really need to drive to a nicer part of town. Green lake is close by and we did go there twice for a walk. It's also convenient to ferry service just 20 min further north. Overall can't complain about anything.  Easy check in and check out.
73063	1851863	10.0	9.0	20141141	This is a very pleasant and comfortable space, with plenty of room and a kitchen with everything you need.  (Although who cooks when there are so many wonderful places to eat nearby?)  Near a main street, but very quiet.  Suzanne welcomed me by maing sure there was coffee in the kitchen, and was always ready to provide information and guidance about things to do and how to get to them by public transportation.   No TV, but the WiFi made it easy to stream things on my laptop.  
73064	1851863	10.0	9.0	20249994	We loved staying at Susanna's place. The apartment was clean, fully equipped, functional, quiet, very comfortable and in a great location. Susanna was there to meet us as planned and gave us a warm welcome. I will look forward to staying here again on my next Seattle visit. 
73065	1851863	10.0	9.0	22561891	Susanna was very welcoming and showed me around the place when I showed up to check in. The place was exactly as cute as pictured and provided a comfortable private sanctuary for the weekend. it had a fine sized kitchen, washer and dryer, great bathroom, and comfortable bed. 
73066	1851863	10.0	9.0	26125232	Susanna was a wonderful and generous host. The apartment itself had everything I needed and was very comfortable.
73067	1851863	10.0	9.0	32164313	Susanna is great.  The place is awesome.  I had trouble one day getting network access and she came over and fixed my computer.  The apartment is quiet and has easy access to downtown.  I wish I could have stayed longer.
73068	1851863	10.0	9.0	42815391	Susanna was a wonderful host and this apartment was great. I stayed here for three months during the summer and I was very comfortable. Susanna was there to welcome me on the first day and she was attentive throughout my stay. When the weather got unusually hot she checked in to see if the apartment was still comfortable and offered to provide me with a fan. The apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the kitchen was good sized. The neighborhood seemed quiet and safe even though it's by a main street. There are some great shops just a few blocks away on Greenwood Ave, and there's super easy bus access right to the heart of downtown. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Seattle!
73069	1851863	10.0	9.0	44899069	Susanna was very gracious to adjust our check in time when our flight was twice delayed. She provided clear instructions verbally and in written form. She was readily available had we needed anything but never intruded during our visit. The guest house was clean, neatly furnished and exactly as advertised. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will recommend Susanna's place to our friends. 
73070	1851863	10.0	9.0	46297814	Really, Really lovely place; it was perfect, actually; an absolute bargain for the price - and the photos don't do it justice.  I mean SO nice, in ways both large (the onsite washer/dryer is a huge plus; made it possible to live a whole week out of just a carry-on) and small (really nice bath fixtures, bedding, coffee & tea, current bus schedule, Wi-Fi boosted & worked flawlessly).  Great location; quiet street, friendly neighbors, trivial to get downtown on the E-line and inexpensive to cab anywhere around.  Most of all Susanna's just a lovely person - so warm and welcoming and kind (when I'd needed that for my week) - as well as a great host:  Makes sure you have & know everything you need - and if you need anything else, she's right next door - and beyond that, leaves you to your privacy / solitude aside from friendly waves and/or quick chats whenever passing one another in the driveway on the way in or out.  Really couldn't have been happier or more thankful to Susanna for this stay - and apologies for not having left her a bottle of wine as I'd intended to say thanks (I'd been offered a lift to the airport and had to take it while the getting had been good).  If she'll have me again, though:  Next time :-)
73071	1851863	10.0	9.0	47343613	Susanna provided a clean and comfortable duplex property.  We felt welcome and secure in her rental unit.  We loved the hardwood floors and bright interior space.  The on-site parking was very nice because the adjacent residential street was often full of parked cars.  Access to the duplex was easy, just 1/2 block off the main street, but the commercial street was very busy so the city noise was ever present.  We enjoyed our stay and would love to visit Seattle again.
73072	1851863	10.0	9.0	48002610	Good place Will definitely book again if I have the chance to visit Seattle
73073	1851863	10.0	9.0	48571323	Had a wonderful stay. Our Seattle home away from home.
73223	7198282	10.0	10.0	39864848	"This experience of mine at Neil's place deserves 5 perfect stars on each aspect (in fact more). Neil was super responsive with all his communications, and flexible with my time of arrival.

On getting inside his apartment, I was completely blown. He has a very nicely decorated place in a quite neighborhood. He and his girlfriend were super friendly and showed me around the whole house.  The room was way better than the pictures suggest. Super  comfy bed, and the bathroom was right adjacent to the room. 

I can confidently recommend to anyone looking for a great comfortable stay, at Neil's place. I will definitely come back!"
73224	7198282	10.0	10.0	41143982	Absolutel recommendable. Neil is a very friendly warm-hearted person. We missed out flight and he didn't charge the room for this night. The house, bedroom and bathroom were big and clean. There were two bus tickets, umberellas, traveller magazines and fresh water on the table like a hotel room. We had a great time there. Thumbs up. 
73225	7198282	10.0	10.0	41544558	"Neil was an amazing host! His house was lovely and the bed was super comfortable. 
His girlfriend made us a welcome package, it was really sweet! Neil was so friendly and welcoming!!
Next time we're in Seattle, we know where we will go! "
73226	7198282	10.0	10.0	41565485	Very welcoming and friendly hosts. Accommodations were excellent. They were astoundingly professional, made it seem like theyd had years of experience
73227	7198282	10.0	10.0	43291820	I'm not a good writer, so I'll make it short. It was a pleasure staying with Neil. Thank you for hosting us!
73228	7198282	10.0	10.0	43581066	"Neil is a 5 star host, he is so friendly and warm. His girl friend is also very nice and considerate. The apartment is clean, quiet and cozy, and has everything that you need even the bus card. Also his house is located near Northgate mall(1 bus stop), so it's very convenient to find restaurants, mall and cinema nearby. The house itself is spacious and very confortable.

For me, Neil is more than a host, he is now a friend. I will definitely visit him again when I go to Seattle next time. A hug from St Louis :)"
73229	7198282	10.0	10.0	44857803	Neil greeted us at the door of his comfortable, clean, thoughtfully set-up home in Seattle and  told us everything we needed to know to have a great stay. The bedroom was as described and was a clean and comfortable space. Neil made many extra touches to make this space comfortable (provided extra towels and toiletries available and labeled the kitchen. ) Great overall experience.
73230	7198282	10.0	10.0	45413525	"Neil and his girlfriend are the best AIRBNB host, the place is a big house and you have access to the hole place, we really enjoyed the kitchen.
I didn't believe how clean and neat they had everything, so organized. They even put extra tooth brushes and other stuff in the toilet in case you forget yours, that's the level of comfort you will get with them.
As far as the neighbor, even tough is not down town you will not drive more than 15 minutes to get there, the green lake park is really close so you can go there to run or if you go with kids it will be great too. In the same area lots of restaurants and coffee shops. I will so much look for them if I ever go back to Seattle, forget about hotels.."
73231	7198282	10.0	10.0	46994660	"Neil has been a very good host. The place is exactly as described. I will certainly come back again.
"
73232	7198282	10.0	10.0	49061274	Neil's place was clean and quiet, exactly what was needed!
73233	7198282	10.0	10.0	52356128	Overall my stay at Neil's house was wonderful (as mentioned in my previous review). The room is nice and clean, contains a very comfortable bed and is directly next to the bathroom. If you are searching for an uncomplicated stay inside a nice house with a great host this might be what you are looking for.
73234	7198282	10.0	10.0	54334783	 This was the best *shared Airbnb I've stayed at. I was very comfortable using the common kitchen and dining areas, and crossing paths with the host felt free of awkwardness. Neil was very kind and welcoming, hands-off but quick to respond to any issue. I could hear the people above and below me. Luckily that wasn't much of an issue. Enjoyed my week stay, great value.
73235	7198282	10.0	10.0	55581814	"I stayed with Neil for 2 weeks when I first moved to Seattle while looking for an apartment of my own. He is a great host, and the bedroom was just as described with a comfortable bed, large desk, and walk-in closet. The house is large with lots of common space, but generally very quiet.  The kitchen was well equipped for the light cooking I did. Parking was easy, and getting to/from downtown isn't too bad by car or bus, just remember rush hour traffic can be brutal.


Neil was prompt with communication before/during my stay and was very helpful when I needed to modify my reservation dates. Overall I would definitely recommend Neil and his house to guests looking for a relaxed and quiet place to stay"
73394	320704	10.0	10.0	895054	I must say, my best Airbnb stay thus far. Jessie's place was very nice and it was just recently remodeled, so there is  new everything! Jessie did a great job designing the place and has a very artsy feel. There is a full kitchen, utensils, an office area, a bedroom, bathroom. She has a TV with hulu and Netflix, so you don't eve need cable (I hooked up my laptop to it using an HDMI cord). Jessie also left tea, beverages and everything else I needed during my stay. If you ever need them they are right upstairs or woking in their photography studio next door. The location is great, lot's of restaurants, coffee shops and nightlife nearby. Downtown Ballard, Fremont & the University District are nearby so you have a lot to do. Also the bed is very comfy!! The pictures are nice but this place has way more to offer than the pictures show, I guarantee you will enjoy it here. 
73395	320704	10.0	10.0	934768	Jessie's place was awesome! Easy to find, private and very clean. Perfect for a weekend get away. There were lots of stores and restaurants near by. We will definitely keep her place at the top for our next visit. 
73396	320704	10.0	10.0	960294	"Jessie at the Redstone abode is a great communicator and all-around nice lady. She was quick to respond to all my emails and questions and when I had concerns she was very helpful.

The apartment is gorgeous, very clean, chic furnishings and nice little extras to let you know she appreciates your business. It is a basement apartment but the stairs to the basement are wide and there is a firm railing. It is well lit and you enter through a lovely courtyard (if you're lucky you might meet a very sweet pup!). The neighborhood is classic Seattle, close to cool neighborhood restaurants and bars, groceries and anything you might need.

I would definitely stay here again and suggest this place for all visiting friends and relatives."
73397	320704	10.0	10.0	969941	Both Jessie and this place are great. Jessie was really helpful in locating good places to drink coffee and eat good food. The place is perfect--clean and well designed. Getting downtown from Phiney was easier than I thought--just 15 min on one bus. I would definitely stay here again when in Seattle and recommend others do the same.
73398	320704	10.0	10.0	997561	The apartment was great!  The location was perfect; close to restaurants, shops, good coffee and bars.  On-street parking was ample.  The little amenities (toiletries, Brita water filter, and towels/linens) were much appreciated!  I didn't use the TV while I was there, but the wifi was speedy and convenient.  Cell phone service was spotty when having conversations, but it was fine for texting.  The apartment is well-maintained and nicely designed.  I hope to be back the next time I am in Seattle.
73399	320704	10.0	10.0	1023536	We loved the Redstone apartment.  It was tidy and quiet and had everything we needed for our stay.  The location was excellent for our Ballard adventures, and Jessie is an attentive hostess.
73400	320704	10.0	10.0	1037358	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 days and we didn't want to leave. We loved the location, Phinney Ridge is a beautiful neighborhood close to everything. We walked to 4 cafe's, 1 grocery store, 2 breakfast places, 1 pizza place, 2 cool bars. There is a ton more restaurants we didn't have the time to go to. The apt was clean, smelled great, fully furnished with everything we needed. It was such a dream vacation! We both felt lucky to have found Jessie's place and will for sure always book it for our future Seattle stays. Ten million star rating!
73401	320704	10.0	10.0	1077853	This is a great apartment in fun hip neighborhood. Jesse has described her apartment just right. It is spacious, has all the amenities. It is within walking distance to Phinney Ridge which is a great area. Also, there was always parking right out front. I loved my stay at this apartment. 
73402	320704	10.0	10.0	1090434	Can't beat the location of this fantastic apartment. Everything you need is included - separate entrance, wifi, kitchen, tv (with Netflix), shower, and a comfy bed. Thank you for letting me stay in your lovely apartment Jessie! 
73403	320704	10.0	10.0	1103004	"The apartment is lovely.  It's very spacious and has a full kitchen.  I took away one ""star"" because I couldn't get cell phone reception, but that's no fault of the host.  Even with that limitation, I'd stay there again!"
73404	320704	10.0	10.0	1128980	"Our stay at Jessie's was more than we expected, so private, so close to public transport, supermarket, cafes, bars and retaurants.  Although we were out most days and only briefly had time with Jessie we found her to be very helpful and accommodating and happy to recommend places to go, things to do.  Jessie's description of the apartment was 'spot on'.  It was clean, comfortable and we enjoyed everything about it. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle - this is the place to stay.

"
73405	320704	10.0	10.0	1143610	"Jess and Cass were incredibly gracious hosts even despite our locking ourselves out while they were out of town! Ugh! The Airbnber's nightmare! 

The apartment is pretty bright given that it's under ground and it's well thought out decor gives it an airy feel. They had wonderful amenities with the extra added touches to set them apart - like glasses in the freezer for a frosty beer and a nice log waiting to be burned in the fireplace. Very thoughtful!

Phinney Ridge is a delightful, funky little town with lots of cool restaurants within walking distance. I was surprised at how easy it was to find parking right near the house - bonus! 

I would highly recommend staying withi Jess and Cass if you get the chance. Very cool people indeed!"
73406	320704	10.0	10.0	1164276	great apartment in a fantastic location, and Jessie is a very thoughtful and accommodating host.  Highly recommended!
73407	320704	10.0	10.0	1229938	The Redstone digs are not to be missed.  I was in Seattle for work and stayed here for a week, and I would not have changed a thing.  The apartment is fantastically appointed and a great stay for anyone wanting to soak up the cool, funky Seattle neighborhoods.  The bed is incredibly comfortable, the area is fantastic, and the logistics couldn't have been easier.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
73408	320704	10.0	10.0	1399022	Had a great time staying at Jessie's place. It was clean and comfortable, and in a great location. Easy access to Greenlake and highway 99 for a straight shot downtown.  
73409	320704	10.0	10.0	1418721	I had a wonderful stay again at Jessie's place. Everything was great and enjoyed the Ballard area. I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. 
73410	320704	10.0	10.0	1447787	The apartment is super clean, tidy, stylish and spacious and its located in a nice neighbourhood uptown. There's lots of great restaurants (Gainsbourg was our fave), good coffee bars and a decent supermarket close by. We enjoyed our stay here as our base to explore Seattle. 
73411	320704	10.0	10.0	1498309	Jessie's place was amazing. Perfect location for my girlfriend and I to relax after exploring Seattle all day. The place is pristine and has an awesome vibe to it.  The neighborhood is nice and quaint with some fantastic little restaurants and coffee shops a short walk from the apartment. It was nice to have access to netflix and wifi on nights we wanted to stay in and re-energize for the next day.  If you are driving, the highways are close enough to make the journey downtown and elsewhere a piece of cake.  There is also plenty of space available on the street to park your vehicle. I would definitely recommend the apartment and I would totally stay there again on another visit to the city. Don't hesitate to book this place, it's worth it.
73412	320704	10.0	10.0	1650369	Jessie and the place were great--very responsive and downright kind to me and my guest who stayed there.  What a great location and neighborhood and a wonderful apartment.
73413	320704	10.0	10.0	1717065	Pictures did not do the apartment justice.  Though my first time in the city/state, I would have gladly spent more time at the house, curled up on the couch.  The bed was so soft, and the shower so hot, that I had trouble getting out of either.  Jessie was an amazing hostess, I could not have wished for better.  Aside from the amazing decor/cleanliness, the location was perfect for a quick (email hidden), a hot cup of coffee, or a yummy dinner, all just a few steps away.  I would recommend Jessie's house to anyone, and if I happen to venture back to Seattle area, I would love for her to have me again.  Thanks for everything!!!!!!
73414	320704	10.0	10.0	1774951	This place is super rad!! Great layout, lots of space, and Jessie was awesome.  We will DEFINITELY stay here again when we come back!!
73415	320704	10.0	10.0	1803529	Wow, this place was amazing! I could have moved in here...Jessie was a great host and I could not have asked for anything more staying here. Next time I'm in Seattle I will definitely try to stay here again. As another reviewer said, this place is so great you have to  make the effort to leave and see the sights!!
73416	320704	10.0	10.0	1834436	A fantastic appt in a lovely neighborhood.  Jessie was a great host who showed us round the appt, gave us advice about where to get the bus, local shops and cafes etc.  the wi-fi was great especially as we had not long finished camping.  Would highly recommend.
73417	320704	10.0	10.0	1999399	We had a great stay at Jessie and Cassie's place.  It's an ideal location and within walking distance to shops, restaurants, and a market.  Easy access to downtown, Greenlake, and more.  The place is designed like a cool hotel and at a much better deal.   Highly recommended.
73418	320704	10.0	10.0	2097562	We had a fantastic time staying with Jessie and Cassie! The apartment is exactly what the photos show. Neat, clean, and easy to get to. Downtown is a quick hop and the neighborhood was cool. The coffee shop down on the corner, Herkimer is the best. We will look forward to using Redstone Apt again!
73419	320704	10.0	10.0	2141052	My husband and I stayed here on a visit to Seattle in late August and we really could not have had a better time.  Jessie has hosting down to an art.  She provided all the information we need to get to her place along with helpful tips about where to eat and how to get around.  The apartment was even better than pictured...very clean and very comfortable!  Phinney Ridge is a charming neighborhood with a nice market and lots of good restaurants, coffee shops, and bars.  We didn't rent a car and found it easy enough to get everywhere we wanted to go by bus or walking.  I would highly recommend a stay here if you are visiting Seattle!
73420	320704	10.0	10.0	2176395	Clean, updated, comfortable, and stylish basement apartment in a great neighborhood location, very close to shops, gallerys and cafes. Plenty of on street parking. Great value!
73421	320704	10.0	10.0	2221717	Jessie's place was absolutely perfect.  The neighborhood is great and close to downtown with a bus route at the end of the street that goes right into downtown.  I'll definitely want to stay here next time I visit Seattle.  I've already recommended their place to a few friends.  
73422	320704	10.0	10.0	2248831	Fantastic place to stay.  Great neighborhood.  There are plenty of places to walk and getting around Seattle is very easy.  I highly recommend Jessie's apartment.  I hope to stay there again in the future.
73423	320704	10.0	10.0	2358908	"I had a lovely stay , and I , as well hope next Spring and Fall when I return I can find her apt,. available. I love the closeness to the busline , the market is great as is the coffee shop , ice cream parlor, and the pizzeria that is just up one block. i am a bit handicap after a broken ankle and I found her home blessed with good footing, sturdy railings and comforting out side lights. I had to give jessie a less star only because the phone connections were so spotty,and there were times i needed to get in touch w/ family. It is not her fault, but it did cause stress.
the place was lovely and i even had a fun experience baking cookies in her oven to give to my boyfriend .  "
73424	320704	10.0	10.0	2481101	"A beautiful apartment in an awesome neighbourhood.
As many have stated before the apartment has everything you could need to feel at home away from home.
Parking right outside the door and only a 15 minute drive from downtown Seattle.
Public transport on the doorstep and a large number of eateries and bars too.
As regular visitors to Seattle we will be back."
73425	320704	10.0	10.0	2553347	I contacted Jessie at short notice and got a prompt reply. Although the place is a bit away from downtown there is a very good strip of bars and restaurants only a few minutes walk away. I went there a couple of nights and met some great locals. The apartment is absolutely gorgeous. Very spacious with everything you need. 
73426	320704	10.0	10.0	2610494	We stayed at Jessie's the 2nd week of October and it was perfect! Found the location to be ideal as we needed to be in all parts of Seattle on various days. Clean, safe and the neighborhood is awesome. Highly recommend it!
73427	320704	10.0	10.0	2674253	Jessie has a great little place for one or a close two people. Easy communications with Jessie and she has a comprehensive set of notes or house rules and offers useful suggestions for nearby coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Easy address to locate and arrangements for checking in and out were clear and accurate. Worth another visit for sure. 
73428	320704	10.0	10.0	2862477	Jessie is a great host and the Apt is even better than advertised. it was really a great place to unwind during a very busy week. 
73429	320704	10.0	10.0	3191191	the place is very cute, well located and nicely decorated.  However, there were some serious shortcomings.  First, there was only one roll of toilet paper, no paper towels, no dish sponge and very little shampoo.  Since we were staying for a week we had to purchase these items ourselves.  Second, the fireplace did not work and made the apartment stink of smoke.  When we pointed this out to the landlord her response was that the prior occupants had no problem with the fireplace, implying we were at fault.  We had to buy candles to mask the smell.  Third, despite being told that Verizon users had good service in the apartment we could never make our phones work and had to stand outside in the wet and cold to make phone calls.  Fourth, we were told that she had a netflix and hulu accounts but every time we tried to use them we were asked for a password and of course we were not provided a password.  Finally, the kitchen was lacking basic goods such as salt and pepper.  Overall, we were very disappointed with our stay.
73430	320704	10.0	10.0	3326821	Great place, great host! Highly  recommended. 
73431	320704	10.0	10.0	3403214	Awesome basement unit with daylight windows. Very well decorated, and finished. Great location with very easy access to downtown and all major parts of Seattle. Laundry machines available. Lots of cafes, grocery stores, and bars a block away. The only thing I can complain about was that the wifi was pretty slow. If you stay here and rely on internet to get any work done, walk down the street to Herkimer coffee. Thanks for the awesome stay, Jessie! We found a place during our stay and are now moving to Seattle. :)
73432	320704	10.0	10.0	3782146	A great apartment in a fun location. Jessie was very communicative and the space was just as advertised. We had a great time and would recommend it to others. As mentioned by other guests, the cell reception isn't great, but that's a small issue. Overall, a really nice play to stay in Seattle.
73433	320704	10.0	10.0	3985892	A clean & spacious 1-bedroom apt in a great neighborhood!  It's a basement apt but very well-lit and colorful and has small upper windows for air.  Comfy bed, kitchen area with everything.  I was on a writer's retreat so my favorite part was the handsome office with desk against the decorative barn wall.  A short walk to gorgeous Phinney Ridge where there's a slew of fun restaurants and coffee houses.  
73434	320704	10.0	10.0	4077820	"Jessie's place is super clean, well kept and tastefully furnished. It's also good on more particular things like nice soap, a place to hang your clothes and good heat & water pressure. I was impressed when I arrived to be within a few blocks of a street or two of local cafes, coffee houses & pubs. Made outgoing calls easily online in spite of the reception issues. Getting downtown by bus was easy. If you are there to explore the city but like being a part of the neighborhood, I'd recommend this place. Seattle has a bunch of adorable houses and Jessie's is one of them.   
"
73435	320704	10.0	10.0	4494660	How Seattle has changed! In So many wonderful ways. To start, Jessie's neighborhood is perfect. North Greenwood has so many nice restaurants and a two of the best coffee shops in all of Seattle(Herkimer being my favourite) You're a short bus ride from Downtown and a pleasant walk downhill to Fremont and Ballard which are so so nice. Jessie obviously has a lot of aesthetic taste as the place is so nice the pictures don't even do it justice. The bed is comfy, the couch cozy, and you have more space than you ever need at such an affordable price. We didn't use the full-kitchen but would have if we had been more disciplined about our money! Thanks so much! 
73436	320704	10.0	10.0	4555373	Great location to many fun neighborhoods in SEA - easy street parking and access to public transport.  Comfy bed, good water pressure.  If you have AT&T you will not get coverage while in the unit (basement) so keep that in mind if you intend to work during your stay. 
73437	320704	10.0	10.0	5101597	Jessie was wonderful. Adorable place, easy access to downtown an great food.
73438	320704	10.0	10.0	5163766	The Redstone apartment was great - clean and spacious. Really awesome location if you are interested in checking our Seattle's real neighborhoods. Phinney Ridge is really cool and has awesome views on a clear day. Parking was super easy. The only downside was the spotty wi-fi and cell reception so this would not be an ideal place if you are trying to do some work, but otherwise a fantastic place and quite a deal.
73439	320704	10.0	10.0	5248022	This was a wonderful place to stay! Couldn't have asked for a better accommodation during my time in Seattle. The pictures Jessie posts about her place don't even do it justice: so cozy, cute, clean, feels like home, and in a great area. Highly recommend!
73440	320704	10.0	10.0	5319169	"Jessie's place has been my BEST experience with AirBnB!

We were in Seattle for 5 days and loved staying at her apartment. While it's not walking distance to downtown, it is only a bus-stop away and the route is lovely. 
The place is walking distance from great restaurants, coffee shops, super market & a lovely park where you can go walking/running. The street looks like out of a fairy tale: wonderfull front lawns, lovely colors, full of flowers... 

Before you arrive, Jessie shares a PDF document that has the full details of the house and restaurant recommendations. This was super helpful for us. 

It's located on a basement so it gets a bit cold (especially for us coming from the tropics!) but it gets heated instantly and is super comfortable. Everything is brand new, wonderful shower pressure, very equiped kitchen to cook whatever you want and a perfectly working wifi. 

If you are traveling to Seattle and want to live the full experience, this is definitely your best option.

73441	320704	10.0	10.0	6147388	Really good time in Jessie's house. The apartment was exactly as the pictures shows and she was a very nice host!  The neighborhood was amazing, the people was so nice and there is a big market 3 blocks from the house where you can find everything you need. There were very good bus connections to downtown and u-district as well.  My personal recommendations: don't miss to try Red Mill Burger, go to Greelake and if you like wine try Conde Valdemar (Spanish wine, you can buy it in the market near the house - Ken's Market).
73442	320704	10.0	10.0	6273978	Jessie's apartment is aesthetically pleasing, very clean and very close to all of the lively amenities of Ballard and Phinney Ridge. I would be happy to stay here agin in the future.
73443	320704	10.0	10.0	6486960	Jessie's place was so wonderful; I fell in love with the area. And, Jessie was so easy to contact and pleasant. Her place was the first airbnb experience I had and I'm glad it was! Thanks, Jessie.
73444	320704	10.0	10.0	6957238	"This is a great apartment! Super clean, super comfortable. 
There are a lot of really good restaurants and bars near by... Red Mill burgers are great! And there¬¥s a farmers market that is open on the weekends just a couple of minutes away.
Jessie is really nice and helpful. 
I would totally recommend this apartment. "
73445	320704	10.0	10.0	7068671	We really like Jessie' apt. It's really cozy and the neighbors are friendly. The location is good. We really felt relaxed in this apt. We come back again when we traveling in Seattle.
73446	320704	10.0	10.0	7555957	Jessie's place is the cutest little BNB ever!  Although we were only there to sleep mostly, it was clean and very cozy.  The place was GREAT!  Thanks Jessie.  We will be back.  :)
73447	320704	10.0	10.0	7743368	My first time to Seattle, and first time using AirBNB and I was completely blown away with this apartment. It is exactly what the photos offer, and more! The place is comfortable, relaxing, clean, and splendidly fitted with funky decor art and features that make you feel right at home. The bed was to die for! So comfortable! The lounge area and kitchen had everything I needed for my stay and I appreciated having the study space, although I did most of my work lounging on the couch. The bar is a nice touch to the house, and although I did not partake in the beverages, it was nice to have the option to have a drink if I needed it. The location is excellent, with a few minutes up the road you arrive to an amazing organic market where I managed to pick up dinner several nights for under $10. I loved my stay at Jessies place and will recommend it to all of my NZ friends visiting here in future. Thank you so much for having me, Jessie
73448	320704	10.0	10.0	8133447	Great spot with all mod cons near to local bars, restaurants and coffee shops of Phinney. Jessie has put a lot of thought into the place making it a very comfortable spot to stay.
73449	320704	10.0	10.0	8750300	"My wife and I stayed in Jessie's apartment for a month during the fall and had a great time.  Other reviews have noted it is cozy, and it certainly is--but that doesn't mean it's small!  It is organized as a studio with the bedroom separated by a sliding partition, but that's probably to comply with the fire code, because the open floor plan is at least as big as a good-sized 1 bedroom apartment.  It is probably 700-800 sqft, and has plenty of storage space throughout the kitchen, bath, bedroom and other areas for whatever you might be carrying.  As stated, we were there for 1 month, but could have stayed indefinitely!

Other nice features which aren't obvious until you get there include an extra-wide range/oven (36"" instead of the typical 30""), plentiful on-street parking, a very soft and comfortable bed, lots of bright lighting options, fast & effective heaters, and a double-basin kitchen sink with a waste disposer.  There is excellent sound isolation between the apartment and the house above it.  PCC, the best organic grocery in Seattle is within walking distance (about 1km). The apartment was also very clean, and very recently remodeled, with many well-chosen, high-quality materials.  It is delightfully obvious that the designer had a great sense of both style and practicality.

We entertained many pairs of local friends at the apartment during our stay.  All commented favorably, and at least half also asked us to email them the AirBNB link.  So don't hesitate--if this apartment is available, jump on it!"
73450	320704	10.0	10.0	11400049	"If you're thinking from the pictures that this place is too good to be true, you'll be happy to hear that what you see is really what you get.  My husband and I stayed with Jessie for a month while looking for our own place to move into in Seattle.  Not only was it great to have a ""home base"" ready for us as soon as we arrived in town, but we found the apt to be beautiful, clean, and spacious.  Having access to Netflix was also a bonus that we thoroughly enjoyed ;)  The apt is also in a great location... walking distance to lots of cute stores, cafes, restaurants, bars, and buses going downtown... it didn't take long for us to fall in love with the neighborhood.  Our only discomfort came from having next to no cell phone reception in the apt.  But Jessie was pretty upfront about that and we found her to be responsive about anything else we may have needed during our stay.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay while in Seattle. "
73451	320704	10.0	10.0	13008851	Had a great time at Jessie's place! Everything worked out well and the neighbourhood was great for our trip. Everything you might need really is within a very short walk.
73452	320704	10.0	10.0	13570866	"Everything one needs is within a brief walk: coffee, grub, groceries, and a major bus line. Yet this space is serene, quiet. Very private feeling; instantly felt like home. Fully stocked kitchen, soft bed, ample space. Well appointed and graciously provided.

Very rewarding maiden voyage into AirBNB land!"
73453	320704	10.0	10.0	14277451	"We had a great two week stay in Seattle and absolutely LOVED the neighbourhood. Greenwood has everything you need a few minutes away - grocery stores, bars and plenty of restaurants. 

Pros
- Fantastic neighbourhood
- Plenty of on-street parking
- Large oven and fridge/freezer
- Stylish furniture
- Great office space
- Great host communications

Cons
- Patchy wifi with no in-apartment router to reset when needed
- No cleaning supplies provided so it was tricky to keep the place clean for longer stays. The crumbs encouraged bugs.
- Lacking in general supplies: toilet roll, washing up liquid, oven tray, smoke detector

All in all - it's in a great location at a great price. Jessie was really accommodating when we asked to extend out stay before arrival. If you're looking for a great value apartment to use as a base for exploring Seattle this would be perfect. If you're looking to make somewhere a home whilst you visit for few weeks then perhaps not so much. 

Value and location was great, but some of the details did impact our stay in comparison to other Airbnb experiences. "
73454	320704	10.0	10.0	15112765	The listing was accurate.  This is a great place to make a home base in Seattle.  Great neighborhood, close to where I used to live.  Jessie's place is awesome, private, cool and convenient.  We will stay there again when we visit the Emerald City.
73455	320704	10.0	10.0	15377001	"Fantastic place.  Roomy, modern and clean.  Nicely done. 

Ladies, bathroom lacks a plug to do your hair and there's no other mirror in the place.  Internet is dicey as mentioned.  My husbands Verizon Galaxy and laptop worked fine but my T-Mobile Ipad and  would not connect to the internet.    If you're high maintenance this may not be the place for you."
73456	320704	10.0	10.0	15651071	The pictures don't lie. The place is big and very well done. Coordinating everything was/is easy. Very professional. Great location. Tremendous value. 
73457	320704	10.0	10.0	17155798	Great neighborhood and close to our son!  It was spacious and had all we need!
73458	320704	10.0	10.0	17512409	This apartment was comfortable and for the price, it served us well while we visited Seattle! I do wish that it had some more natural light (it is actually in a basement so it is dark and has a few spiders) and that it was a bit closer to the popular parts of Ballard. We had trouble communicating with Jessie before our trip, and she actually avoided ever talking to us in person despite being home while we were there. In the past, I have had the most wonderfully welcoming and hospitable AirBnB hosts all around the world so the bar has been set quite high, and unfortunately, I can't say the same about this host. In the end, the apartment had what we needed, and it was much nicer than the other options that were available to us.
73459	320704	10.0	10.0	18320916	Beautiful apartment with great style. The neighborhood was lovely and we had a wonderful time exploring. I know it sounds cliche but we felt right at home. Nothing bad to say. Highly recommended!
73460	320704	10.0	10.0	18719884	"The apartment was very nice.  It was clean and spacious.  The bed was comfy. Jessie has this place looking very nice. 
The only issue we had was that the wi-fi signal was weak. This especially was an issue when trying to use the streaming apps on the tv.  Signal kept dropping and the video would stop. 
The neighborhood was very quiet and the bus stop was close by.  "
73461	320704	10.0	10.0	20546514	Lovely place with an awesome style. Totally fell in love with the neighborhood too. 
73462	320704	10.0	10.0	23014535	The basement apartment is beautiful and very spacious, although there is A lot of sound transfer from upstairs to the basement. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely. Easy bus trip to downtown. However there are no cleaning supplies(even dish soap or a broom) so for a longer stay this can be difficult. Wifi is weak and no cell service in apartment. 
73463	320704	10.0	10.0	23606477	Neighborhood was nice and quite. Walking distance to everything and I mean everything. If you want to go downtown bus stop was a around the corner too. Cass was nice and very easy going. Her instructions were simple and to the point.
73464	320704	10.0	10.0	26926792	The listing description was accurate; everything was as expected! The room is spacious and private. It's in the heart of Phinney Ridge and just a block and a half away from some great bars, restaurants and stores. Was able to meet Cass and she was super friendly and accomodating. Highly recommended. Only minor complaint is that I'm a fairly sensitive sleeper and woke up a couple times due to noises upstairs, but Netflix kept me company when it needed to. Speaking of connection to the outside world, I have AT&T and had no reception. Verizon seemed to work. Overall, clean, comfy and cozy!
73465	320704	10.0	10.0	33023061	Cass was great.  The apartment looked exactly like it did online.  The location is perfect if you're looking for a quiet place to stay while visiting the city.  It's only a short Uber ride away from Downtown Seattle and the shops of Old Ballard.  Cass provided a great outline of places to visit and things to do that were near the apartment.  
73466	320704	10.0	10.0	33512166	We had an awesome time in Seattle at Cass's place!! It was everything that was described in the posting and more. The neighborhood is just perfect for what we were looking for, so close to so many great places to eat and super close to downtown. Cass was very clear on her expectations and house rules which makes it easy to be a good guest! We had the pleasure of meeting her and her roommate and they were both very nice, vibrant people with lots of suggestions for us. Definitely check this place out if you're in Seattle, it felt like a home away from home to us. Thank you Cass, so much! 
73467	320704	10.0	10.0	33956057	Beautiful home in a cool neighborhood. Like others have mentioned there is no cell reception in the place because it is underground so you'll have to rely on the Internet, which was unfortunately a bit spotty when we stayed there. Case was very responsive though so that was great. 
73468	320704	10.0	10.0	36873189	Great place, great location, Cass was very responsive to messages. Place was great clean and as advertised. The phone service was spotty (which was advertised) but there is Wifi.
73469	320704	10.0	10.0	38221611	"This was a great little apartment! We stayed July 8th - July 12th. The apartment itself is beautiful just enough room for 2 people! There was also access to a computer which was really nice! We never met Cass but she was very responsive to any needs we had via messaging! 

Phinney Ridge is a quaint little neighborhood! It was great having a full kitchen and being able to cook breakfast (Ken's Market is also right up the street for groceries/supplies). I will say if you are looking for some night life though this is definitely not the area to stay. 

A cab ride from the airport (granted we did land around 1:00 AM) did cost almost $77, so if possible I would recommend Uber (that was only $35)

Overall we had a great time and will be looking forward to our next Seattle visit! "
73470	320704	10.0	10.0	41194484	We loved staying at Redstone! Cass was friendly and helpful... We had a couple of little dramas during our stay, but nothing was a problem to fix at all. The apartment was awesome and had everything we needed. Phinney Ridge is a charming town...everyone was incredibly friendly, and everything we needed was within walking distance, bus stop to town was close too which was great. All in all it was brilliant! Thanks Cass!! 
73471	320704	10.0	10.0	45373903	Basically as described. Would be good for a very short stay I expect. Very nice neighbourhood.
73472	320704	10.0	10.0	46161541	We were impressed the minute we walked into the apartment (and even before when we drove up to Cass's place).  It's exactly as described.  We wanted a place in walking distance of cafe's, bars, etc. and the apartment was only a few minutes away.  Having a private entrance was great in that we felt we could come and go without disturbing the tenants.  Parking was easy and there were always a few spots right out front and if you know Seattle, this is quite a plus.  Where we stayed definitely enhanced our already amazing trip to Seattle.  Thank you!
73473	320704	10.0	10.0	49150007	Everything about this place is fantastic! The location is great, just a (very) short walk to bars, restaurants, and an amazing market. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, it was truly a joy to stay here for 2+ weeks! Cass was extremely welcoming and helpful, if I wasn't moving here I would stay here again and again!
73606	5805907	10.0	10.0	29029872	Great little basement room in a great location. Close to pubs and restaurants and a bus stop. Very comfy bed and a sweet xylophone. The hosts are very welcoming and offered full use of their kitchen and upstairs bathroom.
73607	5805907	10.0	10.0	29238497	"Aurelia and Tim were very warm and welcoming.  They provided me with everything that I needed for my stay.  I had a beautiful big bedroom with lots of natural light and a super comfortable bed.  

Thank you! "
73608	5805907	10.0	10.0	29642258	Room was clean and spacious; easy to get to downtown via bus stopping only a few blocks away; very friendly and responsive hosts!
73609	5805907	10.0	10.0	29881822	"This is an incredible location in a welcoming Seattle neighborhood.  This home is only a few blocks from a lake, public bus route, a bakery and countless enticing eateries.  
Aurelia and Tim were really welcoming and very open to sharing information.  I wish I would have been around more to get to know them.  They even left a note on the door to welcome us and they had little notes explaining where light switches were and other helpful information.  They were also very communicative when there might be noise.  This was a perfect spot for me because I was out all day and it is very quiet at night.  But during the day you can hear noise in the living room.   
Overall I would come back again.  Thanks Aurelia and Tim!"
73610	5805907	10.0	10.0	30161441	Super sweet people!  Great location and very spacious.  Private entrance is very convenient.  Their dog Blue is so darn adorable!
73611	5805907	10.0	10.0	30244557	Very lovely place to stay!  Spacious and inviting.    Aurelia and Tim were very welcoming.  Will definitely stay here again!
73612	5805907	10.0	10.0	30370574	Very welcoming people and a great place to stay. It was a quiet, comfortable night :)
73613	5805907	10.0	10.0	30520688	Great neighbourhood, affordable and accommodating hosts. 
73614	5805907	10.0	10.0	30591279	Great experience! Tim and Aurelia had a great place. The description of the place was prefect! Just what we were looking for 
73615	5805907	10.0	10.0	30799894	The room was beautiful and spacious, just like in the listing. It was really nice to have the private entrance and our own bathroom down the hall. It felt like our own nice space, and we didn't have to worry about disturbing anyone. Aurelia and Tim were very welcoming, recommending lots of nice sights in the nearby neighborhoods. You can tell that they've put a lot of love into the room, adding little touches like cozy chairs, warm lighting, and books. It was a wonderful place to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. 
73616	5805907	10.0	10.0	31059002	*Arrival: notes greet you and help you find your way around the house & even a welcome letter with neighborhood recommendations. *The space: Very large and private room below the main house (to call it a basement would make it sound dark, there are large windows and plenty of light). There's a comfy queen bed, a couch, a nice chair to lounge in, and cool art on the walls. A dimmer switch for the lights next to the bed is super helpful as you're bedding down for the night. *The hosts: The nicest! Aurelia & Tim are super cool, gracious hosts who want to make sure you're happy. If you want privacy, the downstairs space is your own sanctuary, but I recommend heading up to the kitchen to say hi. *The conclusion: If you're staying up in the Green Lake area, this is where you should stay.
73617	5805907	10.0	10.0	31249186	Aurelia did a great job making us feel welcome. The room is exactly as pictured and the bed was the most comfortable bed I've slept on at an airbnb. There's also a private entrance and bathroom so it's almost like having an entire studio to yourself. The neighborhood is gorgeous and just two blocks from Green Lake.
73618	5805907	10.0	10.0	31398398	"Aurelia and Tim are some of the most friendly and welcoming people we have ever met. The room and amenities are exactly as described/pictured. The room is probably bigger than I expected. 

We stayed for one night with our 4- and 2-yr-old, and they loved it. The downstairs bathroom does not have a tub, but Aurelia and Tim offered us their upstairs bathroom to use the tub to wash our kids. They also have a ton of kids books that kept our kids very entertained. The xylophone in the room was very popular with our kids. They enjoyed the stay so much that they didn't want to leave.

The area is awesome for kids. It's a block away from the zoo. It's about a 3-block walk away from Green Lake, which is great for walking/jogging around. Lots of great local restaurants in the area too.

We would definitely stay here again. Hope this review helps you feel great about your decision to check out Aurelia and Tim's place!"
73619	5805907	10.0	10.0	31671944	Everything was great at Aurelia and Tim's! Accommodations were clean and cute - we had everything we needed. Bed was super comfortable, too! We felt welcome and the whole process was very easy. Thanks!

The bed is super comfortable and the massaging chair was just awesome! The private bathroom is cute and we had everything that we needed. The private entrance makes it feel like you have your own place. The place is in a really good neighbourhood and there were some lovely restaurants and shops close by. Aurelia and Tim are both really friendly and super helpful people. It was so nice to got to know your little family :) we enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend it! 
73621	5805907	10.0	10.0	32078152	We loved staying with Aurelia and Tim! The room was large, bright, and relaxing. We slept extremely well  in the comfortable bed. Aurelia and Tim are super friendly and generous, sharing their home effortlessly. Their daughter Amara is adorable and very social. We would love to stay with them again next time we're in Seattle.
73622	5805907	10.0	10.0	32132766	"The home of Aurelia and Tim was beautiful, comfortable and cozy. We felt very welcomed.
Everything was perfectly arranged for us. They even had a list with recommendations including some neighborhood restaurants and bars. We tried out two of them. The food was amazing.
We could come and go any time. It was super uncomplicated and easy-going. The accomodation is also appropriate for families.
Since we had travel plans, we only stayed for one night. We wished we could have stayed longer. The best airbnb place I have been so far!
"
73623	5805907	10.0	10.0	32282980	Tim and Aurelia were fantastic hosts and their space is quiet and so comfortable.  There are helpful notes around the space to help you get acquainted with the room, which was a nice touch.  I would not hesitate to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle!

Aurelia & Tim are great hosts. They made sure I was aware - in advance - of activities in their house that may have had an impact on my stay, left instructional notes about the space with information about heat, lighting, and included a guide to local eateries. By the way, the bed is amazingly comfortable. 

If you need a simple, peaceful place to stay then this it."
73627	5805907	10.0	10.0	41341734	We loved staying at Tim and Aurelia's place and couldn't have asked for more.  We arrived late-ish and everything was laid out for us and there were clear instructions on how things worked.  After a restful night, we visited with them in the morning.  They were very kind and generous hosts.
73628	5805907	10.0	10.0	41864023	My friends and I stayed at Aurelia and Tim's place for a weekend in Seattle. They are lovely hosts and the accommodations were on spot. Good location close enough to the city centre to get around easily. I would highly recommend a stay!

Thanks again!"
73895	2723368	10.0	10.0	12574723	Connie lives in a quiet residential neighborhood in north Seattle, just east of Ballard. It's out of the way -- in a good way -- yet convenient to all parts of the city. She offers what amounts to a main-floor guest suite, with a bedroom and attached private bath. The rooms are clean, well-lit and comfortable and Connie provides a selection of breakfast foods. She's an engaging hostess and if you're lucky, you may get to meet her identical twin sister! 
73896	2723368	10.0	10.0	13057176	Connie is a wonderful host with a beautiful, very spacious house. We enjoyed our three nights a lot and would highly recommend to stay there, especially if you like an included breakfast, two bikes to explore the city and a garden you can bbq in. Thanks!
73897	2723368	10.0	10.0	13478066	"Our host Connie was very nice and polite. We only saw her a few times during our stay and it was always pleasant.

The room was small but clean and having our own bathroom with separate shower and sink areas was very nice. The house was well kept and quiet. The neighborhood likewise was very quiet and nice. It's a good place to get away, not too far from anywhere including downtown.

I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay in the future."
73898	2723368	10.0	10.0	14247947	Connie's place was lovely and fit our needs perfectly.  We were only able to meet her briefly before she went out of town but she was very kind and hospitable.  We even enjoyed some fresh raspberries from her backyard! 
73899	2723368	10.0	10.0	14332000	Connie was so accommodating to help me out with a last minute reservation.  Her friend was able to let us in since Connie was away.  The home was spacious and lovely.  The room was cozy and clean.  We were only a short drive from the Fremont area where we grabbed a yummy dinner out.  I'd stay again and would love to meet Connie.
73900	2723368	10.0	10.0	15497782	Connie was the best! Everything was as described and more so. We felt like friends after 10 minutes or so (my wife and Connie grew up in the same hometown). Highly recommended!
73901	2723368	10.0	10.0	15833405	Connie was an excellent host! My boyfriend and I could not have felt more welcome and at home than we did at her Phinney Getaway. The house itself was spacious and beautiful, with a great view of the mountains both from her back porch and front lawn. She also served us a delicious breakfast every morning, and often went out of her way to make special accommodations. We also appreciated her overall very welcoming but laid back and unobtrusive demeanor. The house is in walking distance to bars, restaurants, and coffee shops just a few blocks away, as well as about a 20 minute walk to both downtown Ballard and Green Lake. We will definitely be back! 
73902	2723368	10.0	10.0	16014049	Connie's place was excellent. The location is superb, just near Green lake and a quick bus ride from downtown Seattle. The home is well taken care of and Connie has done a fabulous job gardening  in the back, with delicious raspberries during summertime. The view of the Olympic mountains and Puget sound from the breakfast table is amazing. I also had an enjoyable time getting to know Connie and learning about her work as a yoga instructor. She was quite accomodating of me when I had to arrive late a couple of nights. I am quite grateful. I would gladly stay at her place again. 
73903	2723368	10.0	10.0	16131447	I enjoyed a most comfortable overnight. The bed is extremely comfortable, the shower is great, and breakfast is delicious. I would definitely stay again.

The location is excellent as well, just across the Wood Land Park Zoo and there are various nice restaurants, cafe and a pie store near by there. We enjoyed the park in fornt of zoo, the cozy room and the kitchen with fabulous view. I am grateful for Connie's host, she is really hospitable and willing to take time for guests. I think there are no more words to prove how excellent Connie's place is besides we had flighted for 13 hours away from our country and stayed there for one month with immense gratification . 
"
73905	2723368	10.0	10.0	19284102	What a wonderful setting!  And we came at the perfect time of the year.  Connie was a great host and very gracious in giving us access to the entire first floor - great kitchen with eat-in table, dining room, living room, and most importantly - a GREAT deck under the trees and next to her garden.  Fresh raspberries were plentiful and delicious!  Our room was comfortable and the bedroom and bathroom spotless.  Thank you, Connie!  We'll be back!
73906	2723368	10.0	10.0	19534521	We loved staying at Connie's.  She was welcoming and gracious.  The room is small, but the main floor --including living room, dining room, kitchen with dining area and beautiful deck and yard is spacious, very clean and aesthetic.  We actually ended up having guests visit us there, which we had not expected, and everyone felt comfortable and at home.  It is a lovely home, fabulous deck with view.  We highly recommend it!.
73907	2723368	10.0	10.0	23429025	"I had a wonderful time during the 2 months I spent at Connie's place. She is always available and very helpful, an excellent host!

The location is just great, with plenty of places to eat and lots of mexican restaurants nearby (walking distance). The neighbourhood is friendly and makes you feel at home: I even participated in Halloween and Thanksgiving activities (love it!). The place is also very quiet, and I tremendously enjoyed it.

Overall I highly recommend it and will certainly stay at Connie's place again if I come back to Seattle in the future!"
73908	2723368	10.0	10.0	23985827	My brief stay was great in every way. Connie is a wonderful host, and the guest room & bath is fine. Bed is good too! I chose it for location close to an event in Ballard; I think that's important in Seattle, or you spend a lot of time driving. This location is very convenient to several of the central areas.  
73909	2723368	10.0	10.0	24301090	Connie's place was very homey and welcoming. While the bedroom was small, the bed was very comfortable and the connecting bath areas were clean and well appointed. I appreciated her homemade chai tea and hospitality.

The house seems very new. The bedroom might seem a little small but overall you won't feel it since the other parts of the house the living room and kitchen is very big and overall a great experience.  

Nadia and I certainly had a great time. Connie is truly a superhost."
73911	2723368	10.0	10.0	25603362	Very nice host and accommodations.  Location was ideal for my needs.

Close to the Woodland Park Zoo, which we visited the next day."
73913	2723368	10.0	10.0	32847821	Everything as listed.  Good coffee, great view and a pleasant, friendly host.
73914	2723368	10.0	10.0	35225026	Thank you for your hospitality Connie. I had a pleasant stay with you. I appreciated your suggestions of things to do and the offer of your bicycle. I especially enjoyed your yard - great view, beautiful flowers and lovely neighborhood.
73915	2723368	10.0	10.0	36120562	Connie was a great host. We ran into each other a few times during our stay. The listing is very accurate, the house is beautiful and warm. There's a lot to offer in Phinney, and it's fun to walk the neighborhood with great views, coffee shops, and tasty things to eat.
73916	2723368	10.0	10.0	39143397	A lovely (email hidden)anquil setting and close to restaurants/services and public transport.Connie is attentive but unobtrusive.I spent almost a month there and had a great time.If you enjoy gardens and gardening this will be an added bonus.Highly recommended.
73917	2723368	10.0	10.0	39325357	Connie's home on Phinney Ridge was a very quiet and comfortable place for my parents to stay, about a 15 minutes walk from my place.  Beautiful home and nice yard.
73918	2723368	10.0	10.0	39465773	Great place to stay in a beautiful neighborhood. Connie was an accommodating host, and even gave us apples on our way out! This was our first airbnb experience, and we would definitely would stay here again.
73919	2723368	10.0	10.0	39629298	We had a wonderful time at Connie's place. Great location, beautiful view, and quiet. Bedroom and adjacent bathroom are very comfortable. We would definitely stay again.
73920	2723368	10.0	10.0	40231988	"Connie was easy to communicate with prior to arrival an during our stay. She is a lovely friendly lady and made us feel welcome in her gorgeous home. The area of Phinney Ridge is wonderful - lots of gorgeous tree-lined street, fabulous homes and gardens and a lovely cafe scene. We fell in love with its laid-back, BoBo charm. It's easy to walk (downhill) to Fremont (and to get a bus back from there or the city).
Connie's home is spacious, comfortable, charming and has lovely views. The guest bedroom and bathroom is a good space, quiet and cosy. 
We loved staying at Connie's, feeling part of a neighbourhood and meeting Connie's sister and brother-on-law who live next door!"
73921	2723368	10.0	10.0	40385449	My parents stayed with Connie for the last two days and had very positive things to stay about the experience.  When I came to pick them up Connie was very welcoming and friendly.  In addition to being a lovely host, the residence boasts a beautiful garden and an amazing view of the Olympic Mountains.
73922	2723368	10.0	10.0	40638891	Connie was helpful. We had to leave very early in the morning and she helped us figuring out the right amount of time to get to Anacortes Ferry terminal. 
73923	2723368	10.0	10.0	41091757	Can't really add anything that anyone else hasn't stated here - Connie's is a phenomenal place to stay at in Seattle and pretty much unbeatable value. I lived in Seattle 5 years and know the cleanest, safest, best locale neighborhoods to live, and Connie's house is right in the middle of all of those decriptors in phinney ridge. The room is cute and not very big, but the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is all yours! Just as nice as any upper echelon hotel room, but the rest of the floor is also yours to explore if need be, and the yard is fantastic. Connie herself is super sweet and convivial without invading on your personal space and time - a perfect host. A wonderful airbnb experience - once again, super highly recommended. 
73924	2723368	10.0	10.0	43023130	We really enjoyed chatting with Connie, and the breakfasts she made for us.  Connie had information about events going on and shopping nearby (though our focus was on looking after our grandchildren who live a few blocks away).  Connie's house is attractive and comfortable. The neighbourhood of Phinney Ridge is quite beautiful with older houses and great views of the Olympic mountains across Puget Sound.  Walking north on Phinney or adjacent streets is very pleasant, but guests should perhaps be cautioned that the east-west roads on each side of the ridge are quite steep.
73925	2723368	10.0	10.0	43324755	"I had a short but very pleasant stay at Connie's house. The neighborhood is very quiet and family oriented, and is within a short walking distance from a few small inviting restaurants.

Upon arrival Connie greeted me with a delicious pear cake made with pears from a tree in her backyard."
73926	2723368	10.0	10.0	49405481	Connie's place is in a quiet residential neighborhood, the bed is very comfortable, and we slept great after a night out in nearby Ballard. Fresh ground coffee in the morning, and fruit from the garden for breakfast! The area is full of wonderful old homes, and very close to the Woodland Park Zoo. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay, Connie.
73927	2723368	10.0	10.0	49802505	A friend and I stayed with Connie for a dance weekend and found the experience very pleasant. The house had enough space that we were able to come in late without disturbing Connie and location is great. The house is kept a little cooler than I like, but Connie offered to adjust the thermostat, which was perfect.
73928	2723368	10.0	10.0	51406961	"Connie was a wonderful and sweet host. It was very nice to wake up and have a delicious coffee cake and some wonderful conversations. The rooms were kept so neat and clean. 

Thanks for a wonderful stay Connie!"
73929	2723368	10.0	10.0	52539950	I stayed for a week with Connie, and she was a wonderful host providing for all of my needs. I appreciated her attentiveness and also the fact that she gave me plenty of privacy. The room was comfortable and it was wonderful having accessing to the kitchen. In addition, the location is convenient to downtown as well as many great neighborhoods.
73930	2723368	10.0	10.0	53435132	"Host Connie quickly and kindly came to the rescue when I was able to travel last minute to Seattle for family business. Although out-of-town, she arranged for her sister to welcome me to her lovely home. First floor room with a big cozy bed and a separate bathroom a few steps away. Conveniently located in a quiet, safe area with plenty of free street parking. 
I fell in love with the quiet Phinney Ridge area, the fall foliage, and the view of Puget Sound from the kitchen window and garden plantings. 
Connie's sister graciously offered me her ferry schedules and info regarding nearby eateries, gas stations, etc. I would be happy to return."
73931	2723368	10.0	10.0	54223849	Connie was a warm and wonderful host that provided everything I needed.  Her home was in a great location for me to explore and take in the zoo, along with walks and the meetings I needed to get to.  She was a warm and very helpful person whose space was exactly as described, warm and comfy....and green.  Yeah.   Thanks so much.  Love to return.   
73932	2723368	10.0	10.0	54858110	Connie was a perfect hostess. She made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  She even checked on us when we had a 24 hr. virus.  Our room, bath and bed were so comfortable and we had open use of the kitchen and living room. Her home was quite conveniently located and there was a spectacular view of the Olympic mountains.  We hope to stay with her again. 
73933	2723368	10.0	10.0	55266718	"Connie is a lovely host!  Her home was inviting, clean and conveniently located.  It was more like a B&B, the pear coffee cake was a hit.

Would definitely would rebook and refer this Abnb!"
73934	2723368	10.0	10.0	56269327	Connie was very welcoming and the room was as advertised. We would for sure stay here again. 
73952	4947002	10.0	9.0	27695966	"Place is a mini Oasis, close the Green Lake, the Zoo, easy-easy access to downtown.  I would recommend this to anybody visiting Seattle.

Host is ""just the right amount of friendly"".   Made sure everything went well, was quick to answer any questions, provided insights into the surrounding area."
73953	4947002	10.0	9.0	28682577	Keith's guest house is fantastic! So cozy and comfy! Keith had yummy cookies to welcome us...what an added treat! Great location! Bongos cuban restaurant is within walking distance - so good! We would love to stay at Keith's place again! 
73954	4947002	10.0	9.0	30312343	Our host made us feel welcome by first of all coming to find us when we got lost.  When we met them they were incredibly warm and greeted us with warm hugs like friends and freshly baked cookies were waiting on the table.  The place is very homey and clean and comfortable.
73955	4947002	10.0	9.0	31785646	Keith was an amazing host, he accommodated us very well. The house was clean, spacious and he left instructions on everything as well as some tourist advise and recommendations. Overall it exceeded my expectations and if i go back to Seattle, I'll make sure to contact Keith again. 
73956	4947002	10.0	9.0	34167620	Keith was an excellent host. Extremely helpful and open with his home. Perfect little self sustained apartment. Great location next to a lake and plenty of pubs. I would recommend anyone coming to Seattle to say with Keith. 
73957	4947002	10.0	9.0	34699012	Host made us feel welcome, listing correct, location safe.
73958	4947002	10.0	9.0	35041018	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
73959	4947002	10.0	9.0	41730842	Keith was a  wonderful host. The place was spacious, clean and well organized. There was plenty of tips for Seattle newcomers, like myself, that were much appreciated. Wonderful restaurants and a bus into downtown within walking distance (less than 2 minutes even!) I would definitely recommend staying with Keith!  
73960	4947002	10.0	9.0	42818057	Freshly backed cookies, clean house, lightly stocked refrigerator,  and a personalized note addressed to our family was our welcome to Keith's house.  He also provides brochures,  and a binder with detailed information to help plan your activities while you visit the area.
73961	4947002	10.0	9.0	45056100	We had a fantastic experience at Keith's place. As a completely separate downstairs apartment, it had absolutely everything we needed. The full-size kitchen was great ‚Äì I could have cooked a five course meal for my family - but Keith gave us some AMAZING local restaurants to try and there was no need to cook. There was a ton of space and I recommend it for anyone with teenagers. Centrally located to everything you need in Seattle, and Keith and his wife are just fantastic people. Communication (and parking) just outstanding and I recommend with two thumbs up.
73962	4947002	10.0	9.0	49445523	Keith was a great host! He was easy to get in touch with, the house was very clean, and he left freshly baked cookies.  Keith was very informative and had a binder of information for guests. The house is conveniently located near a variety of restaurants and beautiful Greenlake! 
73963	4947002	10.0	9.0	50527736	Keith and Sue were wonderful hosts- they were available but left us our space as we liked. The location was perfect. Walking distance to Phinney Ridge shops and Greenlake, super easy access to the Rapid Ride bus to get downtown. The house was well-appointed. Traveling with 2 kids we appreciated the laundry facilities, extra towels, blankets, etc. We are looking forward to coming back next time we are in town!
73964	4947002	10.0	9.0	52327704	"Keith (and wife Sharon) were great hosts - great communication - pleasant and accommodating.  Home is exactly as described, was clean, bright, well stocked, VERY comfortable beds, FANTASTIC location within easy walking distance to GreenLake, Phinney Ridge, bus stop, easy car parking out front, thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Our ONLY caveat is that you will be more comfortable staying here if you are not taller than 5'9"".  It is a basement apartment, as he states, but the ceilings are low.  We were both 5'9"" and 6'2"" and had to ""duck"" often."
73965	4947002	10.0	9.0	54296626	The listing of the flat was spot on--fabulous; perfect for 4. The location was amazing, with great street parking, 1 block to easy downtown bus, a fabulous Cuban restaurant across the street, and cute shops/nice market within easy walk. And the lake! What a fun place to walk and people watch! Keith was very kind, making sure we had umbrellas, and all questions answered.  I can't imagine a better place in Seatle!
74027	6577729	10.0	10.0	34811334	The house was very nice and clean with a great kitchen.  We were welcomed and the owner did what he could  to meet any requests we made.  The location is close to a good variety of shops playgrounds and grocery stores. 
74028	6577729	10.0	10.0	35003212	Morteza came and introduced himself shortly after our arrival. He was working on the yard so he could check in on us after we arrived. The neighborhood is quiet and feels safe. The place was great for our needs. There is plenty of seating and the beds were comfortable. Morteza was quick to respond to any messages or questions. It was easy to get to UW from there so it was worked perfectly as a base while there for my son's graduation. Highly recommend. 
74029	6577729	10.0	10.0	38001082	"Morteza was a great host!  Very accommodating and it was great how fast he responded to messages and questions - even when he was on holiday himself! 

The place was clean and very tidy and the photos are well representative.  A great grocery store and deli just up the street as well.  Kitchen renovation is recent and nice."
74030	6577729	10.0	10.0	38402090	"The host was very accommodating, even when we added two people to our party last minute. He made himself available for any questions and was prompt to respond. 
As for the apartment, the location was perfect. A 15 minute walk to Green Lake, which is surrounded by numerous coffee shops, eateries, and relaxing pubs to grab a drink. It was very family friendly and perfect for a warm summer's day. We were also only two blocks from a small grocery store to stock the kitchen, as well as some great breakfast spots to fill up before a full day in the city. 
The apartment was clean and comfortable. It housed 8 of us without any trouble, though we did bring a camping mattress for two guests. What we really enjoyed was the back porch, which allowed for us early risers to have a place to drink our coffee/tea while the others slept in without disturbing them. 
My only complaint would be the small children who lived upstairs. They can be loud on the weekend mornings, running across hardwood floors, if you are trying to sleep in.  "
74031	6577729	10.0	10.0	39056064	Very decent nice location and nicely furnished, had good communication with Morteza. He even dropped some coffee and bits round for us.
74032	6577729	10.0	10.0	39563104	Morteza was the most gracious host; he replied to all inquires in a very timely fashion, and checked to make sure all was OK during our stay.  The apartment was clean, and neighborhood safe and quiet. My son and I stayed there for 5 days/4 nights.  Good value, especially during the peak summer vacation period in Seattle.
74033	6577729	10.0	10.0	40218836	This apartment was nice to stay great neighbors and very centrally located. Morteza made our stay in Seattle a wonderful event. 
74034	6577729	10.0	10.0	41100884	Had a great 3 night stay at Morteza's bungalow.  The unit was as describe and depicted in pictures. Very convenient location, while on a quiet street.  Was perfect for our family (me, wife and 2 young children) bouncing around Seattle for the weekend.  As for Morteza, he was a wonderful host.  Very responsive to emails, and often proactive reaching out to me with helpful information.  The place was in great shape when we arrived with a number of very thoughtful additional welcoming touches.  Again, we had a great stay and I am sure you will too if you book this place.  Cheers!
74035	6577729	10.0	10.0	41402360	Comfortable and clean in a friendly, walkable, charming neighborhood. Host was available if we needed information, but not intrusive. Easy access to bus. We felt truly welcomed and amenities were just what we needed. We would definitely recommend this apartment. So great to visit a city and feel like a local. 
74036	6577729	10.0	10.0	43111542	We had a great stay at this rental.  The apartment was as described and was the perfect amount of space for our group of 4.  The location is great; it's less than a half-mile to Green Lake and just a couple blocks to Greenwood St., which has lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and a grocery store.  Morteza was a great host.  He responded promptly to all of my messages and was available for any questions.  
74037	6577729	10.0	10.0	43834879	"Morteza was a wonderful host! Directions and access to the apartment were clear and easy. The location is excellent! A good market, excellent restarurants, a lovely consignment shop all withing a two bock walk. A great neighborhood to wander around as well and within walking distance of Green Lake. Also easy public transportation to downtown Seattle or the University.

The apartment is lovely and comes fully equiped including landry, blow dryer, and ironing board for those who might be traveling for work. The kitchen is well equiped and Morteza generously left a bottle of wine and bag of coffee. My daughter's only advice was to include an ice cream scoop to make it perfect and to be able to take full advantage of new gelato shop at top of hill!

Lovely little outdoor porch to eat breakfast on where to work while looking out over the trees and yards. 

Everything was clean and well stocked. 

We had a couple of snafus with keys (not due to host!) and Morteza was available and helpful in resolving the issues. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend it for families, business travellers, or anyone looking for an accessible, attractive, and comforatble stay in Seattle.
"
74038	6577729	10.0	10.0	44436977	We enjoyed staying at Morteza's home very much. It was very clean and most comfortable. Morteza was in touch from beginning to end...a most gracious host. We met him in person just before we were leaving. Super nice. Our home for 4 and a half days was in a great neighborhood, parking was never an issue, wonderful markets close by. Very walkable area, close to Green Lake, the zoo, etc. I would definitely recommend Morteza's home to anyone looking for a nice alternative to hotel living.
74039	6577729	10.0	10.0	54900273	Nice house. Enjoyed our stay
74040	6577729	10.0	10.0	55389465	"This charming 2 BR flat is located in a very walkable neighborhood in the Phinney Ridge/Greenwood neighborhood.  Restaurants and shops are a block away.  

The flat was perfectly clean, the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen is well-equipped.  We never saw Morteza (he welcomed us over the phone), mostly because we were occupied with our famly during most of the visit.  He checked in on day two to make sure we were entirely comfortable.  No complaints."
74041	6577729	10.0	10.0	57226342	Morteza was the perfect host; the apartment is perfectly located and thoughtfully curated, a very welcoming space. Just steps to the great restaurants and bars of Greenwood, and a few minutes to Greenlake. Highly recommend!
74042	6577729	10.0	10.0	57922053	My mom very much enjoyed staying here while visiting us. The apartment is comfortable and homey, and in a lovely neighborhood, just a block from coffee shops and grocery on Phinney Ridge. It's well appointed with a newish kitchen. Morteza is a great host - responsive and helpful. 
77230	825574	10.0	10.0	16210824	Anne was wonderful to work with.  She was very responsive both prior to and during the visit.  Anne introduced herself, but left us to ourselves while we were there, and was very respectful of our space and privacy. The apartment was beautiful, just as pictured, and very comfortable.  The neighborhood was ideal for us - a little bit removed from downtown, so quiet, yet still accessible through public transportation, with several nice restaurants within walking distance.   And only a 15-20 minute bus ride to city center.  I would definitely stay at the Urban Oasis again when I come back to Seattle.
77231	825574	10.0	10.0	17374753	"Anne's urban oasis in Seattle is great! The apartment is the downstairs of her house and is obviously recently remodeled with great care. Despite being downstairs (partial basement) the space is very light and very spacious. The apartment seems like a high-end hotel suite - the linen on the bed is very high quality, the bathroom is great, the living room/dining room is comfortable with very nice furniture. The kitchen is basic but functional. In short, the space is incredibly nice and we were very happy staying there.
Anne was also a very nice host. She accommodated a change for us in the stay and was easy to communicate with before the stay. She has made a little folder for the neighborhood and we walked to several of the recommended places. The apartment is within easy walking distance to very nice restaurants and cafes. We really enjoyed the neighborhood. 
I would very much recommend staying at Anne's apartment. "
77232	825574	10.0	10.0	17838834	Anne was an excellent host and her place was fantastic!!! We felt right at home and loved the neighborhood. We tasted wonderful food from restaurants Anne recommended and breakfast at Coastal Kitchen was yummy! We couldn't have been happier!!! Thanks Anne! 
77233	825574	10.0	10.0	18098974	"""Urban Oasis"" is a lovely apartment space with a wonderful host!  The private apartment is located in a beautiful part of Seattle's Capitol Hill District, and is walking distance to numerous shops and restaurants.  It is also only a few blocks from the transportation line that will take you into the Downtown area.  My boyfriend and I were only in Seattle for 2 nights, and wanted to explore all areas of the city. We were able to park our car for the entire time in Seattle, and travel by foot or bus (which is exactly what we wanted).  
Anne (who is incredibly knowledgeable about the city), was able to give us a great list of ""where to go"" and ""what to see"".  The apartment also has a binder filled with various restaurant menus and additional information about the city (bus schedules, etc).  Upon our check it, we were also greeted with a plate of freshly baked cookies :-)
If you're looking to stay in a charming, zen part of the city, I would recommend staying here."
77234	825574	10.0	10.0	18320069	Anne made me feel very welcome.  Not only does she provide a lovely apartment to stay in, I found cookies waiting for me.  The apartment was very well appointed and I could have cooked for an army with all the dishes provided, but I didn't.  The only thing I didn't find until the last day was a box of tissues which were in plain sight (almost) in the bedroom. 
77235	825574	10.0	10.0	19330570	"Anne's apartment is fantastic! The space, which appears newly remodeled, is clean, quiet and elegant and is lacking nothing.  We could have happily stayed for weeks. Although there is a well equipped kitchen, there are so many great dining options within a 5 minute walk, we rarely used it. Anne was great about steering us toward the best eateries and other nearby attractions.  The location is really amazing--quiet, safe neighborhood streets accessible to good food, coffee and great ice cream--all life's essentials. 

Anne was great about keeping in touch, laying out expectations and her whole listing is spot on. We will return for certain"
77236	825574	10.0	10.0	19697020	It is a great place. Very tastefully redone. It was great for me to relax and get ready for a long work day! No negative feedback at all. My only issue is the price. I come to Seattle about 5 times a year and my org won't pay for this more than once.
77237	825574	10.0	10.0	20516674	"Anne's apartment met all of our expectations.  We had a car so it was easy to find.  We didn't have any trouble finding parking on the street in front of the house.  

The apartment is very quiet and had everything that we needed for a comfortable three day visit.  It was spotless which is obviously a high priority for Anne.  We would definately return and highly recommend it to others.  "

We met Anne on our second day in town and she was able to provide some really great recommendations. Comfy bed too! Thanks for having us! 
77242	825574	10.0	10.0	25877067	Great neighborhood, lovely apartment, warm, helpful, responsive and welcoming host. Comfortable bed, newly renovated apartment. We have no hesitation at all about staying again and again. It is by far the best we have found on Airbnb on Capitol Hill.
77243	825574	10.0	10.0	28032186	Lovely apartment in a charming neighborhood. I really enjoyed the stay and having the ability to walk to the local restaurants. Anne was very informative and professional. I'd definitely stay at Urban Oasis again.
77244	825574	10.0	10.0	29751090	Once again we had a wonderful stay at Anne's apartment. It is quiet, spacious, calming and, best of all, in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle. Several great restaurants are less than a block away and many others a short walk. Great coffee and even groceries are within a short walk and  downtown is a 10 minute car ride. Anne is accommodating and unintrusive and has done a beautiful job of decorating and maintaining the apartment. We will continue to make this our home base when visiting Seattle.
77245	825574	10.0	10.0	32123460	I love Anne's apartment which is large and super clean! She almost provided everything we needed. The decor of living room is cool and light is bright. The restaurants in neighbourhood are quite good. It was a nice experience staying there.
77246	825574	10.0	10.0	33151616	What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! Beautiful home in a neighborhood well-situated for getting around the city. The Urban Oasis has all of the amenities you'd need and a nice level of privacy. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family! Thank you, Anne, for sharing your place with the AirBnb community! 
77247	825574	10.0	10.0	33521407	The place was perfect for our little family.  It was clean and up to date.  We met Anne briefly as we entered the place.  She left us alone, unless we had a question or needed something.  The neighborhood was cute with several restaurants around the corner.  I would definitely come back if we return to Seattle.  Thanks Anne!
77248	825574	10.0	10.0	34330762	"The apartment is huge and very clean.  Everything looks like it's new and it's all well maintained.  Overall the apartment is amazing and it's a great place to come back to after a long day out in the city.

The neighborhood is amazing, it really is an oasis.  Every day I woke up and walked to a different coffee shop to try something new and you can always find something good to eat in the neighborhood.

Anne was a great host, she even came down to greet me despite me arriving close to midnight.  She has great recommendations for restaurants and things to see in the are and made the experience great."
77249	825574	10.0	10.0	34961119	This place is amazing! Clean and very spacious, the pictures do not do it justice. It is in a great area of Seattle with many restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bakeries, etc within walking distance. We had a rental car during our stay and parking was quite easy on the street. Anne was a gracious host, she was easy and fun to chat with if we needed but let us do our own thing which was nice. I would not hesitate to stay here again!
77250	825574	10.0	10.0	35229377	We were so happy with our experience staying at the Urban Oasis. Just as described and even better than the pics. Very open plan and very clean inside. We loved it! It was so nice having our own apartment for the time we were there. Anne was so helpful with directions and tips. It is in a fantastic location and only a $6 uber right into downtown area. Couldn't be happier :) thanks so much Anne :) 
77251	825574	10.0	10.0	36124335	Fantastic place to stay! I loved the space. Everything was so clean, which I appreciate, as well as being comfortable and homey. Anne had many nice amenities and details throughout the apartment. Fully stocked kitchen, wonderful bathroom, beautiful large sofa, and comfortable bed.  It is nicer than the photos. It is a really great space. I thought it was sweet she even had an urgent care number listed if needed. The apartment was very quiet, but you could hear people walking above in the house easily. 
77252	825574	10.0	10.0	37160414	The place was perfect: clean and comfortable. Such a great location. We had everything we needed. Anne was responsive and her instructions were easy and straightforward. Thanks for providing a lovely launching pad for an awesome weekend in Seattle! 
77253	825574	10.0	10.0	37661107	"The Urban Oasis was even better than we had expected! The neighborhood was quiet, yet just couple blocks away you had all the services needed like nice park, grocery store, restaurants etc. And the place itself was a true oasis, and decorated with such a good style! During our stay it was a heat wave in Seattle so the apartment was for us a cool oasis after a long day of sightseeing and exploring the city. Many thanks to Anne, absolutely the best place on our three week road trip in States & CAN.

"
77254	825574	10.0	10.0	38553232	Anne's flat was very welcoming and cosy. Everything was spotless, the furnishings elegant and functional and the kitchen well stocked. The neighbourhood is very quiet but has plenty of restaurant options nearby; it's a short 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle. Parking on the street is free and was never a problem. It wasn't entirely clear to us from the description of the flat that it is in a basement, but a reasonable amount of natural light gets in and as noted the flat is very nicely arranged, so that surprise ended up being a minor disappointment. Anne was a welcoming host who gave us useful tips about the neighbourhood and nearby activities.
77255	825574	10.0	10.0	38994046	Urban Oasis was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. The apartment was spotlessly clean and very well organized. Ann was the perfect host and responded very quickly to our queries. I would have no hesitation in recommending Urban Oasis. 
77256	825574	10.0	10.0	41072247	"Anne was an amazing host and we had the best time in Seattle. Her home was clean and comfortable in an amazing location! She also helped out with great neighborhood advice when we needed it.

I will definitely stay there again the next time I am in Seattle."
77257	825574	10.0	10.0	41366431	Our stay at Urban Oasis was great! The place and the location was perfect to discover Seattle. Within a block from the apartment there are great restaurants and coffee places as well as some cool shops and Anne had created a really good list with the best places. The apartment had everything you need and was very clean and tidy. We would definitely stay here again! 
77258	825574	10.0	10.0	44644703	John and I had a wonderful and very relaxing stay in this gem of an Airbnb accommodation. The apartment was really comfortable and very stylishly decorated with plenty of space inside and with a small front yard where we enjoyed our morning coffee while watching people and dogs walking by. The location was perfect too, in walking distance to several really good restaurants, bars, coffee shops and ice cream places.  Access to public transport was excellent - and it took only 10-15 minutes to get to downtown. The host, Anne had provided us with plenty of information on how to get around and with lots of good restaurant recommendations. We would definitely recommend the Urban Oasis for anyone visiting Seattle for a getaway or a longer stay as it immediately feels like your own home in a very pleasant neighbourhood.
77259	825574	10.0	10.0	46273956	"This location is excellent! We walked and took public transit everywhere and were out and about each day of our stay. It was great to be able to walk around the corner to a solid dinner spot upon arriving late our first night in town. After dinner each night we enjoyed walking around the Capitol Hill neighborhood, there's lots of beautiful houses to check out and it felt like a very safe and welcoming neighborhood. The apartment itself is very nice, well designed, and completely updated. It's easy to get in and out, private, and very quiet (although you will hear the host family walking around in the house above). The kitchen is nice and full of whatever utensils you need. The place even had a nice TV (with cable), and a sound system (which we didn't get to test out).
"
77260	825574	10.0	10.0	47359874	Urban Oasis was just as the name suggests, a home away from home, clean with attractive interior design on a quiet street accessible to various shops, markets, restaurants, and parks. Anne was away during our stay and returned the day of our departure. She was responsive via email and text to a question we had about how to use the remote controls. The kitchen was conveniently stocked with all the necessities for us to cook on occasion. We mistakenly thought we had another night reserved and therefore were not prepared to check out on time. After Anne alerted us of this, we rushed to gather our belongings and set off to find a Plan B! Overall, we enjoyed our stay and highly recommend the place to others looking for a true Urban Oasis. 
77261	825574	10.0	10.0	47690890	"This was a great place in a lovely neighborhood with great restaurants/coffee shops within easy walking distance.  Restaurant suggestions were great by the host.  Space was fully furnished with kitchen/laundry and everything you might need.
Really highly recommend this place.
15 minutes from the downtown area/Space Needle/Pike's Market and not hard to find at all.  Parking on street was always easy to find."
77262	825574	10.0	10.0	49777743	Just a beautiful little stay in Capitol Hill! Anne was fabulous, exceptionally informative, and an impeccable host - straight down to the fresh cookies that awaited my arrival. Having a washer and dryer available to use at one's leisure while traveling is a PHENOMENAL perk to this Air BnB. The location is also unbeatable. I fell in love with the neighborhood, as I was warned I would!
77263	825574	10.0	10.0	50320140	My husband and I had the most wonderful stay at the Urban Oasis! We felt right at home and absolutely loved the location. Great restaurants, coffee shops, and a delicious ice cream parlor right around the corner! Anne was a fantastic host. She gave us wonderful tips on the area and the city which we followed and made our weekend that much more enjoyable. We even arrived to home made cookies! There is no where else we would have rather stayed! 
77264	825574	10.0	10.0	51148915	Anne's home was comfortable and as welcoming as herself! Anne said hello after we settled in and offered up some local recommendations to help us get our bearings in the neighborhood.  The apartment has a built-in, automatic fireplace which was perfect during a light Seattle rainstorm.  It's quite large with all the accommodations one would need- kitchen, stocked bathroom, even a laundry room.  At night, we slept well in a cozy, plush bed.  In all,  a fantastic location, a great place, and a lovely host!
77265	825574	10.0	10.0	53353629	Anne was an absolutely wonderful host with and amazing home! This was my first time in Seattle and I absolutely fell in love. Thank you so much for such an outstanding trip!

77267	825574	10.0	10.0	55386761	Anne was a great host! The listing was even more beautiful than the photos portray. It was walking distance to everything in Cap Hill, which was perfect. Anne left easy to follow directions too. I would stay here again!
77268	825574	10.0	10.0	55864613	"The Urban Oasis was fantastic. Well situated in Capitol Hill near several boutique shops and restaurants. All the amenities one looks for in traveling: personal space, a full kitchen, a well appointed bedroom and bathroom and even laundry if you need to get it done on the go. I highly recommend this spot for Seattle visitors and know where to stay when I'm back in town!

Thank you : )"
77269	825574	10.0	10.0	56207715	Anne was great. The suite is exactly as listed - brand new, clean and cozy. And the neighbourhood is perfect - centrally located for getting around Seattle, and convenient for just going out for a walk and having a dinner, a drink or a coffee at one of several great restaurants and cafes on 19th Ave.
80235	5625964	10.0	10.0	33975621	Jill and John were excellent hosts and very knowledgeable about the area! Their home is beautiful, parking was very easy, and there are so many shops and restaurants within walking distance. Their description was definitely accurate. I had a wonderful experience staying at their place and will definitely stay with them again! 
80236	5625964	10.0	10.0	34507406	"Wow!  If my future hosts all turn out to be as wonderful as Jill and John, then I will no longer ever consider googling hotels.  These two have the kindest hearts.  From the moment I entered their home and was greeted by a home-cooked dinner, to the thoughtful gesture of leaving me a bar of chocolate, these two are amazing!
  Room was cozy and lived even better then its photo.  The Landmark seminar I was attending was a 12 mins. walk down the street.  They are tucked away from the partying of the Freemont district but perfect distance to enjoy its festivities.  Coffee shop and bus stop are only one block away!  Stay here - you won't be disappointed!"
80237	5625964	10.0	10.0	34740035	Jill and John were incredible hosts. Their home was very nice and they went out of their way to make me feel welcome.  They were full of kindness, offering to help me out in numerous ways as I was relocating to Seattle.  They truly went above and beyond what was required of them. 
80238	5625964	10.0	10.0	35012417	I really enjoy the stay in their house. The room is very comfort. Its place is perfect to see beautiful scenery in Fremont. And the transportation to downtown is convenient. Last but the most important, Jill and John are very nice and welcome! Hope to stay with them, when I stay in Seattle next time!
80239	5625964	10.0	10.0	35333742	V clean n quiet neighbourhood. Easy to take the bus to town. Parking is free n u wud feel safe. Value for money stay. Our rating wud b 4 STARS! 
80240	5625964	10.0	10.0	36206254	Jill and John are very warm and welcoming. This was our first Airbnb experience and it could have not gone better. The house was easy to find, the room very comfortable and conveniently located (by the front door so you do not risk disturbing anyone should you return late) and the living space offered a wonderful view and ambiance to drink your morning coffee. The bus downtown is a block away and there are some coffee shops and cafes just as close. My only regret is that we did not stay longer. We will definitely be looking into staying here again should we return to Seattle.
80241	5625964	10.0	10.0	36430388	Had a great stay with Jill and John. Their place is lovely and clean. A great location to explore Seattle. We had a whirlwind trip and didn't see them much, but would recommend their place to anyone!
80242	5625964	10.0	10.0	36976268	Jill and John made us (fellow hosts!) feel very welcome - we'd rented out our house, needed a nearby place to stay and so we were lucky to have them so close!  Jill  and I had easy communication before our arrival, she showed us around when we got there, we had a nice conversation with both Jill and John, and they were easy to share space with..Of course, the location is great, their home is spacious with a nice upper floor with a view of the mountains and sunsets, and our bedroom was perfect.....
80243	5625964	10.0	10.0	37187955	Jill and John were great hosts! Very accommodating and respectful. We wish were able to extend our trip! It is a great location for a short stay; clean and bare necessities :)
80244	5625964	10.0	10.0	37608100	"We had so much fun with Jill and John. They are great hosts, especially because they are so interested in so many things and they already have seen a lot of different places around the world. We spent a lot of time talking about all kind of things. It was great, thank you Jill and John!
Their place is really nice. It is calm and absolutely clean. And it has a very good busconnection from a bus-stop near to the house right into downtown. 
We always would come back and absolutely recommend this place. "
80245	5625964	10.0	10.0	37870951	"Jill and John are fantastic hosts, and the kindest, warmest, most interesting of people.  From the moment I stepped into their home, I was welcomed‚Äînot as a guest, in the commercial sense‚Äîbut as a friend they just hadn‚Äôt met before.  
The room was clean and tidy, with a very nice private bath.  There is a nice view of the water through the sliding window, which opens to welcome a cooling breeze in the evening.  
I got the impression that if I had wanted to be left alone, my privacy would have been their priority.  But I was pretty excited about the coming weekend, and didn‚Äôt need to be left alone,.  Besides, I liked them as soon as we met, so we spent some time together.  They are the most gracious of company.  
I came to Seattle looking for a place to stay for the night, and left with two wonderful new friends.   "
80246	5625964	10.0	10.0	38402190	"The home was lovely, clean, and very well kept.  Even though we arrived very late due to our flight arrival time, Jill waited for us and welcomed us.   The room is beautiful and just as pictured. The bathroom was stocked with plush towels and basic necessities.  Jill also showed us where the kitchen was located and welcomed us to use the refrigerator if needed.  She also provided us with a key that enabled us to come and go as we went to our appointments/engagements in the area.

Parking in this area can be a bit of an issue but we always found a place to park. "
80247	5625964	10.0	10.0	38616838	Jill and John were so great! My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay here. It was a beautiful room/home, and the area they live in is absolutely amazing. They left us notes in the mornings giving us directions to the bus, and lots of recommendations on things to do downtown and in the area. We enjoyed our time in the neighborhood and their area than we did in the downtown/touristy areas! If we come back to Seattle, we will definitely try to book with Jill and John! 
80248	5625964	10.0	10.0	39036677	Jill and John were wonderful hosts - if we are back in Seattle, we would certainly stay here again! Fremont is a great neighborhood - close to good coffee shops and restaurants and breweries - just be ready to walk up and down some Seattle hills!  We had a great time exploring the area and getting to and from all other parts of Seattle by car or bus was incredibly easy.  Their townhouse is perfectly designed for guests - we had a comfortable room and bed with our own bathroom and the entrance to the house is right out the bedroom  -so we came and go as we pleased.  We had a fun time talking with Jill and John and loved their recommendations!
80249	5625964	10.0	10.0	40611563	Jill and John were amazing courteous hosts.  They have a great place and it was a pleasure to stay there. Highly recommended.
80250	5625964	10.0	10.0	43232136	Jill and John are wonderful hosts, who provided lots of information for us. We had a lovely time in their house which is very clean and has loads of facilities if you need them. It is very close to Seattle by bus, and the town of Fremont is great for arts, food and quirky sightseeing! Would love to come again someday.
80251	5625964	10.0	10.0	44316762	"Jill and John were perfect hosts. They were  friendly and helpful, and they were very knowledgable about what was going on in the local area. The house is in a great spot with lots going on within walking distance, and it's incredibly easy to get public transport to all of the tourist spots in the city. 
The room was comfortable and clean, and it was also great to have access to the washer/dryer and kitchen area. 
I couldn't recommend Jill and John more, this was basically the perfect airbnb!"
80252	5625964	10.0	10.0	44809959	Jill and John were wonderful hosts. Besides providing a clean, comfortable, well-located room in one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Seattle, they made me feel welcome. They also shared important information about getting around -- where to catch the No 5 bus, a key transit mode from Fremont to downtown -- and about some of the delights of their own neighborhood. They were also simply good people to talk to.
80253	5625964	10.0	10.0	45263593	"Great neighborhood and Jill was looking for us as we had left a time of arrival. Very inviting and a friendly couple awaited up. They had just lost electrical service and explained how we could easily manage should the problem continue but it did not. It was the result of a wicked wind storm just a few hours earlier.
The room itself was just inside the door, very private, just right for us.
The living area was relaxed, warm and inviting and if we return to the Seattle area would likely try to find open days with these hosts again."
80254	5625964	10.0	10.0	45693755	Jill and John were excellent hosts and were available to greet us even though out travel was very dated. Lovely home just as shown in the pictures, great guest room and private bath. AMAZING location right near all the happenings of Fremont. Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Seattle. 
80255	5625964	10.0	10.0	45939520	Our host, Jill made us feel welcome and made sure we were comfortable.  The room is well-appointed and  private with its own entrance.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. We only booked the room for one night but would be happy to stay longer.  The location in Fremont is very convenient with shops and services within a few blocks.
80256	5625964	10.0	10.0	46739979	Jill and John were such warm and inviting hosts and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Their home is beautiful and the private room and bathroom were even better than expected. It's very convenient to take the bus so we parked our car on the street and didn't touch it for our entire stay. Jill and John gave great tips on where to go and how to get around. Fremont is a very fun neighborhood with a great mix of restaurants, cafes, shops, and nightlife. Unfortunately our stay in Seattle was short, but if we were to come back we would definitely try to stay with Jill and John again.
80257	5625964	10.0	10.0	46890955	The listing was accurate except everything was even better than promised. The house was very clean and beautiful in a Zen, calming way.

80258	5625964	10.0	10.0	47371507	Jill and John are very kind people. Jill greeted us when we arrived and showed us the room.

80259	5625964	10.0	10.0	47657412	"This stay was one that makes you go ""I wish I lived in Fremont"" being showcased by the wonderful Seattle trademark townhouses. The room was as depicted, but the bed's comfort can only be felt once you're there. I had a stuffy nose (that I had previously), but slept very well at night. Jill was very nice to accommodate our requests, and we even exchanged tips. The Fremont neighborhood was also very nice with views from atop the hill, as well as delicious diners, Theo's chocolate factory just a walk down. I would go back to stay with Jill and John over and over again."
80260	5625964	10.0	10.0	47910244	Fantastic! My boyfriend and I highly highly recommend staying here. Jill and John were incredibly sweet and helpful. The room and bathroom were spotless and the bed was very comfortable. The location was also excellent. We would definitely come back!
80261	5625964	10.0	10.0	48049261	"Our stay with John and Jill was great. We stayed for one night and were in Seattle for two days. We met Jill, who welcomed us and gave us lots of helpful suggestions of how to get around and where to eat. The room was very clean and quiet. We didn't have much interaction with our hosts because we dropped our stuff off and then took off to go wander around, and didn't come back until later on at night. Our limited interaction though was great! Jill was very kind and accommodating, and if we head back up to that area, we'll be sure to book with them again.

Would strongly recommend and plan to use again when in area. Thanks Jill and John!

81206	5252877	10.0	10.0	28664645	Great apartment. Everything was in pristine condition. Amenities for both us and our kiddos were great. Friendly meeting with property manager upon our arrival. Great location. Would highly recommend. 
81207	5252877	10.0	10.0	29840563	A friend of mine checked on my behalf and Autumn, the apt manager made it very easy to accommodate this for us! The apt itself was awesome and the view from the Living room/kitchen was just beautiful! The amenities were plenty for 6 adults, and the guidebook provided included all instructions that we needed for check out.
81208	5252877	10.0	10.0	32044360	The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
81209	5252877	10.0	10.0	33058381	The host canceled this reservation 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
81210	5252877	10.0	10.0	36324259	Everyone was great and communicated very well before and during our stay. The unit was immaculate.
81211	5252877	10.0	10.0	38583938	"The apartment was just as described in the listing. The pictures were identical. You do have to walk up stairs, but that was mentioned in the listing. As for cleanliness, it was mostly clean. When we pulled the hide-a-bed out, there were so many crumbs that we couldn't get them all off. My friend ended up sleeping on the other twin bed in the second bedroom. 

The check-in process was a disaster. We arrived on time, but the apartment Rueben gave us wasn't the correct one. We had a major freak-out moment. Rueben wouldn't answer his phone, someone was parked in our spot, nothing was going according to planned. I even call the owner, Melissa because her number was listed on the listing. She didn't email me back until several days later. Rueben finally called back and said we were in the wrong apartment, but that we couldn't get into our because it was still being cleaned. We waited an hour and half before the cleaning lady left. We were not pleased as we had missed plans with friends due to not being able to get ready. Then Rueben, the apartment manager had to come by. Oh my word. He had trouble changing the code to the door. I finally told him to leave it and that I would just use my door stop alarm.  Even after all the paperwork was signed, he still wouldn't leave. I finally had to tell him very directly to please leave because we had to get ready for dinner. 

The space was fine once we finally got in and settled. As for the neighborhood, we didn't really have to time to explore it. The apartment has a great view of the city and Mt. Rainier (when it isn't cloudy)."
81212	5252877	10.0	10.0	39559933	Great place!  Extremely clean and well-stocked with more than enough room for our group.  Would definitely stay here again.
81213	5252877	10.0	10.0	40537780	Three of us stayed here on our trip to see Wicked. Very close to downtown- with awesome views of the water and skyline. The pictures were accurate, the cleanliness was superb, the beds were VERY comfortable (I would like to know what kind of mattresses they are so I can buy some for my house). They even had a bottle of my friends wine in the refrigerator for us! Perfect way to cool off while getting ready for the theater. Communication with hosts were prompt. We will definitely rent here again!
81214	5252877	10.0	10.0	47963134	We had a wonderful time staying in Seattle! This was an AWESOME location and very modern apartment. We had everything we needed when we arrived. We even had a parking spot so that we didn't have to look for a place on the street. The only thing we would have loved was more seating in the TV area. We had 6 people staying in this location so a wrap around sectional would have been perfect for when we all gathered to watch movies/sports. We would highly recommend this location, especially if you have fewer than 6 people.
81215	5252877	10.0	10.0	52460265	This place is great! Really beautiful and close to everything you need. The bed was super comfortable and the apartment overall was very liveable and spacious. The host was great, very easy to deal with and made sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again.
81216	5252877	10.0	10.0	53692715	Spacious apartment in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to interesting shops and tasty restaurants.  The beds were so comfortable, great to fall into after a day of exploring. The private parking spot is super helpful for those who wish to explore further than Fremont. Autumn was very helpful and responsive in getting us situated. Very nice place.
81217	5252877	10.0	10.0	57704659	"This is a review for the ground floor unit in the building.  We booked at the last minute and the top floor was already taken.  Everything in this apartment seemed new and in great condition.  Kitchen was well equipped .   The  beds were super comfortable and the apartment very clean and quiet.   The manager, Autumn was very helpful, communicated well and was there to meet us on arrival and walk us through the apartment. 

 Fremont is a fun location to stay in while visiting Seattle. convenient and safe.

81770	394408	10.0	9.0	1285865	"Great little ""urban farm"" that's walking distance from Fremont and easy access to Ballard and downtown. We stayed with two kiddos, and it was so fun for our 4 year old to help feed the chickens, watch the baby ducks and play with the two sweet kitties that live here. His only question was, ""Where is the buffalo?""! We loved being able to spread out and relax in the living room. Nice spacious kitchen and beautiful yard. Great neighbors too! We had such fun that we thought about locking Caroline and Paul out upon their return and staying indefinitely!"
81771	394408	10.0	9.0	1717237	"I'm not sure where to begin.  We rented from Caroline and Paul for an entire month in summer 2012.  The house was perfect.  The location was just up the hill from all the restaurants in Fremont and the Burke-Gilman Trail, allowing us lots of freedom to walk and bike around beaufitul north Seattle.  There are several bus routes to reach the UDistrict, Ballard and downtown as well.

The house itself was adorable.  Very clean and comfortable to live in.  We were here as a family of four, so our daughters slept together upstairs and we slept downstairs.  Caroline and Paul left us cornbread to enjoy with honey from their own bees upon our arrival.  And we found a surprise bag of chocolates with a sweet note at our door mid-stay.  They were overly welcoming and a joy to work with.

The one thing to know is that they have many animals at the house, including chickens, ducks and cats.  We loved caring for them and enjoyed learning about what having chickens is like especially as we are considering it ourselves.  However, if you are not into animials this may not be the place for you.

Overall, if you are looking for a place to truly experience Seattle life - walking, biking, eating in quirky Fremont, busing downtown, caring for chickens (and eating their fresh eggs) - this is the place for you."
81772	394408	10.0	9.0	1994937	We had a pleasant stay in Caroline and Paul's home. It is centrally located in the Fremont section of Seattle on a quiet street with off-the-street parking. We enjoyed fresh eggs and honey from Caroline and Paul's hives for breakfast. They have a lovely kitchen and dining room, and two bedrooms and baths. Everything was clean. The stay comes with some animal-feeding duties for the chickens and ducks they keep in their yard so you should only stay here if you like animals and caring for them. They also have a cat who takes care of herself pretty well, with her own little cat door in and out of the house. We were very fortunate to enjoy beautiful weather our entire time in Washington, and Seattle was bathed in glorious sunlight. 
81773	394408	10.0	9.0	3043401	Caroline was an impeccable hostess: organized, informative, and incredibly friendly. Upon arrival, we found a hand-written note encouraging us to consider her home our home for the duration of our stay--what a considerate and warm touch! Living in a stranger's home can be a bit awkward, and there was none of that with Caroline and Paul. Our stay was easy, fun, and a learning experience: we'd never enjoyed duck eggs before, which was quite a treat. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly; we chatted with a neighbor and always found parking on the street and fun in Fremont. What a great spot!
81774	394408	10.0	9.0	3097153	So glad that we ended up staying at Caroline & Paul's rather than checking into a hotel downtown.  The house was really good fun and in a great location for us. Even though I'm English I left the tea behind and couldn't resist the fresh coffee beans and hand grinder each morning.  The duck's added extra charm.  Would recommend the place and stay there again given the chance. 
81775	394408	10.0	9.0	3166994	"We had a little family reunion at Caroline's lovely home in (email hidden)t up with our son and his wife for Christmas. The  house was perfect, great location, plenty of room, great spots to sit and visit and a dining room table for means, games and coffee. We loved it. Lovely view, duck eggs (thanks  girls), and nice neighbors. We cooked, talked, walked, and had a rockin good time. highly recommend.
thanks Caroline...loved the kitchen maps..."
81776	394408	10.0	9.0	3199280	"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed staying here.  Not only did it fill our basic need of 2 beds in Seattle, we also appreciated experience the flavor of Seattle that Caroline lives (recycling, composting, energy efficiency and DUCKS in the back yard!!)  We cannot say enough how much we enjoyed dotting our day with ""what are the ducks doing??""  We were also impressed with Caroline's collection of cast iron pans and Prince CDs!  There were good eateries and places to get coffee/drinks in the neighborhood and the PCC grocery store is a gem.  The house is near a variety of busses, so we had no need to rent a car while staying here.  

We are very happy we opted for the Airbnb option over a hotel.  We thank Caroline for hosting us in our first visit to Seattle!"
81777	394408	10.0	9.0	4933288	Caroline's place is truly a sweet home in Fremont.  Far enough away to be quiet, but close enough to stumble home from nano breweries, and get the most delicious coffee in the morning that Seattle has to offer.  The ducks are a riot!!  The Brewery Cafe was a big hit!!  I'd stay again and again.  
81778	394408	10.0	9.0	5174360	"Caroline's home was everything that she said it would be.  It was easy to find, comfortable and pleasant. She even left us a loaf of bread and honey from her own bees.  We didn't take care of the ducks, but enjoyed them when we were there at the house. The neighbors were friendly, too.  
It worked out well for us to stay there and we enjoyed making coffee in the mornings and lounging around before our busy days began.
Thanks Caroline very much."
81779	394408	10.0	9.0	5595622	"We were in the area for a wedding, and loved staying in this ""sweet home in the heart of Fremont""! We had everything we needed in the house, and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance. I can't speak for public transportation to downtown Seattle though, if that's what you're interested in, as we rented a car for all our wedding festivities. Oh, and watching the fireworks from the rooftop will no doubt be one of the highlights of my year - just be careful, the railing up there is a little wobbly!

We cared for the ducks ourselves, but that was our choice. I'm glad we did, because they were so darned cute. It put a smile on my face at the beginning of each day, watching them parade out of their coop and into their little pond :) Caroline did offer to have the neighbors care for the ducks if we preferred, and in fact they did help out one evening when we couldn't be there. We met said neighbors, and they were super friendly - they even invited us to join their bonfire! If you're concerned about the bees, don't be. They keep to themselves. We barely noticed them.

Thank you Caroline - if I ever make it back to Seattle, I'm checking with you first to see if your place is available!r"
81780	394408	10.0	9.0	6145599	Caroline and Paul's home was perfect for our stay in Seattle.  The kitchen had everything you needed and more.  We loved the amazing energy of the home and how comfortable we felt staying there.  The ducks were soooo much fun to wake up to every morning, especially for our two little girls who loved following them around the yard.  Caroline and Paul were so wonderful and lovely to work with.  Would recommend this home to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.  We also loved the neighbors. :)
81781	394408	10.0	9.0	8477972	What a great place to stay for my first AirBnB experience! The house was very cosy and in a great spot for visiting my family in Ballard (as well as close to the city).  My daughter had a great time looking after the ducks and even made an omelette for herself.  Caroline is a great host and very helpful with information throughout the whole process.
81782	394408	10.0	9.0	8666183	We had a fantastic time in Seattle and staying at Caroline's was great! It was really nice coming back from a long day of walking and sight seeing and being greeted with a comfy, cozy home. The neighborhood was cute, and in great walking distance to lots of food! The house was adorable, clean and the pet ducks were a great bonus!
81783	394408	10.0	9.0	9626612	Caroline's house was so visitor friendly! I enjoyed how cozy it felt, but not at all small! Great use of space and the prefect retreat for NYE! The ducks were great as well and I even was able to fry up an egg thanks to the neighbor! Loved it. Everything. Thanks for letting us use your home!
81784	394408	10.0	9.0	12024679	House is exactly as advertised, very comfortable and very clean. Caroline was an excellent host providing recommendations on things to do and even a stock of breat butter and cheese which along with the fresh duck eggs made for great breakfast! Nice to see a local Seattle neighborhood too while still very accessible to Downtown and nearby Ballard.
81785	394408	10.0	9.0	13301275	Thank you so much for providing a wonderful, welcoming, and homey spot for my family when they were in town. It was wonderful to meet you guys too! 
81786	394408	10.0	9.0	15023953	"We had a great time in this house!  My son loved the ducks....lots of quacking all weekend :-D  A quaint and cozy house in a cute part of town.  She had great instructions for the house and fun suggestions for nearby things to do. So nice to have a nice place to go back to that also has some fun aspects for my toddler! 
Also the duck egg breakfast we made was fantastic :D"
81787	394408	10.0	9.0	15390653	Caroline and Paul's cozy home in the wonderfully quirky Fremont neighborhood was everything we wanted in a vacation spot.  The house was spotless and had everything we needed for our meals, relaxation, and a good nights' rest.  Our son especially enjoyed caring for the ducks and looking for eggs each morning.  Caroline was very responsive to our emails and easy to work with.  Thanks for a great stay!
81788	394408	10.0	9.0	16969062	We had an excellent time staying in Caroline and Paul's house in Fremont. It was exactly the space we needed for the two kids and the location was perfect. Easy walking distance to the zoo and good bus connections to Downtown, Ballard and the University area. We enjoyed ourselves very much. The ducks were a particular highlight with the kids. Very entertaining. 
81789	394408	10.0	9.0	23523118	Caroline and Paul are wonderful people!  The house was perfect for our family Thanksgiving celebration.  All of our questions prior and during our stay were answered in a gracious manner.  It was evident that the goal was for us to enjoy our time - and we did just that!  
81790	394408	10.0	9.0	24421497	"House was clean. Quiet, eclectic neighborhood.  Close to good restaurants.  Tile work in the basement bathroom was quite delightful.  Good music selection. Bed was comfortable and had warm blankets.  The brochures were a nice touch.  Downstairs bedroom has a low ceiling, if you are 6'2"" or taller, be prepared to duck."
81791	394408	10.0	9.0	28597648	We really enjoying at Caroline and Paul's home. The neighborhood was beautiful, the house was comfortable and clean and they were excellent hosts. My grandson really loved seeing the ducks. I would definitely stay here the next time I visit Seattle. 
81792	394408	10.0	9.0	33076208	"Caroline was great and her house was beautiful. We were happy with every part of our experience there. She had a delicious craft beer (and many neighborhood maps and guides) waiting for us when we got there and both she and Paul were kind and welcoming when we ran into them during their work on the backyard cottage. 

This eco-friendly home was very cool. We loved the tile work in the basement bathroom and the map collage wallpaper in the kitchen. 

I would say to be careful about committing to sleep in the basement bedroom if you are very tall, the ceilings are quite low. If you aren't very tall (over maybe 6'2""?) it shouldn't be any problem.

Free street parking was a breeze and we drove less than 5 minutes to amazing food and beer most of the weekend. We didn't have much of a chance to explore the area on foot because we were only in town briefly but it seemed like a great neighborhood all around.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place! We had no issues at all and would love to stay there again if we ever need an airbnb in Seattle again."
81793	394408	10.0	9.0	33903769	"Yes, we felt very much at home.... loved peeking in at the ducks! They even offered us duck eggs! Loved the ""Theo"" chocolate on the table along with all the helpful maps and attractions of the area. Thank you for the lovely stay, felt very much a part of the Seattle culture and LOVE Fremont Coffee house!!!! My personal new fave! "
81794	394408	10.0	9.0	34054655	It's a very nice and clean house in a good neighborhood. The hosts were very communicative. They also left eggs for us to use. The house has one bedroom on the ground floor and another bedroom in the basement. During our stay, the basement bedroom was quite cold and we didn't get the heating system to work for the basement. Anyways, the stay was good overall. I would recommend this place to other guests! 
81795	394408	10.0	9.0	34634193	Enjoyed a lovely stay in Seattle, our hosts were very helpful with tips and directions when we met them on arrival and the house is very nice. We liked the library outside the front door and the fun things to do in Freemont, it was easy to drive downtown too.
81796	394408	10.0	9.0	35399412	Caroline made us feel very welcome in her home. She was very responsive with communications and instructions to access the house where great. The place was very close to the heart of Fremont and the Seattle center. They did a great job renovating their home, very eco friendly and comfortable. And the ducks were very cute !
81797	394408	10.0	9.0	35907193	We were welcomed with a Theo (made in Seattle) chocolate bar next to a note on the coffee table.  This is one of the nicest places I have ever stayed in and the pictures give a very good idea.  The fridge and pantry were full of delights, including fresh duck eggs!  The kitchen is very well stocked with equipment, including a bullet coffee grinder.  We had all our breakfasts and one dinner there in our 4-night stay.  Caroline and Paul gave us some good suggestions regarding the Freemont Solstice Festival and got back to me right away when I had questions.  I can heartily recommend this home to others, as long as they have no problem with steps (a few to enter the house) and hills, as the neighborhood is very hilly!
81798	394408	10.0	9.0	36666568	LOVED staying here! We were left several guides, some great local chocolate, and even duck eggs to try :) The house was beautiful and had a great location so we were able to walk around and explore Fremont, or take an Uber for under $20 to get to a near by city. I met Paul and Caroline and they were both very kind. I would absolutely stay here again if I had the opportunity.
81799	394408	10.0	9.0	37035156	We met the hosts when we arrived and they were very sweet and welcoming. The neighborhood was as described and close to many things.  The house is a little quirky, but well taken care of with love.
81800	394408	10.0	9.0	38906125	3 of us were in Seattle to visit family and friends, and this was the perfect place for us. The house is clean, spacious, and gave us convenient access to where we wanted to be.  Caroline was also terrific: easy to get in touch with and very welcoming even though we didn‚Äôt actually meet in person. She kindly left us bread, etc. along with an invitation to try the duck eggs for breakfast (which we did‚Äîyum!).  
81801	394408	10.0	9.0	41195436	Enjoyed our stay in Seattle thanks to our comfortable accommodations!  The house was cozy and the beds were comfortable.  It's a great location, close to Ballard Locks, Woodland Park Zoo, and downtown Seattle.  We enjoyed walking up and down the hills to explore the Fremont area.  We would recommend this home to anyone visiting the Seattle area.  Thanks for sharing your home with us!
81802	394408	10.0	9.0	52979201	We consider ourselves fortunate to have had this home opened to us.  We were able to relax and unwind after the classes we took.  It is out of the way, well appointed and cared for.  The beds are comfortable.  This was a really enjoyable stay for us.  The instructions are very clear for taking care of the property.
81803	394408	10.0	9.0	53467741	The house was as lovely as my communications with Caroline (which were all great).  Stayed for a friend's wedding in Fremont, and the house was convenient, well-stocked, and cozy.  Wonderful all around.  The ducks were a bit noisy in the morning, but I'll let that one slide ;)
