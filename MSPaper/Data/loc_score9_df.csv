1425	6004058	9.0	9.0	31233618	"Marina’s Queen Ann studio was just as described; the place was small but clean, cozy, and comfortable.  Marina left a basket with helpful info, maps, and tissues. The apartment is in a great neighborhood close to downtown and Kerry Park with a beautiful view of the city.  

Marina gave us our privacy but was very responsive and helpful whenever we texted.  Overall, a great trip to Seattle!
"
1426	6004058	9.0	9.0	33151436	"The description was accurate - the suite is very similar to a hotel room, but was the perfect size for our visit.

The location worked well, but it would have been nice to be a little closer to coffee shops and amenities. The building is very quiet and relaxed. "
1427	6004058	9.0	9.0	34213590	Very nice place! Cozy with a fantastic location.
1428	6004058	9.0	9.0	34958147	Mariana makes you feel very welcome.  The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated.  Perfect location for my visit to Seattle.  
1429	6004058	9.0	9.0	36408316	This airy studio had all the amenities and the most amazing view from the spacious patio. Walking distance to downtown and offering killer views this property was more than I could have hoped for. Our hostess was more than helpful and left everything a visitor could need, whether staying for one night or more. I cannot recommend this property highly enough!
1430	6004058	9.0	9.0	37981463	This is a great location just a few minutes' walk from Queen Anne and Key Arena. There is free parking. The apartment is a studio, so it's small, but Marina sets it up beautifully and it is clean and comfortable. Marina was great about communicating with us to give us information and helpful directions to the place. 
1431	6004058	9.0	9.0	38954954	Great place! Clean, comfortable bed. Great location!
1432	6004058	9.0	9.0	39966022	The apt is adorable! It's clean and cozy. Perfect stay if you plan on just sleeping there. Checking in and out was a breeze. Looking forward to visiting again!
1433	6004058	9.0	9.0	40596659	Marina made us feel super welcome and was great at communicating! The place was just as described, perfect for one or two people for a short stay, and in a great location! ESPECIALLY perfect for heading over to the port for cruises early in the morning - it was a 10 minute ride! Also walking distance to the space needle. We loved our stay here! 
1434	6004058	9.0	9.0	41822097	"The location was amazing - beautiful views and an easy walk to so many restaurants and attractions.

The place is great as well. Marina really did a fantastic job of keeping the area spacious and light. 

Marina was very accommodating and caring, and made us feel at home."
1435	6004058	9.0	9.0	44059382	"We had an amazing time visiting Seattle for the weekend and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. This adorable studio apartment was small but so well organized we never felt cramped. The Amazing use of space. The building itself was beautiful and felt so comfortable to come home to.
The apartment has a bus stop across the street which easily takes you downtown. And while you wait you get an amazing view of the Space Needle! It's breathtaking. Or you can walk around the Queen Anne area which is full of adorable shops, cute cafes and amazing restaurants. There's something for everyone. 
In summary, great space, very welcoming host and we would definitely recommend it!!"
1436	6004058	9.0	9.0	44930272	This place was decent and just as described. As stated, it's small but has everything you need for a short stay. My only complaint is that the apartment gets pretty warm, with no air conditioning.
1437	6004058	9.0	9.0	45119937	Cute hotel style studio with everything you need for your stay. Love the historical feel of the place!  Host was very accommodating and check-in was a breeze. Steps away from the bus stop and a short walk to the Seattle center. Overall a good experience! 
1438	6004058	9.0	9.0	46782491	Very clean and conveniently located studio that meets all your basic needs. The host is very easy to communicate with and accommodating with the check in/out process. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle. 
1439	6004058	9.0	9.0	48646907	Place was great. Totally quiet at night! Its like we were the only people there and no noise from the street. Studio was small but clean and cozy. Love the old building and the claw foot tub. Location was a little far away from things walking, and up a hill for those biking, but not too bad. We had a communication breakdown right when we were checking in, but it all worked out.
1440	6004058	9.0	9.0	49631934	Location was great and is within walking distance or a short bus ride/car ride to Kerry Park, Space Needle and Pike Place. There is also a great view from the apartment itself. Neighborhood felt very safe and was quiet. Room is cozy and is perfect for one or 2 people. It was also very clean and had everything we needed. Marina was a great host, super friendly and was very fast to respond. Check in/check out was very easy and the flexible hours were convenient for us. Would recommend to anybody needing a place to stay in Seattle!
1441	6004058	9.0	9.0	51017020	"Great neighborhood, but the ""patio"" photo was misleading. There was no table and chair(s) - you have to climb out a window onto a roof that can be accessed by several other windows, so limited privacy.
It would have been helpful to know before booking that there was no coffee maker, toaster, or microwave and that parking can be difficult.
Comfy bed, though."
1442	6004058	9.0	9.0	54228180	The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1443	6004058	9.0	9.0	58411660	Marina's place was perfect for us - compact, but with everything we needed, in a charmingly converted hotel building. Check-in and out was easy, Marina was a great host!
1772	762029	10.0	9.0	2820649	Maggie and Jean-Marc's Gypsy Wagon is a fun and unique option for adventurous traveler's, and for only $30, a helluva bargain in (email hidden)ggie and Jean-Marc were down-to-Earth and helpful hosts, and their three dogs very sweet.  
1773	762029	10.0	9.0	2870601	"The wondrous world of the Gypsy Wagon! We had a marvelous weekend, full of fun based out of the Gypsy Wagon.  An easy Rapid Transit ride to downtown Seattle, as well as convenient access to the fun Ballard and Queen Anne neighborhoods, the location is also off the beaten path enough to feel unique.  
The Wagon is beautifully crafted. It feels homey, clean, playful & private.  The top bunk slept two people comfortably, with storage for gear under the lower bunk.  
Thanks to the wonderful creators of the Gypsy Wagon for being gracious, open and welcoming hosts! We'll be back when we're in Seattle again hopefully!"
1774	762029	10.0	9.0	2923121	A great place to stay, and great hosts! I felt very welcomed from the moment I arrived and I had an excellent one-night stay here! The wagon really is a lot of fun - incredible to see all the careful, loving work that had gone into crafting this piece of art, that you then get to sleep in! What fun! And although it's obviously small, it's roomier than I expected - I didn't feel cramped at all. Definitely a fun and unique experience! :)
1775	762029	10.0	9.0	2938894	"Jean-marc and Maggie were helpful and easy-going.  Among other things, they approved a last minute decision to add an extra night  to the front end of our stay, and Maggie kindly took the initiative, printing a bus route from the Gypsy Wagon to Seattle Center.  We liked the selection of coffee and tea to begin each day. Two year-old Candance was a delight. 

My 8 year-old daughter and I loved the Gypsy Wagon.  It was cozy, beautiful, and a highlight of our trip, equally as apealing as seeing the King Tut exhibit, Space Needle, and other Seattle sights.  We looked forward to returning to it, laying on the beds, talking, at the end of the day,  We feel fortunate to have to stayed in this hand-crafted work of art."
1776	762029	10.0	9.0	3099582	Fantastic people with a fantastic space to share with the world! Jean-Marc and Maggie (and their family) were wonderful hosts, made me feel right at home and comfortable during my short/busy stay in them in Seattle for some job interviews. I'm proud to be a gypsy wagon alum :) and grateful for the opportunity to stay in their beautifully constructed space. 
1777	762029	10.0	9.0	3109765	Me and my friend Dave came to Seattle for a weekend and were so lucky to stay in Jean-Marc beautifully hand-crafted wagon. We commented to each other several times on how the place actually MADE our stay for us: on how comforting it was to return to and how it made the stay extra special because of its unique nature. The room is very clean, warm and beautiful. Jean-Marc is a very talented carpenter! Maggie and Jean-Marc are also very nice hosts: friendly, helpful, and hospitable. It was also nice to wake up to tea and coffee! I would stay again and recommend it to anyone!
1778	762029	10.0	9.0	3143426	The gypsy wagon was a really neat and unique place to stay! Jean-marc and his wife were wonderful hosts! Also the cookies in the morning were delicious :) 
1779	762029	10.0	9.0	3160735	Jean Marc & Maggie were very nice hosts and welcomed us with open arms when we got there! Cadance was a little cutie too!! we loved the gypsy home as it was unlike any place we've stayed in before! even my frinds who have seen our pictures have commented how cool it is! It was a bit tiny for the 5 of us but the atmosphere of the cabin overruled that. The home is also very near to the bus stops and Whole Foods!! Love it! Thanks guys!!
1780	762029	10.0	9.0	3280409	My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in the Gypsy Wagon, witch is very comfortable. Jean-Marc is probably the coolest host we meet during our 5 weeks holiday.
1781	762029	10.0	9.0	3305810	Jean-Marc and his wife were wonderful hosts.  We didn't get to see them very much as we came in late and spent most of the day away.  They were able to accommodate our schedule extremely well and were very helpful and extremely quick with replying to our inquiries.  We we're so delighted to come and go as we pleased.  We always felt welcome.  It was our pleasure staying in the Gypsy cabin.  The feel was very warm and cozy.  I wish we could have stayed longer!
1782	762029	10.0	9.0	3323725	This is a one of a kind experience. The gypsy wagon is very unique and well crafted and cozy. Jean-Marc and Maggie are super nice, and the place is 20 minute bus ride from downtown Seattle. Their house is always open for whatever you might need and they always greeted me with a smile. I would definitely stay there again.
1783	762029	10.0	9.0	3332946	"Add a little spice to you life !  Great sleeping Wagon and very cozy. Close to town and Whole Foods :)
Our hosts could not have any more accomodating and their daughter was adorable. There is some road noise, so a fan for some white noise would be beneficial, but other than that ...you will have a very pleasant experience.
Michael and Josh Wade"
1784	762029	10.0	9.0	3346301	It was easy to get to from Downtown using transit. Cute little place with very comfy beds and pillows.....friendly hosts. Would definitely stay there again!
1785	762029	10.0	9.0	3481732	I had a great stay in the Gypsy Wagon...super comfortable, incredible location for my stay and the Queen Anne area is very nice.  Jean-Marc and family were incredibly accommodating.  Their homestead is idyllic.  I would recommend this place for sure.  Thanks y'all!
1786	762029	10.0	9.0	3526250	JM and Maggie were great hosts! They gave us tips and the gypsy wagon was everything we hoped for and more!
1787	762029	10.0	9.0	3642447	"Great place, thought it would be cold, but it was perfect!
Thanks for letting us stay at your very unique place."
1788	762029	10.0	9.0	3806936	This was a really nice place to stay in Seattle. Very comfortable... super nice hosts, and a good deal. The wagon was very clean, as was the bathroom. There are grocery stores and restaurants in walking distance, but it was nice to have my bike because the Elliot Bay trail was very close, with easy access to downtown.
1789	762029	10.0	9.0	3909049	Had a great time in the gypsy wagon. Jean-marc and his family were awesome. Great location with easy access to public trans. Cozy and comfortable. Highly recommend checking it or there other space out for sure. Thanks for everything. Would stay there again.
1790	762029	10.0	9.0	3941148	Great time there ! Such a perfect way to stay and visit Seattle ! I really enjoyed that wagon and thanks Jean-Marc and Maggie for your hospitality ! 
1791	762029	10.0	9.0	4099975	"The gypsy wagon is incredibly cute. Jean-marc is a fantastic host; I stayed with him twice and I was incredibly happy both times.

I liked the Tiny Garden cabin a bit better; it's a little further from the street and so it's a bit quieter. But after a full day of exploring, I hardly noticed; it's an incredible town and I couldn't ask for a better host."
1792	762029	10.0	9.0	4207205	"My partner and I had a really great time visiting the  gypsy wagon and showing it off to our friends. We both felt very comfortable in the space. We loved the ambience - very charming. It was clean and warm (we're from the south). Our hosts were really wonderful and accommodating!! WE had an overall really good experience, and I would recommend it to others. 

I would also add that we used public transit exclusively, and the bus stop is pretty much directly across from the location. There is also a Whole Foods a couple of blocks up the street if you're into that sort of thing. "
1793	762029	10.0	9.0	4269623	Jean-marc and Maggie were wonderful hosts! The gypsy wagon was as charming and cozy as the pictures suggest. The location was conveniently located within half a block of the D-line Rapid Bus (20min to downtown with free wifi onboard!). If you're lucky, Jean-marc and Maggie will introduce you to their chickens and rabbit in addition to their friendly dogs. Staying here was the highlight of me and my boyfriend's trip. We'd love to go back if we ever need a place to stay in Seattle. 
1794	762029	10.0	9.0	4292361	"This was my first AirBnB experience. I wanted to extend a visit to Seattle after a business trip but wanted something more eclectic.
I find nothing worse than frigid, soulless, corporate environments.

My experience was the opposite of that and incredibly amazing! Jean-Marc have put so much heart and soul to their space. The two rentals, their little dog house, and many other things are all hand crafted! Don't let the word dogs scare you; they have two sweet gorgeous puggles! Aside from that they have a chicken coupe and a really cool garden too! All of these elements plus their hospitality, made it feel as if I was staying with distant relatives! 

The bus stop is literally Infront and you can get anywhere In Seattle from there. I literally just hopped on buses and went everywhere from Lake Washington to downtown! The Whole foods down the way is packed with local items so you can grab the famous MightyO donuts or some fresh oysters. 

No one was checking in that evening so they allowed me to leave my luggage until my early evening flight! Great central location, no weird charges or fees; just a great cozy experience over all!

Ps. They provide you, coffee, towels, heater, comfy pillows, hair dryer and even a little getting around manual! Try it out! :)"
1795	762029	10.0	9.0	4396142	Very comfy and totally what I was looking for. Just a simple place to crash after being out all day for several days. Hosts were very nice and accommodating and laid back. 
1796	762029	10.0	9.0	4506043	Lovely people.  Super accommodating.  The wagon wheel was perfect for our stay and very close to everywhere you want to be in Seattle.   Highly recommend.  
1797	762029	10.0	9.0	4551003	Jean Marc was super nice, the wagon too , the only downfall is you can ear a bit of the traffic, bring ear plugs. But great location, good coffee and small fridge that was very convenient !:)
1798	762029	10.0	9.0	4598079	We had a great stay at the wagon! It was very cozy and unique-great if you will be out and about most of the day, very comfortable for sleeping but not much room to move around. Very convenient to the D express bus to downtown. Jean-Marc and Maggie were friendly and accommodating.
1799	762029	10.0	9.0	4678513	"Greetings airbnb community,
If you're looking for simplicity, affordability, comfort, & a laid back atmosphere, I would highly recommend both rentals offered by Jean-marc and his sweet wife, Maggie! I rented both garden cabin & gypsy wagon! I was able to arrive 2 days before the rest of my family, and was immediately charmed by my upper bunk in the gypsy wagon :)   I had a blast The Triple Door's show: ""Through the Looking Glass: The Burlesque Alice In Wonderland"", and stumbled upon the huge Norwegian constitutional parade in ballard. Had a delicious afghan meal with my family, with complimentary fernee that melted in your mouth! Our hosts were very warm and welcoming, located close to metro stop, close to whole foods, loved their two pug dogs, chickens, and muppet-like angora rabbit!! Unfortunately, we all left in the morning for some last minute sightseeing before our cruise to alaska, and did not want to wake our hosts, so did not get to say a proper good bye! and Thank You!!"
1800	762029	10.0	9.0	4743046	J has a great Gypsy Wagon.  Excellent craftsmanship, very unique. We enjoyed seeing his garden, chickens and angora rabbit.  Great host & hostess.  Very close to the city bus stop and only a few minutes to downtown Seattle.  
1801	762029	10.0	9.0	4829976	"We enjoyed our stay at J and Maggie's Gypsy Wagon. What a unique and cozy experience. J and Maggie were delightfully relaxed and welcoming. Their yard was beautiful! 

thanks again for this fun adventure!"
1802	762029	10.0	9.0	5188135	This Gypsy wagon is literally the coolest place we have ever stayed! It's exactly what it looks like, cute and quirky. There were heaters, not that we needed them, and a bathroom located inside the house with fresh towels which was great. Jean-marc and his wife were extremely welcoming and easy to get along with. The bus stop to the city is located 50 meters away and the buses come every fifteen minutes, really convenient. Would definitely stay here again
1803	762029	10.0	9.0	5238287	"Amazing location & super nice hosts!
Jean-Marc and his wife really made us feel like in a little paradise.
Not only because the garden with the comfortable and cosy gypsy wagon is a little suburbian paradise - yet still close enough to the city. But because they where absolutely easygoing and open minded nice people. We highly recomand staying with them!
"
1804	762029	10.0	9.0	5318141	We had an incredibly relaxed stay in this supercozy gypsy wagon, together with the great hospitality of Jean-Marc and his family. The bus to downtown seattle leaves right across the street, so location/accomodation wise, we absolutely recommend it! 
1805	762029	10.0	9.0	5372032	Responsive communication. Well run and personable. The rooms make for a very unique experience. Recommended hosts!
1806	762029	10.0	9.0	5417199	A great experience! The beds are supra comfy, and the bus stop is right around the corner.
1807	762029	10.0	9.0	5461688	My boyfriend and I loved staying in the gypsy wagon. We were there for two nights, arriving fairly late the first and we left early the last morning so unfortunately didn't get to talk with JM and Maggie much. Their garden is beautiful, the wagon was clean and the bed was comfy. The bathroom was nice with fresh fluffy towels and great coffee options in the morning. Thank you!
1808	762029	10.0	9.0	5555058	The wagon is terrific! The craftsmanship is top notch and the whole thing is very warm and friendly. Plus, we got some great sleep on the comfortable bedding. The back yard garden that it sits in was beautiful. The chickens and hilariously fluffy rabbit are so cute. There's a bus stop maybe 100 yards away from the wagon itself. Very convenient. The bathroom is inside the main house but it's not used by the host family, so it's always available and private. I couldn't have asked for a better BnB experience and I'd recommend this place to anyone.
1809	762029	10.0	9.0	5625625	My in-laws stayed here while visiting Seattle and had a delightful time. Jean-mac made them feel completely welcome. They were very comfortable too in the wagon. Would book this again.
1810	762029	10.0	9.0	5699745	"I absolutely loved the gypsy wagon. It was so beautiful and very cozy. I was at the end of a long trip and very tired so I really enjoyed hanging out in the back yard with the chickens and the adorable dogs and watching the sunset.  The house and bathroom were very clean and the coffee and fridge were very helpful. 
The wagon is also in a great location- I was able to bike to downtown, Fremont, capitol hill and more very easily. 
I didn't meet Jean-Marc but his wife Maggie was very friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend this unique spot!"
1811	762029	10.0	9.0	5911820	"I had an excellent time on my travels thanks to this adorable little wagon room. Jean-Marc and his lovely family were very welcoming and warm. I loved their gardens and animals. While the space doesnt have a bathroom and shower attached, they have made it super easy to use the inside facilities without bothering the rest of the house. I particularly liked the fact that I didnt have to bother anyone when coming and going. I look forward to returning to the area and staying here again!

For those getting around the city without a car, there is a major bus line right out front that will get you around. There is a gorgeous bike/walking path near by as well. If just walking around, downtown, capitol hill, and the freemont area are all within about a 45 minute walk if you dont mind the hills. Stop and pick the blackberries, theyre everywhere!"
1812	762029	10.0	9.0	6009107	"Another wonderful stay with Jean-Marc and Maggie, in the beautifully crafted Gypsy Wagon this time.  The workmanship on the wagon is absolutely amazing, just gorgeous in every detail.  

In addition, the location is perfect - I walked in to town a few times, although there is also a direct bus just across the street, which gets you quickly to the main part of downtown.  Most times I came back, the sweet dogs were there to make sure I felt welcome, and the bunny usually popped out as well to say hi.  There is quite simply no better place to stay in Seattle, especially if you are flying in or out and renting a car as you can take 99 rather than I-5 and avoid a ton of traffic that way.  

Wonderful hosts, adorable critters, fabulous location, free wifi and parking, what more do you need?  Stay here!"
1813	762029	10.0	9.0	6053508	"We had a great time at the Gypsy Wagon! 
Jay is a great host. The common space was great to have! The yard is pretty, well kept, and has chickens!!! So neat. The gypsy wagon is comfortable and is a great small space! 
If I'm ever back in Seattle I will try to stay here again. "
1814	762029	10.0	9.0	6150546	The wagon is awesome as were Jean-Marc and his family. And the cute dogs and chickens and rabbit. It was a blast! They are really warm and welcoming people. I felt like I was at a cozy little inn. And if you are using public transportation as we did for the whole stay, it is super easy as there is a bus stop right in front of their house. TEN stars for Jean-Marc!  
1815	762029	10.0	9.0	6348288	"This turned out to be a pretty fun place for us to stay in Seattle and very conveniently located. We had a car, but you could easily hop on the bus just across the street and get anywhere you could want in Seattle relatively quickly. We ended up all over town but never felt like it took long to get back in the evening.

The gypsy wagon was a bit small, but since we were able to keep our luggage inside the house there was still plenty of room for two adults and two small children. (Note though that the lower bunks are a bit short for anyone over about six feet). Our kids enjoyed having the yard to run around in in the mornings, and it was nice to have a bit of outdoor space as well as room indoors in the house for showering and breakfast. Overall a fun and pleasant place to stay."
1816	762029	10.0	9.0	6465902	"We had an awesome stay in the gypsy wagon. We were in town for a wedding and were out exploring the rest of the time so we weren't there too much. However, the bed was super comfy and Jean-Marc allows access to their separate bathroom/shower, kitchenette and living room. Everything was clean and tidy. The D line bus runs right outside his place which was really convenient for us!

For the little bit we talked to Jean-Marc I could tell he's a great guy and excellent host. Next time we hear of friends visiting Seattle we will be sure to mention the GW as an option!"
1817	762029	10.0	9.0	6565535	Jean-Marc and his wife are great.  The gypsy wagon was just as advertised.  We are tempted to ask them to build one for us so that we can tow it around the country and have the same experience every night.  Their house is very convenient on the D bus line to most places of interest to visitors, and it's tough to beat waking up to chickens and a rabbit and two dogs and a vegetable garden in the morning.  It kind of feels like you're on a farm in the middle of the city.  Good stuff.  Nice people. Lots of fun. Highly recommended.
1818	762029	10.0	9.0	6689291	This was our first trip to the Great NorthWest, and our stay in the Gypsy Wagon far exceeded our expectations. Our host, Jean-Marc, is a warm, affable fellow and a wealth of information. I felt like I was chatting with an old friend. The Wagon was comfortable with sufficient outlets to accommodate the electronic lifestyle, and the common areas are clean and have all the amenities of home. There is off-street parking, and since parking is a premium in Seattle, access to the bus stop across the street is a big plus. There you can grab the D-Line which takes you to the heart of Seattle's downtown district. The neighborhood is quiet and the chickens, small animals, and garden give you a homestead flavor you won't get anywhere else. I'd not only recommend it, I'm looking forward to a repeat visit.
1819	762029	10.0	9.0	6784251	Our stay in the gypsy wagon was very comforting and fun. It was noticeable that Jean-Marc is an experienced 'airbnb-er'. All was well organized and we are really gratefull that we not only could drop off our luggage earlier than check in time but also be able to hang out in the living room for a while after check out time. We hope that the gypsy wagon will stay for a long time on airbnb as it is in our opinion a great addition to airbnb and a unique place to sleep. Great job Jean-Marc!
1820	762029	10.0	9.0	6937897	Seattle was our last city before returning home after a 2 weeks road trip.  Jean-Marc was a kind, relaxed host.  He offers a separate communal space for his guests and a quaint back yard.  He gave us all the tools we needed to discover and explore Seattle.  The rooms are also quite close to the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods, a treat of Seattle. AND he has the CUteST pet BUNNY!
1821	762029	10.0	9.0	7007895	"I spent one night in the wagon with friends, then moved to the cabin. The wood smell in the wagon made it feel more like camping, which was nice. Everything about it was pretty perfect. There's a whole foods a couple of blocks away, and the bus downtown was convenient. 
I think the night in the wagon was the best night's sleep during a two week vacation. "
1822	762029	10.0	9.0	7077235	The wagon is superb! Tiny but very comfortable, and it makes me feel to be like camping in the wood. Jean-Marc and his family are very friendly!
1823	762029	10.0	9.0	7158498	Hi ! I stayed 3 nights in Jean-Marc gipsy wagon with my sister. It's exactly the same than show in pictures, with two double beds and some place for luggages. We had a bathroom and a living room shared with the tiny cabine, very spacious with a microwave and a fridge. Jean-Marc and his wife Maggie were very nice and available. The place is aroud 20 minutes to downtown, there is two buses just nearby. I recommended this place !
1824	762029	10.0	9.0	7254711	"We loved staying in the Gypsy Wagon! It was comfortable ""camping"" in the cutest garden oasis in Seattle. Jean-Marc and Maggie are helpful without being overbearing. Their animals are so cute and well-behaved that it was a joy to be around them. The place was really clean, too. Complimentary coffee in the morning was so appreciated! I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a comfortable bed in a great space. It's nice to see people living their dream! I will dream about coming back to this awesome spot. Thanks Jean-Marc and Maggie for helping to make our stay in Seattle easy and unique!"
1825	762029	10.0	9.0	7515781	"This airbnb stands out as a unique heartful experience in a most loved space, both the cabin and the yard and space. What then really topped it off was how well organized it was set up. From the labeled shelf in linen closet for toiletries to healthy clean water dispenser to fridge to coffee maker. Everything is mindfully and beautifully set up for everyone's comfort and convenience. We will definitely be back. Thank you Maggie and Jean-Marc

1826	762029	10.0	9.0	7634747	I absolutely loved staying in the gypsy-wagon! A lovely family - generous hosts. I was late for my bus and short $1.25 bus money - they lent me the cash and I paid them back later! Clean and comfortable space inside the wagon as well as in the house, fresh towels every day. My stay here was top-notch. I would stay here over and over again!
1827	762029	10.0	9.0	7773193	We had a great time! The location was perfect and the common space was clean and had nice amenities. The wagon is really cute. Great hosts, highly recommended.
1828	762029	10.0	9.0	7839025	Fantastic! Great place to stay; host was extremely cool & helpful. The place was fun to stay in, and their 'common' area was cozy & comfortble. The angora bunny was a nice touch too. Highly recomended!
1829	762029	10.0	9.0	7875302	This was my first airbnb experience and it was awesome!   I love staying at unique places and supporting local entrepreneurs . . . and Jean-Marc's gypsy wagon gave me that opportunity.   It was very clean and cozy.    By the way, this guy built this gypsy wagon himself . . the craftsmanship is beautiful!   There is another small cabin in the back as an alternate option.   I love walking and it was about a 20 to 30 minute walk to downtown Seattle.  If you are looking for a unique and affordable stay in Settle . . . definitely stay here!
1830	762029	10.0	9.0	7964770	This is a great location with easy access to city transit- we hopped all over the city from here.  Also groceries, coffee and even a gym fairly nearby.  The lodging is comfortable, simple, quirky and perfect.  What a skilled craftsman this man is!
1831	762029	10.0	9.0	8091783	"We had a lovely stay in the gypsy wagon. We were in town visiting family and just needed a cozy play to stay with our six year old daughter.   The gypsy wagon was great and very comfortable. I was worried it would be cold and we actually had to turn the heat off each night.  The chickens did wake us up two of the mornings but not at an ungodly hour and we found it amusing. The last morning we were there the chickens were silent which worried us. Turns out they had been let out of their coop and were co-chillin and enjoying breakfast on the other side of the house.  The host also has two adorable dogs that we only met once briefly. The rest of our stay we never even knew they were there.  

The beds were comfy and we slept well.  We plan on staying here again.   Also! Props for tasty hot cocoa. Yum!   Really great communication with the host and a great place to stay. "
1832	762029	10.0	9.0	8132190	Spending two nights in the Gypsy Wagon was our first AirBnB experience and we couldn't have asked for anything better.  Thank you so much!
1833	762029	10.0	9.0	8186921	I enjoyed one night in the gypsy caravan.  Very cozy. The other amenities in the house for guests were very clean and well organized. Very fast response to emails by Jean-Marc.  Enjoyed sharing the yard with the chickens. 
1834	762029	10.0	9.0	8301191	"We had a great stay at the Gypsy Wagon; a real adventure for my kids. They loved it!
 It was cozy, very clean and the owners so friendly and helpful. 
The location was good; we used the public transportation and were able to get around/make connections easily.
I can highly recommend this to those looking for unique accommodations that are a good fit with the feel of the city. 
"
1835	762029	10.0	9.0	8370069	Fantastic place and excellent host. 
1836	762029	10.0	9.0	8499145	This was our first experience using Airbnb and I can honestly say that we are glad that we did! The hosts were wonderful and the accommodations were fantastic! The custom built gypsy caravan is truly a work of art and was second to none. We thoroughly enjoyed waking up in the city to see chickens and a bunny rabbit right outside our door. Our five year old wants us to move into the caravan and I can see why. We are so thankful to have been able to stay in the gypsy caravan instead of some stuffy hotel. We will certainly be back as well and will gladly recommend these accommodations to others.
1837	762029	10.0	9.0	8587122	The gypsy wagon worked out perfectly for us!  Jean-Marc was a great host and was quick to respond to my texts/calls once we arrived in Seattle. We stayed there in November and we were impressed with how comfortable the gypsy wagon was. The wagon and the common areas were all very clean. I would love to stay there again next time I'm in town!
1838	762029	10.0	9.0	8836782	"You'd be nuts not to stay in this magical handcrafted gypsy wagon. It's one of a kind experience. And you get to tell everyone you meet, ""yeah, I'm staying in a gypsy wagon in Seattle."" Then just sit back and let the conversation fly."
1839	762029	10.0	9.0	9159757	As soon as we walked in the wagon, we felt how special it was! It  is built so beautufully. The owner J and his family were very friendly and shared the story of how he built the wagon. The common area and the wagon were very clean and everything worked perfectly. The wagon had a nice heater to have kept us very warm during the freezing nights and days of our stay. We loved friendly chickens and the rabbit in the yard. This place is magical and we would love to come back again!
1840	762029	10.0	9.0	9266864	Jean Marc is a very responsible, friendly and thoughtful host. The  Gypsy Wagon is a lovely tiny living space with stained glass windows, Wifi, electricity, and two very comfortable beds. It is situated in an ideal location with easy on street parking. There is a Rapid Ride bus which will take you downtown in just a few short minutes within an easy walk. There is a Whole Foods store on the busy street nearby with great organic wholesome food.  This is a wonderful, memorable place to stay if you plan to spend your time out exploring the area while in Seattle. Jean Marc is a talented crafts person with  great communication skills. He is helpful and always available to help.
1841	762029	10.0	9.0	9764619	The Gypsy Wagon was a great accomodation for the few days that I was in Seattle. It is a quaint little structure that was very comfortable and inviting. I appreciated the fact that the common room and bathroom had a separate entrance so that I wasn't always bothering J and his wife. It was very close to a bus stop which took me downtown. Everything about the place was great and I would gladly stay here again next time I am in Seattle.
1842	762029	10.0	9.0	9839024	Had a great stay in the cozy wagon, would certainly repeat again as it was convenient to reach all the different parts of seattle.
1843	762029	10.0	9.0	9932330	Cozy, warm gypsy wagon had everything we were looking for! It was so comfortable, we didn't want to get out of bed. Added bonus - petting the neighboring Angora rabbit.
1844	762029	10.0	9.0	10026735	Do yourself a favor and stay here.  Great location, fun wagon, and functional common space.  Thumbs up!
1845	762029	10.0	9.0	10069649	Super cozy, fun spot. Marc was very accommodating and all around a great guy. Loved all of the animals around, too! Will definitely stay here again!
1846	762029	10.0	9.0	10179147	I had a friend visiting from the Netherlands, and this was his first time in Seattle. I am so happy I found this place for us to stay. It was whimsical and cozy, and Jean-Marc was a very hospitable host. He was flexible and very helpful when we were looking for good places to eat and hang out. And the bunny Tribble and the chickens were also very nice company. Also, the location was perfect-- walking distance from grocery stores and coffee shops and just across the street from a major bus line. Thanks to this place, my friend had a great first experience in Seattle, and I can't wait to come back here again.
1847	762029	10.0	9.0	10315453	Very hospitable host and a cosy, warm wagon in the garden with chickens and a beautiful rabbit for company. We had a lovely stay and would definitely come back if in Seattle again.
1848	762029	10.0	9.0	10497777	My partner and I had an awesome stay in the heated gypsy wagon. Jean-Marc was more than willing to help us out and was excellent with communication even though we arrived at 1:00am on a Monday morning. He was nice enough to turn the light and the heat on for us for when we arrived. His description of the private wagon is accurate. His wagon is comfortable, unique, and beautifully crafted (and warm too). Also, his place is literally across the street from a bus that will take you downtown in ten minutes or north toward Ballard if you choose. We would definitely stay again, as my next Airbnb experience will be difficult to beat after staying here. Thanks, Jean-Marc.  
1849	762029	10.0	9.0	10611190	Beautiful wagon, and beautiful area. Host was very accommodating!
1850	762029	10.0	9.0	10662012	Another great experience.
1851	762029	10.0	9.0	10964425	We loved the little wagon, the chickens, the rabbit and the dogs! You can walk up about 6 flights of stairs (from street to street) to get to the Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle and take a bus to downtown. This is quite a pretty walk through a nice Seattle neighborhood. We only saw the hosts once, but are familiar with Seattle, so we didn't need any tips. The bathroom and dining room are in the house, which is separate from where the hosts live. Wagon is adorable with reading lights, wifi connection and a little heater, which we only turned on once. It was very easy to find from the closest bus stop, just a three minute walk away. 
1852	762029	10.0	9.0	11133343	"Jean-Marc was a really nice host and his gypsy wagon is a wonderfully crafted piece of art. It was great to be so close to the city and still have a little place just for ourselves after a busy day.  :)
"
1853	762029	10.0	9.0	11296782	This past week our daughter and son-n-law booked the cutest bed and and breakfast we have ever had the opportunity to stay in! It was in a beautifully handmade made Gypsy Wagon! It resides in our wonderful hosts, Jay and Maggie's back yard, just slightly north of downtown Seattle. We shared the backyard with some cute chickens in a hen house and the most adorable angora rabbit. Just inside the back door is a common area with table and chairs, a refrigerator, microwave, and an individual serve coffee maker. Close by, in walking distance, is a Whole Food Store and we were just a half block from a major bus line which if you take it you are in downtown Seattle in less than 10 minutes. Jay and Maggie are great, around if you need them but completely unobtrusive.They have a sweet 3 year daughter and two wonderful little dogs. I can honestly say that if you want a great value and a convenient, comfortable stay, book the Gypsy wagon soon because when this gets out it will be hard to get into this great place!
1854	762029	10.0	9.0	11380484	"Jean-Marc was great and the listing was as we expected. It was quite a novelty experience and close to town. The neighbourhood was also safe. In the house we also had access to a fridge, microwave, utensils and a coffee machine.
We will definitely be staying here next time we are in town.
Thanks for the experience! :D"
1855	762029	10.0	9.0	11502256	This was an awesome experience. Kind of like camping in the city, in a 5 star hut. Jean-Marc is a master craftsman who builds tiny homes and shares graciously with others. Highly recommend this stay.
1856	762029	10.0	9.0	11571473	Jean was a great host. He respond to all my questions immediately, and he was always available.He made us feel very comfortable, everything was very clean and the location is pretty close to downtown, you have everything what you need around that area. It was a great experience !
1857	762029	10.0	9.0	11753956	Jean-Marc and Maggie were incredible hosts. The gypsy wagon, and the rest of the property including the chickens, pugs, angora rabbit, tricycle, is an awesome experience.
1858	762029	10.0	9.0	12030741	Jean was a great host. He patiently explained everything for us and left us with a lot of private room. It was a pleasant stay. It was especially cool to live in a gypsy wagon!!
1859	762029	10.0	9.0	12165300	Staying in the Gypsy Wagon is a truly one of a kind experience; one I will never forget and hopefully re-visit in the future. Jean-Marc and his family could not be more welcoming and the surrounding flora and fauna - including his own couple puggles, chickens, and a bunny (not to mention the awesome hammock and swing) - make this a sort of paradise. Take this escape in the Evergreen State. You will not regret it!
1860	762029	10.0	9.0	12609798	I really enjoyed my time at the gypsy wagon and will definitely stay here again if I get the opportunity. Jay was most helpful and welcoming, as was his family. The accomodations were very comfortable and inviting. I also really enjoyed the ease of access to public transportation.
1861	762029	10.0	9.0	12836878	I had a great time staying at the gypsy wagon! I slept very well. Jean-Marc and his wife were really nice and hospitable as well! I would definitely recommend this place to others! 
1862	762029	10.0	9.0	13014100	Jean-Marc was a great host. We arrived a couple hours before our scheduled check in time and he was very accommodating and let us check in right away. The place was very nice and clean and is in a great location. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.
1863	762029	10.0	9.0	13152563	Jay & Maggie were great hosts, though we barely saw them. Everything was clean, the back yard and wagon are a tiny piece of paradise! I definitely got backyard camping nostalgia, and we both found our stay very relaxing. The gyspy wagon is beautiful, both inside and out, and we found the beds very comfortable. Andrew says he wants his own tiny house now!
1864	762029	10.0	9.0	13257324	Very quaint little place. Just as cute as the pictures. Access to the common area was really nice. Keurig coffee in the morning! Very close to the rapid ride so it was easy to get everywhere. Also, you have got to hang with Tribble, their angora rabbit. Great stay overall!
1865	762029	10.0	9.0	13358864	Where do I begin with this gypsy wagon!!?? We felt like we stayed in a fairy-tale....such a perfect location. Gorgeous wood work, gorgeous place. Super accommodating. I highly recommend you stay here if you visit Seattle! J and Maggie are the best, sweetest hosts and make you feel right at home. Thanks for everything, guys!!! :-) 
1866	762029	10.0	9.0	13477850	"This place is charming!! Jean-Marc was friendly and helpful, though we saw him very little. The yard, garden, chickens and bunny add to the charm.   The bed was very comfortable, though it is a very small space.  It worked well for us as we came in late and left early to spend time at FolkLife each day. 

Coffee and tea in common room appreciated.
Easy access to downtown Seattle.  Thank you! "
1867	762029	10.0	9.0	13587610	We loved our stay in the gypsy wagon! Jean-Marc and Maggie were both incredibly friendly and the location was a short distance from almost everything in Seattle. The adorable bunny and chickens also added to the experience! 
1868	762029	10.0	9.0	13847175	"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the gypsy wagon. It was so quaint and cosy.
It was very handy for the D line bus from downtown (15 mins ).
The only downside was the road noise but didn't spoil my 2 night stay.
Thanks Jay and Maggie"
1869	762029	10.0	9.0	13963255	"Hospitality was on point, very gracious and laid back. This is the perfect location in the city to stay, walking distance to the D-Line and a very appealing scenic walk to Fremont.

Also, the Gypsy Wagon was the perfect amount of kitsch--I miss it already. I will absolutely be back to Seattle and I hope it won't be booked when I return. "
1870	762029	10.0	9.0	14100056	"This was our first airbnb experience and it was a great one! My husband and I really enjoyed the beautiful caravan and found it to be extremely cozy, clean, and comfortable. The beds are very pleasant and its a wonderful place to spend time. The backyard is a little bit of rural paradise in the middle of the city. Love the chickens and especially Tribble, the cutest bunny in the world. 

The way the hosts have their space set up is great as the guests have access to a door in front and through to the back yard without bothering the hosts at all. The inside portion has water, coffee, fridge, and a very clean bathroom with nice fluffy towels. Its great to be able to have a shower whenever without bothering anyone. The hosts and their friendly dogs are warm and welcoming and still give guests ample privacy and space. 

The location also is great, close to downtown without having to do anything scary like drive on the viaduct, and less than 5 mins to Ballard. 

Basically we loved it, we'll be back, and this was the perfect introduction to airbnb. "
1871	762029	10.0	9.0	14281519	"I am a big fan of ""roughing it"" when I travel. But this was better then I expected. Yes the trailer is small. Only enough room to sleep really but if needed you can store your luggage inside the part of the house that is separated for guest use.  The trailer was incredible!  It was made by hand!  Very authentic and vintage style. I would love one for my own car and travels.  But beds are super comfortable and the heater was more then sufficient for some chilly and rainy nights. The guest half of the house has a very comfortable living and dinning room area, complete with morning coffee and wifi so I could relax and do some research. And a small refrigerator that I could store my personal food stash in. Hot bathtub very relaxing!  
I brought my toddler who absolutely loved it!!!  The backyard made a wonderful ""playground"" for her, free to roam without worries. An awesome slide, the cutest bunny I've ever seen, fabulous chicken coop, organic garden, and more!  Despite the animals and rain, there was no smell and no mess. Kept extremely clean and tidy. 
The owner was there in a flash when I needed some assistance.  But otherwise we had total privacy. Thank you so much for a lovely stay and for your incredible creativity that you have so kindly shared with the public!  
(If you need the Ritz Carlton or Hilton then move on). But if you are into authentic an genuine cabin style affordable stays with legit and welcoming service.... I'm sure you'll love it!  As I did "
1872	762029	10.0	9.0	14677216	Our stay at the gypsy wagon was absolutely fantastic. Jay and Maggie were super kind, friendly and accommodating. Their hospitality and crafty wagon made our stay easy and enjoyable. Also the two dogs Mary-Jane and Betty Boo were very welcoming and laid back. We would recommend the gypsy wagon 100%, it's a great way to experience Seattle. 
1873	762029	10.0	9.0	14810719	The gypsy wagon was a great stay for our time in Seattle ! It was very clean and the outside gardens were beautiful. The common area was also very nice. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, thank you ! 
1874	762029	10.0	9.0	15144970	This was my first airbnb experience and it was great!  Jean-Marc and Maggie were very welcoming and hospitable hosts, and the gypsy wagon was extremely comfortable with beautiful craftsmanship.  Other pluses were the large common area, beautiful yard, and proximity to downtown Seattle.  I will definitely look into staying at the Gypsy Wagon the next time I visit Seattle.
1875	762029	10.0	9.0	15673085	This is my second stay with Jean-Marc and Maggie.  They are wonderful hosts and I feel honored to continue to enjoy their hospitality.
1876	762029	10.0	9.0	15862993	"Terrific experience from start to finish! Jean-Marc made us feel welcome from the very first email right until we left. The Gypsy wagon was amazing, such wonderful craftsmanship! My son said; ""It was a cool as he thought it would be.""  The accommodations were just right. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
1877	762029	10.0	9.0	16250765	This was awesome! Jean-Marc and Maggie are excellent hosts. Jean-Marc greeted me instantly and we chatted for a few minutes which made me feel very comfortable. He was very thorough with explaining the guest area and history of the wagon etc. The charm of staying in the wagon is like nothing else I have experienced. Everything is very clean and the bed is super comfortable. Plenty of room to sleep two if necessary (bunkbeds). The common area is very nice and everything is super accessible. A bus to the downtown is a minute walk down the hill. I loved staying here. Thank you so much! Highly recommended!
1878	762029	10.0	9.0	16366930	We loved our stay here!!! We were a bit hesitant before arrival but everything was extremely clean, well organized and comfortable.  Jean-Marc is an awesome guy that walk us through the build of the wagon. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!! Fantastic stay!!
1879	762029	10.0	9.0	16482353	It was a pleasant stay. The trailer was adorable. The hosts were friendly and welcoming but also gave us our space.  I liked having the chickens run around in the background, the rabbit and the garden. I would recommend this place. 
1880	762029	10.0	9.0	16640561	Super comfy Gypsy-Waggon! We felt very lucky to be able to stay at Jean-Marc's beautiful waggon. It's small but GREAT and you definitely see all the work and love the hosts have put into it. Beds are super comfy, aircon and heater are provided. The bathroom and the common area are super clean, we were provided fresh towels, coffee and tea, dvds and more! Jean-Marc, the host, was lovely and very helpful! We absolutely loved staying here and would highly recommend it to everyone!
1881	762029	10.0	9.0	17433619	Beautiful spot, super cozy sleeping quarters in a funky garden.  Met hosts when we checked in but didn't see them after that.  They kept everything very tidy and clean.  Great location within 10 min bus from Ballard, Fremont, downtown and Capitol Hill.  Would definitely stay there again!
1882	762029	10.0	9.0	17581278	"We enjoyed our time at Jean-Marc and Maggie's bed & breakfast. The Gypsy wagon and the other accommodations on the lot are super unique and cute, unlike any other place I've stayed. The wagon was a little cramped with my husband and 20 month old and me, but we really only slept in it anyway, and having the common space and the awesome yard/lounging spaces made it work just fine. 

Jean-Marc was available and helpful when we needed him and we really enjoyed the feel of being away from the city when in actuality downtown was just a quick and easy bus ride away.  

I would stay there again, and maybe check out another of the accommodations!

"
1883	762029	10.0	9.0	17843539	This was a great place to stay! Jean-Marc was a great host. We felt very comfortable and at home while we were there. It was also very convienant that we were so close to the bus stop. Location was great! 
1884	762029	10.0	9.0	18118654	Staying in the gypsy wagon was a great time. You are provided with a common room that is shared with the guests staying in the other 2 cabins in the backyard.  Jean-Marc was very friendly and accommodating. The towels and washcloths were washed every day also which was nice.  The only catch is there is only one shared bathroom, but it is easily worked out as guests are asked to take that into consideration.  Overall, a good stay and would stay again (also Tribble the rabbit lives outside and is lovely).
1885	762029	10.0	9.0	18240922	Jean-Marc was waiting for us - my 14-year-old granddaughter and me -  when we arrived and made us feel very welcome.  There were no problems whatsoever, and we had everything we needed or wanted.  The common area was very comfortable and inviting.  The beds were comfortable and the gypsy wagon itself was very beautiful.  My granddaughter thinks I am a very cool grandma for finding this place!
1886	762029	10.0	9.0	18436149	I had a fantastic stay in the Gypsy Wagon. Clean and well appointed.  Will surely stay here again on my next trip through Seattle. 
1887	762029	10.0	9.0	18938814	I loved staying at the gypsy wagon. It was comfortable and warm and only a 20-min bus trip away from downtown Seattle ( where i needed to be). I was treated well and would definitely go there again.
1888	762029	10.0	9.0	20101887	The house was great :) host was really kind, the room was clean, and the location was great too. Gypsy wagon was sooo cute!!! I would love to stay there again if I revisit Seattle.
1889	762029	10.0	9.0	22050157	Most outstanding Airbnb ever! Can it get any better than curling up under your warm blanket and listening to Seattle's rain on the roof of your gipsy wagon? A gipsy wagon with heating, power outlets and wifi. A cross the street from express bus to downtown. And across the street from Whole Foods. Jean-Marc has been a super accommodating host. I'd come back anytime.
1890	762029	10.0	9.0	22335526	What an easy way to stay in Seattle! The gypsy wagon was affordable, easy and convenient.
1891	762029	10.0	9.0	22447018	This was my second time staying in one of Jean-Marc and Maggie's gypsy wagons. For me this is the best place to stay in the whole city. They're heated with strong wifi so the only difference between this room and a hotel is with these guys you step out onto basically a private park complete with a garden, a rabbit and chickens. 
1892	762029	10.0	9.0	23163328	It was great staying in the wagon. A real experience. The neighborhood was a Jody bus ride from everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle and Jean-Marc is a good discreet host. 
1893	762029	10.0	9.0	23446746	I had a great stay! Clean, cozy, and so charming!
1894	762029	10.0	9.0	23758157	Jean is really an ideal host. The wagon is in the yard and we really enjoy privacy without seeing other guests. The bathroom is shared by guests and it's clean.
1895	762029	10.0	9.0	24027457	"Jean Marc's Gypsy Wagon was fabulous. It was clean, charming, well-crafted, artful and in a great location for me...walkable to the Whole Foods store, right on a main busline, and right near my mailbox unit.

Jean Marc was friendly, welcoming, responsive and enthusiastic. I really enjoyed the balance of the welcoming vibe and the independence to be able to come and go at leisure.

Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would stay there again."
1896	762029	10.0	9.0	24326105	Marc is a really nice guy, the wagon was neat, while the lower level might be a little small for a guy though, but generally it's a nice place to stay. 
1897	762029	10.0	9.0	24667767	Jean-Marc was very welcoming, and even took extra time to show us and some of our family we were visiting in the area features of the stay, and shared some of his own history. Our young grandchildren (who live nearby) were with us when we checked in. Jean-Marc introduced them to his Angora rabbit, the hens (which are very quiet, in case you are wondering), the slide, and swing. Everything was super clean and serviceable. We stayed in the original Gypsy wagon- which was in perfect condition and really a lot of fun. We stayed at the end of December during pretty cold weather for Seattle. The wagon was very warm and comfortable, as were the shower facilities. This is like an oasis in the midst of the city- also close to major bus routes. Highly recommended, especially to add a little adventure to your stay in Seattle!  
1898	762029	10.0	9.0	25050709	My stay in the Gypsy Wagon was amazing! The wagon was nice and cozy, which kept us very warm through the Seattle winter. Jean Marc was a great host who made sure that we were well taken care of while giving us privacy. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a unique place to stay in Seattle!
1899	762029	10.0	9.0	25267395	J was an amazing host. Met with him the first day and spoke a bit, helped us feel at home. Very friendly but leaves his guests to do their own thing, which was nice. The wagon was beautiful and perfect for us. The location also could not be any better. We didn't have a car but not even a block away is a very busy and useful bus stop. Overall, I could not have asked for a better experience!
1900	762029	10.0	9.0	25411632	If you are going to Seattle and looking for a nice, clean place to lay your head this is it!  I was visiting Seattle solo for a few days and was looking for an affordable place to stay that was close to a bus line.  The wagon is so cute and cozy and was the perfect place for me.  There are 2 major bus lines that you can catch about 300 ft from J's place.  I didn't spend a ton of time at the wagon, but when I was there it was very quiet and I never had to wait for the bathroom.  In fact other than meeting J on my arrival I never saw anyone else while I was there.  Everything about J's place is wonderful.  From the cabins, to the proximity to the bus line, to the cleanliness of the bathroom facilities, not to mention the chickens and the angora rabbit.  All around a great place to stay.  If you are debating weather or not to stay here: DO IT!  You will not be disappointed.
1901	762029	10.0	9.0	26143121	Jean-Marc was so welcoming and personable. He made us feel right at home and made sure we were comfortable. The wagon was very funky and cute. It was exactly what we had expected. We had a really lovely stay! Thank you Jean-Marc!
1902	762029	10.0	9.0	26823949	We loved it! Great location, comfortable, and fun! I highly recommend! 
1903	762029	10.0	9.0	27093338	"This place is perfect. Seriously. Close to everything, charming, comfortable. If you're into rustic minimalism, it's an inspiration. 

"
1904	762029	10.0	9.0	27393397	There was nothing less than terrific here.  The neighborhood was comfortable, quiet and just a few steps from the D train which made getting where we needed to go so easy.  The wagon itself was great!  So clean with a really appealing atmosphere and surprisingly comfortable beds!  After some flight cancellations and rearrangements Jean-Marc was so helpful in extending our stay.  Will definitely return to the great view and adorable chickens!  Great way to meet other travelers!
1905	762029	10.0	9.0	27504894	Nice place. Jean-Marc and Maggie are friendly. And I love the animals there!
1906	762029	10.0	9.0	28021868	"Staying at the Gypsy Wagon was everything I hoped it would be. Jean-Marc was very sweet and informative upon our arrival, and gave us complete privacy for our stay. My husband is 6""3 and we felt cozy for our whole stay. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are clean. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to be close to the city, but on a budget. "
1907	762029	10.0	9.0	28314386	The Wagon With Heart looked just like the pictures and is beautifully made. Right next to a bus line which makes it easy to get downtown. Overall a wonderful place to stay!
1908	762029	10.0	9.0	28540980	Very unique space in the city outside of downtown. Kinda like urban camping. The bed is very comfy. Something's to note is there are a lot of city noise from cars and trains, so don't think this is a quite/secluded spot, it's off a big road. 
1909	762029	10.0	9.0	28783446	"Great place, great hosts. Thoroughly enjoyed our gypsy digs in Seattle. 
"
1910	762029	10.0	9.0	29177005	"This adorable Gypsy Wagon lived up to its rave reviews. It was comfortable and clean, and far more interesting that staying in a motel or hotel. My partner and I traveled from southern Oregon to Seattle to attend a conference. The neighborhood was convenient to downtown yet felt like an oasis, despite the traffic noise.  I enjoyed the little free time I had walking the neighborhood, chatting with Jean-Marc and sunning in the backyard with the chickens. (If you like walking, take the multiple staircases above the house; you'll eventually be rewarded with a great view of the Sound.) The D Line RapidRide is literally a block away and runs every 15 minutes on weekdays, which made for easy commuting to and from the conference. We also made good use of the Whole Foods Market a few blocks away. Although we didn't get to meet Maggie, Jean-Marc was an engaging host who made us feel very welcome. Our ""neighbors"" in the adjacent Gypsy Wagon were pleasant and respectful as well.
We would absolutely stay here again!"
1911	762029	10.0	9.0	29585948	Really nice guy, loved staying in the wagon! 
1912	762029	10.0	9.0	29849488	This place is awesome! Check in and out was super easy. The bus was nearby and incredibly convenient. The wagon was so fun to sleep in and really comfy. Atmosphere was peaceful and quiet, exactly what I was looking for. Oh, there were also really, really adorable fluffy bunnies in the yard! I would definitely stay here again/
1913	762029	10.0	9.0	30143411	"The Gypsy Wagon was a wonderful experience.  Very comfortable and inviting.  Jean-Marc is an excellent host and a very talented craftsman.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the stay.
"
1914	762029	10.0	9.0	30471445	I was in town for an professional planning conference in downtown Seattle and wanted to find a spot to stay off the beaten track. Boy did I find it! The Gypsy Wagon was the perfect place to come back to and relax after long days of nonstop learning and talking to people. It was easy to get to by bus, but I also took some lovely walks through the Queen Anne neighborhood to and from downtown (about 3 miles away). If you're a runner, there are also some good running spots. I ran to discovery park and back one morning, and it was another really nice way to get to know a new neighborhood. I highly recommend staying with Jean-Marc and his wife (and rabbits and chickens). If you're heading to Seattle, look them up!
1915	762029	10.0	9.0	30892783	Do not be fooled by how little this place looks in pictures. If you're by yourself and even with a +1, this needs to be the place you stay at. The location is super convenient and the place is super cool. Would stay again 10/10.
1916	762029	10.0	9.0	31595197	Great, quiet neighborhood and very accessible to public transit. The wagon and yard were both dreamy! We stayed for 5 nights while looking for an apartment and were sad to leave. Would absolutely recommend.
1917	762029	10.0	9.0	31699027	We had a great time staying in the gypsy wagon! It was very comfortable and Jean-Marc was super friendly. There was even a guide to some great places in Seattle (the Bayside Cafe is awesome).  I would definitely stay here again!
1918	762029	10.0	9.0	32005042	We loved staying here. A wonderful Gypsy Wagon that was clearly crafted with love. We enjoyed being in such a peaceful environment and hanging out with the chickens! Thank you Jean-Marc!!
1919	762029	10.0	9.0	32552987	The Hand crafted Gypsy Wagon exceeded my expectations by far. Jean-Marc was helpful and gave us plenty of privacy. The Queen Anne area is quite close to the city which made sight seeing easier. The wagon was cozy and everything you need is provided for you (we didn't end up using the fan or the heater). Also the views are beautiful and it helps that there's a whole foods across the street. 10/10 would stay there again!
1920	762029	10.0	9.0	32727493	I did not meet the host. Listing was as advertised. Environment was clean and well kept. Would recommend to others. 
1921	762029	10.0	9.0	33256847	Our experience was great. The little cabin was perfect for us for the weekend. It is small and cozy and very comfortable. The animals around the property were a plus too. We plan on staying here again. 
1922	762029	10.0	9.0	33547436	Awesome experience! Great location and the gypsy wagon is rad! Jean-Marc is super nice and I'll definitely stay again the next time I come to Seattle!
1923	762029	10.0	9.0	34468715	This area is perfect! We loved being ten minutes from Pikes Place and then only a couple minutes from the Fremont area and Union Lake. There's so much to do and the wagon itself is adorable, comfortable and has a great view! JM is welcoming and friendly! The bunnies are friendly as well! Overall, wonderful experience!
1924	762029	10.0	9.0	34682384	"This was my first experience with AirB&B.  It was a great adventure for me. Jean-Marc made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt very safe there.
"
1925	762029	10.0	9.0	35408340	Fabulous stay! Excellent location, kind host - and definitely comfortable, warm, and cozy. I highly recommend the gypsy wagon!
1926	762029	10.0	9.0	35661547	The gypsy wagon was great! Everything was as advertised, clean, comfortable, and adorable. They have a great set-up and a charming place. Highly recommended. 
1927	762029	10.0	9.0	36019285	Jean was friendly and courteous! The wagon was so cool and his home is conveniently located. His pets were a plus lol Highly recommended!
1928	762029	10.0	9.0	36681614	This was the perfect place to stay for our weekend getaway to Seattle. We never had the pleasure of meeting the host, but could tell he put a lot of care into not just the gypsy wagon, but also his backyard and entire home. The bed was comfy, the location was very central and we had an overall great time. Would recommend to everyone and will definitely stay here again.
1929	762029	10.0	9.0	36986198	This was an absolutely awesome stay. Comfortable beds, SUPER easy access to downtown Seattle. Literally hop on the bus outside of where you're sleeping and you'll be in downtown in about 10 minutes. Also very close to Kerry park which overlooks the entire city. They use this view for all of the postcards so you can rest assured you'll be seeing the best view Seattle has to offer. I can't thank Jean Marc enough for his kind hospitality and welcoming tone. I know one things for sure, when I'm back in Seattle I know EXACTLY where I'll be staying.
1930	762029	10.0	9.0	37765076	Adorable micro-home, very clean. Easy access to a major transit line was a huge plus. The whole foods nearby was also very handy for a quick cup of coffee in the morning or a snack for the day out. The wagon even managed to stay cool on the hotter days of our trip.
1931	762029	10.0	9.0	38132322	It was fun to stay with Jean-Marc, we loved his wagon. Be prepared to have some food, there are no shops around, and we had to take bus and go to the city for breakfast. Otherwise it was great! 
1932	762029	10.0	9.0	38860207	We had a lovely stay at the Gypsy Wagon! It is truly a work of great craftsmanship. Jean-Marc was welcoming and responsive, while allowing us all the privacy and independence we desired. The location is very situated for public transit. We would absolutely spend another weekend in the Gypsy Wagon! 
1933	762029	10.0	9.0	39757615	"Everything that we had expected staying at the Gypsy Wagon come true. The place was wonderful and we had complete privacy but if we needed anything Jean-Marc was very responsive. 
Thank you for a wonderful stay, we love the chickens and your bunnies are adorable!!!!! 
The location was perfect and we look forward to coming back again soon.
Thanks again!"
1934	762029	10.0	9.0	40107231	The Gypsy Wagon was a great experience!! The small cabin feel was cozy and very private. The wagon was very clean and exceeded my expectation. Next time we're in Seattle we'll be staying in the wagon. It's very conveniently close to pikes place and great tourist sites.
1935	762029	10.0	9.0	40355602	"Marc's Gypsy Wagon is super cute. It was a lot of fun staying there and inspired me to build one myself!
Thanks Marc!
I can highly recommend the Gypsy Wagon."
1936	762029	10.0	9.0	41084588	This wagon was so cool to stay in! The top bunk was the best place to sleep because the cool breeze would blow in from the window and we could hear the soothing sounds of the city at night (which I LOVED).  The wagon was perfect for us because we explored the city all day and just came back to sleep. Even though the weather was hot during the day, the wagon was nice and cool at night and we had a fan in case we needed some extra air flow.  I recommend taking the hosts advice and showering at night to avoid the morning bathroom traffic.  We found a breakfast joint nearby that we loved called Tenth West, just a ten minute walk away and so delicious! I recommend the breakfast sandwich.
1937	762029	10.0	9.0	41935847	The Gypsy Wagon was awesome, especially during the summer.  The location is really close to the W Wheeler street bus stop so you can go pretty much anywhere you need to go via public transportation.  When you're in the wagon, you can also look at J's Garden, rabbits, and chickens. It's a pretty cool sight to see!
1938	762029	10.0	9.0	42425702	My boyfriend and I landed in Seattle from Europe where we had planned to stay at Jean Marc s gypsy wagon but unfortunately when we landed I was feeling feverish and unwell so we prefered to stay at some friends house. Jean Marc was however very nice double checking on us and giving us suggestions on places to visit in the area!
1939	762029	10.0	9.0	42846449	What a great place - the Gypsy Wagon is awesome! Everything as described. Good location to get downtown or to Ballard/Fremont. Jean-Marc was a very accommodating host. 
1940	762029	10.0	9.0	44437857	What else more could I have needed?my stay felt so relaxing. Quiet, pretty. The other little wagon next door was rented, but I wouldn't have known if I wasn't told. Both a fan and a heater and electricity there, and even WiFi. Whole Foods a short walk away, as is a bus stop to go downtown. Loved looking at Jean Mark's garden too.
1941	762029	10.0	9.0	45382577	"The listing was accurate, and the fan and the heater in the wagon was very useful. I was surprised how cool in temperature the wagon was. 

Having it right by two bus lines was incredibly handy. We spent most of our time downtown and the D Line went right there. 

We didn't really see any one else that was staying in the yard, but the rabbits and chickens were great. 

The hosts were very welcoming. 

"
1942	762029	10.0	9.0	45661862	Everything was wonderful.  A really unique place to stay in a pretty backyard with a great view.  Jean-Marc greeted us and told us to let him know if we needed anything.  We didn't, as everything went smoothly.  I'd just make future guests aware that it's a pretty small space--the only room for bags is on the other bunk, but if you know what you're getting into it's fine.  I'm not sure about the public transportation, since we had a car, but it's a quick 10 minute drive to central Seattle (traffic notwithstanding).  All around great experience, would highly recommend.
1943	762029	10.0	9.0	46127408	Jean-Marc was an AMAZING host! He welcomed us and chatted a bit which made us feel very at home. The gypsy wagon was perfect. Very clean with extremely comfy beds. The bathroom was clean and had everything we needed. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
1944	762029	10.0	9.0	47408047	Jean-Marc, his wife Maggie, and their adorable daughter made our stay so enjoyable with their warmth and openness. They have truly created a little oasis in the middle of Queen Anne. I was impressed with the spaciousness of the gypsy wagon even though on the outside it appears small. Like other guests have noted, it doesn't get too hot because there is a fan as well as stained-glass windows that open out onto the garden. My friend & I especially loved the animals (chickens, dog and bunnies), they really added to the charm of the property. 
1945	762029	10.0	9.0	47992985	"This was the perfect stay for my cousin and my Washington trip. The stay was incredibly enjoyable and was exactly what we needed. It was like we walked into a fairytale every time walked into Jean-Marc's backyard. The wagon is how it was described (but even more beautiful). I didn't meet Jean-Marc or his wife in person but we were in the wagon by 10:30pm each night and gone for the day no later than 7:30am each morning - which is probably why we never met. 

Some notes:
My cousin and I had small carry-on luggage and personal items (four total bags) and I'm not sure how anything other than small bags would fit into the wagon.

We parked in the cul de sac - not sure if that's where we were supposed to park but it worked out fine, we didn't get a ticket. 

The blankets in the wagon are EXTREMELY warm and soft. The evenings in Seattle were very cold but the blankets kept both of us at a perfect temperature. We didn't use the heater (although there was one available) because the blankets were perfect. 

We took an Uber to DT Seattle one night and it cost a little less than $9. I highly recommend choosing Jean-Marc's cute abodes. The location is perfect for whatever you are planning on doing. It's not far from the highway, down town Seattle, and only about 20 minutes from the airport. Plus, it took only 3 hours to go to (website hidden). Helens, 2.5 for Mt. Rainier, and 2.5 for Olympia State Park. Wonderful.

It's a perfect oasis. "
1946	762029	10.0	9.0	48203517	This place was super cute and cozy. Great AirBnb option! Good location. Jean-Marc was very welcoming.  Very cool set up!
1947	762029	10.0	9.0	48548567	This BnB was fantastic. Described perfectly and in an awesome neighborhood. We even were able to walk to a farmers market!
1948	762029	10.0	9.0	49797790	"Let me start by saying this listing definitely lived up to some high expectations.  The wagon was cozy and beautifully made, the rabbits are hilariously adorable and you're encouraged to pet them.  The location is great, the hosts are very hands-free and have obviously got their operation down to a science.  Everything was clean, the rules reasonable, and our stay was hindrance-free.

We did have a small dispute with the host the morning after we left.  Since our unit had two beds we didn't think it would be an issue for a friend to crash with us the last night of our five-night stay.  Once on the road home the next morning I opened my email to find an extra $85 fee from the hosts with a curt, somewhat accusatory message attached.  Admittedly we were in the wrong, we realized we should have cleared it with them first (in our defense this was our first AirBnB) so we agreed to pay the fee.  But I feel it's worth noting that neither the printed booklet in our unit or, at the time of this writing, the online listing say anything about extra guests.  We also felt it could have been resolved a little more smoothly.  They did attempt to contact us that night, but only through the AirBnB site and at the time we were exhausted from a long trip and our phones were dead.  They could have easily come out and knocked on the door and discussed it in person.  They also said something about watching us through the security cameras, which made us a little uncomfortable.

Handy tip: make sure and pack sandals.  The grass gets wet at night and you might end up back in bed with muddy feet after a late night bathroom trip."
1949	762029	10.0	9.0	49968323	The wagon was exactly as pictured. The D line bus literally stops at the base of their street. As said in the listing, it can get noisy with local traffic, but not unbearable. Other than 2 short responses to questions and briefly seeing JM on our second last day, we had no contact with our host and were left to come and go as we please. Thanks for having us.
1950	762029	10.0	9.0	51427973	This was my second time staying with Jean-Marc and my mom's first time in Seattle. Accommodations were as expected, check in and out was super easy and the location is perfect for a visit to the city. I love staying in the wagons, it kind of feels like camping.
1951	762029	10.0	9.0	51796017	Everything was great, clean accommodations, private bathroom, close to transit. Would definitely love to stay again, 
1952	762029	10.0	9.0	51943426	I absolutely loved the gypsy wagon, and had a wonderful stay hosted by Jean-Marc. Jean-Marc provided all the amenities needed to have a comfortable stay including fresh/clean towels and sheets and a heater in the wagon and restroom. The scenery is beautiful and the location is convenient for visiting downtown Seattle. I would definitely stay at the gypsy wagon again if I get the chance! Definitely
1953	762029	10.0	9.0	52284596	Awesome. Probably this is not for everyone, as you might dislike having to walk outside under the rain to go to the restroom, or might dislike that the room is (as expected) very small; but if you understand those points, you will have a beautiful time (website hidden) is very nice and friendly, and the wagon he built looks and feels beautiful, warm and cosy. Definitely, we spent some great and unique time here.
1954	762029	10.0	9.0	52468617	Great spot, beautiful and unique structures, and a very nice and welcoming host! Overall a good, quality experience.
1955	762029	10.0	9.0	54880121	The communication prior to arrival was great. Everything was in order when we arrived. The room is small. We slept very well. The bus route was really convenient. We had a great time. Nice rabbits and chickens.
1956	762029	10.0	9.0	55366674	It was a nice stay at jeans place. I enjoyed it!
1957	762029	10.0	9.0	55974953	We had a great stay! Everything we needed was readily accommodated with no need to reach out to Jean-Marc. He was very responsive with pre-arrival inquiries. Our wagon was warm and cozy, and communal bathroom very clean and homey. The wagon is a bit small, but perfect if you don't intend on being inside of it all day. Bring a warm jacket and comfortable shoes for times you need to run to bathroom (very very very close to wagon so a super short run). Would totally recommend! 
1958	762029	10.0	9.0	58146498	This is my second stay with JM, and it was as awesome as the first. Such a cool space, perfect location, great price for someone who is looking for safe, warm, and fun without all the unnecessary space. Highly highly highly recommended.
3532	6423204	9.0	9.0	33184426	Exactly as described - wonderful cottage.  Hosts Mark and Marti went out of their way to make us feel at home. Located in Ballard within walking distance of many restaurants and shops and only a short drive to downtown Seattle. 
3533	6423204	9.0	9.0	33546663	Great downtown Ballard location. Furnishings are attractive and house is spacious for 2. Added plus is a driveway. No frills but a good stopping place for those on the run. 
3534	6423204	9.0	9.0	34152155	The cabin was great, and only about 2 blocks from all the rest shopping and food in the Ballard neighborhood. Check in and check out were super easy, and they left maps and notes about the house so we felt right at home. A great experience.
3535	6423204	9.0	9.0	34467978	A friend and I booked this house for a long weekend. It could not have been in a better location. Great local food and beers are within walking distance and the house was perfect fit for a weekend stay. Thanks a ton!
3536	6423204	9.0	9.0	34723470	Great location! So many restaurants and shops within walking distance. Also very easy to drive into downtown, everything we wanted to see/do was close by. The house was exactly as described, simple accommodations, but  comfortable. Mark and Marti were easy to get in contact with and very helpful. 
3537	6423204	9.0	9.0	35118412	"Delightful! It is exactly as Mark and Marti describe...a little worn on the outside but warm, welcoming ( instantly felt at home) on the inside. LOVED the location - walking distance to amazing coffee shops, dining spots, parks, a library, the water.  Easy access to downtown Seaatle and other neighborhoods in Seattle. I'd live here forever if I could!
The space inside the was awesome - loved not being linked to technology (currently no wifi - they do plan to offer that soon though) and the visual stimulation/distraction of a TV ( currently no TV - they do plan to install one though). The beds were great. Layout of the home was spacious. Didn't take advantage of the backyard but would have had we been there a day longer!
The only bummer was the wash machine had broken earlier in the week and leaked onto the old floor causing a musty smell that permeated the home but was resolved when the doors were open. Also Marti was awesome and stopped by to give my friend and I $ so we could do laundry at a laundromat close to the home...she even checked out which laundromat would be the best for us and had good Yelp ratings. Above and beyond is what I would say about these hosts! Looking forward to coming back and staying again!"
3538	6423204	9.0	9.0	36026271	Mark & Marti have a great little house in the heart of Ballard steps from all the nightlife, restaurants, and weekend farmers market. The house has all the amenities (no internet) that you need for a great stay. Never met the hosts but they were quick to respond to email and check in was a breeze. Cool little backyard was another plus. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
3539	6423204	9.0	9.0	36293004	Mark & Marti's cottage is fabulous. Great location in Ballard, right by the bus line, good restaurants, and BREWERIES. The apartment is very clean and organized, with everything necessary for a comfortable visit. I would definitely stay here again. 
3540	6423204	9.0	9.0	36705503	We had a great time -the cottage was perfect for our family of 3 and the location is great, only a block away from all the fun Ballard has to offer. Thank you!
3541	6423204	9.0	9.0	36925146	Mark and Marti had an incredibly clean and comfortable space set up for us upon arrival. It was a great place to stay, within walking distance of several cool places in the Ballard area. We would highly recommend this place to any AirBnB guest!
3542	6423204	9.0	9.0	37585905	We had a great stay here! There is a splash pad down the road so my toddler had a blast! The beds were very comfortable! The backyard it was relaxing sitting at the patio table! Marti and Mark were very helpful! 
3543	6423204	9.0	9.0	38185712	The cottage is modest and simple but such a perfect location to experience the Ballard scene. My sisters and I slept like babies in this quiet, comfy spot. Thank you!
3544	6423204	9.0	9.0	38513684	"My parents stayed at this cottage so that they could attend my wedding locally.

The cottage was spacious, clean, and had everything my parents could have needed. The location is perfect-just a couple of blocks from Ballard downtown. Mark and Marti were very communicative throughout the process. I highly recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
3545	6423204	9.0	9.0	39637703	The cottage was not as attractive as the photos and description.  It was very clean and is cute.  However, it is in serious need of many repairs.   With some sprucing up and maintenance it would be a much nicer rental.   Windows did not open and front and back door let in all the bugs when open.   The neighborhood was disappointing and somewhat dumpy.  
3546	6423204	9.0	9.0	41147791	Great experience, highly recommended
3547	6423204	9.0	9.0	41646255	The listing was accurate, the location was great!  We could have done a lot more in the house but we spent a lot of time exploring Seattle.  
3548	6423204	9.0	9.0	42165826	We loved our stay in this rustic cottage right in Ballard. It sure is a gem in the midst of all the modern apartments going up all around! Our expectations about the house were right on, since it is well advertised that it is an old house, clean on the inside and a little crusty on the outside. It served us well as a place to sleep at night and take some rest during the day, while being right in the heart of town. Mark checked in with us often to make sure we were set up and had all we need. The only thing we had to do to prepare the house for our 1 year old explorer was to move some items up and put in outlet protectors. Simple, cozy, cabin like feel. Reminded me of going to my grandma's lake house.
3549	6423204	9.0	9.0	42896212	"The cottage was clean, with everything we needed. The location is very central in Ballard, close to restaurants, coffee shops, bars, boutiques, and a great farmers' market. We had a good time.

As honestly stated in the property description, the cottage looks run-down from the outside, although it is very charming on the inside. A bit of yard work and a coat of paint would help a lot to improved the curb appeal and perhaps discourage some of the homeless that congregate in this area."
3550	6423204	9.0	9.0	44146162	 We had a great stay at the cottage - we had everything we needed and mark and Marti were very helpful and resourceful - we would stay there again for sure ...
3551	6423204	9.0	9.0	44738437	Mark and Marti were warm and welcoming hosts, making sure we had everything we needed; they also had the initiative to call and confirm our plans which was much appreciated.  Planning a holiday for family takes quite a bit of work and i was happy that staying at Mark's house, his attentiveness really took a load off my mind.  The interior of the house is, as mentioned, very well kept and clean - it is also very functional and the kitchen utensils are modern and new.  We had a great time at the place, and thank Mark for hosting us!
3552	6423204	9.0	9.0	45276794	Mark and Marti were great, responsive, nice. The place was in a fantastic location, and very well-maintained. We didn't see an ironing board (we were here for a wedding), asked them about it, and they dropped an iron and an ironing board off same-day. It would have still been a great stay even if they hadn't been able to do that, but it just speaks to the kind of nice and helpful people they are. Other than that, the place was exactly what we were looking for: a great and comfortable base of operations in a great location/neighborhood. We'd stay here again for sure.
3553	6423204	9.0	9.0	45635651	We had a great time in Seattle and the house in Ballard was in a wonderful location with lots of brilliant restaurants, bars and shops. The house had plenty of space for our party of three and we were very comfortable during our stay.
3554	6423204	9.0	9.0	46053919	We had a great long weekend in the Ballard. Great location.   Plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, etc. within just a few blocks.  Nearby grocery store and well equipped kitchen made cooking easy.  Everything very clean.  We traveled with our toddler and the 2nd small bedroom was great for him.  There is a small playground in the neighborhood.   The bathroom is quite small but functional and clean.  We'd definitely stay again.
3555	6423204	9.0	9.0	47017639	Mark and Marti provided all of the necessary information for an easy check-in. Although they weren't onsite, we had everything we needed for the stay. The house had a lot of charm and was clean. The biggest appeal was it's proximity to Old Town Ballard (2 blocks), which was great for exploring. 
3556	6423204	9.0	9.0	47226917	We showed up a little early which was our bad - been on the road for 3 weeks now so our timing is off. The house is super cool and in a perfect location. It's got everything you need and the hosts were quick to respond and didn't bother us at all once we were in the home. I loved Seattle and the neighborhood. So great. 
3557	6423204	9.0	9.0	47435654	Great hosts! Very quick and thorough communication. Set us up perfectly for our stay. Their small, quaint cottage was perfect for our needs and made our stay in Seattle feel a bit more authentic. Ballard is a beautiful little area not too far from downtown destinations. Two places in that area we really enjoyed were Caffe Fiore and Morsel (insane biscuits). All around, we were very pleased with our stay!
3558	6423204	9.0	9.0	47774896	Mark and Marti's cottage was perfect for our 3 night stay in Seattle.  The space was exactly as described and everything was set up for our arrival.  The cottage is well furnished and very comfortable.  The location is the perfect place to stay and enjoy all that Seattle has to offer without being in the hustle of downtown.  There are countless restaurants, coffee shops, and bars within a five minute walk of the cottage.  We loved our time and would be sure to book here again!  Thanks!
3559	6423204	9.0	9.0	48125139	The house is so comfortable and cute, it is perfect for 2 or 3 people.  The kitchen was outfitted well for cooking.   You could stay here for a long or short term stay.  Described accurately, the hosts are very welcoming.  We appreciated how clean it was.  Would definitely stay here again, it was a great value.   
3560	6423204	9.0	9.0	48362019	thanks for the smoothe communication! my brother and father enjoyed the house! 
3561	6423204	9.0	9.0	48758073	"This cottage was exactly as described and was perfect for a weekend getaway.  We love Ballard and have never stayed so close to the ""main drag"".  It was wonderful to be able to walk to restaurants, shops, coffeeshops and the Ballard Farmer's Market.  "
3562	6423204	9.0	9.0	48969549	Easy check-in, great location for access to Ballard, Fremont, the Locks,  delicious restaurants and shops. Very spacious and clean inside.
3563	6423204	9.0	9.0	49145000	Nice cottage with convenience and privacy. The check-in process is absolutely easy. Many restaurants and bars within 2 blocks. Probably the best QFC in 1.5 blocks. Overall a very good choice.
3564	6423204	9.0	9.0	49724651	We loved our stay at Mark and Marti's cottage! The location was unbeatable, walking distance to restaurants, cafes, shops, and grocery stores. Ballard is an awesome neighborhood. Great communication, quick to respond. Cottage was very clean and comfortable, exactly as described, lots of space and even a little backyard area. Thanks Mark and Marti!
3565	6423204	9.0	9.0	51471961	Roberta and Dan we're very nice. The cottage was awesome and in great condition. Many windows (and screens to keep the bugs out). The place is very private, quite, and surrounded by trees. You feel like you are at a lake resort but only 10 minutes drive from the hippest of Seattle's neighborhoods. We enjoyed listening to the many ducks and paddle-boating on the lake. However, our canoeing adventure quickly became a swimming adventure. Getting in a canoe is harder than it looks, but at least we have an embarrassing story to tell.
3566	6423204	9.0	9.0	52352302	Perfect charming cottage in the heart of Ballard. My 4 year old son even loved his room with the bed. Hat tip for the hosts having the place decorated for Halloween too!
3567	6423204	9.0	9.0	52534465	Everything was well documented and easy.  A great place in a great neighborhood.  
3568	6423204	9.0	9.0	54251875	The cottage was lovely, and just as described in the listing.  It is quite convenient to all the great stores, coffee houses, etc. in Ballard.  We especially liked having off-street parking.  
3569	6423204	9.0	9.0	54448031	Great location and good place for the price. The house was a bit musty, but otherwise quite comfortable. 
3570	6423204	9.0	9.0	54823863	The home was just as described. Very charming and clean just a few minutes walk to the bus stop, grocery store, and restaurants. Mark and Marti were so thoughtful they provided umbrellas, the discount card to the grocery store and growlers so you can fill up at the local brewery. These little details made you feel like you were at home. Would definitely stay again when I return to Seattle.
3571	6423204	9.0	9.0	55984316	Very nice cottage\and location was ecelent in Ballard
3572	6423204	9.0	9.0	56703771	The 1919 Cottage offers exactly what it is told to be.  Very cozy and comfy.  One of kind experience. 
3573	6423204	9.0	9.0	57075791	Great place to stay! Charming and homey. Quiet but still close to the main part if Ballard. A wonderful full kitchen and their awesome comfy couch were highlights. Also they have a driveway for you to park which is really convenient. 
3574	6423204	9.0	9.0	57255255	We loved this little cottage (one of the last houses on the block not turned into massive, multi-unit condos) and it was perfect for me and my daughter.  Cozy, yet plenty of room.  We appreciated the thoughtful details like umbrellas (which we used!).  We would absolutely want to stay here the next time we visit friends in Ballard! 
3575	6423204	9.0	9.0	57555254	"""Charming"" is the perfect word to describe this cottage. The common areas were awesome for a home this size. Location was terrific and within walking distance to great shops and restaurants. Marti and Mark supplied all essentials necessary for a comfortable stay and were responsive to all our needs.

4325	3155785	8.0	9.0	42231253	Kim was great and responsive to meeting up to handoff the key, provide the address, etc.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I was a single female traveling alone and felt very safe at Kim and her roommate's place.
4326	3155785	8.0	9.0	42629386	I loved staying with Kim.  She was a great host and the retro vintage house is exactly as advertised.  My room had a private bathroom which made the stay even better.  Highly recommended!
4327	3155785	8.0	9.0	43310332	Kim was warm, friendly, and real. Thanks, Kim! The room I rented was big and clean. It had its own bathroom with shower! I liked the diverse pictures and sculptures through the place.  And I guess I like short sentences. 
4328	3155785	8.0	9.0	46005974	I did not meet Kim during my visit. I stayed in her room while she was out of town. The room is nice and the bathroom and shower were fine. I only briefly met the other roommates. 
6498	1494986	10.0	9.0	7099304	We had a lovely stay at William's apartment. Very romantic. Beautiful private garden with an amazing hot tub. Would reccomend staying here to any and all friends traveling to Seattle. William was very nice and helpful. He had lots of reccomendations for the area. We couldn't have asked for a better place to experience Queen Anne!
6499	1494986	10.0	9.0	12317568	We had a really great stay, the place is beautiful and clean and comfortable. Thanks for having us!
6500	1494986	10.0	9.0	23177787	Nice modern place. Everything was clean. We didn't use the hot tub but is an awesome amenity. 
6501	1494986	10.0	9.0	25035301	We usually stay in West Seattle but wanted to stay somewhere more central, specifically Queen Anne. From the pictures William's apartment looked clean, modern, and functional. The apartment was everything we hoped. Clean, well decorated, functional and convenient. We enjoyed walking the stairs to the top of the hill, walking down the stairs to Lake Union, and walking down the hill for coffee and groceries. Great location, great apartment, looking forward to staying there again.
6502	1494986	10.0	9.0	26115471	"Pristine property perfect for a couple. Well appointed details throughout contained everything we could need for a week of exploring the city and relaxing in comfort. I would recommend this property to any of my friends and family.

The floor plan shows a garage which is not in use, however we were able to park directly in front of the unit without any difficulty throughout the week.

Central location was only a $10 Uber ride to most destinations.

A very wonderful experience."
6503	1494986	10.0	9.0	38556211	This was the perfect place to stay for me and my family. It as really quiet and peaceful and the house was located in a convenient location in Queen Anne. Inside was really clean and had just the right amount of space for us. We loved being able to relax on the patio and look out to the trees. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to take advantage of the spa. The coordination with William was seamless. I would stay there again next time in in town.  
6504	1494986	10.0	9.0	45666593	We had such a good time at Queen Anne Garden Gateway, the apartment exceeded our expectations. Very modern and luxurious and in a great part of Seattle. We stayed for four nights and by the end of our stay the place really felt like a home. The bed is extremely comfortable and the television huge. We liked the place so much that we actually just stayed in and cooked for 2 nights, the kitchen is well equipped with everything you may need. There is a great supermarket just down the road. Definitely recommend staying here.
6505	1494986	10.0	9.0	47465743	The host provided very comprehensive instructions on how to enter, etc.  We felt the property was exactly as promised.  We would stay here again.  It was across the street from the #2 & 3 bus stop which took you right to Seattle Center.  We walked from the property as well and found ourselves in the wonderful neighborhood of Queen Anne, a mere heart pounding steps (that's Seattle) away.
6506	1494986	10.0	9.0	49446397	The unit is beautiful and so clean! William (our host) was so patient and answered all our questions promptly. He sent us recommendations of restaurants and bars in the area, as well as grocery store which was such a huge help. The pictures don't do it justice. It's so quiet and in a great neighborhood. It's in a very central location and only a $7-8 uber ride to downtown or pike place. Four of us stayed and there was plenty of room. The unit is so comfortable (especially the beds), we didn't want to leave! We really loved staying here. We will be back and will definitely stay here again.
6507	1494986	10.0	9.0	55739656	"William was a kind host and very helpful. We ran into some trouble on our way up to Seattle, but once we arrived to our final destination, everything was set up perfectly and without wait.

His list of local grub and other local options was a great help for first-timers in the Queen Anne area."
6567	4016650	10.0	9.0	27312972	My girlfriend and I had a very charming stay at the Gallery last weekend. The place is tastefully, comfortably furnished with a great view of Lake Union and Gas Works Park. There was limited street parking available, but there is a really easy to access public transportation. Brian was a great host and we look forward to our next stay. Highly recommended!
6568	4016650	10.0	9.0	28189981	Brian and Lydia are classy, civilized people used to a sophisticated lifestyle.  Being in Brian's place compares favorably to being in a four or five star hotel:  luxurious bed and linens,  a walk-in closet, a million dollar view, original art on the walls, bagels and coffee for breakfast.  All  just a short bus ride from downtown.  Highly recommended!
6569	4016650	10.0	9.0	28369026	My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our time spent at The Gallery. Both Brian and Lydia are warm and welcoming personalities. Lydia gave us fantastic recommendations for restaurants and local entertainment. We felt very at home, slept wonderfully, and woke to a breath taking view of Lake Union and the Cascades. Wish we could’ve stayed longer!
6570	4016650	10.0	9.0	28543080	What an amazing experience staying at The Gallery! Such a lovely room with a beautiful view - we laid in bed and watched planes land and take off from the lake for hours. The guide book you put together really helped get us oriented not only to the house but the city as well by providing really helpful information on bus routes + the neighborhoods. Thank you for making this an easy and unforgettable experience! 
6571	4016650	10.0	9.0	28826826	"My wife and I had a wonderful stay at The Gallery!

Our delightful host Lydia was very helpful and easygoing.  She was very happy to offer recommendations when we asked for them, including pubs in Downtown and the Sunday market in Fremont.

The house was warm and welcoming and the view of Lake Union from the room was simply stunning.  The location was perfect and was the ideal base from which to explore the area; in particular, the house is served by many bus lines so Downtown is easy to reach.

Overall, we loved it and thoroughly recommend you visit soon!"
6572	4016650	10.0	9.0	30148912	"I'm a frequent Airbnb user, this stay makes me reconsider if a  hotel might still be a better idea for a solo female traveler. 单独旅行女性，慎重选择。屋主和家管不是很友善。－一位在美国居住4年，airbnb常用用户提醒。

Day 1: ""Antique shop is not suitable for you."" It's what Brian told me, when I asked for vintage shopping (email hidden)e host has critical attitude.

The room is very clean and new, but it's cold in sleeping time. I only got 3 warm nights with heat on after the hosts got notified for this 18 nights stay. Brian explained the house would be too hot for him if the heat's on. The portable heater wasn't coming as he suggested. And he called me COLD BLOODED. Lydia was laughing next to him. what's funny?

The house location is perfectly in middle of the city, and a nice walking distance to Fremont. I appreciate the laundry is open for guests, and you'll have yogurt everyday! However, I couldn't be relaxed during the stay. Sound proof is not so good. you can hear everything above your room and the gate alert easily wakes me up. 

Host dresses very casual. You'll see Brain in blue bath robe ONLY in the living room at night. Lydia is hateful to guests. She believes everything you can HELP YOURSELF with that thick RESOURCE BINDER;She watches you every move.Anything you missed from the binder, you will be judged or yelled. Once she was not happy about me replacing a piece of foil for my old lemon.""It's wasteful."" she said.  Lydia is someone who hired to host the house, she is a nice host  only when Brian is around. 

I wish all upcoming guests won't have same experience as I had. As far as you know where to go, have Uber,gps set up, this is the best place for short stay. Break a leg!"
6573	4016650	10.0	9.0	30403588	"Got back last week from a great solo four day trip to Seattle, thanks in large part to the accommodations provided by Brian.  Brian set me up in a large, very comfortable room with huge closet, top notch bed and desk overlooking Lake Union (the pictures say it all).  Waking up with the sun rising over the Cascades, a coffee and bagel in my hand, sitting on one of the balconies, was really more than I expected.    

I was out most of the time and found the location very convenient.  The bus stop back from downtown is a few hundred feet away from the front door and while the stop downtown requires navigating some stairs to get under the Aurora Bridge, it was no big deal.  Once the bus arrived, it was about 15 minutes down to Pike Street.  Buying one of the ORCA cards at the beginning of the trip made paying for public transit easy and hassle free.  Recommended.

Brian was a great host.  Being the first time using an airbnb rental, Brian made me feel welcome from the time the front door openened (the smell of garlic simmering in the air) until I left.  No awkward moments, but nice casual conversation during our fairly brief encounters.  

Brian's home was very clean and nicely furnished.  I was offered use of his kitchen and enjoyed the privacy of bedroom and shared bathroom which never seemed to be used by anyone else.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience.       "
6574	4016650	10.0	9.0	30650761	This was my first visit to Seattle to attend a conference and spend a few days seeing the city and area. Brian couldn't have been a better host. An unforeseen change in my plans could have been disastrous, but Brian patiently and graciously assisted me in getting it all worked out. The room was  comfortable and quiet, with a spectacular view of Lake Union and the sunrise. The directions provided from SeaTac via Link and bus were spot on, with only a one minute walk from the bus stop. On my next visit to Seattle, there will be a next visit, I will definitely consider staying at the Gallery. Thank you, Brian. You helped make my trip unforgettable. 
6575	4016650	10.0	9.0	31131638	We arrived at the property and had very detailed instructions on how to gain access  as the host was not home from work.  It went without a hitch.  The directions were perfect.  We settled into our room and immediately loved the view overlooking Lake Washington.  Everything was comfortable and welcoming.  Lydia was a wonderful host and was very accommodating and friendly.  We enjoyed the access to the kitchen and appreciated the bagels and yogurt in the morning.  My daughter, husband and I loved this property as it was withing walking distance to the University of Washington and close to many restaurants and coffee shops.   I highly recommend it...:)
6576	4016650	10.0	9.0	31205724	"Brian's place is awesome.  The decor is great, and accurately represented (if not better in person!).  Art everywhere, and amazing views.  

There were lots of great books about the area and travel destinations all over the place to glance through while relaxing.  The views of Lake Union were great as well, so it was easy to watch the boats on the water, and the seaplanes coming and going!  If you just want to rest a bit, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, so that's not a problem at all.

The steak house on the corner has amazing reviews, but might be out of the price range of most travels (it was definitely out of ours).  A little more of a walk gets you to some great selections, and delivery is always an option we found out as well.  It is a reasonable walk from Gasworks park, and near 2 different bus stops to let you get down town within a few minutes. 

All of this and more is in the binder he leaves in the kitchen for you to read through, and it's a great prep for your stay in the area.  If that's not enough, all you need is a quick 3 minute conversation with Lydia to know all the in's and out's of the area and everything it has to offer.  She helped us setup a phone app for bus schedules, and gave us tips on all the options around for the rest of our stay, even beyond our stay at The Gallery.

When we get back to Seattle next, we'll definitely look into staying there again!"
6577	4016650	10.0	9.0	31826473	"Staying here was such a luxury, the view was gorgeous and though I sat at the desk for several hours doing work, it didn't feel like ""work"" - it felt blissful.  The bed was super comfortable, towels thick and fluffy, plenty of closet space and both Brian and Lydia were wonderful to meet.  Very accommodating and all-out good people.  Hoping that my next visit will be longer than two days!"
6578	4016650	10.0	9.0	32422196	"What a great visit !  My bedroom was quiet and comfortable (btw, LOVE the mattress and pillows!).  The Gallery was nicely appointed, clean, up to date, and yes, the views were superb!  Brian was out of town and Lydia, his host/representative, was there.  Because of my schedule, I didn't see her until my last day in Seattle.  She was very quick, though, to respond via text to answer any questions.  Lydia is a bright young woman, very personable, helpful, knows Seattle well, and is a perfect host.  
As a footnote, I was initially reluctant to stay in a place with a shared bathroom (shared with Lydia).  My concern was quite unnecessary as Lydia was virtually ""invisible""......I never felt I was ""sharing"" a bathroom.  I will certainly stay at the Gallery again!!!"
6579	4016650	10.0	9.0	32818798	We had excellent communication with the hosts! They were gracious and let us check in early since we flew in on a morning. The view is phenomonal! We'd stay again if possible.
6580	4016650	10.0	9.0	33100263	"Brian's place is extremely pleasant and tastefully appointed, with a lovely view of Lake Union. It is convenient to Downtown by bus (or Uber/taxi), and downtown Queen Anne and Fremont are both a 20-30 minute walk or a quick Uber ride away. There isn't much in the way of services in the *immediate* vicinity on foot, but if you have a car, or walk one way and get a ride back the other, it's no big issue to get to downtown Queen Anne for Safeway and Trader Joe's.

Definitely a great value, and a delightful property. We were apparently the first people to use it without Brian or Lydia there, so I can't thank or compliment them in person, but we had a great stay."
6581	4016650	10.0	9.0	33697879	If you want to stay in a great area of Seattle in a room with an unbelievable view, with a friendly and welcoming host, look no further. My girlfriend and I stayed at The Gallery for 5 days and wish we never had to leave. The room itself is spacious, with a very comfortable bed and bedding, a large closet, a desk, two luggage racks, a private balcony, and an unbelievable view of Lake Union and Gas Works Park. We had a great time watching seaplanes take off and land from the comfort of our room. The guide Brian and Lydia provide is extremely thorough and helpful with regards to explaining everything from how to use the TV to a thorough guide of public transportation. The guide made exploring Seattle via public transportation very easy. We did not get the pleasure of meeting Lydia because she was traveling during our stay. However, we did get to meet Brian. Brian is a great host and a great guy. He was always very courteous and helpful and it was great getting to know him a little bit. For example, my girlfriend and I were sitting at a bus stop and Brian saw us from his car as he was driving by. Brian immediately stopped his car and offered to get us closer to our destination. I thought that was really great. We didn't see him all the time during the stay (it was almost like having the place to ourselves) but when we did see him, we had a great time talking to him.  I would recommend the gallery to anyone looking to stay at a wonderful place with a lot of information on exploring Seattle. Thank you so much for having us Brian.
6582	4016650	10.0	9.0	34337488	Brian was a fantastic host and his property was exactly what I was looking for. It is located in an ideal location with public transportation options very accessible and mere minutes away from the Fremont neighborhood and downtown. Brian was great at responding to any correspondence in a timely manner and addressing any issues that arose. He also made sure there was yogurt, coffee and bagels for breakfast each morning which was a very nice touch. The reality of staying here absolutely lived up to the expectations of the photos of this listing. The view of Lake Union from the bedroom was enough to convince me to return here if I'm ever back in Seattle. I definitely recommend considering this property for your next trip to the Pacific Northwest.  
6583	4016650	10.0	9.0	35103784	Overall an excellent experience. The process leading up to checkin was great. Brian was a great communicator and I had no trouble getting into the property.  The view was awesome from my room and it was a wonderful property.  The room and bathroom was spotless and I felt at home.
6584	4016650	10.0	9.0	35471063	"Our recent stay at The Gallery was exactly as described in Brian's listing. We visited Seattle towards the end of a week-long PNW trip, and the comfort and amenities of The Gallery were exactly what we were looking for. The panoramic views, proximity to multiple neighborhoods, and access to transit made for a great stay in Seattle.

The private room and common areas are well appointed, and provide a quiet retreat away from the busy streets and crowds.

Brian was a great host, and provided solid advice and recommendations for our first visit to the city. The resource binder was a thing of beauty - and it answered all our questions about what to do and where to eat around town.

We hope to return to The Gallery on a future visit to Seattle."
6585	4016650	10.0	9.0	37707664	While I was unable to meet Brian personally, Lydia took great care of me! Every need was anticipated and I felt right at home. They even went the extra mile with providing an optional breakfast. Places and people like this don't come around often enough. Brian's home is pristine and beautiful, and the room had a gorgeous view, giving any tourist a wonderful introduction to the Pacific Northwest. Parking was simple, wifi was fast, location can't be beat and there was always a personal touch. I would highly recommend The Gallery to anyone.
6586	4016650	10.0	9.0	38534412	"I stayed at the Gallery with Brian and Lydia, his assistant  for one week. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The house is beautiful and has fabulous views over Lake Union. Brian and Lydia were very friendly and helpful. It's very easy to get a bus or an Uber downtown from here.  I would recommend this AirBnB to anyone. 
"
6587	4016650	10.0	9.0	38917715	We had a wonderful stay at Brian's home. He and his assistant Lydia attended to every detail and were quite helpful with travel and restaurant suggestions. We felt very welcomed. Brian's new home is beautifully decorated with a comfortable bed and an exquisite view of Lake Union. It is in a residential neighborhood with easy access to bus lines and coffee shops within a 5 minute car ride. Finding a parking space was challenging on a few nights.  We were there during a heat spell and would have liked a fan. Brian plans to add that feature.  We highly recommend this bNb. It was comfortable, welcoming, in a convenient location and quite private.  A real find!
6588	4016650	10.0	9.0	39461554	Brian and Lydia were really accommodating and superb hosts. The location and room were both brilliant and the view of Lake Union was simply brilliant. 
6589	4016650	10.0	9.0	39809526	Brian's unit was impeccably clean, offered a great view/bed, and he + Lydia were very helpful hosts. It was definitely a nice base for exploring Fremont/Ballard + Queen Anne. We drove up from PDX and parking is very difficult immediately near the apartment (just a limited # of spaces on their street) but if you are willing to walk ~3 minutes up/down a hill you are fine, so keep in that mind. It is right next to Canlis if you are thinking of eating there, was certainly nice to be able to walk there! Thanks again.
6590	4016650	10.0	9.0	40837224	The house was beautiful and couldn't ask for a better view outside your bedroom window.  Both Brian and Lydia were very gracious and offered suggestions of things to do around town.  Overall a fantastic experience!
6591	4016650	10.0	9.0	41789414	Brian and Lydia were fantastic hosts. The room had an amazing view, and provided everything we needed for our stay in Seattle. Lydia provided several recommendations for where to eat/visit,  and helped us learn our way around public transportation. Would definitely recommend staying at the gallery!
6592	4016650	10.0	9.0	43082026	I really enjoyed my time at the Gallery! I have to say that waking up the the view of Lake Union and enjoying it from the living room as well was my favorite thing about my stay. The bathroom is also fully stocked with amenities, which was also a huge plus from a convenience standpoint. The sun shines into the room in the morning, but there are blinds to shut out the light until you're ready to meet the day. I would highly recommend this listing and I hope to stay there in the future again!
6593	4016650	10.0	9.0	43443711	Brian and Lydia were friendly hosts. Both were very helpful in responding my questions in timely manner throughout the reservation and the stay. The amazing lake view from the room provided the beautiful sunrise to be seen from the bed during the clear days. The cute balconies in the room and the living room were excellent for the tea and the breeze. Light breakfast was provided. Overall, the Gallery was cozy and beautiful, located in a quiet neighborhood, however on-street parking could be challenge. We enjoyed our stay.
6594	4016650	10.0	9.0	43849500	The Gallery is wonderful with a beautiful view of Lake Union outside of the window! I love it! Brian is such a gentleman,  very generous and put a lot of trust on me! Lydia helped arranging all the details which makes our staying smoothly and comfortable. Thank u Brian and Lydia, your place is the one I would like to revisit. 
6595	4016650	10.0	9.0	44959821	Great stay, beautiful apartment with an awesome view of the lake.  Very clean, very comforting, highly recommend a stay at The Gallery.  And cant forget to mention the hosts - Lydia was fantastic to work with for the planning aspects and it was nice chatting with Brian - both of which were very happy to provide some great Seattle recommendations.
6596	4016650	10.0	9.0	45333647	Great location and neat place. Will definitely recommend.
6597	4016650	10.0	9.0	46005946	"Great location! Perfect accommodations. Fast communication with Lydia and Brian prior to arriving. Hard to find the townhouse at first. It's at the dead end of the cauldasack to the left (2nd building off street). Wonderful view of the city. The room and bathroom were clean and nice. Had a nice time visiting with Brian, he had some nice recommendations on places to eat. Only saw Lydia once, I think she just rents a room from him. This is embarrassing, but we clogged the toilet and Brian cou don't have been nicer about it. 
The directions to the bus routes could be clearer, also would have liked it if they pointed out specific locations to go to along with bus number. We downloaded bus route app, which helped us. We rented kayaks a few blocks from the place - so easy and a beautiful view on Lake Union. Would definitely recommend this place and stay here again!! "
6598	4016650	10.0	9.0	47409476	Had a fantastic experience at the Gallery - gorgeous views as promised and very well maintained neat place. Brian and Lydia were friendly and easy to talk to. Hope to visit again sometime in the future.
6599	4016650	10.0	9.0	48965211	Listing was spot on. Location was perfect. The place was exactly what we expected. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. Access to public transit was right down the street. The veiw! The veiw is awesome! We'll reach out to this host on our next visit to Seattle.
6600	4016650	10.0	9.0	51505936	This is the second time to visit Seattle. We arrived in night but Lydia is really nice to keep contact with us whenever we had any question. We total stay 3 nights and when we waked up in the morning, the view in the room is so fantastic and we are really glad we stay in Brian's house since we found out the duck boat tour was not any more available by one accident they met before. So we couldn't see the the view of Lake Union by duck boat. But we had so wonderful memory for staying Brain's house. Everything is perfect here. We will visit again when we will go to Seattle again! 
6601	4016650	10.0	9.0	52431113	Clean, warm, perfect lake view. Making my first few days in Seattle a very pleasant time. Met Brian and Lydia only once during my stay. They were both very friendly.
6602	4016650	10.0	9.0	54365459	I had a great experience staying at Brian's!!  Brian and Lydia were both very welcoming and accommodating and interesting to talk to.   The apartment is fairly close to the downtown area and there is a rapid transit bus stop nearby.  Getting to see the sun rise over Lake Union alone makes this place worth it!
7416	6776229	10.0	9.0	44863335	Lovely apartment. Good lake view.Convenient.Clean. I like the coffee machine.
7417	6776229	10.0	9.0	45023940	Stayed one night to be closer to a wedding.  The host was very welcoming and responsive.  The unit is extremely clean and comfortable.  The kitchen is well stocked.  Great view of Lake Union!  I would stay again.  
7418	6776229	10.0	9.0	45447717	The apartment was very nice and clean.  Everything we needed was provided for us. The host was very helpful and prompt to help us during our stay. 
7419	6776229	10.0	9.0	46064152	Great place! Super convenient to the major Seattle neighborhoods. Comfy and quiet. Made for a great base camp for a long weekend of exploring. I'd stay here again.
7420	6776229	10.0	9.0	46645603	Had a great experience. Everything was as described. Great balcony view!
7421	6776229	10.0	9.0	46972936	The host was very attentive for our needs, much appreciated their flexible hospitality! Apartment was clean, efficient for all your need, and has a killer view of Union Lake. Enjoy our stay at your place, thank you so much :) 
7422	6776229	10.0	9.0	48585806	This was a great home base for our weekend in Seattle. The location made it easy to get around by car and public transport. Though our outings were fun, we were also happy to spend relaxed time in the very comfortable apartment. 
7423	6776229	10.0	9.0	49357585	The apartment was exactly as advertised - clean and comfortable.  It served as a good home base for exploring Seattle's many neighborhoods and downtown.  We would welcome the chance to stay here again if we're ever back in Seattle.
7424	6776229	10.0	9.0	49826317	Great, convenient spot to stay in Seattle. Located in a place that made getting around quick and easy. Very clean apartment. 
7425	6776229	10.0	9.0	50684719	Everything was as described. We enjoyed the stay very much. 
7426	6776229	10.0	9.0	51333328	We had an amazing stay at this apartment during our trip to Seattle! Everything was very clean, the view was spectacular, and the neighborhood was very quiet and central to many locations we visited. Tim provided everything we needed and made our stay very easy. We would love to stay here again when visiting Seattle! 
7427	6776229	10.0	9.0	51832765	Timothy made it very easy for me to enter and exit the apartment.  He and Brittany were as helpful and as responsive as one could hope for.  The place was perhaps better than described... was very spacious, well equipped with a view to boot.   The gym was better than I expected and the unit very clean and (website hidden), with hbo on demand and good wifi once I locked into the correct password. Location is great for people with a car or those that like to walk.  The cool neighborhoods of Fremont and Queen Ann's are accessible at about .6-7 miles to Fremont and 1 mile to the heart of Queen Anne's.  If you don't have a car, the E line bus is a cinch and you are downtown in 12 minutes.  I took one cab the whole time.  I got to the airport, faster than a cab would have taken by one bus and the light rail.  I did not cook, but could have done so with a nice modern kitchen.  Washer and dryer also for those staying a while.  I recommend this listing highly. 
7428	6776229	10.0	9.0	52135219	Sstreamlined check-in. 
7429	6776229	10.0	9.0	53098898	"We very much enjoyed our stay here.  The area is nice and fairly centrally located.  Having a car definitely made things easier, and the reserved parking space was a big plus.

The apartment is not huge but is a step up from a typical hotel.  The living room is large and spacious, and the kitchen is large and well-equipped enough to cook normal meals.  There's a separate bathroom with tub and a normal-sized bedroom as well.  The view of the river from the balcony is fantastic.

The appliances, such as the dishwasher, washer, and dryer, make this a practical place for a longer stay, although we only spent 3 days there.

All rooms are well-appointed, clean, and comfortable.  We also appreciated the included sundries such as shampoo, coffee & tea, laundry detergent, a Brita water filter/dispenser, and some basic cooking ingredients.  

The host was very responsive and helpful when we contacted.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and we would gladly stay here again."
7430	6776229	10.0	9.0	53767422	Heart of Seattle has heart. Located near everything and easy public transportation. It is clean and well equipped for cooking homemade meals. Easy check in and out. Free parking which is a bonus in Seattle.  Pretty decent view also. I would definitely recommend this place.
7431	6776229	10.0	9.0	54411491	What an amazing view! I did get the chance to briefly meet the host and super gracious. Perfect location and amenities for our stay. I will certainly come back on another trip.
7432	6776229	10.0	9.0	54931195	"Tim and Brittney were great hosts.  They were very communicative and answered questions prior to my arrival.  The place was exactly as pictured and even better than what I imagined.  It feels like a brand new 1BR that is laid out well for the amount of space.  I was staying alone for almost 4 days and enjoyed my time there.  

The place comes equipped with everything you need including a washer/dryer which was super helpful for me as I am staying in Seattle for a full week.  Clear instructions were left in terms of how to leave the place.  I had one minor SNAFU while I was there but Tim and Brittney quickly contacted the building and got back to me as it was a building-wide issue and not specific to the unit.  

Overall I would stay here again, the place had a great view, the workout room was a nice bonus.  The only thing to be aware of is that there are multiple entrances which can cause confusion to Uber drivers so you're better off trying to meet them on 6th Street instead of Aurora because the turn comes up very quick.  "
7433	6776229	10.0	9.0	55101807	The host was very accommodating to my need to check in a bit earlier. The coffee and the holiday decorations were a welcome touch.  
7434	6776229	10.0	9.0	55685385	Tim was available and helpful and made everything very easy. The place was super cute, and exactly as advertised. It surprised me that it was so quiet, you can't hear any of the traffic on Aurora. I would stay here again.
7435	6776229	10.0	9.0	56520387	Lovely decor and comfy furnishings, exactly as depicted in the photo.  The place has a great sized bathroom, also tastefully decorated and accessible with railings (which was a great surprise). Little holiday wishes on the bed pillows and kitchen table. Great view of Lake Union. Couldn't have asked for better accommodations.  Would definitely love to come back again and take advantage of the roof deck and exercise facilities.
7436	6776229	10.0	9.0	57049954	The accommodations were wonderful and Timothy was very helpful with any questions we had during our stay. The apartment is very clean, nicely decorated and has a spectacular view! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend!
8479	7226013	9.0	9.0	37931720	We had a great time in Angels apartment. It was exactly as described,  comfortable and clean. Angel is a lovely person, welcomed us and gave us tips and recommendations for the area. The location was conveniently located near the E-line that takes you downtown in only 15 minutes. There's also many places to eat and discover just a walk away! I can recommend her space to anyone visiting Seattle! 
8480	7226013	9.0	9.0	38077742	Angel's place is located easy walking distance from lots of dining and drinking options on 45th street.  Also, great location if you plan on checking out other neighborhoods.  The room and shared bathroom were clean and comfortable.  Her dog was adorable!
8481	7226013	9.0	9.0	38464118	"Angel was very flexible with the check-in time and welcomed us warmly. We really felt like home and enjoyed our time there. Odin the dog is also very lovely! A special perk was that breakfast was included.

The room was as shown in the pictures and quite cozy. There is a good and fast bus connection to central Seattle just around the corner. We would recommend Angels and Evans place!
"
8482	7226013	9.0	9.0	38785369	Angel was very helpful and welcoming and the room was clean and suitable for our needs. There was a basically private bathroom and use of the kitchen as well as breakfast provided. The neighbourhood is neat with a big choice of restaurants within easy for walking.
8483	7226013	9.0	9.0	39584560	Well-priced accommodation in a great location with super-friendly hosts, thank you!
8484	7226013	9.0	9.0	39862411	We had a lovely stay with Angel and Evan. Angel was very helpful with every aspect of our stay and was able to provide some food suggestions as well. The location was absolutely perfect for catching the bus. Odin was super cute and friendly.  Communication was excellent which we really loved . We would stay here again in the future. 
8485	7226013	9.0	9.0	40287721	"We really enjoyed this stay the hosts Angel and Evan are extremely friendly and made us feel at home. Angels home made granola is amazing. The dog Odin is a great fella, he will allow you to fuss him but he doesn't jump up or beg for food.
The room is clean and large, the house is close to the E line and other bus routes.
Would go back here in a second."
8486	7226013	9.0	9.0	41135501	Angel was a great host! The place was clean and nice and she really made us feel at home. The open, inviting feeling was much appreciated! We also loved the little extras that showed that she really thought about her guests- travel brochures, maps, small toiletries. Awesome, would totally recommend for anyone looking to stay in a cool neighborhood in Seattle that wants a laid back and nice experience!
8487	7226013	9.0	9.0	41429554	"Angel was very helpful and communicative from the beginning - she made sure to give us directions to help avoid traffic when we had to get to Eastlake - she also told us about local restaurants and things to do around the neighborhood (I recommend checking out the Gasworks park nearby)

"
8488	7226013	9.0	9.0	43174946	"Angels house is in a fantastic neighbourhood, just a walk away from a beautiful lake and about a 15minute bus ride from central Seattle. 

When we arrived she provided us with plenty of leaflets and gave us directions to where we wanted to go and  tips.

"
9575	7182584	9.0	9.0	49812929	Great to have a place to ourselves that was still close to the activities we came to enjoy. 
9576	7182584	9.0	9.0	51312563	This was a super-cozy, quiet oasis for our weekend in Seattle. This was our first airbnb experience that was truly kid-friendly for our 21 mo old with the low beds and toys and relative lack of potential breakables. The neighborhood was green, quiet, and very walkable with a grocery just a few blocks away. Parking was easy but we walked to breakfast, green lake, awesome playgrounds and quirky shops like Sock Monster and Archie McPhee's.  Not in the middle of the action but a short drive away from the Seattle sights (although we never left the neighborhood). 
9577	7182584	9.0	9.0	51630087	"
Pamela did an excellent job of making us feel welcome and at home, and made sure the house was stocked with essentials like fresh coffee and bread. 

The house is really beautiful, the location is great, and there's a lot of stuff for kids in the house (books, toys, bath stuff, etc).

Also, the house itself was set up well for people with young children, since there's a lot of open space both inside and out, and the master bedroom's bed was so low to the ground. (It was also a really comfortable bed!) 

Highly recommended! "
10414	7459684	10.0	9.0	44967840	Charming duplex, central and walkable to many great parts of Seattle. Birgit was very communicative and friendly in meeting us to show the apartment upon arrival. I'd definitely stay again. 
10415	7459684	10.0	9.0	45325560	Birgit made sure the place was nice and clean before we got in. She made us feel welcomed and we loved her place. It was pretty spacious and not far from downtown Seattle. 
10416	7459684	10.0	9.0	46971051	The location was great for us.  It was nice to be able to walk up the street to Irwin's for coffee early in the morning.  Even though there is a bus stop within walking distance, I would recommend having a car to get around.  Don't expect any fluff, just a decent place to stay at a reasonable price.
10417	7459684	10.0	9.0	47819701	Checking in to the house was very easy, they left a key for me and also checked in the day before to see if I had any questions.  I am actually from the neighbourhood so I knew where I was going and what to do!  The apartment was just as they said on the listing.  I love Wallingford, not just because I grew up there!  House is walking distance to Portage Bay, a great brunch spot and Wallingford is very walkable.
10418	7459684	10.0	9.0	48544759	"Catherine made us feel very welcome. We had some unfortunate mishaps with reservations (having nothing to do with the hosts) that the owners handled graciously. Catherine was available, accessible and helpful.

For that reason, it is difficult to give frank feedback about the accomadations. However, I feel that in the spirit of AirB&B and entrepreneurship, it is important to do so. This is my 5th AirB&B, in urban and rural areas, so I feel that I have a decent basis of comparison. I am confident that the hosts will respond in kind and this can become a great place to stay!

The good news: very clean, decent layout, safe, etc.  It is near some great restaurants and a great bike/running trail, which was nice. 
For folks looking to explore Seattle, Wallingford is not very central. That is a certainly a matter of preference, however. An argument can be made both ways: a nice, local feel vs. centrality.
The not-so-great-news: My boyfriend and I both agreed that, for the money, this place could have been nicer (or a bit less expensive). It just didn't feel very generously-appointed. We will give specific feedback to the hosts.
The bad news: The $75 cleaning fee. We have had two cleaning fees in the past ($40 each). I wasn't looking for it (my bad) and it came as an unpleasant surprise. 
Overall: I think that the demand in Seattle is very high for AirB&B. While I would not enthusiastically recommend this place, it was perfectly acceptable. Other reviewers have seemed to like it, so this might have just been our opinion, compared to other places that we have stayed. With a few tweaks (and lower cleaning fee), this could be a great place to stay."
10419	7459684	10.0	9.0	49055872	We had a short, but very pleasant stay.  The apartment is lovely and comfortable.
10420	7459684	10.0	9.0	49276715	We had a great stay! Very comfortable and quiet. Host was very communicative and quick to respond when we had questions. Overall wonderful experience.
10421	7459684	10.0	9.0	49642267	My friends and I stayed very comfortably in this Wallingford home. One of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. The space is big enough it did not feel cramped at all with two people in each room and one friend on the provided air mattress with a cover and sheets. Birgit was great at communicating with us and we would happily stay here again!
10422	7459684	10.0	9.0	50022565	"Our stay was great. Birgit's home is very comfortable. The location was convenient for us to explore Seattle by car or Uber: dumplings at Din Tai Fung, Seahawks game, Marination Station in West Seattle, Living Computer Museum, etc.  Birgit allowed us to park in the driveway which was great because street parking is tighter than I expected.

We never met Birgit but we communicated with her and her daughter Kristina by text and everything went smoothly."
10423	7459684	10.0	9.0	51065704	We had a great time at Birgit's duplex. Everything went smoothly and the place was prefect for us. We enjoyed the neighborhood and the access to downtown Seattle. The place was very clean and had all the creature comforts we needed and more.
10424	7459684	10.0	9.0	53338483	I stayed at Birgit's for 3 weeks while visiting Seattle. The apartment was clean, spacious and in a good location ( close to Burke-Gilman trail, UW & bus connections). The kitchen was well equipped with cooking utensils etc. so the apartment is ideal for longer visits as well if you want to cook yourself and make it feel like home. Communication with Birgit was smooth before arrival and her daughter Kristina was helpful with everything I would need during my stay.
10425	7459684	10.0	9.0	53549744	Very nice little home in excellent location
10426	7459684	10.0	9.0	53816878	We had a great experience here.  It was very convenient to my meetings at the University of Washington (less than 10 minutes walk) and house was stocked with everything and very clean and comfortable.  Birgin's daughter, who lives upstairs, came and checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed and made us feel welcome.  Definitely recommend Birgin's home!
10427	7459684	10.0	9.0	55104381	The place was just as described.  It was clean and well appointed, and we had everything we needed.  The neighborhood was very convenient to Wallingford and Seattle.  And, we appreciated the snacks!  
10428	7459684	10.0	9.0	55798807	Brigit was responsive and helpful, the rental was comfortable and well equipped. Great location close to the city, shops and food.  Great Value!  
10429	7459684	10.0	9.0	56046709	Clean, comfortable, and warm accommodations for a good price. Few blocks away from great food options. Also a short walk to Gasworks Park.
10430	7459684	10.0	9.0	57203816	"I rented the place for some guests to stay for a week or so.

They had a great experience of a home away from home at Birgit’s place.  They especially loved the spacious premises. The location in Seattle is wonderful with several key places at walking distance. It is ideally located in the Wallingford area for walks by Lake Union, local coffee shops and eateries serving all possible cuisines, the University of Washington and a large shopping complex. 

Birgit is a wonderful host even from a long distance! Kristina who lives on the premises is one of the warmest people we had met. Thanks to her the check-in was very smooth and the stay enjoyable. She took care of everything my guests needed and ensured they had a memorable stay. We have promptly booked it again for other family coming to Seattle.

Thanks Birgit and Kristina. This was the best air bnb my guests had ever experienced."

The room is large and spacious with a separate small study area nd desk.  And the bed is amazing, best sleep I've had in years.  I really hated to have to wake up.  Younghee has plenty of towels and toiletries to share.  Younghee shares common areas of the house.  I wish I'd had more time to just sit and relax in her tranquil sun  room and admire her beautiful assortment of plants.
Younghee herself is an absolutely beautiful person.  We had great conversation in the evening over tea and over coffee in the morning.  I would definitely recommend staying here.  I know I will if I have the opportunity again!"
11043	1715582	10.0	9.0	8108675	We asked April to stay at her house very last minute. She responded very quickly and was very accommodating: she worked hard to take great care of us even though we only needed a place to stay for the night (e.g. Offering us use of her coffee machine and teas, and making us coffee in the morning even!). The house was cozy and warm, and the bed was comfortable! The only minor downside is that Boise travels quite well inside the house- otherwise a very warm and welcoming stay in a very convenient location. Would come again!
11044	1715582	10.0	9.0	8157549	Younghee Lee's home was warm and inviting. It was very clean. The bed was comfortable, and my room had a beautiful view of Seattle. Younghee Lee was a gracious hostess, making sure I was comfortable. I would return to this home again!
11045	1715582	10.0	9.0	8183879	Younghee's home was warm and inviting.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and loved the location of her place!. Thank you, Younghee!
11046	1715582	10.0	9.0	8234163	I was so happy to have Younghee as my host. I could never expect such a great hospitality ever. Just be ready to get much more than what you look into getting. She is down to earth, sincere and welcoming. She made sure I was doing ok. Today I am happy to know I have found myself a great friend in Seattle. The house and the neighborhood is awesome too. I couldn't get enough of it. I already miss it. 
11047	1715582	10.0	9.0	8466640	This was my second stay at Younghee Lee's beautiful home. Once again, I found her to be a most gracious hostess, with a warm, comfortable personality. Younghee Lee provides  a very well-kept home that makes a stay in Seattle feel like home away from home! 
11048	1715582	10.0	9.0	8720516	The hostess is a generous, kind classy lady. She has a very comfortable room for guests that is well furnished and has a handy bathroom right next door. Had some great conversations with her about gardening and traveling, and her husband is a great host as well.
11049	1715582	10.0	9.0	8753608	Younghee went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and welcome in her lovely home   I found Younghee to be delightful company. Her generosity and her concern for my well being was greatly appreciated   The accommodations were immaculate with a long deep bathtub, great for a relaxing soak. There were plenty of warm slippers waiting for guests by the front door of this shoeless home. The bed was supremely comfortabl and the bedroom spacious with lots of daylight.  The hosts were very quiet and considerate not to disturb their guest after we retired. Wallingford is a quiet, safe and interesting neighborhood. I am looking forward to returning to this great Airbnb. 
11050	1715582	10.0	9.0	9279499	My wife and I stayed at Younghee's place for two nights, and we had a very pleasant experience. Younghee is extremely friendly and welcoming, we spent a fair amount of time during our short stay chatting with her about many different things, we also had the pleasure to taste her great cooking and baking. Younghee's place was also very nice, cozy, and extremely clean. Our room was quite spacious, and had a nice view of downtown Seattle. The neighbourhood around the house is also very nice with many restaurants. We would love to stay again at Younghee's place when we visit Seattle again, and we strongly recommend her place to Airbnb travellers.
11051	1715582	10.0	9.0	9295073	"My stay was everything I could have asked for and more! Younghee is an incredibly kind and friendly person. She went out of her way to make me feel welcome, baking me cookies and even giving me a ride to my interview in the morning. Her home is beautiful and spotless. Without a doubt, I would book with Younghee again. I'm lucky to have met her. 

"
11052	1715582	10.0	9.0	15319701	Younghee was the perfect host, we had some trouble with traffic when we arrived and didn't get to the house till really late but she was so lovely about it all and stayed up to let us in and still showed us round. In the morning she was super helpful with finding bus times etc for us to get out and about as well as making us tea and sharing fruits with us from her garden. The house is lovely, and the room is a great size with a really comfy bed and a great view over Seattle from the window. If ever in Seattle again, we would be sure to stay with Younghee again.
11053	1715582	10.0	9.0	15581392	Younghee made me feel quite comfortable, the same as being at my own place. I found a spacious, clear and clean room, with complete privacy. Description of the room and house was absolutely accurate. The house was at a walking distance from the beautiful university of Washington, and 20 minutes by bus to reach downtown. Neighborhood is calm, and close to a supermarket and some bars and restaurants. Younghee was also very helpful in providing cues to explore a number of points in Seattle. She loves a good chatting. It was a great stay!
11054	1715582	10.0	9.0	15817529	Younghee & Peter, were very hospitable.  Peter meet me when I arrived & carried my bag upstairs.  My room was extremely clean and fresh, as was the bathroom. Literature, brochures and bus schedules were nicely laid out on the dresser in my room.  Due to the cool weather, windows could be opened to receive fresh air.  Their garden was beautiful and Younghee shared many of her tips on organic vegetable growing and cooking. Immediately upon my arrival, Younghee showed me where everything was located in the house, offering coffee or tea for mornings.  She also, took time out of her schedule to show and drive me to the Chittenden Locks and drove around the Fremont community showing me all the points of interest.  One morning Younghee took me to a popular park filled with walkers, runners, swimmers and fishermen. At the end of the day when I would arrive back, I was always greeted by  Younghee or Peter, asking what adventures I had that day. On may last evening with them, Younghee prepared a wonderful meal for  the three of us to share.  At the end of my stay, I felt like I had made new friends!
11055	1715582	10.0	9.0	15951199	"Younghee was an incredible host to me and my wife during our stay in Seattle. She and her husband were generous and kind, and their home is so unbelievably charming. It will be safe to say that we now consider her a friend more than a host whose home we once stayed at. 

I hope that future guests appreciate how much she wants to make her guests feel comfortable while they're there and return their respect for her time and home. "
11056	1715582	10.0	9.0	16104556	Younghee was most welcoming and took care of us any minute we were at her gorgeous house. Our stay was too short to take advantage of everything, but we could easily have hung out on the patio for hours. The room is spacious, very clean, and has a stunning view. The neighborhood is charming and calm, but close to great restaurants on 45th street and a short drive to downtown. Highly recommended! 
11057	1715582	10.0	9.0	16294170	"Younghee was a great host and very friendly. She made sure we felt at home, even making breakfast for us a couple mornings. And she was excited to tell us about Seattle and give us insight into places to visit. 
Her home is very beautiful and comfortable, and access to the kitchen was very convenient. It was a great place to stay in a quiet neighborhood that was only a few blocks away from shops and restaurants, and a short drive from downtown. Would love to stay here again."
11058	1715582	10.0	9.0	16481524	The room was very clean and classy and also the bathroom. Yonghee was nice and eager to help with bus schedules and sightseeing, she even made us coffee in the morning and croissants! Downtown is easy to get to by bus and other places worth to visit are within walking distance. 
11059	1715582	10.0	9.0	16668343	"Younghee was an wonderful host. She has heart of gold and charming personality. Her house was beautifully kept and is in a great and convenient location. There are lots of restaurants walking distance and bus stops are nearby her house. Younghee made me a breakfast and her garden she tales care of is amazing. I miss her and our talk, time spend together. Thank you, Younghee! Hope we keep in touch and I get to see you again!

11060	1715582	10.0	9.0	17087616	My week in Seattle turned into a wonderful experience with zero hassles because of Younghee Lee! From day one, she provided information, maps, good advice and a very warm welcome. I really appreciated her morning coffee and company.  Whatever she was cooking on any day was shared and I really need to mention that Younghee's cooking is a work of art! I was in town for a wedding and had a very busy schedule the first 4 days, but this visit was like staying at an old friend's home who was happy to have your company. I slept well, ate well and enjoyed staying in a home that was clean, beautiful and peaceful.
11061	1715582	10.0	9.0	17744075	My  host was very friendly and very helpful.  She provided maps, a hat, an umbrella and wonderful cups of tea.  She gave good advice about things to do in the Seattle area.  The room was clean and attractive.  The neighborhood was nice and was in a central location with easy bus service.   I would highly recommend staying with Younghee.  I would love to go back there again.
11062	1715582	10.0	9.0	18528784	A great experience! Younghee and Peter are beautiful persons, taking great care of their guests, you cna learn a lot from them (in particular, Younghee is a great gardener and cook; she also an experienced mycologist). The room was large, everything is convenient in this beautful house and the garden is superb. The area is quite green and quiet. There are many shops, restaurants and bars just 2 blocks away, with buses stops to downtown. Thank you so much Younghee!
11063	1715582	10.0	9.0	18791903	I had a really nice stay at Younghee's place. I felt a little bit like being at home, even it was only for two nights and two nice breakfasts with freshly brewed coffee and croissants. A perfect stay!
11064	1715582	10.0	9.0	22943554	I stayed here for eight nights and had a very comfortable and easy experience. Younghee is delightful, very friendly and welcoming. She allowed me to use the kitchen and so was able to make my own breakfast and a couple of evening meals. I was able to do my washing and ironing mid week which is a great help when travelling. She is a great cook and she regularly offered me food and (email hidden)e location is ideal for walking to many cafes, bars and shops as well as catching buses to just about anywhere around Seattle. 
11065	1715582	10.0	9.0	23263409	Younghee's house is beautifully restored, extremely comfortable, and well-placed, especially for visits to UW. Wallingford is a really lively neighborhood - great for walking.  We arrived late and Younghee was on hand to help us settle in and get oriented. She was a great source of local information and even loaned me a coat one day! Great visit which we hope to repeat.
12243	6562393	10.0	9.0	37065400	I might be the first guest of this great place. Lucky me! It's in a quite area with short drive distance to almost all Seattle attractions. The house is even more beautiful than the pictures. Jeffrey is a great person willing to provide best hospitality to his guest. He is also provide very detailed instruction for his home. All the facilities are very good. 
12244	6562393	10.0	9.0	37675450	Excellent host, excellent house, excellent neighborhood. Every detail has been thought through. It really is an urban oasis.
12245	6562393	10.0	9.0	39291235	My family and I had a very nice experience at Jeffrey's home in Queen Anne. The house was very nice with a great backyard area. The location was perfect as it is close to downtown Seattle but still has a nice quiet feel to it. 
12246	6562393	10.0	9.0	41081343	Jeffrey's house was beautiful and in great condition.  It had an amazing, tranquil backyard.  Description and pictures of the house were accurate.  Jeffrey was super thoughtful in stocking the home with essentials and niceties for us to use.  He was very responsive to all of our questions.
12247	6562393	10.0	9.0	44390394	Four of us stayed here for three nights and it was fantastic. Jeffrey was very helpful and responsive throughout the entire process. The house is great, with a private backyard area, very comfortable beds and lots of space. The location is also excellent. We had never been to Seattle before, so we had to take a (semi-educated) guess at where in the city we wanted to stay and I'm glad we chose here. The neighborhood is quiet at night, it feels safe, and it's easy to hop on a bus to head anyhwere you want to go. I would stay here again for sure, and I highly recommend it.
12248	6562393	10.0	9.0	44712780	Jeffrey is a great host!  His home is very nice, clean, and comfortable!
13827	5364609	8.0	9.0	26969660	This apartment was amazing! It is a great amount of space with a super friendly host. Though we did not meet him in person, he was very helpful and thoughtful via message and text. It is in a great location, close to freeways and awesome restaurants. Easy to find, super clean and welcoming, has great views! We had a wonderful time! 
13828	5364609	8.0	9.0	28335826	Paul's place is awesome. He sends you every piece of information you could possibly need for enjoying his space and he was very responsive to questions even while he was out of town. Highly recommended!
13829	5364609	8.0	9.0	29562648	What a great stay at Paul's place! The neighborhood is pretty fantastic (grocery store, pretty decent eateries nearby), and Paul was super welcoming. Although he was away, he was easy to get in touch with when I needed to, he checked in as well, and did all he could to make me feel welcome in his space... which is gorgeous. I will totally stay here again if I end up in Seattle again.
13830	5364609	8.0	9.0	33332181	Paul's place was lovely to stay at. The place was cozy and well put together. The full sized kitchen was a joy to cook on, and the location was exceptional! Having a place to park our car was another very welcome perk. All things said and done, I would highly recommend Paul's place to anyone visiting Seattle.
13831	5364609	8.0	9.0	38063450	"My GF and I really enjoyed Paul's place. It is well located as you can walk, bike or take a quick Uber the 1-2 miles to either Belltown, Seattle center or Capital Hill. We ended up walking all of it and wasn't too big of an issue. There was a grocery store and a few good little restaurants within walking distance as well.

Getting into Paul's building & receiving the keys was very easy. He gives you all the information you need for use of his apartment. While we didn't cook, we very easily could have as it was a nice kitchen with anything you would need to prepare food.

Clean & in a great location with a responsive host, I'd definitely recommend Paul's spot for anyone traveling to the Seattle area.  "
13832	5364609	8.0	9.0	42566551	Paul was very accommodating and flexible. We absolutely enjoyed our stay and appreciated his hospitality!
14915	6795678	10.0	9.0	35883165	"My partner and I stayed at this incredible spot just outside of Capitol Hill in Seattle for two nights and were very impressed.  The apartment is quiet and private with a separate entrance and easy street parking.  Inside there is a full living room, kitchen, bathroom, study area, and bedroom - and all are modernly decorated and fun.  The king size bed was more comfortable than my own bed at home, and the bedding was perfect for the climate during our visit.  They had breakfast foods, coffee, juice, tea, etc. for us.  They thought of everything and we had a great experience staying there.  The price was spot-on and I would book this location again in a heartbeat.
Thanks Blair and Kate!"
14916	6795678	10.0	9.0	36600705	Everything about this apartment was wonderful! It is just as clean and cozy as the pictures. It was spacious and comfortable, with lovely decor. The location was perfect for my family and I, and it was very convenient for getting to the places we needed to go! I loved the urban, modern vibe that it offers and it was a perfect location to stay in the city of Seattle! 
14917	6795678	10.0	9.0	37259798	Blair and Katie were amazing hosts.  I visited with our French exchange student and both of us loved having our own little apartment from which to come and go. The apartment is spacious, very clean, and extremely comfortable. Better bed than any hotel (or my own for that matter.)  The little touches meant a lot - like an offer for ground coffee and cream, and a paper on our doorstep in the morning.  Blair & Katie were extremely responsive and went out of their way to help us feel at home.  The location puts you within walking distance of downtown Madrona and just steps away from a 10 minute bus ride to downtown.
14918	6795678	10.0	9.0	37682278	"Blair and his family were extremely welcoming.  They provided us with some eggs from their chickens, a bottle of wine, and some other foodstuffs to get us started.  We were there on the 4th of July, and Blair gave us great advice on where to see fireworks.  Overall, our stay in the apartment was superior!  

The apartment is very roomy, the kitchen is well-equipped, and the location is very convenient for the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Plenty of parking on the street in front of the house, and a nice grocery store just a few blocks away.  We would definitely recommend this location!"
14919	6795678	10.0	9.0	39657424	listing was accurate
14920	6795678	10.0	9.0	39957756	"This is a really lovely apartment! The shower is one of the coolest I've ever been in; the design is unique and the stone-work floor is super comfortable on your feet in the morning.

To enter the place was a piece of cake, and Blair left really clear instructions. There were a few goodies in the fridge for us as well, and the unexpected highlight was opening the door one day to find chickens just roaming around.

The hosts were wonderfully communicative, reaching out throughout our stay to offer help and responding quickly to our requests. They were awesome.

I would definitely recommend staying with Blair. My only note would be that you can hear the people upstairs walking, so if you're a light sleeper, you should take that into account. I'm not sure how much noise we made going in the other direction, but we certainly tried to be cognizant of it after we realized the clarity."
14921	6795678	10.0	9.0	40260329	Great communication with Blair, he was quick to respond and made us feel welcome. The apartment space was clean, bigger than I anticipated, and comfortable. We both loved the funky shower as it had great water pressure! The bed was very comfortable and we both read in the main living area. There's no tv but we didn't want one. Fridge and cupboards had misc items like non-dairy milk (almond I believe?), tea, coffee, basic spices, etc. We weren't in the home much and were enjoying Seattle's food! 
14922	6795678	10.0	9.0	40631918	We had an absolutely fabulous experience staying with Blair and Kate. Their private basement apartment is perfect for anyone looking to stay in Seattle and have your own place. The neighborhood is adorable and their property is fabulous. No complaints at all!
14923	6795678	10.0	9.0	40961509	Great place! I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an affordable, hip, clean place to stay in Seattle.
14924	6795678	10.0	9.0	41641224	"Brand new apartment in Seattle. Very cozy and confortable. Shower and Kitchen are very nice and there is enough space for 4 people. The description is totally accurate.
Highly recommend especially because Blair and Kate  are very nice hosts. They are very helpful and responsive to help at any time. They have a small kid who spent time playing in the back yard with my 2 kids.
Kate even took time to bring my wife and kids to the beach.
Thank you very much."
14925	6795678	10.0	9.0	42276723	This was our first airbnb experience and it was great. We enjoyed the location and felt like were coming home at night. Easy cab ride to city center, downtown, etc., but far enough away to escape the city hustle. 
14926	6795678	10.0	9.0	42732950	We had a great time staying in Blair and Kate's basement apartment. It was just as the pictures show inside, and they had thought of everything when it comes to amenities. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower.......amazing! Of course now I'm home our shower feels like a dripping tap in comparison!! Thanks for a great stay. We really enjoyed meeting your family.
14927	6795678	10.0	9.0	43513647	Everything about this place was as advertised! Blair and Kate were very welcoming and accommodating, the apartment was massive and beautifully furnished/maintained, the location was in a cool neighborhood just outside of downtown, and they actually might have the best shower in the state of Washington. Really enjoyed the stay and would recommend it to anyone heading to Seattle - thanks Blair & Kate! 
14928	6795678	10.0	9.0	43827127	Blair is the man! Super accommodating host in a great neighborhood not too far from downtown. Apartment was super clean and tidy, with plenty of space. They even hooked us up with a bottle of vino and some organic free range eggs for breakfast! To top it off, Blair mailed a some stuff we left behind back to NYC for us. What more can I say! Oh, and washer/drier was clutch for cleanin clothes mid trip. CLUTCH
14929	6795678	10.0	9.0	44156415	"We stayed 2 nights in Blair's basement apartment. It is exactly as pictured in the photos and very clean and comfortable. The refrigerator was stocked full of goodies including fresh eggs from the resident hens (who we happily visited) and everything else one could think of, including a lovely bottle of wine. Unfortunately for us, we had already stopped at the grocery and picked up quite a few snacks and our busy schedule didn't allow for us to take advantage of all the wonderful items left for us. As noted in the profile, Blair left us to our own devices, other than to check on us when we arrived to be sure we had everything we needed and a run-in in the garden where we said our hellos. I had emailed ahead of time asking for restaurant recommendations and Blair came through with terrific ideas. Le Pichet was perfect for my French boyfriend and even the Pink Door, supposedly fully booked, squeezed us in on Saturday night for my birthday dinner, so kudos to Blair! We had a rental car that was easily parked outside the house, but we took the Uber car service everywhere so we didn't have to deal with parking. The house is located on quite a busy thoroughfare, but is very quiet inside. We did notice some street noise in the master bedroom, so we just used the fan in the bedroom closet for ""white noise."" Same with the small amount of footsteps we heard upstairs.  There was no concern there, as we knew ahead of time it was a basement apartment. Everything was top-notch - couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"
14930	6795678	10.0	9.0	45514138	"This is one of the most beautifully kept Airbnbs I've stayed in. It was clean, organized, and VERY well furbished. The huge bed is very comfortable, the desk was wonderful to get some work done, and the living room is a great gathering place. A++ home, I'd live there! 

There was a very small con to staying here. The noise from above. The Airbnb is located underneath the main house, where walking, running or talking is heard VERY clearly through the ceiling. It was quiet at night, and in the early AM, so it was completely bearable. 
"
14931	6795678	10.0	9.0	46160912	We really enjoyed our stay. The place was very clean and it was quiet. I also appreciated that the host left a list of things to do in the area. We would definitely stay there again. 
14932	6795678	10.0	9.0	46915580	The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and an easy $15 Uber ride to downtown.
14933	6795678	10.0	9.0	47376700	I can't say enough about how outstanding our experience was at Blair's. It was our first time booking with Airbnb and it exceeded our expectations immensely. Blair initiated and maintained contact before during and after our 3 day stay. We were greeted by a complimentary bottle of wine along with a detailed list of  useful activities and amenities to make our stay as agreeable as possible. And it was just that. Blair gave us several great recommendations which included a visit to the serene Madrona beach/park area which was a close walk away, as well as the nearby Tallulah's restaurant which had a great modern-fresh menu and stellar craft beer selection. The place has a comfy king-sized bed, washer and dryer which we were able to make use of, towels (beach and bath), full kitchen, and a pretty nice grocery store 3 blocks away where we bought groceries and cooked half of our meals while in Seattle. We took Uber several times from the house and made it downtown in 15 minutes during rush hour. Staying at Blair and Kate's place truly felt like home (the chocolate chip cookies they brought us didn't hurt either) and they  went out of the way to make our stay in Seattle one of the best we've had travelling.    
14934	6795678	10.0	9.0	47718848	Well appointed and comfortable apartment. Cleverly designed and soacious. Did not feel like a liwer level apartment. Quiet for an urban neighborhood. 
14935	6795678	10.0	9.0	48904775	"Overall a great experience! The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed, close to some nice breakfast/brunch places, and about 25 min bus ride to downtown.

Blair was very responsive, always available to help and provide sight seeing suggestions since it was our first time in Seattle."
14936	6795678	10.0	9.0	49558543	"The days in Blairs house are so comfy just like at home ! Even though I think myself is good at home design , I have to say I learned a lot from them. Blair's home design of color and function are very good taste and smart!  And they are very very very very nice people! The only regret of our trip is we have no chance to spend more time with them. Something urgent happened to us, we have to do 1 day earlier check out, that's all ourselves reason, I didn't expect them to refund the money, what they really don't need to do . But they refund the money to us! Thanks is not enough for me to express my appreciation. 
Next time I went to Seattle , Blair's place is definitely my first choice!"
14937	6795678	10.0	9.0	49934145	"Blair was great to deal with from the first communication. I was in town for my son's birthday and Blair gave me suggestions on where to go and what events were going to be in town when I was in Seattle. 
It was easy to find his home and the unit was as described, very clean, big king size bed and a great shower.
The location was walking distance to Seattle University and the surrounding area. 
I would highly recommend staying at this unit if you are visiting Seattle."
14938	6795678	10.0	9.0	50810798	Blair's place was awesome! The shower was very funny. Had a good laugh when we arrived. The place was completely spotless when we arrived. Bed was super comfortable. Thanks for the great experience :) 
14939	6795678	10.0	9.0	51372130	"One of the best AirBnB stays so far. Blair made us feel very welcome. We loved that there was a keyless entry, and the apartment was fantastic. Waking up the next day, we were greeted by Blair and two croissants. Our weekend was pretty packed with activities, but Blair offered to give us tips and suggestions on what to do if we needed them.

I would highly recommend this AirBnB and would most definitely stay there again when I'm in Seattle."
14940	6795678	10.0	9.0	52097283	"Thank you the place is lovely.  Blair gave great directions for 2 country seniors from a small coast town the big city is pretty scary.
the apt. is great very clean, well stocked if you were to cook, very comfortable king bed, and cool shower. The whole place very well done. We enjoyed our week end with our granddaughter at Seattle U. Would recommend this place to anyone coming to Seattle. Nice area close to down town."
15568	6133354	10.0	9.0	31744804	New lovely listing place. Great location.
15569	6133354	10.0	9.0	33283660	This was my first experience using airbnb and Kim has certainly set a very high standard! The accommodations were beautiful, the personal touches made the space feel warm and inviting.  The neighborhood was just a short drive to downtown and there were so many restaurants with in walking distance. Had we stayed anywhere else I'm not sure our trip would have been as wonderful and relaxing as it was. 
15570	6133354	10.0	9.0	34742074	Kim's home is very inviting and comfortable. When entering the foyer, a welcome greeting was seen on a small chalkboard at the entrance to my room. The appointments were perfect, the cold beverages were great and there was a variety of nibbles. I slept like a baby in the comfortable bed. Kim is an open caring person. I wish I could have stayed longer and spent more time with her on the upper level patio. Her studio was private and very affordable. I look forward to staying with her again in Seattle when traveling with my daughter. 
15571	6133354	10.0	9.0	35356264	This accommodation was beautiful, comfortable, and in a great location. This host thought of virtually everything a guest might need, from shampoo to guidebooks two snacks. The environment was immaculate, sophisticated and comfortable. I give this accommodation 15 stars out of 10!! If I return to Seattle, I will definitely check into booking this accommodation again.
15572	6133354	10.0	9.0	35480196	"Kim's studio is indeed awesome.  We have never before been in such a luxurious and sophisticated space:  much like the picture but more amazing.  Kim was very flexible with a sudden change in our plans which was appreciated.  When we arrived we found a well stocked feast of foods, snacks, toiletries and other amenities.  The towels were plush.  The Murphy bed (our first) was extremely comfortable. The backyard deck was also fabulous.  We had no trouble parking in the neighborhood which was quiet, residential and safe.  

We were unable to stay long at Kim's studio due to scheduling.  If we had stayed longer, we weren't sure whether the lack of windows would have become a problem.  
"
15573	6133354	10.0	9.0	36023970	Great little place in a very nice location - easy access from airport on public transportation, close to great little restaurants, grocery store, farmer's market, Washington Park, Japanese Garden, very quiet street and neighborhood, within walking distance of downtown.  The place is exactly as described and very clean, well appointed, stocked with snacks and beverages and toiletries.  Kim provided very detailed instructions and information about the neighborhood.  Great stay, it's about as 5star as you can get on Airbnb.
15574	6133354	10.0	9.0	36430324	We enjoyed our stay so much we decided to extend our time in Seattle one more night. Kim was very accommodating to this request. The studio itself is decorated so nicely and it feels very comfortable. The bed was great too! At first I was a little nervous about the location because it didn't seem near much when we were driving in, but it was great!!! We walked ALOT and whether it was down to Madison park or pikes market we were totally able to make it. UBERS were used when we didn't want to walk and it was a very cheap ride. I would highly recommend this location to anyone. 
15575	6133354	10.0	9.0	37158137	The host was welcoming and friendly. 
15576	6133354	10.0	9.0	38389563	"
Kim's studio in the heart of Seattle's Madison Park neighborhood was perfect for us as it was very convenient to our daughter's house and to several bakeries and restaurants nearby.  Kim has thought of everything you will need from snacks and breakfast items in the fridge to a first aid kit and a pair of scissors.  She provides many items we did not see in our other Airbnb locations such as a selection of hair products and bath gels. The fish pond and outdoor seating area are just perfect in the summer in Seattle.  This location is comfortable and well stocked with many, many thoughtful touches! "
15577	6133354	10.0	9.0	38711683	Loved staying at Kim's studio! Very lush, livable digs! The bed slept great! And the koi pond and patio were amazing! Given that I was ill when we visited, I was so grateful for having such a nice place to stay! Kim went over and above to help us! Fantastic place, fantastic host!
15578	6133354	10.0	9.0	39396632	Kim was a gracious host who made us feel welcome when we arrived with a nice bottle of wine and a few snacks to tide us over until we went out for dinner and music. The property is well maintained and is situated in a quiet location with ample parking. 
15579	6133354	10.0	9.0	39703442	The apt was as pictured. Bed and bath was comfortable. Kim is a wonderful person and makes you very welcome. 
15580	6133354	10.0	9.0	40094992	Kim provided a lovely studio,  fully equipped with everything we needed for our stay in Seattle. This was my first airbnb experience and she exceed my expectations.  The neighbourhood was nice,  with several restaurants within a short walk.  It was a short drive to downtown,  which was perfect. 
15581	6133354	10.0	9.0	40751026	Kim greeted me upon my arrival, gave me a tour of the property - the apartment and the garden area. It was a very comfortable property and easy to access different parts of Seattle. The property doesn't have many windows, so it was warm while I was there (the entire region was baking) and the fans ran the entire time. Kim offered snacks, coffee, and a bottle of wine as the hostess, all greatly appreciated. 
15582	6133354	10.0	9.0	42861973	"Kim was a wonderful host, and made us feel very welcome. We didn't feel we were staying in someone's home - we felt we were in our own place. The studio was beautifully decorated and full of snacks, drinks, and everything to make our stay enjoyable. The outdoor lounge area and koi pond were an oasis for relaxing and reading.

There was lots of information about what to see and do, plus recommendations for local restaurants.

The location is very convenient to both auto and bus travel, and there are a number of local shops and restaurants within easy walking distance.

If you've never been to Seattle, prepare yourself for a hilly experience."
15583	6133354	10.0	9.0	43321168	"Kim was super easy to communicate with and her place was easy to find.    The place was very clean and she had done a great job of providing instructions for everything in the place.  

It doesn't have windows but plenty of light comes in when you leave the french doors open which was fine for me since I was out and about for most of my stay.

Would definitely stay here again."
15584	6133354	10.0	9.0	44306470	Our host Kim was so nice and thoughtful.  We had a baby with us and she had all these toys and a pack and play set up to make our baby feel right at home.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet, but just a few blocks down there are restaurants and coffee shops.  We drove a car because of baby, and there was plenty of free street parking.   Her place was lovely and and you can tell she really thought of all the little things one would need.  My husband forgot his charger so she found us one.  Just a really lovely lady and really beautiful studio.  
15585	6133354	10.0	9.0	44980098	The place was great and had everything we could need for a great vacation in Seattle.  Kim went above and beyond to make our son feel comfortable- providing a crib and toys for him during his stay!  
15586	6133354	10.0	9.0	45275189	Everything was perfect. Kim was awesome. She had great suggestions of places to go and eat in Seattle as well as in the neighborhood. The studio was perfect for me and my girlfriend.The bed and furniture were very comfy. Kim left the studio  supplied with snacks, drinks, and even a complimentary bottle of wine which was awesome. We give this studio and Kim an A+++.
15587	6133354	10.0	9.0	46994686	"Kim did a fantastic job in welcoming me to her studio. Upon arrival there was a ""Welcome Ron"" at the front of the door. I thought this was a nice warm touch. Beautiful studio and I would love to rent from Kim again. 5/5!!!"
15588	6133354	10.0	9.0	47593648	"Kim was a lovely host.  She was easy to coordinate with and clearly has a passion for hosting.

The one downside was that the apartment didn't have any windows, which made it stuffy.  I wish the lack of windows had been in the post about the place."
15589	6133354	10.0	9.0	47807114	"We had a terrific stay at the studio. Kim made everything very easy and the space was just as advertised, clean and comfortable. We appreciated the many thoughtful details, like the yummy snacks and drinks. The studio is centrally located and parking was super easy, right in front of the house. 

We would happily stay at the studio on our next trip to Seattle! "
15590	6133354	10.0	9.0	48933257	"Kim was very welcoming and accommodating! The studio had everything we needed and then some. It was clean, quiet, and just what we needed after a day of walking up and down the hills of Seattle. The location was just a short walk or Uber from the places we wanted to explore. 

Kim was very responsive during our entire stay. We had a small issue the second day, shot her a text, and she took care of it right away. Everything was so comfortable we extended our stay one night!"
15591	6133354	10.0	9.0	51493496	Kim's house is so cozy，making you feel like being at your own home. It is really a wonderful experience. 
15592	6133354	10.0	9.0	52992433	"My experience was excellent! I thought everything was great; the location, the ease, the friendliness, the hospitality.
I will definitely be back."
15593	6133354	10.0	9.0	56929063	Kim was an amazing host! She was super accommodating and very responsive to text messages whenever I needed something. As a longer term guest, I was able to do laundry in her main home, which was so convenient. The space is also well decorated and cozy, and the Keurig was an added plus for sure.
15732	1029680	9.0	9.0	14315731	What a lovely home - perfect for our group!
15733	1029680	9.0	9.0	17118111	We had a great experience at Kristin's home. The house was very nice and suited our needs. The neighborhood was a bit quieter and cozier than we expected so we felt we had to be quieter than usual hanging out outside, but the stay was still a great one. Would recommend this home! 
15734	1029680	9.0	9.0	28293697	Thank you for the wonderful, relaxing, and productive stay at the bungalow.  My student pals and I were finishing up some last minute papers, and this space was exactly the escape what we needed to get focused and relax. Everything was as pictured and described.  Communication was a breeze.  
15735	1029680	9.0	9.0	34983844	Really enjoyed our stay in Madrone. The home was as advertised. It was convenient and had all the amenities. Would enjoy staying there for a longer time.
15736	1029680	9.0	9.0	35610731	Great place to stay!
15737	1029680	9.0	9.0	38013731	The house is beautiful and exactly as advertised, if not better. We had 6 people for a weekend and it was the perfect size. Would not hesitate to stay here again. 
15958	8253955	10.0	9.0	49696500	Colleen and her husband were exceptionally hospitable. We had a great time staying at this historic yet beautifully decorated home. it's located nearby the UW campus and is 2 min from the I5 exit so its location was very convenient as well. We would highly recommend anyone to stay there and would have no reservations about going back! 
15959	8253955	10.0	9.0	51326293	Colleen made our stay super easy! Great communication before our trip and helpful during. The space was very clean and perfect for what we were looking for. This house is an easy walk to the University of Washington campus. 
15960	8253955	10.0	9.0	57120489	Colleen was super easy to work out arrival and departure details with and arrangements worked very smoothly.  Her basement apartment has it's own entry and the neighborhood was very quiet and perfectly located for anything in the University district. We very comfortably slept 6 adults and one baby in our own pack and play. The newly remodeled kitchen is beautiful and has everything you need to cook any type of meal.  The bathroom is very roomy and also newly remodeled.  We had no problem with on street parking.
16518	6913414	9.0	9.0	47981726	Jenna was very responsive to all my questions and my family really loved how cute a cottage it was for our stay. The neighborhood was very walkable (several options for groceries/coffee available within 10 minutes), and we had no problems with parking at all during the entire stay. We'd definitely consider staying again the next time we visit! :)
16519	6913414	9.0	9.0	48883475	Fast and accurate communication from the start. Very responsive and even gave a great coffee gift certificate due to some construction (no problem since we ubered everywhere). Safe and clean neighborhood. House was very clean and a pleasure to stay in. Highly highly recommend.
16520	6913414	9.0	9.0	49666432	Beautiful well designed home to stay with my husband and our two young children. We loved the well thought-out layout of this little cottage. My husband is a contractor and was impressed by the details and work that was done there. The unit was really clean and well-stocked with all the needs for cooking and cleaning for our family. The location was great with a small market near-by and coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. We also used the public metro system with ease. We would definitely stay in this unit again and recommend it to others. 
16521	6913414	9.0	9.0	51838601	Very nice cottage in a nice neighborhood in Seattle. The place is small, but super charming and well decorated. Downside is both rooms are separated by a sliding door so you don't have a lot of privacy.
16522	6913414	9.0	9.0	52124163	"We had a great experience staying at the property. It was clean well designed and felt like home. The beds and furniture were very comfortable. The kitchen was beautiful. The neighborhood was safe, close to a grocery store, coffee shop and easy to get to the highway. 
We will be using the space again. Our host Jenna responded immediately when we had questions prior to our stay."
16523	6913414	9.0	9.0	52762506	The Cottage was absolutely delightful! It was better than the photos. The construction, the flooring, bedding, the fixtures - top of the line and it was super clean. Jenna was easy to contact and very responsive. And great care was made to make the space cozy and inviting through small details . I would highly recommend this place!!
16524	6913414	9.0	9.0	54782501	What a delightful, cozy cottage. Thoughtfully designed and well appointed, the photos accurately show you what to expect. It's located in a terrific neighborhood near the University with a great local coffee shop at the end of the block. I hope we have the opportunity to stay at the cottage again in the near future.
16525	6913414	9.0	9.0	54946785	We had such a delightful time in this charming and beautiful little cottage a stone's throw from the U District, UW campus and bus lines to downtown. The interior design was so well thought through and executed, especially the radiant floor heating.  We felt like were staying in a Pottery Barn catalog.  We were blown away!
16526	6913414	9.0	9.0	55362229	"
Jenna, thanks for letting us use your place. It was perfect for us.  It was so nicely decorated, clean and solid; and so it was great to come home to.  

We loved the privacy and quiet.

Thanks"
16527	6913414	9.0	9.0	57174795	"I loved this beautiful cottage.  Jenna did a wonderful job with the decor and design (industrial meets cottage).
The unit was clean and had everything that we needed to cook and make us feel at home.
The best part was the location.  It's literally in one of the best neighborhoods in UDistrict.  It's close to UW, Cohen Park, Buses, Ravenna and I5."
16559	4270642	9.0	9.0	21494235	"I stayed in this studio for 3 nights.  The description is accurate.  It is really close to UW's campus, and there are a lot of food options around.  It is also easy to go to downtown Seattle, as there are many bus stops nearby.  To/From the airport it takes about an hour.

Here are the things I liked about it:
- good water pressure
- instant hot water in the shower/sink
- clean when I arrived
- location (campus, food places)
- fast WiFi
- good instructions and communication from/with the host
- host checked in with me before I left

The only negative things:
- noise travels very well in the building (although most of the time it was quiet)
- as it is mentioned in the description, there is a shared door with the adjacent studio: there is a large gap in between the door and the floor, so you'll hear conversations/music... anything that is going on, so also be aware of your own private conversations etc.
- I found the mat in the bathroom not very inviting, use a towel instead

All in all I had a good impression of the place.  Melissa is very responsive and communicating with her is very easy.  This combination of location, quality of the place and price is hard to find!"
16560	4270642	9.0	9.0	23066767	The host was nice, and the room was as described (and pictured).  The location was fantastic, just 2 blocks from the UW campus, and right in the middle of a lot of restaurants and things to do.  The perfect place if you are visiting the university, like I was doing.  It is a very simple room, but I didn't need much, so it was great.  Very clean.  2 downsides, though.  The first problem was that the room is connected to the adjacent room by a door, and has a opening of about 1/2 in below it.  That means that sounds travel very easily between the 2 rooms, which can be annoying for you and your neighbor.  The second problem is that this is a first floor room with some traffic on the street - your window opens right to the people walking by, so if you like privacy, you will have to keep the windows always shut, which is unfortunate.
16561	4270642	9.0	9.0	26222158	This place is very close to UW which was very important to me. It was clean and comfy and had everything I needed for my stay. Getting in was a breeze since Melissa had already prepared everything. The one downside to the place is that the doors (one to the hallway and one that goes to an adjacent studio) do not isolate noise properly. That wasn't a big concern for me though.
16562	4270642	9.0	9.0	27890821	I ended up changing rooms upon arrival, so I cannot review this specific room.  However, I can still review the building and host.  The host is very polite, nice, attentive to guests, and is open to feedback - she took a couple of suggestion that me and another guest made to improve the room, regarding sound and privacy.  Another good example is that other people had asked if they could stay in adjacent rooms, which in this case included the room I had reserved.  So before I even arrived, she asked if it would be ok to move me to a bigger, nicer room for no extra charge, which of course I accepted (and the room was indeed great).  The rooms are simple, but spacious and comfortable.  The location of the building is excellent if you have any business in the university, and there are tons of great restaurants around.  This is the second time I stay at this place and it's really good, I highly recommend the place and the host.
16563	4270642	9.0	9.0	28564274	Melissa was an excellent host. I would have no reservations staying with her again. I visited UW while staying there and found it to be about a 15 minute walk from the Quad, quite convenient. Also right around the corner from stops for multiple bus lines which were incredibly useful! I'd recommend buying an ORCA card to make it simple to get on and off buses. 
16564	4270642	9.0	9.0	28925242	"I stayed in Melissa's studio for one week while attending a conference in March. Melissa was very easy to reach by text message if I needed anything throughout my stay. The studio was very clean, and located in an incredibly convenient part of town. There were a lot of good restaurants within walking distance. Heating system works well when I need it.

The only negatives were that no plug for the bus tub, and not much kitchen tool. 

Overall, I would stay here again due to the convenience and location."
16565	4270642	9.0	9.0	30937928	A great experience overall.  The location of the apartment couldn't be better and the apartment itself was cozy, clean, and quiet.  For one person this unit is a great deal.
16566	4270642	9.0	9.0	31935483	The host was very efficient and we didn't have to meet to arrange a check-in. While that can be a bad thing for some travellers, I knew that I was not staying at someone's private house so no problem. The neighborhood is a very lively student area.
16567	4270642	9.0	9.0	32213997	Pretty much just what you want from an Airbnb rental, especially if you have appointments in the U-District and are traveling by yourself. The highlights of this unit are the bathroom and kitchenette. I had lots of privacy and the building's other tenants were perfectly quiet during my stay.
16568	4270642	9.0	9.0	33178549	"I had a very positive experience renting Melissa's studio. The apartment was clean and located conveniently to a number of buses. I was generally only there to sleep and shower, and it worked well for those purposes. 

I generally had an easy time accessing the apartment and Melissa was easy to reach when I first checked in. Hot water worked and everything was generally very comfortable. As others mentioned, the apartment is street-level but I didn't have any issues with noise or anything.

Fair price compared to the cost of a local hotel and convenient. Would definitely recommend."
16569	4270642	9.0	9.0	48124841	Melissa and her husband were very friendly, respectful, polite and welcoming. The neighbourhood was safe, quite, clean and at a walking distance from the University of Washington and the University Way where we found several good restaurants, a health clinic, banks, and a dollar store. Besides,  on Brooklyn Avenue, we found two gas stations and a Safeway Supermarket. We couldn't ask for more. It was perfect for us. 
16570	4270642	9.0	9.0	51745699	It was fine and functional.  Good for short term stay.
18891	4565370	10.0	9.0	23412849	Rachel and Jon were extremely friendly and welcomed us into their home when we arrived. They also invited us to take part in their Thanksgiving dinner! Their home is beautiful and the room I stayed in was very comfortable. Brigitte, their cat, made sure we felt at home during our stay. Their place is in a quiet neighbourhood and convenient for accessing other parts of Seattle.
18892	4565370	10.0	9.0	23611581	Jon and Rachel are very outgoing and friendly; they put me at ease and I felt at home immediately.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable with a warm comforter that kept me cozy during a couple of cold winter nights.  It is a unique house just as they described it with interesting interior touches.  You will feel right at home here.
18893	4565370	10.0	9.0	23927928	Excellent stay with Rachel and Jon. Their home is great, wonderfully located, and very comfortable and tastefully decorated. They even offered to share dinner with us! Our only regret was having to leave on an early flight the next morning!
18894	4565370	10.0	9.0	25275217	We felt super comfortable at Rachel and Jon's place. Rachel was very welcoming and flexible with our schedule - she let us check in early and check out later. Their home is lovely and in a decent location near Capitol Hill, but a bit of a walk to downtown. They are superb hosts and did a great job of making sure we felt welcome. 
18895	4565370	10.0	9.0	25488345	Jon and Rachel have a lovely home. The stay was perfect - comfortable and convenient. And they were very flexible hosts. 
18896	4565370	10.0	9.0	26276679	Rachel and Jon were very kind and accommodating. It was easy setting up an arrival and they even wrote us a great selection of breakfast spots for the morning of our departure. The house and our room are BEAUTIFUL! Love all the decor in this character home. Our bed was super comfortable and their cat was a gem. The neighbourhood was central to everywhere we needed to go. Highly recommended and we will definitely look to stay here again! 
18897	4565370	10.0	9.0	26380201	I could have great time at this place. The whole house (room, washroom, kitchen etc) is so clean. And it's nice location. Also the hosts (Rachel and Jon) are so friendly.
18898	4565370	10.0	9.0	26715184	Rachel and John were very nice and welcoming hosts. The house is charming and in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown. I would definitely stay again with them.
18899	4565370	10.0	9.0	27109734	We had a fantastic stay at Rachel & Jon's lovely home. We had a warm welcome from Rachel & their beautiful cat Briggie, which was a nice surprise. Our room was great, comfy bed, lots of space, liked the decor. Everything about our stay was perfect, felt at home there. Was easy getting the bus into town, also found a great local cafe, Cheeky cafe for the best breakfast & you are very close to some nice Chinese & Vietnamese food! We enjoyed our chats with Rachel too. Thank you for making our last stay in an AirBnB for a while so wonderful! We will miss all the lovely people we have met in our last year of traveling.
18900	4565370	10.0	9.0	28085350	Better than photos. Rachel and John's home has a lovely aesthetic with sleek, wordly and vintage appeal. Tidy and uncluttered. This place could be in a magazine. Bedroom has high ceilings and an incredibly comfortable bed and blankets. Beautiful kitchen. Bathroom is lovely, too. Hosts were highly flexible. Brigitte (cat) likes to snuggle. Neighborhood is an Uber or bus ride from downtown and lively spots like Capitol Hill. We used the bus routes heavily and walked only a few blocks to a well-connected bus. Highly recommended. 
18901	4565370	10.0	9.0	28797931	Had a fantastic time in The Reading Room.  We were in town for a conference, and as such were quite busy, but have nothing but good things to say about our hosts and their lovely home.  They were very welcoming, gave great advice, and welcomed us above and beyond.  And they have excellent taste in furniture, and an even more wonderful cat.  Highly recommended.
18902	4565370	10.0	9.0	29945910	These guys are just amazing. They are both so chilled out and happy to help with anything possible. Location is superb. A 2 min walk will have you on a bus heading into downtown Seattle. Or if you fancy walking it, which will take you 30 mins or so. I'd recommend these guys to everyone. 
18903	4565370	10.0	9.0	30827908	"Rachel and Jon are just the sweetest! Thank you both for the lovely room, and your generosity. Your home is very close to everything ""Seattle;"" I definitely recommend! I felt comfortable and safe, and will absolutely check for an available room with you next time I come that way!"
18904	4565370	10.0	9.0	30905041	It was a very short but sweet stay in this beautiful house. Rachel was very friendly and accommodating (we never met Jon). Lovely bedrooms and an excellent location; we had no problems finding parking near the house. The cat was also very friendly too!
18905	4565370	10.0	9.0	32488777	The host canceled this reservation 66 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18906	4565370	10.0	9.0	33580096	Both Rachel and Jon are very welcoming and accommodating throughout my stay. The house is bright and airy, and is a wonderful place to stay. It's a short bus/taxi ride into the main Seattle city center, and is within walking distance to cafes and grocers. It is a fantastic place for your Seattle visit, to get away from the noise of the city and experience the neighbourhoods. I highly recommend staying here!
18907	4565370	10.0	9.0	34459782	"Rachel & Jon were very warm and welcoming, as was their home --  an older frame structure, decorated with an austere elegance: Uncluttered, very clean, but cozy and woody and organic. The Reading Room has a bed, night stand and a chair, as well as a few shelves of books, ranging from French texts to Thomas Pynchon novels. The bed was quite comfortable, though I had to tread carefully down the wooden steps when I had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. 
The neighborhood is centrally located in Seattle, fifteen minutes' drive from most key places in town. There's a very nice coffee shop a block and a half away.  "
18908	4565370	10.0	9.0	35085497	Rachel and John are generous and friendly hosts eager to share their home (and a variety of delicious snacks). If you want great company and host interaction, their place is the place for you. They keep their home tidy and have great suggestions for area activities and locations.  Brigitte the cat has tons of charisma and really, really wants your attention. A cool spot!
18909	4565370	10.0	9.0	36665542	Jon and Rachel have a lovely home in a neighbourhood that is in close proximity to downtown Seattle. Although we had a rental car we chose to walk to the downtown area on our first full day. The walk was pleasant and took about 25 minutes. The house has high ceilings and large windows and is very tastefully decorated in a minimalist style that allows one to enjoy the space. Jon and Rachel were very friendly and welcoming. They graciously provided complementary tea bags, coffee, fruit and a few other treats. We enjoyed chatting with them at the breakfast table and felt welcome to share their kitchen and dining area with them. Everything was as described. The weekend of our stay Seattle was experiencing a heat wave. The room was warm for sleeping but Jon and Rachel did their best to provide ventilation by setting up fans, etc. A great place to stay when visiting Seattle!
18910	4565370	10.0	9.0	41200942	It was a perfect stay in Seattle. Our hosts helped us a lot to find restaurants and shops. Without  Rachel and John it wouldn't have been that amazing
18911	4565370	10.0	9.0	41330503	We loved our time at Rachel and Jons house! It was a lovely space, the room was great and a good size. The rest of the house was beautiful and relaxing. The bathroom was clean. All together a great place to stay!!
18912	4565370	10.0	9.0	43032403	Rachel and Jon were very welcoming during my long stay. The house was clean, and occasional fresh fruits (sometimes from their garden) were provided! The neighborhood is very safe and it only takes about 15-20 minute walk to get to the lively Capitol Hill. The only minor problem about the house was that there is only 1 bathroom, so sometimes it can be a little bit inconvenient...Overall, I think I fell in love with Seattle partly because of this nice airbnb experience! It made me feel right at home! 
18913	4565370	10.0	9.0	46135290	We had a delightful overnight stay in this lovely home. We felt very welcome, not just in our room but throughout the house. Rachel provided great and interesting company that kept us up chatting later than we intended! We would highly recommend this home to anyone. 
18914	4565370	10.0	9.0	46495997	We enjoyed staying with Rachel and John during our time in Seattle. The house was lovely, decorated with beautiful art throughout and the room was very comfortable. We were out and about during the majority of our time there however they answered any questions and provided everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Their cat Brigitte is the sweetest! She welcomed us at the door when we arrived. The location was a great! Just under 10 minutes and about 6 bucks for an Uber to Pike Place Market and many attractions downtown. We would definitely stay there again if in Seattle!
18915	4565370	10.0	9.0	46882869	"We had an amazing time at John and Rachel's place! Rachel did everything she could in order for us to enjoy our stay and make the most of the short time we spent in Seattle. The room was very comfy and was basically exactly what we've been looking for. We left with a very posotive impression of the city and the neighborhood and we will definitely come stay here again when in Seattle.
"
18916	4565370	10.0	9.0	48698424	"Staying with Rachel and Jon was great! The house is beautiful, clean and in true Seattle style. There were plenty of clean towels, and they provided an easy way to get in and out. They even let us check-in early so that we could store our bags and get headed out on the town! (They also have an adorable cat!)

It’s in a great part of town, too! Walking distance to the University, and all of the bars/restaurants in Capitol Hill. Not too far from other tourist attractions like the Space Needle, EMP Museum, etc. either. Though, a nice quiet place to rest at night. All in all: Great trip!

Our only bummer was not having more time in Seattle so that we could hangout with Rachel & Jon a bit. 

We would definitely suggest staying at the Farmhouse to anyone looking to be in the city — no better location or room!"
18917	4565370	10.0	9.0	52134859	Staying with Rachel and Jon was phenomenal. The location was great for where we needed to be in Seattle. They have a very clean, open and inviting space, and the room we stayed in worked out great. They were very hospitable and made our stay special. I would highly recommend their space to others!
18918	4565370	10.0	9.0	52837254	"Rachel and Jon were the perfect hosts during our short stay in Seattle!  
All the welcoming hand-written notes, plus the gorgeous plants in every room and the added bonus that they are both such lovely people really sealed the deal; we will definitely look to stay with Rachel and Jon again on our next visit to Seattle! A++!"
18919	4565370	10.0	9.0	54414251	We loved staying with Rachel and Jon. Their home is beautiful and they were really good hosts and good people to chat too. We'd love to stay with them again if we get back to Seattle v
18920	4565370	10.0	9.0	54801050	Had a fantastic stay with Rachel and Jon. They are both lovely people and I really enjoyed meeting them. Their cat, Brigitte, was super sweet - definitely a special kitty. I loved my accommodations - the house was super cool and I had everything I needed. Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!
18921	4565370	10.0	9.0	55966290	Had a fabulous stay with Rachel and Jon. Though visiting just for one night, we felt instantly welcomed in their space- an absolutely stunning home with so many thoughtful details. We had the pleasure of enjoying coffee and breakfast with Rachel and Jon on the morning of our departure and just couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Lovely home and even lovelier hosts! 
21353	1171574	10.0	9.0	5027514	It was my first airbnb experience and I happen to be the first guest at Phil and Andrea's. The house is lovely and neighborhood friendly. Phil is very helpful and warm-hearted and keen to offer every help I needed.  I only met Andrea once but he is also very friendly. It was a wonderful experience.
21354	1171574	10.0	9.0	5303098	 Don't expect a luxury place, if you want this you must be willing to pay too much more. The room is very good for the price. The location is very good because you have public transportation around the corner: 3 bus lines that take you to the main attractions in Seattle, which is important since it is difficult and expensive to rent and park in the city. A plus was the privacy of the room, with its own entrance Also we liked  checking in and out flexibility. The best part is the hosts: very friendly and always ready to help and give good advice.. It was a pleasure to meet and talk with Phil and Andrea.
21355	1171574	10.0	9.0	5463991	Phil was very welcoming and friendly.  The space is clean, quiet and peaceful.  It's close to everything and I'll definitely come again when I'm in Seattle.  Recommended!
21356	1171574	10.0	9.0	5535107	We stayed at Phil's basement for 2 nights. It was overall a good experience. They were really friendly and nice host, even leaving us cakes and pastries. The location is ok, connected to downtown Seattle by bus which takes about 20mins. The room is nice and comfy. 
21357	1171574	10.0	9.0	5735571	That's why we travel via airbnb: In Phil and Andrea we found new friends in one of the most beautiful cities of the world and their house was nothing less than a home far away from home. That location and the hospitality of these hosts are really hard to beat. They also provided us with a wide selection of toiletries in the bathroom and free breakfast-coffee! And if you want to drink a perfect italian espresso or cappucchino, visit Andrea's Caffé Torino. It's the best. We will definitely come back!!!
21358	1171574	10.0	9.0	5997433	"Simply put, Phil and Andrea were the perfect hosts. It was extremely easy to book with Phil, and he was generous enough to accommodate some unusual requests since I was staying at his place during a big move. As other reviewers have noted, the little details like the pastries and the coffe/tea that Phil and Andrea attend to really make the place feel like home.

Just a few notes on the area: Madrona is not the most busy neighborhood in Seattle, but it was a nice and quiet place to relax after a long day of touring. I didn't get a chance to try the public transportation, but it was very convenient to drive to and from and park in the neighborhood in case you have a car. Some convenient and tasty places restaurants in Madrona to try are Naam Thai, Ezell's (deliciously fried) Chicken, the Catfish Corner, and Assimba (though any of the Ehtiopian restaurants on Cherry and MLK are probably awesome).

A few last tips: it can get a little chilly but there is a heater in the space (that I never had to use). Make sure you push the key towards the door a little bit when trying to lock/unlock the back door (also, turn away from the door to lock and towards to unlock).  The little corner with all the food and utensils on it works great as a desk if you need one. Nora's wood (right next door on the corner of 29th and E Columbia) is worth a peek. Molly Moon ice cream is delicious (get the salted caramel and the scout mint). Enjoy your time in Seattle in an awesome place!"
21359	1171574	10.0	9.0	6025517	The room was everything we needed and more. Though I did not get a chance to meet Phil face-to-face, he was still an absolutely fantastic host. From the travel brochures in our room to the pastries on our arrival, everything was great! I would definitely stay here again. Close to so many things, walking or by car, and a wonderful neighborhood to boot! Thanks again for hosting us, Phil!
21360	1171574	10.0	9.0	6447404	We never got to meet Phil, but we almost feel like we did. He was very accommodating from the beginning and almost immediately send us all the info we needed and contact info even though he wouldn't be in town. The room fit the purpose and it was nice having our own bathroom. The garden is wonderful and the next door park is cute. The neighborhood is nice and if you don't mind the hills you can walk almost anywhere. Would stay there again, and maybe meet face to face with our friendly hosts.. 
21361	1171574	10.0	9.0	6565827	Phil and Andrea were friendly and gracious hosts and the room was comfortable. I would stay again when my travels being me back to Seattle. 
21362	1171574	10.0	9.0	6734163	I enjoyed staying at Phil and Andrea's place. I met only Phil and he was very friendly and accommodating. The room was just as described with warm wood finishes and claw foot tub in bathroom. The place is close to buses that take only 20-30 minutes to get downtown or to connect with rail lines. I enjoyed sitting on the  wood deck at the rear of the house where there is a lot of foliage after a day of being downtown. I also liked exploring the local residential neighborhood which I would not have experienced had I stayed downtown.
21363	1171574	10.0	9.0	6819073	Phil's spot was perfect. The accommodations were exactly as described with no surprises. This is a comfortable, simple, clean basement room. We never actually met Phil but he was still a great host and even left some delicious pastries from the cafe that his partner owns. Thank you for a great first Airbnb experience!
21364	1171574	10.0	9.0	6918355	"Beautiful place! 
Phil and Andrea were very welcoming, we even got some bake goodies from Andrea's cafe when we first arrived to their place.
It was great having a little fridge, a water kettle, coffee, tea, etc.
It's located on a quiet neighborhood but you can catch a bus about a block away that will take you into the city centre or some other more busy areas."
21365	1171574	10.0	9.0	6987284	"This was a perfect choice to visit Seattle. Excellent location with lots of parking space and many buses towards capitol hill, downtown and other parts of town.

Plus, the house was beautiful. You have your own entrance and keys so you have 100% privacy and no hassle in coming in or out anytime you want. The boys were also very very friendly and helped us with whatever problem (we had an issue with an electric charger). "
21366	1171574	10.0	9.0	7049074	Highly recommended! If you need a place to Stay in Seattle you can't go wrong with Phil's room. Phil and Andrea live in a beautiful home conveniently located between downtown and a nice beach of the washington lake. We had a car so going around wasn't much of a problem for us, and in any case a couple of blocks from their home there is a small area with restaurants and coffee shops. It was very easy to communicate with them (I talked a lot to Andrea because Phil was out of town) and check in and out was very easy. In the room, which is very private and clean, you will find an A4 with all the information you need and some great tips about what to do and where to eat in the area. If you get the chance to talk to them they will give you even more tips! They really are great hosts! The only tip I have is that if you are terrorized by spider (I know it is silly, but I am), just bring somebody with you that can kill them all off before going to bed! I think this is the only drawback about staying in a comfy wooden room surrounded by trees and nature! 
21367	1171574	10.0	9.0	7280601	"My partner and I stayed for two nights at Phil & Andrea's for a short vacation in September, 2013.
We are happy to have met with Phil.  We could tell immediately that he is a wonderful person.  Although the guest house is not one of those that provide you with luxurious experience, Phil ensured us that we were more than welcome to ask for anything or help if needed.
The best thing about the guest house is its location and price.  The price is reasonable.  The location is only 5-minute drive to Seattle downtown.  Buses to downtown are nearby.  Cafes and grocery shops are easy to reach in the neighbourhood.  
There is a generous size fridge in the room, and a toaster; however, there is no microwave oven.  But guests are welcome to use theirs in the kitchen upstairs."
21368	1171574	10.0	9.0	7333409	great location, super accessible, is as described. totally worth it for the money, would highly suggest staying with Phil (met very briefly) and Andrea (didn't meet). 
21369	1171574	10.0	9.0	7408718	"I was in route to Seattle for several meetings and after looking at hotel prices I decided to try Airbnb. I contacted Phil and in less than a hour he responded, 

Getting to his place was fairly easy and when I knocked at the front door he answered. The space is in the basement with a private entrance and full private bathroom. 

It was private, quiet, had everything I needed and the wifi connection was very strong. I enjoyed my stay and wish I had booked it for another day when I had the chance. Close to major highways and not far from downtown it is the perfect area. 

Phil was great. The few times we bumped into one another coming or going the chats were always nice. For this to be my first experience with Airbnb I am glad it was with Phil and his basement space. Next time I am in Seattle I will without doubt be booking with Phil again."
21370	1171574	10.0	9.0	7611865	Phil was very nice and helpful.  He helped me charge my phone when I lost my charger and lent me an Orca card to get around town on public transit. The room was great too.
21371	1171574	10.0	9.0	7794322	Conveniently located and very kind hosts.  Though, I didn't get to meet them this trip, Phil and Andrea made every effort to make us feel at home and give us resources for our visit in Seattle.  I would definitely stay here on my next trip!
21372	1171574	10.0	9.0	8390239	"Phil's place is fantastic!  Great location, easy to get to Lake Washington.  Lots of street parking!  His home is so lovely, the outside has beautiful gardens, and the inside is cozy and warm.  Perfect for a Seattle get away!  
Thanks! "
21373	1171574	10.0	9.0	8557032	Phil was a very welcoming host to us, and we very much enjoyed our stay in Seattle with him.  I would gladly recommend this cosy apartment as a place to stay.  
21374	1171574	10.0	9.0	8629368	Pill was a great host and was very helpful during my trip. The location was convenient in order to get around. I will definitely contact Phil again when visiting seattle! 
21375	1171574	10.0	9.0	8835140	"Phil's room was a wonderfully cozy place to stay.  I wasn't there in the warmer weather to enjoy the garden, but I can see that they would be pretty.

The bed was very comfortable.  There is a pot for boiling water, and coffee and tea are provided as well as a fridge and a few dishes so that you can easily eat there.  

It is in the basement, but the wood panelling was very cheery and I loved having a separate entrance.  I didn't need tourist assistance because I was visiting my daughter, but it seemed as if they'll help with those things if you need it.  There is good information written up about local restaurants, busses, and grocerty store.

I would definitely go back there again."
21376	1171574	10.0	9.0	8877828	This is a nice place. Phil was flexible and quick to respond to questions. The space was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.
21377	1171574	10.0	9.0	9074637	"Ciao al tutti,

The room 'Private Entrance & Central"" was as advertised and more. I left the airport and took the light rail plus one bus and arrived in well under one hour (decided not to rent a car). When I arrived Phil had left instructions on how to enter the location where the key was placed and even left a slice of very tasty pumpkin bread (wished they left a couple more slices). The room and bath room were very clean and I had more than enough heat (I actually had to turn off one of the heaters, and I'm from L.A. lol.) There are three close and very convenient buses that are anywhere from two minutes to seven minutes walk away. My 'Uber' ride from downtown to Phil's place costs $10.00. 
Phil provided an iron and also allowed me to use the washer and dryer. Phil and Andrea made themselves available if needed. The co-host, Andrea owns 'Caffe Torino' at 422 Yale Ave. which has an amazing Sunday brunch, which reminded me of my sisters place in Italy. There is also 'Catfish Corner' a quaint family owned restaurant one block away, which serves some very tasty fried catfish and chicken wings. 
I highly recommend 'Private Entrance & Central' and I will use it again in the future.
"
21378	1171574	10.0	9.0	9228032	It was like a little cabin in the middle of Seattle. Close to downtown and very quiet place! I would recommend. Andrea was very nice too!
21379	1171574	10.0	9.0	9490747	Great stay!!! Very cozy and warm ... Although Phil was in Mexico , his partner Andrea was very friendly and accommodating ... Highly recommend !!
21380	1171574	10.0	9.0	9661149	We stayed three nights at Phil and Andreas and it was great. The room is spacious and clean, with everything you need to pull together an easy breakfast, although there is a great bakery right on the corner. Easy buses to anywhere in the city, and amazing ice cream and Thai food a few blocks away. Phil and Andrea are courteous and helpful, but also give you your space. Basically like renting a house/apt but at a great price in a great neighborhood. Stay here, be merry. 
21381	1171574	10.0	9.0	9730210	Phil is a very caring host.  He met me on the street and carried my suitcase to the place.  It is a nice cozy room, all paneled in wood, in an interesting neighborhood.
21382	1171574	10.0	9.0	9918363	"My stay at this location was great! The private entrance makes you feel like you definitely have your own space, but having Phil and Andrea upstairs is nice if you ever need suggestions.

Phil and Andrea left little notes around the room as instructions on how to use things, and also wrote a page about the history of the house, their background, suggestions for the area, and how to use the shower, amongst other things. I thought it was a great touch that really made me feel comfortable in the space."
21383	1171574	10.0	9.0	10024868	Phil's place is so comfortable. It is definitely the perfect place for two people and is within a thirty minute walk of downtown and capitol hill. He is a wonderful host and is so helpful and thoughtful. I highly recommend staying!!
21384	1171574	10.0	9.0	10164132	"Phil's accommodations were quiet, cozy and very comfortable. The room felt very much like a studio with several cozy seating areas with good lighting.  Nice touches were a fridg, plates & utensils, a tea kettle, tea bags and even special breakfast pastries left for us. The entrance was well lit and easy to get to. We would definitely stay again.

Phil is a nice guy, very friendly. I would definitely plan on coming back to this location when I come back to Seattle!!! 
21388	1171574	10.0	9.0	10513830	Phil (and Andrea) were lovely hosts. It was a real pleasure to share their home in Seattle. The room is a wonderful nook in the city and within walking distance of all that Seattle has to over. Would definitely recommend you staying here. What's more Phil very kindly helped us get to wherever we needed to get to when we left AND he was always there to offer sound advice on what to see and where to go. Get booking air bnbers! 
21389	1171574	10.0	9.0	10721418	The location is beautiful: between a tiny park and a bakery! And the room is really nice. I didn't have much contact with my hosts, but I would definitely stay there again.
21390	1171574	10.0	9.0	11327898	Wow!  How amazing!  Andrea and Phil were so warm and welcoming.  They even left us some pastries from Andrea's cafe - so good!

We were able to see a lot of Seattle and the surrounding area while we were there as their place is in a great spot! Phil was very helpful and very nice. I would recommend their place wholeheartedly!
21393	1171574	10.0	9.0	11964776	Phil and Andrea were amazing hosts!!! This was my first experience using AirBnB and thanks to them i will definitely be using it again!

21394	1171574	10.0	9.0	12246518	It is exactly as described.  It was clean,  convenient to restaurants,  local merchants and parks.  April is unpredictable but the heater was helpful when needed. Great neighborhood for walking!

We enjoyed our stay very much and would definitely stay here again."
21396	1171574	10.0	9.0	12622145	The location was perfect—just far enough from where I was attending an event to provide walking exercise (except when it rained), and the house is close to a main street so walking alone didn't worry me in the least. As I was leaving early and coming in late the whole time I was there, I was very glad to stay at a place with its own entrance. All I needed was a kettle, mug, and tea bags and all were provided. Comfortable bed, effective heater, excellent notes on how things worked (ie. the bath/shower taps), and fast wifi. All in all, a great place to stay in Seattle.  
21397	1171574	10.0	9.0	13345259	"Phil and Andrea were wonderful hosts! They were super easy to get in contact with, soo friendly, accessible, and had great suggestions for their neighborhood and for the city (GO TO Hi-Spot Cafe, bistro Turkuaz, Molly Moon's, and the EMP)! They live in a BEAUTIFUL home with a peaceful, private back yard in a gorgeous neighborhood--our strolls up to 34th Avenue were our favorite parts of the trip. The room is beautiful, private, and SO comfy, and the house is just a block away from a downtown bus line (so convenient). Phil and Andrea were kind enough to let us use their washer/dryer, and they let us borrow their ORCA card (so we could save $5 on the purchase of the card itself), which was so helpful. And the treats from Andrea's caffe were delicious!!! We can't rave about this lovely experience enough! Thank you both for a memorable airbnb experience during our first trip to Seattle! If/when we come back, we will stay here again! :)

P.S. While you're getting ready in the morning, drink some delicious hot tea and listen to 90.3! It's the best radio/news station ever. "

They're attentive yet easy going, and I felt very comfortable asking them a variety of questions. As for the room itself, I couldn't have asked for more because everything we needed was already quipped (fridge, electric kettle, extra blankets, towels, dinnerware, heater, etc). It felt less like a basement and more like a cabin we had to ourselves. It was clean, cozy, roomy, and overall it was the perfect room where we'd look forward to stretching our limbs after a long day of trekking the city. There are helpful notes/instructions posted for appliances and city guides around the room, and the bus stop is only a block away. 

We had such a memorable experience at Phil and Andrea's, and grew very attached to this place! Thank you again for those delicious pastries. I definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling through Seattle :)"
21399	1171574	10.0	9.0	13832087	Great little place and nice guys, conveniently close to city but nicely apart. 
21400	1171574	10.0	9.0	14430282	Phil and Andrea have a beautiful house, and they have done up the basement so nicely! I spent four nights there and felt totally at home - the bed was comfortable,  and I absolutely loved the bathroom. It was clean and the clawfoot tub was an experience. Thank you to Andrea for leaving all those delicious pastries for me, I enjoyed them so much. You had everything you need to get ready for a day out in Seattle (buses were really convenient too, you could get anywhere). Also, Phil was one of the friendliest hosts I've ever met. I would be back in a hurry!
21401	1171574	10.0	9.0	14599499	"A relaxing ""cabin"" in a beautiful home, Phil was very accommodating and informative on where to eat, shop and spend our time in Seattle! Thank you so much for the hospitality and for sharing your home with us!"
21402	1171574	10.0	9.0	14737559	Our stay at Phil's place in Seattle was great. He made accommodations for us to arrive early which was very kind of him. His house is just up the block from the downtown bus and easily accessible from bike paths. Since guests enter the den through the back, the room is quiet and private. Great stay. 
21403	1171574	10.0	9.0	14819102	Phil and Andrea were great host.  Exactly as expected and had a terrific time.  Great location.  Very central to all places I wanted to go see.  One of my best Airbnb experience.
21404	1171574	10.0	9.0	15039497	My daughter and I recently stayed in the room in Phil's home with a private entrance. The room was exactly as advertised. It was in a beautiful old home in a very nice neighborhood. There was a heater if needed, although the temperature was perfect for us without it. He provided coffee, tea, and hot chocolate if you wanted it. He also had soap, shampoo, and conditioner available in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the bath/shower wonderful. Phil was excellent with communication and available whenever we needed him. He was very friendly and hospitable, even sharing baked goods with us a couple of times during our stay. There are several good restaurants close by and wonderful coffee and ice cream shops, as well. I enjoy running in the morning and the location was perfect for this. There are two bus lines a block from the house, which we used every day. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Seattle.
21405	1171574	10.0	9.0	15307495	Phil was a perfect host. He left notes for us when we arrived in the middle of the night and was very accommodating on all requests. He had a lot of pointers for the neighborhood and was excellent at communicating with us. Would happily return next time we are in Seattle. 
21406	1171574	10.0	9.0	15472970	Room was very nice, and clean. Lots of helpful advice about the city and surrounding areas. Phil was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay again! 
21407	1171574	10.0	9.0	15582603	"Phil and Andrea were great hosts. They accommodated a later check-in and an uncertain check-out time. They greeted us with delicious treats, recommendations for places to go and how to get there, and were genuinely interested in our experience of Seattle. Phil suggested we swim in Lake Washington, which we did and quite enjoyed on a summer day of walking around in the city. Many of his other suggestions were totally on point. We were grateful to have such engaging hosts.

The basement apartment was perfect for our needs. The neighborhood is lovely and full of chickadees, finches, and flowers. We had the pleasure of gracing by bushy lavender upon entering the gate to a private entrance and got to sleep in the most comfortable bed. The apartment includes helpful labels and tips for using amenities. 

We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for making Seattle so welcoming!"
21408	1171574	10.0	9.0	15664712	"We stayed at Phil's place in Seattle very recently and had a warm and enjoyable stay in this great city. Phil and Andrea are wonderful, caring and sociable hosts (thanks for the pastries and cherries!) and very knowledgable. We loved Phil's map of their favourite local places (we found a great restaurant  on 34th for our 2-week anniversary :)).

Phil was really helpful about getting us oriented to the area (before and during our stay). It is a safe, green and friendly neighbourhood and easy to get around (especially if like us, you choose the public transit route) both for getting from the airport and then downtown. The buses run until about 12am (we know because we caught just about the last one :))) Late at night and on weekends (especially Sundays) they run at less frequent intervals... however timetables are posted and some stops have the automated indicator boards).

The basement-cottage was just charming, with beautiful touches like the historic clawfoot tub (felt very decadent 1920's ... in a fun way), the lovely lit-up garden, lots of storage space for our stuff, maps and ""get around"" info,, facilities for coffee/tea and making snacks...

We would definitely recommend Phil's place on your Seattle trip!"
21409	1171574	10.0	9.0	15868174	Staying at Phil and Andrea's home was so much more than what we expected. Their place was incredibly cozy and super convenient to many cafe's, restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. It was very clean and offered a lot of privacy. We could not have asked for two better hosts to make our first trip to Seattle relaxed, exciting, and beautiful. Phil and Andrea go above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable and fulfilling. The description of their home is exactly as stated in the listing. We would definitely come back to stay here if we are ever visiting in Seattle again and would highly recommend staying here if you can. 
21410	1171574	10.0	9.0	15952082	The room was great - clean, organized and equipped better than we expected! Nice and cool during the unexpected heat wave we found in Seattle. Phil is a gracious host, laid back and made us feel welcome. The location is great – close to anything you need and then some. We were very busy during our visit so didn't really get to interact with our hosts, but they made sure we knew they were always available if we needed anything.
21411	1171574	10.0	9.0	16249067	Phil is an excellent host!  He and Andrea are both very kind, hospitable, helpful people (thank you for the delicious pastries)!  We loved returning to this adorable space each night.  The location is perfect and the space is lovely and cozy.  We would definitely stay here again if I ever visit Seattle again.
21412	1171574	10.0	9.0	16461631	Phil and Andrea are old hats at this; they know how to make folks feel welcome and if you need help in navigating Seattle or eating places, etc., they're there to help.  However, what I appreciated most, is they let you be yourselves.  That is, if you want assistance with anything in relation to the apartment, which we didn't since Phil leaves these great notes explaining how everything works, they are right there pronto to address your needs or questions, but, moreover, should you just want to do your own thing, they are unobtrusive in a very cool sort of way. In short, great hosts, great central location, and a great place to sleep!  I would definitely recommend staying here and would revisit again.
21413	1171574	10.0	9.0	16623106	Phil did a great job welcome us when we first arrived. And gave us the insight information of point of interest. The room was wonderful. Overall a great experience! Can't wait to come back to Seattle again! 
21414	1171574	10.0	9.0	16746358	Phil is a wonderful host! His place is in a great spot to explore Seattle from (bus stop to downtown just round the corner) and Madrona itself has some lovely cafés and restaurants (and great ice-cream!!). We were made to feel extremely welcome and Phil had lots of top tips for the local area - including taking a dip in Lake Washington which is within easy walking distance. The room was clean, well equipped and comfortable - we would definitely recommend staying here!
21415	1171574	10.0	9.0	16821521	One of our best AirBNB experiences. Phil has thought of everything! Comfy bed, blackout blinds, coffee facilities, lovely bath/shower, plenty of local info... I really can't fault the place, and on top of that Phil was super helpful and communicative. Six stars!
21416	1171574	10.0	9.0	17100992	Phil met us at the door and showed us to the room which was exactly as depicted on the site.  The room was clean and very comfortable and well-located for our needs.  Phil also provided nice touches of fresh fruit from their apple tree, coffee, tea,  hot chocolate and delicious pastries!  He was also willing to provide local information if we had any questions.  I would definitely recommend this listing and we will certainly check back for availability when we next travel to Seattle!
21417	1171574	10.0	9.0	17432348	Place was clean, quiet and private. Phil was available to show us around upon arrival and had fresh apples and pastries for us. Location of place was a bit of a hike to downtown or lake Washington but only because Seattle is very hilly. 34th street is nearby and has cute coffee shops and restaurants. And Kurt Cobain's (last) home was a 20minute walk to see.  Try the bakery around the corner - it's delicious!! All in all - a great experience and would stay there again.
21418	1171574	10.0	9.0	17617207	The room we stayed in was very comfortable.  The mattress was like sleeping on heaven, I need to ask Phil what it is called.  The hosts were super kind and welcoming.  I appreciated the map with cool places to go and the treats from Andrea's cafe.  Anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle would be very comfortable here.  
21419	1171574	10.0	9.0	17936530	I'd highly recommend this location for a stay in Seattle. Phil was extremely communicative; I never had a question about the neighborhood or the room. The room was pretty basic, but we didn't spend much time there. It was comfortable. The house is located about a $7 Uber ride or a 15-minute bus trip from downtown. One night I walked about seven blocks to a great new restaurant: Red Cow. Phil's partner Andrea, who runs a bakery, left us delicious chocolate and almond croissants one morning, too. While we didn't even see our hosts during our short stay, we felt very welcome. 
21420	1171574	10.0	9.0	18176180	"Phil and Andrea made us very welcome. The accommodation was clean and comfortable with very easy bus access to downtown and other places we wanted to see.
Highly recommended and would stay again. 
If you like authentic Thai food the Lotus near to Phil's is great.  The Ethiopian next to the Lotus also has tasty food.
We didn't get to Andrea's coffee shop but the cakes left for us were delicious.  "
21421	1171574	10.0	9.0	18318153	"The house is conveniently located near 2 buses heading downtown. The room is very neat and private. 
We just had time to say a quick hello to Phil and Andrea. They were very welcoming and considerate (we got pastries from Andrea's cafe). 
We recommend them!"
21422	1171574	10.0	9.0	18874514	We had an amazing trip that was made all the better by our 'home' for the week. Phil was incredibly welcoming and helpful, the room was delightful, and we would definitely stay here again next time we are in Seattle! Thanks so much for all your help and hospitality!
21423	1171574	10.0	9.0	19075857	WONDERFUL!!! The listing reflects the room and location very well. Phil was fantastic giving us advice on various things, from parking to nature destinations.  He and Andrea made us feel very welcome, and the room is comfortable and quiet.  Highly recommended!
21424	1171574	10.0	9.0	19201467	What an awesome first AirBNB experience. From before I even arrived, Phil made sure that everything was in place to make me feel right at home. Even thought I was 3k miles away from where I live, I never felt like a stranger. The room is very comfortable, the claw foot bath tub reminded me of the old homes where I grew up, and Phil is such an interesting guy to talk to. This was an absolutely awesome experience, very comfortable place to stay, and overall I can't thank Phil and Andrea enough for being such wonderful hosts. I will be back again!
21425	1171574	10.0	9.0	19359223	"Phil was there to welcome us and he explained everything thoroughly.
We enjoyed our stay tremendously. The room was quiet and comfortable with all the amenities available and we loved the bed.
We had a great time exploring the city and the neighborhood and loved meeting Andrea at his Italian coffee shop, where we savored the coffee and sweets. What a great surprise to find the delicious pastries in the morning.
We recommend this place very highly.
"
21426	1171574	10.0	9.0	19478518	"Phil was an excellent host! He was super friendly and offered us great conversation and wine upon arrival as well as recommendations for local restaurants and sights. He also made homemade poundcake for us that was waiting when we returned from dinner and a treat the second night too! - just a really great experience!

The room was also super tidy and cozy, tea and coffee options were provided for the morning along with a recommendation for a great cafe around the corner. Phil's directions were also really easy to follow since we'd never been to Seattle. The house is very close to a local bus stop making it really easy to travel around the city. I'd 100% recommend the place and would definitely contact them again for future visits."
21427	1171574	10.0	9.0	19590308	We had a wonderful time at phil and andrea's home! Very welcoming and an amazing place to relax after a long journey. A beautiful room with a very nice bath! We also received useful recommendations for exploring Seattle.
21428	1171574	10.0	9.0	19784081	Phil and Andrea were so accommodating. They were wonderful hosts. Snacks on arrival, beautiful room, private bathroom and private entrance made our stay massively enjoyable.
21429	1171574	10.0	9.0	20138815	Everything about the stay was good. We will return. All was as described. Thank you for a pleasant experience.
21430	1171574	10.0	9.0	20286391	We loved our place at Phil's and Andrea's. The room was as described and very comfortable. When we arrived Phil was there to meet us and show us everything. Phil left the next day for his own vacation, but Andreas was there if we needed anything. Going to the center was easy, but we are a bit spoiled and didn't want to use public transport so we used Uber. It was $9,- to the center and no fuss with the bus! If we ever go back to Seattle, we definitely stay with Phil and Andrea again!
21431	1171574	10.0	9.0	20552103	Phil provided very prompt replies, with friendly responses that answered all of our questions.  The house was in a great location, neither too far nor too close from downtown. It was also close to buses that carried us to the essential places of Seattle. The room was clean and spaciously cozy! You get to have a private bathroom too, with soap, towels, shampoo/conditioner/body wash, and tissues all ready for your convenience! My friend and I went around late September, and Seattle weather was perfect for most of the days, but at nights the temperature did drop a bit. But no worries! The hosts have provided a heater and if I recall correctly, there was a humidifier as well. Phil and Andrea were excellent on respecting our privacy. Finding their yummy treats hanging on the door was such a delight after a long trip to Mt.Rainier! Overall, the hosts and their room allowed a more enjoyable vacation for us! Thank you Phil and Andrea :)
21432	1171574	10.0	9.0	20821322	"We only met Andrea, since Phil was on vacation himself, but both were very kind, never left a question unanswered and helped us a lot. 
The room was very spacious, tidy and clean and it was really cozy. 
We also liked very much the location: Angel's Café is right around the corner for breakfast and there are a lot of nice restaurants within walking distance. We recommend the accomodation to anyone and would stay here again next time we visit Seattle :)"
21433	1171574	10.0	9.0	21125222	Hands down the best time we had in seattle. The place was great and the public transit made it real easy to get around with ease. In the mornings we went to the bakery at the corner and in the evenings there were so many places nearby for dinner. We enjoyed spending the day traveling around and were happy to celebrate Andrea's second yr anniv. of his business. The food was great!! I am glad we got to have dinner with Andrea when we were there. We hope to come back to stay on our next trip. Definitely our favorite place. 
21434	1171574	10.0	9.0	21393994	Our stay at Phil's place has been perfect. The room is better than described: full of tips and treats. Phil is a wonderful host and makes everything easy for you. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet. A wonderful place to stay in Seattle.
21435	1171574	10.0	9.0	21472741	Our stay at Phil's was great! We arrived on a rainy afternoon and Phil was home to greet us and show us to the room. He was very friendly and helped with providing some restaurant recommendations. We actually ended up going to one of his top recommendations for a vegetarian place, Cafe Flora. The room had plenty of amenities, including towels and a microwave, kettle and some basic kitchen supplies. We didn't end up using any of the kitchen stuff but it was nice to have the option to heat up food. The room got pretty cold but there was no shortage of heaters! Phil even left us some pastries our first day and they were greatly appreciated in the morning when we woke up. A lovely experience!
21436	1171574	10.0	9.0	21669033	My friend Katie and I had an excellent stay at Phil's.  We were given good directions on how to get there and on how to use things like the clawfoot bathtub shower and heater etc.  Both Phil and Andrea were excellent hosts as they provided yummy treats and useful tips on what to do in Seattle depending on the weather.  They were available for questions without interfering with the seclude of the private room/entrance.  I would highly recommend their home to anyone coming to visit Seattle. 
21437	1171574	10.0	9.0	21839547	We enjoyed staying here and Phil was a great host. Phil recommended stuff to do in town and gave us some yummy treats from his partner's café. There's great places to eat within a short walk of the house and the neighbourhood was beautiful and quiet. It's about a 30 minute walk into downtown and there's all sorts of stuff to do in the city. Highly recommended listing!
21438	1171574	10.0	9.0	21957272	Phil was a great host and it was evident that he has put a lot of time and effort into making sure that each of his guests feel welcomed and comfortable. I really enjoyed my time in Seattle, and this wonderful lodging in a great neighborhood was definitely a contributing factor. Phil was great at corresponding and keeping in touch to make sure that my stay was as pleasant as possible and stress free. 
21439	1171574	10.0	9.0	22242857	The room was great and in such a beautiful house. Phil was a great host and was very helpful.
21440	1171574	10.0	9.0	22388795	My boyfriend and I had a great time staying here! Phil and Andrea have a lovely home in a great location. The space we stayed in was clean, cozy and had all the amenities for our brief stay! After exploring the city we came home to lovely treats from Andrea's bakery which were absolutely delicious and a great surprise. I plan to return to Seattle again and would love to stay here another time . 
21441	1171574	10.0	9.0	22943478	"Me and Ben stayed in Phil and Andreas place for 2 weeks and it was truly wonderful. These guys are such lovely people and fantastic hosts that made our stay so comfortable. Their place is gorgeous and has everything you need and we can honestly say the bed is one of the comfiest beds we have ever stayed in. The location is fantastic, we didn't need a car at all Seattle is a great city for walking and this place is in walking distance of downtown and Capitol Hill, we actually walked most days but there are buses too all within a 2 min walk from there home. 
It's very private with it's own entrance so you really feel like it's your own little home but Phil and Andrea were always available if we needed anything. If your going to Seattle you'd be a fool to not stay here, if we go back to Seattle (which we definitely will as we've fallen in love with it) we 100% want to stay here again we couldn't fault one thing :). Thanks again guys.
 Eve and Ben"
21442	1171574	10.0	9.0	23788075	"Our stay at Phil and Andrea's home was great! Each night we were greeted with tasty treats at our door steps and the warmth emanating from the heater. 

The place looked exactly like the pictures posted on the site. Aside from the treats, we really enjoyed all the notes throughout the room (how to properly use the shower, kitchenette, etc.).

Thanks again!"
21443	1171574	10.0	9.0	23962007	"Wow. This room is AWESOME! Looks exactly like the picture. Andrea and Phil did a great job making it feel very homey and cozy. My best friend and I loved staying here. We also appreciated all the little notes they left around for us containing little tips. We felt very safe here. 

We did not get to meet Andrea and Phil personally since were had such a limited time and were always in a rush but we could tell that a lot of thought and effort went into these rooms. A major plus was the private entrance that allowed us to come and go whenever we wanted. One night we came home at 3am so it was nice to know were were not disturbing anyone coming home. 

Seattle was beautiful, I miss it already. Thank you for the delicious cupcakes as well. We can't wait to come back. THANK YOU, AGAIN!!!"
21444	1171574	10.0	9.0	24118309	"We absolutely loved Phil & Andrea's place! The room was clean, cozy and spacious, and the private entrance made us felt like we were in a ""entire apartment"", definitely a plus if you are looking for a place with convenience and privacy at the same time. The location was very central, we had a car, and everything was within 10 minutes drive. First time in Seattle? Phil & Andrea's place is definitely the place to stay! Highly recommended!! "

The place was very quiet and clean and the host kind and helpfull.
We had 3 very good nights at Phil's place."
21446	1171574	10.0	9.0	24600090	Beautiful little basement bedroom. The house is very conveniently located right next to downtown (20 minute walk) and just a bus ride away. Phil was extremely accommodating and easy to communicate with in spite of his absence due to traveling. The bedroom was warm, ready and spick upon our arrival with a box of pastries as a welcome gift from Phil and his partner. The bedroom has all the basic listed amenities as well as loads of reading material to guide your visit to Seattle. All the instructions were very succinctly labeled around the bedroom. It really is a very comfortable place especially during the harsh windy winters of Seattle and we would definitely hit up the spot at our next visit to Seattle. 
21447	1171574	10.0	9.0	25079145	Phils place was absolutely amazing. We were greeted with a welcome sign and often with sweets from Andreas bakery. The room was impeccable and very warm even in the cold Seattle freeze we had. The room was perfectly located just east of Capitol Hill which made seeing Seattle by bus or foot super easy. Very quiet room and neighborhood and ill definitely be back for my next staycation!
21448	1171574	10.0	9.0	25555619	"Phil was in touch by email with great directions and cell phone numbers before our flight to Seattle.  He included a list and directions for businesses nearby.   Phil greeted us when we arrived and showed us all the details of where we'd be staying.  The apartment worked out perfectly for us - it is in a quiet neighborhood in a great area of Seattle.  There were little helpful notes and reminders on lamps, heaters, doors, etc., that were very useful.  The apartment was great for us and we'd hope to be able to stay there again the next time we visit Seattle! 
"
21449	1171574	10.0	9.0	25791341	We love this place! The accommodations are very comfortable, have lots of character, very practical, and totally private. We got to meet Phil briefly and learn about his love for Seattle, and he and his partner were kind enough to leave delicious treats for us upon our arrival! I'd recommend this place to anyone especially given its convenience in the heart of Seattle.
21450	1171574	10.0	9.0	26029394	Amazing space! Great location. Delicious treats from the bakery! All in all it was a wonderful place to collect myself before moving into my new place. Highly recommend and would definitely stray again
21451	1171574	10.0	9.0	26234144	Phil was a great host by letting me check in early since I had an AM arrival flight into Seattle. He also pointed me to his favorite breakfast spot, The Hi Spot. The room was like staying in a cabin in the city. The private entrance was also nice since it made it seem like my very own residence in Seattle. Will definitely be coming back again! 
21452	1171574	10.0	9.0	26396378	"The room was extremely cozy and lovely. It had just what we needed!  It was close enough to all the places we needed to go and walked everywhere. There is a delicious bakery around the corner from the house where we walked to every morning for breakfast. 

Phil was very attentive to us during our stay and was available for whatever we needed. 

 Lovely home you have Thanks for being a great host! "

Neighborhood was quiet, suburban area. Was about an hour walk from Pike's Place, and actually it was quite nice to walk to downtown instead of taking the bus. The weather was quite good while we were there.

All in all, very satisfied."
21454	1171574	10.0	9.0	26952676	My stay with Phil and Andrea was fantastic! I really enjoyed every minute. The room was wonderful, really felt like home. I actually found myself sad leaving. I highly suggest staying with them if you are in the area!

21457	1171574	10.0	9.0	27655855	"Phil and Andrea were superb hosts! While my boyfriend and I did not have a chance to meet Phil in person, he perfectly communicated all we needed to know about the check-in process, the location of his home, and was available to answer any and all questions I had previous to showing up via email and text. Andrea welcomed us with a delicious treat from his cafe and suggested Thai for dinner - it was a block away and everything I wanted after a long drive with sore legs.
The room is very cozy and there are helpful notes scattered about regarding heat settings, utensils available, rules for recycling/composting and trash, etc. The entrance is extremely private, which was nice for coming and going throughout the day and night. The location is close to so much - it's a beautiful and quiet neighborhood near many cafes and restaurants, and you can be in downtown Seattle in less than 15 minutes by car. I felt very comfortable here.
This was my first time booking an Airbnb space and I am very happy with my choice and stay. Phil and Andrea, thank you again for welcoming Tyler and I into your home!"
21458	1171574	10.0	9.0	27898994	Felt right at home immediately upon arrival--the Sony was tuned to the world's greatest radio station, KEXP. You will not be disappointed here, the hosts are great and the amenities are exactly as described. Will definitely return to this cozy retreat in Madrona, Seattle's best neighborhood.
21459	1171574	10.0	9.0	28082478	"This was my first Airbnb stay, and I have enjoyed every bit of it. The host was extremely informative before our stay (e.g., giving detailed directions, recommendations of local places). The place is just as described. The room was very cozy, with lots of character. Everything was functional and clean. It was listed that pets are not allowed, which is a plus since my travel-mate is allergic. 
Given this is my first Airbnb stay, I can't compare it with others. However, I'd say this is probably the most ideal way to introduce me to Airbnb. Compare to a hotel, there is a lot more personal touch :)

I was very satisfied with my stay, and will highly recommend this particular host (who has several Airbnb listings) to my friends. "
21460	1171574	10.0	9.0	28214398	We had a wonderful time in Seattle.  Phil was a perfect host, met us upon our arrival, answered all my questions about the area and had some great tidbits of his own.  The location was very quiet and the bed was very comfy!!  We slept very well considering we were not in our own bed.  We were also able to park our car right out front of the house.
21461	1171574	10.0	9.0	28316174	Great place, exactly where we needed it location wise. Everything we needed.
21462	1171574	10.0	9.0	28481304	Experience was fantastic. Phil was so informative and courteous to prepare us for our arrival. Heater was on and little notes all around the room helped us get acclimated to the room. Even had a chocolate croissant in the fridge! Thanks Phil! 
21463	1171574	10.0	9.0	28983196	"I stayed at Phil's for five nights and had a wonderful time. He and Andrea are so nice and hospitable, and their house is located in a beautiful historic neighborhood. The location ended up being super convenient without a car; it's about a minute's walk from two bus lines that will take you almost anywhere you'd want to go around Seattle. I made it to Ballard, Fremont, UW, Seattle Center, and downtown (as well as the airport) all on public transportation.

The bed was very comfortable (hellooooo memory foam!) and the room warmed up quickly with the space heaters Phil provided. I also loved the little family-owned bakery around the corner...I went there for coffee almost every morning!

One thing to note is that this listing is in a basement, so you can hear the ceiling squeaking and creaking as the owners walk around above you. This was not a huge issue, but I thought my fellow light sleepers out there should be aware.

All in all, I had a wonderful experience at Phil's and would 100% recommend staying here, especially if you are new to Seattle. Between the hospitality, the location, and the value, you can't beat this place. Thanks Phil and Andrea! :)"

We were a quick drive from everything we wanted to visit in the downtown area. Plenty of street parking. Phil is knowledgable about the city and willing to always make a recommendation. I would highly recommend! 
21471	1171574	10.0	9.0	31965369	"We loved our stay at Phil's house, especially enjoyed the wonderful garden. Room was spacious and the private bathroom had a wonderful old fashioned claw tub. Phil was very friendly and helpful, and provided us with his favorite spots in lovely Madrona. The house was easy to reach through 3 different buslines coming from downtown. 
Highly recommended!"
21472	1171574	10.0	9.0	32823152	The place was clean and conveniently situated near many good restaurants and only a bus away from downtown. 
21473	1171574	10.0	9.0	33900233	Phil is a very welcoming host! Apartement as shown, offers lots of privacy due to the seperate entrance/bathroom. Lots of tips (where to go shopping, how to get to city center, what to do) were gladly given. Takes about 15-20min to reach Seattle Center or Downtown with one of the two busses leaving next block.
21474	1171574	10.0	9.0	34190437	Such a great experience. The place is charming, very private&comfy.Minutes to several bus routes.

Phil gave great recommendations on local restaurants and activities. Canoeing at UW was one of our favorite parts of our trip, and we would have missed out without Phil. 
They also brought us delicious coffee cakes from a local bakery. 

The room was spacious, clean, and had plenty of rustic charm. We would definitely stay there again!"
21477	1171574	10.0	9.0	35371217	Phil was a wonderful host. He was warm and welcoming upon arrival and provided great suggestions for things to do/places to visit/bus routes, etc. He was available when needed, but also gave us as much privacy as we desired. We didn't have a chance to meet Andrea; however, we did get to enjoy some of her delicious pastries left outside our door :) The place was great too, exactly as described. In addition, there were so many nice things Phil thought to provide...things including the local events paper waiting upon arrival, a cloth bag to use for any shopping trips, speakers for hookup to device, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and heartily recommend it to anyone passing through Seattle.
21478	1171574	10.0	9.0	35566999	A real great introduction to airbnb.  The room is well-furnished and you have all the privacy you need.  Phil has loads of information for guests that is quite useful.  Thanks.
21479	1171574	10.0	9.0	36502047	"The host was very kind and helpful. Even before my arrival, I received useful emails and instructions. He was also helpful when it came to answering my questions and concerns.

The room is a basement with an ensuite, but the tub is a bit small for larger and taller people. 

I was concerned about the lack of air conditioning, but the host assured me that it would not be necessary. He was right because the room was nice and cool at night and I had no trouble sleeping.

The host also provided many amenities in the bathroom and in the room as well as instructions on how to use everything. He also had free instant coffee and tea. He has notes stuck everywhere. "
21480	1171574	10.0	9.0	37057893	"Phil made us feel very welcome with his little notes and kind treats.
Love the hood.

21482	1171574	10.0	9.0	37642266	Phil and Andrea were very accommodating. Phil gave us a lot of good suggestions on what to do around the neighborhood as well as the rest of Seattle. Their Airbnb was very comfortable and had everything you need to have a cozy stay. Can't recommend this place enough!
21483	1171574	10.0	9.0	38376603	Our stay with Phil and Andrea was fantastic! When we arrived, Phil was there to greet us and offer some great suggestions for food and local beer. Our room was spotless, and had all of the amenities we could possibly need. We were in and out of the house a lot over our 2 day stay, so the private entrance was very convenient since we didn't have disturb our hosts at late hours. We were impressed at how spacious the room and it's adjoining bathroom were, and very happy with our stay overall. Andrea even left us some treats from her bakery for breakfast! We felt very welcome in Seattle, and hope to get back some time soon.
21484	1171574	10.0	9.0	38692279	Really enjoyed our stay here. Nice cool room, your own bathroom. Phil gave the best tips for the neighbourhood. Close to the lake, but you can also easily take the bus downtown. Recommend!
21485	1171574	10.0	9.0	39528488	First time ever using airbnb and what an experience for my first.  Phil is amazing, knowledgable, the area is great.  You can make it to downtown on the number 8 super easy!  The space is nice, relaxing, very private, and this neighborhood was one of my favorites, diverse and close to everything.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle!!!
21486	1171574	10.0	9.0	39811699	A great little suite located walking distance to Capitol Hill's wonderful shops and restaurants. Phil was very friendly and quickly responded to our messages. Highly recommend.
21487	1171574	10.0	9.0	40126234	Loved staying here! Picked it since there were so many good reviews and it lived up to ratings. Phil was great as he was very prompt with his messaging and sent a map of nearby restaurants and attractions. There was also fresh pastries for us when we arrived which was awesome! Great location as well as everything was very accessible but still in a smaller neighborhood which was nice. All in all great place to stay.
21488	1171574	10.0	9.0	40341699	We really enjoyed our stay. Everything was as described or better. Phil met us on arrival and all the amenities (wi-fi (which was speedy), refrigerator, etc.) were thoroughly explained. He provided helpful hints on both the immediate neighborhood and downtown Seattle, which was very close. We enjoyed the treats from Andrea's bakery on the morning we left. The neighborhood was great- we loved the neighborhood with all the old Craftsmen houses, including Phil and Andrea's and the fact that it is within walking distance of Lake Washington, where we also spent some time. We unreservedly recommend this for your stay in Seattle as the price is very reasonable, the proximity to downtown is great, and it was nice to explore one of Seattle older neighborhoods.
21489	1171574	10.0	9.0	41057433	"Phil,
Thanks for your hospitality. Your place worked really well for us. The privacy and ability to come and go, while still feeling welcome and well provided for were great. Your directions and tips were spot on and really helped us navigate our way around. I will recommend your place  highly to any friends or family  visiting Seattle, and hopefully we can join you again on our next visit since I am now highly invested in Katie and Evan.
We arrived back in Louisville last night. Lots of bikers on the road.
We had a great trip returning along the Oregon Trail. I highly recommend this book by Rinker Buck ""the Oregon Trail:  a New American Journey.""  Thanks again for helping make our visit a wonderful experience.

21490	1171574	10.0	9.0	41574882	"Phil was a great host who had made every effort to make our stay enjoyable. We only had a short visit so took his advice and ticked off all the activities he suggested - having a great time in the process. Phil's place is perfectly located with downtown and lake Washington within easy reach. 

Would definitely stay again. Be sure to visit Andreas bakery for some tasty treats."
21491	1171574	10.0	9.0	41929012	Phil was great! We loved the location and the room. We had everything we needed with a private entrance, bathroom, mini fridge, and microwave. The bed was more comfortable than it looked and we enjoyed being right next to a woodsy park. 
21492	1171574	10.0	9.0	42456478	Phil's place was a perfect spot for me and my daughter to explore Seattle. With it's separate entrance and amenities we felt like locals. Phil was very nice and helpful and Andrea gave us some delicious pastries. I would definitely stay here again! 
21493	1171574	10.0	9.0	42825548	Phil's place was perfect: clean, considerate, and quiet. Cute notes left everywhere help guide the guest and feel right at home as one gains a sense of the personality of the host. Location is great, too. The best Airbnb of our trip by far.
21494	1171574	10.0	9.0	43896404	Quiet neighborhood, very convenient to lots of things, and accurately described by a very good host, Phil Brennan.
21495	1171574	10.0	9.0	44517983	Super nice room--quiet and cozy.  Phil and Andrea are excellent, generous hosts and provide everything you need and more!   Highly recommended!

21498	1171574	10.0	9.0	52052187	The listing was described perfectly. The space was warm and accommodating. We definitely felt at home. We were able to use public transportation during our stay and really get to see Seattle. Phil was very friendly and was able to answer any questions we had about touring the city.

21500	1171574	10.0	9.0	53043542	Phil and Andrea were terrific.  Their listing was exactly like they said, and I've never had the wonderful pastries available like they provided, at any hotel I've ever stayed.  The neighborhood was most convenient for access to Lake Washington, as well as Downtown and Capitol Hill.  It was a very green area, and a terrific place to stay.
21501	1171574	10.0	9.0	53229721	"There was a pastry waiting for me on my first night which was delicious. The place was clean and welcoming. Although I never met him in person Phil was easy to communicate with and available over messages. 

The only thing I wasn't expecting was, being in the basement of an old house, I was woken up every morning to the sound of footsteps above me. I don't think there is anything Phil could do about this but would have been good to know going into it. I still think his place is a good value. If you are looking for a clean and private place to stay for a good price this is a great option. "
21502	1171574	10.0	9.0	53816697	Phil and Andrea were awesome hosts! Lots of great advice on what to check out in the area, and the pastries from Andrea's bakery were amazing. Really cool place to stay at, and loved the claw foot tub. Wished we could have stayed longer in Seattle, lots of cool stuff to see in so little time. Thanks for the awesome stay guys, can't wait to be back, loved the neighbourhood and everything!
21503	1171574	10.0	9.0	54307961	Huge thank you to Phil and Andrea for their hospitality. I briefly got to chat with both of them. They are delightful and welcoming people. The accommodations were beyond and location is excellent. I would not hesitate to book with them again and highly recommend anyone visiting Seattle to reserve this room. 
21504	1171574	10.0	9.0	55485664	Phil was very welcoming and the space was exactly as described. He was in contact with me and the arrival/departure time was flexible. He also had pastries waiting for me daily 
21505	1171574	10.0	9.0	55607582	Phil, really made me feel welcome from the start and this was a very memorable and special stay because of the meticulous planning that Phil puts in to making sure that you have a pleasant time in Seattle. Provides excellent recommendations on a word document for you, where to make sure to visit, places to eat. Neighborhood is excellently situated, I walked to downtown in 30 minutes and the room is a treat. 
21506	1171574	10.0	9.0	55908628	Phil was helpful with the neighborhood information and gave great recommendations.  The room was cozy and comfortable and the location was close to coffee shops, restaurants and trails.  We would definitely stay there again :).  
21507	1171574	10.0	9.0	56287596	This was my first experience with airbnb and I can only say good things! Phil was super nice and accommodating. He provided us with everything we might need (microwave, electric kettle, heater, knife, spoons, forks, plates, cups, etc.) Even a mini fridge! I am so glad I chose this spot! It was easy and quick to get to  downtown from here and I love the fact that it has a private entry. Lovely wood paneling and colorfully decorated room. Hope to come back and visit again!
21508	1171574	10.0	9.0	58161744	Phil's place is nice and clean, and is easy to get to from the airport (by light link rail and a bus, about 40mins). He provided loads of information on the area and there was a welcome snack as well! 
21795	1455908	10.0	9.0	7207620	Before ever arriving I had a good feeling about the decision we made to rent from Jesse & Thuy. Jesse communicated with me frequently and responded quickly. He seemed very thoughtful and conscientious of our needs. When we arrived the place was spotless and felt very comfortable. On the table he left several local travel brochures, a packet of helpful information he typed up himself (rules for staying there, WiFi login, local restaurants & attractions, etc...), and a note with a gift for being their first airbnb guests. Above & beyond!! He made himself available if we needed assistance (which we did not, since he did such a good job of covering all the bases) and checked in with me via text message just to make sure we got in okay. Aside from how great he was, the home is modern/up to date, and in a great location; tucked into a cozy neighborhood just minutes from downtown via car or bus. The bus stop was only a few blocks away. Coffee is also within walking distance (as it should be in Seattle! lol) To say that all of our needs were met is an understatement! These two are fantastic hosts and you can feel secure that should you choose to stay here you will be very pleased. Thanks for everything, Jesse & Thuy!
21796	1455908	10.0	9.0	8863650	"This was a great rental.  Thank you Jesse for making this easy and accommodating.  cozy place with lots of light, close to downtown and everything.  
Loved the little fire place, it was comforting.  And there is a great coffee shop 6 blocks away down the hill that I love.  
I can see this being a great place for someone that needs to commute to something they are attending daily, but still be a little out of the major hub of city craziness and have a neighborhood feel. 
Also, I love the little kitchen with the nice appliances. "
21797	1455908	10.0	9.0	9543845	The host is very friendly, they give us a bottle of wine as gift for new year, the house is tidy and clean, it's fabulous for two couples to stay. 
21798	1455908	10.0	9.0	9988623	Jesse was a great and very communicative host.  The apartment is lovely, with beautiful wood floors and quality appliances throughout.  It's in a cute neighborhood with great access to everything we needed, plus was near enough to downtown to make a pleasant morning commute.  I would absolutely stay with them again if I came back through Seattle.
21799	1455908	10.0	9.0	10119331	The flat was vert clean, every thing was in order, enough utilities for cooking, quiet neighborhood,  Jessy always understanding and easy to be in touch with her, we really enjoyed our time in Seattle, 
21800	1455908	10.0	9.0	10167536	Our stay at Jesse's was great. A nice cozy apartment that was comfortable for the five of us. It's in a great location, close to downtown and Capitol Hill. Would definitely recommend staying here! Jesse was easy to get in touch with even whilst on holidays! Great place, great host!
21801	1455908	10.0	9.0	11189778	Very nice place in a great location. Jesse was easy to communicate with and the place was in great condition. I would stay here again when visiting Seattle.
21802	1455908	10.0	9.0	11377775	Had a wonderful stay! The location is easy to find, convenient with shopping close by, and free street parking was available for the two cars we had with us. The apartment was super clean and adequate for our group of six. Great communication from Jesse, despite his travel schedule.
21803	1455908	10.0	9.0	11571419	A beautiful home in a great location.  It's easy to get to Downtown or Capitol Hill from here, and always has easy parking. The rooms are bright and the master bed has one of the most comfortable mattresses I've slept on, even if the room got too bright in the morning to sleep in. Jesse was responsive and helpful. Definitely keeping this place to rent again.
21804	1455908	10.0	9.0	12139696	Had a wonderful stay at Jesse's. The townhouse exceeded our expectations and the wine and the card is a nice touch. Jesse promptly answered our questions via airbnb during our stay. This our first airbnb experience and we're glad Jesse made it a great one. We would highly recommend staying here.
21805	1455908	10.0	9.0	12563843	"Jesse is a caring person. 

His house is very nice, clean, beautiful, cozy, close to bus stop. 

My trip would have been perfect if I had not been very sick all the time. Luckily the hospital was close too! 

The city of Seattle is beautiful, modern, urban, organized, clean. 

I need to get back to enjoy all that I could not enjoy it. 
And for this, the Jesse's house is my first choice!"
21806	1455908	10.0	9.0	12979806	Jesse and Thuy were amazing host during our stay! Always in constant contact with them, even while they were in Vietnam! My family and I were impressed with their home and all its amenities. If me or my family/friends are visiting Seattle in the near future, we are going to want to stay here again. 
21807	1455908	10.0	9.0	13076947	"Stayed here for a girls' weekend with 3 other people, so it was the perfect amount of space. The place was clean and had plenty of bed space for all of us. Jesse was super responsive and helpful in providing information and recommendations for the area.

The only complaint I have was that it was incredibly hot the first night inside the house. I'm guessing it's because it was a warm week prior to our arrival and the heat was trapped inside the house. It was unclear if the HVAC system actually included AC or if we were supposed to use the portable fans (which I don't prefer when I sleep). By contrast, the second night was a lot more comfortable though still rather warm inside the house compard to the outside temperature.

Would not recommend to people who have trouble going up and down stairs since it's 3 stories, but I found it to be great cardio!

The place is farther from the main tourist/going outscene in Seattle, but we had rented a car, so it was perfect for our weekend."
21808	1455908	10.0	9.0	13217874	Great place! Full amenities including pillows, towels, utensils, etc. Feels like owning your own home. Love the neighborhood and its closeness to downtown and Pike's Place too! 
21809	1455908	10.0	9.0	13474637	Jesse's place was amazing. It worked out really well for our group. We were able to function without having to worry about waking our late sleeping friends due to the configuration of the floor plan. The location made it easy to get to Cap Hill and Pike Place. We are runners and it was nice to be able to get to some flat land on the eastern side of Seattle. Would totally come back and stay with Jesse.
21810	1455908	10.0	9.0	13569696	I stayed at Jesse's for 2 nights in Seattle. Jesse has a beautiful home in a very convenient and accessible location that is just a bus ride away from everywhere else. We arrived to find a bottle of wine at the dining table, it was a nice surprise. Jesse has taken great care to ensure that the place is very clean and stocked with amenities. My family of 5 had a great stay and we would definitely come back again if we were to visit Seattle again. Jesse has also been a very responsive and helpful host.
21811	1455908	10.0	9.0	18703455	The house was great, Jesse and Thuy were very welcoming and even gave us access to the mailbox for the duration of our stay. I would definitely consider staying here again!

21813	1455908	10.0	9.0	22183636	I had a great stay at Jesses house. it was beautiful & cozy. it's also a great location to everything in Seattle. Jesse is very nice and quick to reply. 
21814	1455908	10.0	9.0	22560141	"Came to Seattle for a girl's weekend and this looked like the perfect place to stay. There was two of us and this place had more than enough space! Communication with Jesse before and during the stay was awesome.  Very responsive and we were even greeted with a bottle of wine on arrival! Place was very clean, beds were soft and comfortable. Lots of towels. Great location. Less than a 10 minute drive/cab ride to downtown. We went out both Friday and Saturday nights, and didn't wait long at all for a cab. One item to note on the heating - make sure the vents are switched to ""on"" since when you get there they have them on off or low settings to conserve power. Took us awhile to figure that out, but it was all good once we did. I highly recommend staying here. It's clean, comfortable, centrally located and the hosts are great.  The place looks exactly like the pictures. "
21815	1455908	10.0	9.0	26701129	My roommates and I had a wonderful stay in Seattle, thanks to Jesse! The house was beautiful and clean, and the rooms were very comfortable. Jesse was extremely good at communicating both before and during the trip, and was very accommodating. He also left us a card and a bottle of wine to welcome us, which we thought was very sweet. The location is great and a short commute to downtown. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for accommodation in Seattle! 
21816	1455908	10.0	9.0	31796994	This is a great location.  When we arrived Jesse had thoughtfully left a card and bottle of wine to welcome us to his home.  The house was clean and comfortable with pretty much any amenity you might need.  Jesse is very responsive and even contacted me that I had accidentally left an item behind so I could easily retrieve it before leaving town.  Recommended!
21817	1455908	10.0	9.0	36385187	"The location is pretty convenient to downtown Seattle. This town-home is clean and easy to use, but not very organized. Host left a lot stuff at the place, especially in the kitchen, you can reach pretty anything you need. 

Jessie left a bottle wine and thanks note for us. He is easy and nice communicated. Highly recommended for a family!"
21818	1455908	10.0	9.0	37994636	Jesse is a good host and we enjoy our trip in Seattle!
21819	1455908	10.0	9.0	38903592	"Jesse was responsive and quick to answer any questions/problems we had. He had a welcome packet for us that was very clear with directions and notes regarding the house. 
The house was very clean and organized and had everything we needed. It was a pleasant stay. 

Thank you again Jesse!"
21820	1455908	10.0	9.0	39737099	"Jesse was excellent in communicating with me prior to my arrival, and checked up with me via email after arrival to ensure everything was ok. They left a  bottle of wine for us on  which was very nice. Place was  very comfortable and close to downtown Seattle like the listing mentioned. We have no complaints about this listing, perfect spot for 3-4 people to stay and hang out in Seattle.

Thank-you for letting us stay with you."
21821	1455908	10.0	9.0	40748560	We enjoyed our stay in this town house.  Jesse was very flexible in allowing us to drop our bags prior to check-in time so that we didn't have to leave them exposed in our car for the day.  He met us upon arrival and provided some useful info on the bus system.  It was very convenient in that the bus stop is right across the street and we could take a single bus (#27)  to downtown and within walking distance of all the attractions we wanted to visit (Pike Market, Space Needle, etc).  We also liked that we were only ~5 blocks from Leschi Park & Lake Washington, which made for a good running route.  The house had everything we needed and beds were comfy.  We would definitely stay here again.
21822	1455908	10.0	9.0	42910320	Great place! Jesse was super responsive and flexible, the apartment is clean and cozy - it was super comfortable and easy. Would definitely stay here again. 
21823	1455908	10.0	9.0	46769713	"This was a great experience and place to stay. The neighborhood is about 10 min from downtown, 15 min from Capitol Hill and 30 min from the airport. There is a Starbucks and market that is walkable from the townhome. 

There were three of us staying in the townhome and it was so spacious. We really enjoyed being there and hanging on the deck (the weather was perfect). The rooms were great, the place was extremely comfortable! It was a great home away from home. 

Thank you Jesse for allowing us to use to the place and for the bottle of wine on arrival! That was very kind! 

Thanks!"
21824	1455908	10.0	9.0	48547593	Jesse was an excellent host.  He responded to all our questions and requests promptly.  He left a welcome note with a bottle of wine for us when we arrived which was very thoughtful.  The House Rules that he emailed us were very reasonable.   The location is great - walking distance to Leschi Market and a convenient bus ride to downtown.  There is a great Ethiopian Restaurant within walking distance as well.  
21825	1455908	10.0	9.0	50371437	The house was very accurate to it's description and exactly what we needed.  We were confused with the address and went to the wrong side of the street at first but when I called Jesse he immediately answered and directed us to the correct location.  It also was a perfect shot to our event downtown where we are going for the weekend so the drive back and forth was easy. Overall, I recommend this location.  It was an easy drive to downtown, it was clean and the host was very accommodating, thoughtful and helpful!
21826	1455908	10.0	9.0	53402075	This was my first time renting with Airbnb and it was a great experience. Jesse was a wonderful host and the place was exactly what we needed. We had a fantastic time in Seattle!
22287	1351716	10.0	9.0	5724414	If you are planning a trip to Seattle I would highly recommend this private guest house. Communication, accommodation, hospitality, convenience and location were all top notch.  It made out first airbnb experience perfect.  Thank you Bill and Huong!
22288	1351716	10.0	9.0	5818289	"A quaint backyard hidden treasure; minutes from the city by bus, or a little longer by foot for the adventurous.

Bill and Huong are a warm, gracious couple, whose cottage offers a quiet retreat for a couple or small family. Lots of on street parking in this residential neighborhood, and if you revel in the aroma of freshly baked bread, this is the place for you...a bakery just around the corner.

The cottage and landscaping were still being developed, but the basic accommodations provided enough comfort for a memorable stay (7/2013). "
22289	1351716	10.0	9.0	5898956	Prompt response, very friendly, and accommodating. This is an amazing deal for what basically amounts to a one bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood. I had to do a double take the next morning, when I realized how close I was to downtown. Furniture is simple, but it had a nice firm mattress, and the place was very clean. I'd certainly stay there again. 
22290	1351716	10.0	9.0	6113740	"Came down to Seattle from Vancouver, Canada for the Capital Block Party which was 5 minute cab ride away.

Huong and Bill were very friendly and helpful during our stay.

The guest house was spacious for the amazing price. 
We were pleasantly surprised to find the fridge filled with bottle water, pop, and juices for our enjoyment. For the coffee lovers, there is a coffee maker and coffee is provided.

Just a note, the kitchen has a microwave but no stove but this didn't effect our stay as we planned to eat out. The living room is a great space to relax but there is no tv in the suite, but if you plan to stay in and watch tv while on vacation in beautiful Seattle, you are missing out on an amazing experience. 

Great bonus is there is wifi for those who need it.

Bathroom had shampoo, conditioner and body wash but no blow dryer.

Overall amazing stay. Great owners, great price and close to downtown. We do highly recommend booking here instead of at staying at an overpriced downtown hotel.

Look forward to booking the guest house again soon. "
22291	1351716	10.0	9.0	6255831	Enjoyed staying at Huong and Bill's... a very sweet little place.  Loved that it was so convenient (only 2 blocks) from public transportation... so easy to get into downtown and elsewhere.
22292	1351716	10.0	9.0	6326515	The guest house was perfect for our 2 day stay in Seattle. We drove downtown mostly, but did find the transit was easy the one time we took it. The wifi had a poor connection but Huong and Bill tried to help fix it. They were great hosts and the little home was lovely and private.
22293	1351716	10.0	9.0	6464377	Arrived on a Wednesday night, left our luggage there. Came back and found the place stocked with a few bottles of water, towels, silverware. Very nice inside, clean and relaxing. Wifi was the most important for my group and their internet was superb. Hosts were friendly and I would gladly stay with them again!
22294	1351716	10.0	9.0	6536440	We really loved this space! Getting there and in was super easy, and the place was nice and comfortable, a real joy to come back to in the evening! It was stocked with anything you need on a trip, and close enough to Downtown. We can really recommend this place a lot!
22295	1351716	10.0	9.0	6601556	Seattle is an eclectic city with a lot going on all hours of the day and night in some areas so the guest house is a great escape from the commotion. Huong and Bill have a lovely property and have made the guest space very warm and accommodating with cable, wifi, beverages and some toiletries. My girlfriend and I only stayed for about 36hours and only saw Huong and Bill upon arrival and Bill one additional time when he brought over an iron and ironing board, but they were incredibly nice and welcoming. This is a residential neighborhood but there is a bus that stops 2 blocks from the house that will take you right to all the action in less than 15 minutes. And there is a very cute cafe right in front of the bus stop. We had a very pleasant experience and appreciate the hospitality!
22296	1351716	10.0	9.0	6788433	"We really enjoyed our stay at the beautiful cottage and it instantly felt like home away from home.  
The location is just perfect, very central located, yet in a save and quiet neighborhood. 
Huong and Bill were also very nice and really made us feel welcome.
I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Seattle!"
22297	1351716	10.0	9.0	7036863	"Fantastic little cottage behind Huong and Bill's house. Lots of space to relax compared to a hotel room and a quick taxi from this quiet residential neighbourhood to the downtown core. Only saw Huong and Bill briefly during our stay but both times they were very helpful and friendly. Will definitely try to stay here again next time I visit Seattle. 

One minor note if you *need* to access wi-fi on your phone: The internet signal in the cottage is a little weak, totally fine for laptops but not good if you're relying on a cellphone or other small device to get online. "
22298	1351716	10.0	9.0	7139763	Had a wonderful time staying at Huong and BIll's place in Seattle. Next time we visit Seattle we will definitely contact them for another stay. Highly recommended!
22299	1351716	10.0	9.0	7209936	Our stay at the guest house was great. The house was nicely nestled in the back in a space that felt private and safe, and we were able to come and go without feeling at all intrusive. The little extras in the form of drinks/snacks were a pleasant surprise, and there was a good amount of space to spread out during downtime. The location is also great - things to do in Seattle are very spread out, so having a central location that's not far from anything was perfect. Huong and Bill were very responsive and lovely hosts!
22300	1351716	10.0	9.0	7257142	Bill and Huong were great hosts and the cottage was lovely.  It had everything we needed and was easily accessible from the freeway.  Would definitely stay here again!
22301	1351716	10.0	9.0	7339318	The cottage was great! It was comfortable and clean and very convenient for us. Bill was super nice and made us feel most welcome. We'd definitely come back again. 
22302	1351716	10.0	9.0	7481305	"Bill and Huong have a wonderful cottage to offer. Your own ""tiny house"" with plenty of living space nestled in their backyard. The new door lock was easy to use. Easy access from the highway and close to Downtown. There is plenty of street parking on a quiet residential street. A grocery store is about 5 blocks away. The kitchen does not have a stovetop or dishwasher, but that did not matter. We made use of the microwave and toaster. There were extras in the full size refrigerator (soda, bottled water, muffins, butter) and tableware for four. There is also a coffee maker/coffee. Personal extras in the bathroom too. The bed is comfortable and there are extra linens and towels. BIll upgraded the internet with a 2G and 5G booster for excellent quality WiFi and a TV is now available. We asked for a floor fan for the bedroom, in addition to the ceiling fan in the vaulted living room. The desk area is stocked with an array of travel magazines, Seattle maps/bus schedules and a tempting bowl of chocolate treats!  The nearest bus stop is only two blocks away. A local cafe menu on the desk was an great suggestion for take out (and it is near the bus stop). I spoke to Bill once, and he was very pleasant. This house is so close to our family in Seattle, we hope their cottage is available whenever we return. This is our fourth Airbnb rental in Seattle."
22303	1351716	10.0	9.0	8094824	My boyfriend and I had the perfect stay at this cute little guest house. It was nice and private, warm, comfortable, and inviting. There were waters and pop in the fridge to help ourselves too as well as snack bars, and mini-chocolate bars (which my boyfriend may have eaten the whole bowl of). We did not get the chance to meet Bill and Huong but had a lovely welcome note waiting on our arrival. There were plenty of towels, and we had no trouble at all with the wi-fi connection (or anything for that matter). If you're up for a good walk you can make it to Pioneer Square/Downtown, but we opted for the bus which was nearby and came very frequently. Definitely suggest this as a place to stay in Seattle. We will stay again on a return visit!
22304	1351716	10.0	9.0	8280839	The cottage is great:))It was confortable and clean.Bill is very good:)) We would like to stay here again!!!
22305	1351716	10.0	9.0	8446340	"Bill and Huong’s guest cottage in the Central District was perfect for us.  Centrally located in a quiet, culturally diverse neighbourhood, the cottage behind their home had all the space and privacy that we like.   We could come and go as we pleased.  The courtyard between the cottage and their home is populated with Japanese maple trees, which were so colourful during our October visit.  

Their location is within easy access of the bus, which is a short ride to downtown, as well as the I5, and is an easy drive from the airport.  Their home is a short walk from a convenience store, supermarket, pharmacy, Starbucks, a great café (Cheeky Café),  a funky take-out pizzeria (Humble Pie), and numerous other eateries.

Our hosts left us some welcome treats in the kitchen to get us started, including bread and English muffins from their local bakery, which has a factory outlet just a block from them--all the comforts of home and more!  Bill and Huong responded quickly to any special requests we had.  They were gracious hosts, and we recommend them and their guest cottage.
"
22306	1351716	10.0	9.0	8869516	The cottage provided by Huong and Bill was perfect for our three nights' stay in Seattle.  We had everything we needed to plan our days, figure out the transit system, have hot drinks and microwaved food.  They were the first hosts to work with my need for a fragrance free environment (after 12 tries.) I would highly recommend staying with Huong and Bill--I will certainly stay with them again for any future trips to Seattle.  
22307	1351716	10.0	9.0	10063984	This cottage is a great and comfortable place. The photos do not do justice to how warm and lovely the space is. It is bright and airy while being cozy and charming. The cottage had everything we needed and was particularly tidy and well-maintained. It was also nice to stay in a place where the furnishings (towels, linens, dishes) were very high quality. During our two week stay, Huong and Bill were friendly hosts who hit the right balance of being available and helpful but giving us privacy. We also found the location to be quite convenient and accessible.
22308	1351716	10.0	9.0	10239438	Huong and Bill are great, kind hosts and their place is conveniently located for downtown exploration.  I would definitely stay here again!
22309	1351716	10.0	9.0	10426743	"First and foremost, Houng & Bill were so great to deal with! They communicated with us several times before we arrived including the day before (welcoming us!!) and then dropped by soon after we arrived to introduce themselves in person.  They were so warm and friendly. Second, this rental is a great value!!!!  It was so reasonably priced, yet it was still a cozy place with all we needed.  While the kitchen does not have a stove (which we did not need since we ate out or at local relatives) it does have a frig, microwave &  coffee maker.  The only thing that we were a bit ""turned off"" by was the tub...it looked old and stained (which immediately conjures fears of mildew & mold), but it had clearly been cleaned and the rest of the apartment was spotless. We will be back each and every time we visit Seattle.  What a find!"
22310	1351716	10.0	9.0	10485363	"My friend and I traveled to Seattle for a quick visit, and could  not have been happier with our found accommodations.
The guest house was clean, warm and welcoming. Bill came to greet us shortly after our arrival. He was kind and offered his help, should we need it.
I highly recommend booking with these two! A lovely home away from home, and the perfect distance from the city center.
Thanks!
"
22311	1351716	10.0	9.0	10685227	Huong and Bill's guest house is absolutely charming, convenient, and comfortable. I extended a business trip over a weekend to explore Seattle, and this location was centrally located and easily accessible via Uber or public transit. Huong and Bill thoughtfully outfitted the home with nice touches like city maps and granola bars. Most importantly, the Wifi was fast and the bed was heavenly. Can't wait to stay here the next time I'm in Seattle!
22312	1351716	10.0	9.0	13132618	Thanks go Huong and Bill for taking care of my mother as she visited Seattle!  Very sweet little house - we initially missed that there wasn't a stove though, would have been nice for the longer term stay.
22313	1351716	10.0	9.0	13227109	I greatly enjoyed staying at Huong and Bill's guesthouse! It was nice to have the added space and the use of a kitchen that I wouldn't get at a hotel. The guesthouse was clean and completely ready for me when I arrived. The location is close to public transportation access, which is needed to get to downtown Seattle and there are some fun coffee shops and restaurants walking distance from the guesthouse. It felt more like a home to return to after a fun day in Seattle rather than a stuffy hotel room. Thank you for helping make my visit so much more enjoyable :) 
22314	1351716	10.0	9.0	13435872	We had a wonderful stay at Huong and Bill's place, and we highly recommend booking with them for your stay in Seattle. The guest house was quiet, immaculate, and perfectly located to all things Seattle. Huong and Bill were great communicators, and excellent hosts - they were available as we needed them, but also provided plenty of privacy during our trip. A+, 10/10, and would 100% rent from them again. Thanks, Huong and Bill!
22315	1351716	10.0	9.0	13565558	We had a great stay at Huong and Bill's cottage, it was the perfect place to relax after days out in the city and visits with family. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle. 
22316	1351716	10.0	9.0	13751585	The place was great!  Settled in behind the main house, this guest house was a nice place to stay.  It was in a nice and quiet neighborhood with friendly people.  Place was nice and had all that we needed.  The best part was the location.  The location was perfect.  Not too far from the tourist places where getting Lyft was easy as pie.  Highly, highly recommended. 
22317	1351716	10.0	9.0	14155555	"My mum and I really enjoyed staying at Huong and Bill's guest house.  Everything was nicely set up for us when we arrived and the place was very welcoming.  There were pamphlets available about things to do around Seattle; advice on nearby amenities; and information on how to get around i.e. buses and taxis.  The location was convenient to everything we had planned to see and do.
I will definitely be back!!"
22318	1351716	10.0	9.0	14233112	My husband and I had a wonderful stay in the guest cottage. It was very close to the train station where we came in from and close to the stadium. The cottage was equipped with all that we needed for our stay and very clean. We would definitely stay there again! 
22319	1351716	10.0	9.0	14356058	Very cute little guest cottage in a very peaceful and pretty neighborhood thats near a lot of delicious asian restaurants. Very awesome and clear directions/communication from Huong and Bill and they really thought of everything when it came to the house - nice little touches make you feel at home! 
22320	1351716	10.0	9.0	14736074	"WE CAME BACK! This was our second stay in this facility.  It is just perfect ... plenty of space and amenities.  The neighborhood is quiet and it Is an easy drive to just about anywhere (Downtown, Lake Washington Lake Union, Bellevue/Medina, numerous neighborhoods, parks and attractions or the Airport). The hosts are very easy to work with and they provide lots of local information for your stay. E-mail responses are quick before your stay and we have contacted Bill via text for small issues during our stay. The Guest House has always been clean and safe. Our grandson lives close and has nicknamed it ""the tiny house"".  And it is, just about like home.  We will be back, Bill and Huong. This is the third airbnb property in Seattle we have rented and the only one we have used twice. :))"
22321	1351716	10.0	9.0	15265675	"We loved staying in the guest house. Very spacious, private and clean. We were vacationing with 2 of our grown-up kids and there was plenty of room. 

Bill was very helpful. He quickly provided a tarp and blanket when we told him we planned to check out the 4th of July fireworks. It was just what we needed for the park where the lawn was a bit wet. 

It really is convenient to the major Seattle attractions and street parking in front of the house was easy to find. "
22322	1351716	10.0	9.0	15421971	"Great host and Airbnb stay! Bill and Huong gave really detailed a directions and arrival information which made getting there a breeze. Extremely flexible- Bill was able to meet us early to drop off our bags before check in so that we could start our exploration of the city. We were hoping this might be possible but we're not expecting, it was awesome it worked out. 
The space is beautiful, clean and comfortable. Nice touches like bottled water, snacks and maps made us feel looked after.
Bill was very kind and helpful in our brief interactions. Overall would recommend!"
22323	1351716	10.0	9.0	15569560	"Our experience was excellent.  The central location was a key factor in selecting this location.  We loved being part of an actual neighborhood. The neighbors were even saying hi to us by the end of our stay.  And, the fact that we had beautiful weather made our stay even more enjoyable.  The guest house was clean, comfortable and inviting.
"
22324	1351716	10.0	9.0	15829536	"Nice place. Its a charming little one bedroom guest house behind Bill and Huong's house. Surprisingly spacious for what it is. There were three of us staying and it was plenty of room.

There's a small step in the house that can come out of nowhere, but we learned after a few stubbed toes to pay attention. Heed the warning to watch your step!

The internet was a bit fickle for us, but we were on vacation and reliable high-speed wifi was not a high priority.

In getting to and from the house we most often either walked (watch out for the hills) to public transportation or took UberX. Never had any problems getting around.

Overall, we had a blast. Would stay again."
22325	1351716	10.0	9.0	15956969	Just what we were looking for.
22326	1351716	10.0	9.0	16096769	What a great experience! Huong and Bill have really set the bar high as this was my family's first Airbnb experience. It was always easy to get a hold of them, either before we booked, before our stay, and even while we were there. We loved the Little Blue House (the kids still talk about), it was perfect for our weekend stay. The neighbourhood was perfect for us, we were close to shops, markets, and even a bread factory :) You will not be disappointed staying here, and we look forward to coming back again.
22327	1351716	10.0	9.0	16683459	We had a great stay in this gorgeous little cottage. Everything that we needed was there and such an easy check in and check out process. Very easy to get downtown and there was lots of information left for us to help with our exploration of Seattle. Thanks again!
22328	1351716	10.0	9.0	17279002	This was our first experience using Airbnb.  We found Bill and Huong’s Sweet Central District Guest House to be a great alternative to spending a week in a hotel room.  It was very clean and neat and had everything we needed.  We used the guest house as a retreat to crash after our busy days touring the city and surrounding areas.  They setup a high quality air mattress in the living room for our younger son, which worked very well for us.  We felt safe and secure in the house.  Our older son lived in the city and helped us pick out a location that was close to him and still in a good neighborhood (something first time users of Airbnb should keep in mind).  Bill and Huong were very responsive to our questions and even brought us some delicious chocolate cake one night.  Thank you, Bill and Huong, for making our first visit to Seattle a very pleasant experience!
22329	1351716	10.0	9.0	17456504	The Central District Guest House was a great space. It was keyless entry, and so we had no interaction with the hosts; however, the hosts lived in the main property in front of the guest house, and so if we had had an issue (we didn't), they were nearby. The place itself was clean and plenty of room for two.  It was a little warm with no A/C, but with the windows open for a breeze and with the fan it was fine. The guest house was near the chinatown/international district, which we both enjoyed, and it was also walking distance to the Centurylink Stadium and the Amtrak station. 
22330	1351716	10.0	9.0	17564313	"Bill and Huong's place was perfect for our trip.  The cottage was clean and comfortably slept our group of 4.  We got a chance to meet Bill and the neighbours and they were all extremely friendly.  We were even welcomed with a ""go Blue Jays"" post-it note when we arrived!  I highly recommend staying at Bill and Huong's place."
22331	1351716	10.0	9.0	18022884	Huong and Bill were communicative and helpful hosts.  The apartment was private, clean, with all the basic amenities. 
22332	1351716	10.0	9.0	18245630	we had a great stay at Huong and Bill's cottage when we were in Seattle for a few days for a wedding. Everything was clean and bedroom had nice light and was comfortable. location was convenient for downtown Seattle.
22333	1351716	10.0	9.0	18662470	Bill and Huong were very welcoming and made sure that we settled in OK. We had our 11 month old baby with us and the spacious apartments gave her plenty of room to crawl around. There was a microwave to sterilise bottles. There was plenty of free parking space on the street and the neighbourhood felt safe. Their place is conveniently located for us to take the bus to/from downtown Seattle. Bill also recommended a lovely Vietnamese restaurant which we went twice!  There were plenty of useful local travel and tourists information readily available in the apartment.
22334	1351716	10.0	9.0	18874402	This was a great place to stay.  Great location which was close to the stadiums.  The guest house was very clean and had all of the essentials, with snacks too!  Bill and Huong were very easy to get in contact with and quite accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thanks!
22335	1351716	10.0	9.0	19210010	Great experience with Bill and Huong. They left everything out we needed with a clear outline of the bnb and surrounding area. Would definitely recommend.
22336	1351716	10.0	9.0	19675985	we loved the place, the neighborhood is great, AND 3 blocks from my daughter's place! we didn't see Huong and Bill, as i believe they were away. the ONLY slight problem was that there was no soap for the shower (bought a bar) and only a smidgen of coffee left- bought some too. other than that, we'd love to come back for our next visit!
22337	1351716	10.0	9.0	20376230	"Although I didn't get a chance to meet Bill and Huong, they were excellent hosts and great communicators. The cottage was just as described--it was clean, had ample closet space, and was stocked with both snacks and maps of the area, which we very much appreciated. We had no problem finding a parking spot on the street in front of the house, and the keyless entry allowed for convenient check-in/check-out. 

We also enjoyed the Central District location. The cottage is located in a quiet, safe, residential neighborhood, but it only took us 10-15 min. by car to get to Pike's Place downtown and to the Capitol Hill neighborhood (we used Uber). There were also plenty of bus maps in the house if you prefer to take public transportation--Bill and Huong were nice enough to include precise directions regarding how to get downtown and back as well!

I would definitely stay here again if I had the chance.

22338	1351716	10.0	9.0	20747138	"My husband and I stayed an entire week and absolutely loved it! Perfectly described and in a great location. Access to everything is literally minutes away and it was the right amount of space for us during our stay. 

If ever back in Seattle (sooner than later), we will be staying here again."
22339	1351716	10.0	9.0	20931103	Gorgeous place, i wanted to move in!
22340	1351716	10.0	9.0	21291224	Very clean and comfortable accommodations, all the helpful information provided by Bill and Houng was appreciated. 
22341	1351716	10.0	9.0	21715696	Met Bill who was very nice and helpful; neighborhood very quiet, no traffic, homes nice.  Best thing for us was close to a bus stop as we had no car.
22342	1351716	10.0	9.0	22075564	"A very nice, private spot. Clean, nicely appointed and convenient location.
The internet was a bit spotty, but Bill was quick to help."
22343	1351716	10.0	9.0	22293541	Bill and Huong's cottage was the perfect place to stay the weekend in Seattle. It was a cozy little place that slept my friends and I very comfortably. The location is amazing! Just a few minutes to downtown, free street parking and right off the freeway. Could not have asked for a more ideal place to stay. 
22344	1351716	10.0	9.0	22671224	"A friend and I visited Seattle (my first time) for an extended weekend.  We chose Huong and Bill's guest house for its location.  It is located on a quiet street, but close to the action of downtown and quaintness of Capitol Hill.  The guest house was spacious and had all the essentials.  The kitchen is functional but not fully equipped, so keep that in mind if you have intentions of cooking at the house to save on costs.  There was plenty of parking on the street.  

My friend has the following to say about her experience:  ""The air mattress would have been much more comfortable with a mattress pad or cover under the sheet.  Overall the place was well located and functioned well.  It was spacious and even though it was worn looking, it seemed clean.""

Upon arrival, take a look around the cottage, especially in the kitchen.... Get the lay of the land sort of speak.  There are plenty of maps in the kitchen drawers.  This would have been helpful for us (had we checked) as we did not use our cell phones without Wi-Fi connection.  Overall, it was a cozy and private guest house.  It was conveniently located and a 10-15 minute drive to tourist attractions.  Thank you Huong and Bill!"
22345	1351716	10.0	9.0	22783745	Met Bill briefly when he came to the door to make sure all was good.  Fabulous location, easy to access, user friendly host, all I needed, fabulous linens and towels, comfy couch, house more than expected/represented on site.
22346	1351716	10.0	9.0	23204767	"Visited Seattle for a Seahawks game and other tourist type things. Could not have been happier with our decision to stay with Bill and Huong.  They were extremely accommodating and flexible with check in and check out times.

The location is perfect, we were extremely surprised at how close to downtown and CenturyLink Field/Safeco Field we were, a very quick easy walk.

The cottage is much bigger and nicer than it looks on the site.  I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone they stay in this location. You cannot beat the price, location, and friendliness of Bill and Huong.

"
22347	1351716	10.0	9.0	24016589	By far the best AirBnB that I have stayed at thus far!  The Guest house was clean and up to date. Everything looked nice and new. The host was very responsive and extremely helpful and understanding. The area is good as well. A short 15 minute walk to downtown area/stadium or a $5 Uber ride. If you are debating between this location and another... pick this one! You will not be sorry.
22348	1351716	10.0	9.0	24310256	I really love the small one bed room house. Neat clean and perfect for 2 people. The location is excellent as it's near pike's and chinatown. Will definitely return! 
22349	1351716	10.0	9.0	24410796	Everything about this property was as described. Very clean and comfortable. Highly recommend to anyone looking for accommodations in this part of the city.   
22350	1351716	10.0	9.0	24565858	"The cute little house was perfect for me and my husband! It looked exactly like the pictures and was easy to find. A $9 uber ride to just about anywhere you wanna go downtown. We were in town for the Seahawks game and it was so nice to stay close, not have to worry about how were getting home. 
Everything was clean and organized and we had everything we could have needed. I would definitely stay here again!"
22351	1351716	10.0	9.0	24773387	Had a great time staying here.  It was easy to find and check in was very simple.  The place was spacious and comfortable.  Didn't get a chance to meet Huong but Bill was very friendly and made sure we were taken care of.  
22352	1351716	10.0	9.0	25360201	"the guest house was perfect! Bill and Huong are very kind.
thank you for a wonderful experience Bill and Huong!"
22353	1351716	10.0	9.0	25427324	Thanks you Huong and Bill! The location was great. Close enough into downtown but still peaceful and very safe feeling. We had plenty of space. Huong and Bill were kind and easy to communicate with. There was everything we would ever need in their guesthouse. 
22354	1351716	10.0	9.0	25606774	Great location close to downtown. Bill and Huong were very accommodating leaving the lights on for us and supplying refreshments in the fridge. The guest house was clean and had everything we needed for our 5 night stay. The neighborhood was safe, quiet and conveniently located to restaurants, freeway and downtown. The host was next door on the premises to make sure we had everything we needed. Reasonably priced.
22355	1351716	10.0	9.0	25671075	Fast communication from host.  Accommodations were exactly as described.  I thought this was a great value for one person and would be especially true for three or four.  I absolutely recommend this spot and will rebook on my next trip.
22356	1351716	10.0	9.0	25974224	Huong And Bill were wonderful hosts and everything about our trip was as promised or better. Very friendly and always asking what they could do for us, but for the most part let us be to enjoy Seattle. The area is pretty and safe and although I was initially worried about parking on the street, it was never a problem for the 6 days we stayed! We walked to the park, bus, bakery, walgreens and supermarket. The house itself was great and more than enough space for a family of 4. We asked for a vacuum so we could keep up the cleaning as we stayed but otherwise everything was there.
22357	1351716	10.0	9.0	26069617	Bill and Houng were amazing hosts! Our stay was fantastic. The little house has everything you might need and was so clean and ready to go when we arrived. This spot is centrally located and close to everything in Seattle. The house is also equipped with wifi and cable. You could stay at a hotel but you'd be waisting your money if this spot is available. I really hope we get the chance to stay with them again. 
22358	1351716	10.0	9.0	26710288	I spent a weekend in Seattle, exploring town with 3 of my friends. The location was fantastic, free street parking! and walkable distance to city, walk was bit over 35 minutes, if you are not into walking a short busride or taxi will get you there in no time. Huong and Bill are really lovely, fast responses to messages, flexible and super friendly hosts. They made us feel welcome and relaxed. The guesthouse is behind the main house and has it's own entry providing privacy, it's clean, has all the info right there, maps, magazines, and the beds were super comfi. Great little getaway almost in middle of town. 
22359	1351716	10.0	9.0	27013574	My husband and I had a wonderful time staying at Huong and Bill's adorable little cottage! They were both so kind and hospitable, made the stay very comfortable. I definitely hope to stay there again for any future trips we take to Seattle! 
22360	1351716	10.0	9.0	27351200	Yes they were great.  The location was good and everything was to our liking.  They were able to accommodate our 3rd colleague.  The space was clean and the right size for us.  
22361	1351716	10.0	9.0	28934419	I stayed in Huong & Bill's guest cottage for a month and loved it. So comfortable, exactly as pictured, and immaculate. It is in a diverse neighborhood within walking distance of downtown and also close to bus stops. I didn't meet Huong, but Bill was instantly responsive to texts, so pleasant and helpful. I would definitely return. 
22362	1351716	10.0	9.0	30905823	Near the heart of Seattle! Plenty of parking on the street. Simple, but comfortable guest house. 
22363	1351716	10.0	9.0	31989471	I had an excellent stay at Huong and Bill's cottage. The location was perfect with quick access to downtown Seattle as well as the Capitol Hill Area. The place was spacious, well kept and I highly recommend it for a nice Seattle experience. 
22364	1351716	10.0	9.0	32321723	Quiet friendly neighbourhood , clean comfortable accomodation , exactly as shown on listing. A little distant from Downtown Seattle for us , but a good service from no 14 bus which is 5  minutes walk away. Houng and Bill were lovely hosts. Peter and Eileen, from Ireland. May 2015.
22365	1351716	10.0	9.0	32629287	Huong and Bill were excellent hosts. Everything was exactly as listed and the place was lovely. I would definitely lodge with them again. Thank you both so much!
22366	1351716	10.0	9.0	32910079	Huong and Bill's guesthouse was a great place to stay in Seattle. A bit of a walk to downtown and Pike Place Market through the International District, but in a nice neighborhood and convenient enough. Plenty spacious and neat, the place was a good spot to explore the city. I only met Bill, but he was available and helpful during my stay.
22367	1351716	10.0	9.0	33616690	Bill is a very relaxed and committed host. The house was clean, the airmatrasse (second bed) was unexpected comfortable. Nearby there's a bus to the centre, that worked well for us. We had a great stay
22368	1351716	10.0	9.0	33927650	We didn't get the chance to meet our hosts, but they were super helpful and responsive when we communicated. The guesthouse was clean and made up for the four of us and it was the perfect location for us. Thanks for hosting us, Huong and Bill! 
22369	1351716	10.0	9.0	34465653	My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway to Seattle. We loved how cozy and welcome the place was, it was a great place to crash in between adventures! Also very centrally located, downtown was easily accessible with our rental car.
22370	1351716	10.0	9.0	34828473	10/10 would visit again. Bill was extremely kind, the property was comfortable and well located, and coming and going was very smooth.  It made for a great trip, thank you!
22371	1351716	10.0	9.0	35806114	Our host and the guest house were wonderful. It was clean, quite, and close to everything we needed. The space was wonderful and a perfect slice of authentic Seattle living.
22372	1351716	10.0	9.0	36000946	I had my family stay at Huong and Bill's guesthouse during their visit to Seattle. They were very accommodating and made the whole process very easy for my family and me. The guesthouse was incredibly cute and comfortable for my family's stay. 
22373	1351716	10.0	9.0	36293616	Host was very accommodating and did everything to make us feel comfortable.
22374	1351716	10.0	9.0	36533589	The listing is exactly as described. Quiet neighborhood withing walking distance to downtown and nearby shops.  The house was very clean and in great condition.  Bill introduced himself to us and was extremely friendly. They went above and beyond to make sure our stay was as perfect as possible.  Next time I travel to Seattle i will be staying there again. Great place, great area, and great hosts.  Thanks Bill and Huong!
22375	1351716	10.0	9.0	37015603	The guest house is in a very quiet neighborhood.  Bus lines are a short walk, so it's quick trip to downtown.  Plenty of on-street parking if you are driving.  The owners are friendly, but not intrusive.  I will stay there again when I am in Seattle!
22376	1351716	10.0	9.0	37318639	This was my first Airbnb so understandably I didn't know what to expect. This was an excellent experience and my friends and I are so glad we stayed here for 2 nights! Huong and Bill answered all questions I had before via email and text. The house itself is cozy, clean, and just as described. Hosts even included some little snacks, food, and water in the fridge. My friends and I instantly felt comfortable. The neighborhood is a quiet residential street with ample streetside parking. Highly recommended.
22377	1351716	10.0	9.0	37904364	Felt welcomed by Huong and Bill, we didn't really interact with them much because our schedule was filled. However they did welcome us and were quite hospitable. The place is great for the 2 nights that we stayed at in the Atlantic area. There is a bus stop in close proximity. 
22378	1351716	10.0	9.0	38124183	Huong and Bill contacted us a week before our trip and gave us all the information we needed.  The neighborhood is quiet and sweet and we managed to walk to the Cheeky Cafe (0.2 miles) for Saturday breakfast (no wait at 9-10am and yummy fry bread).  It is also located walking distance to the Seattle Bouldering Project (Climbing Gym) and that was awesome too.  Perfect location for us.  Plenty of street parking.  We didn't interact with Bill or Huong in person because there just wasn't a need, everything was great.  
22379	1351716	10.0	9.0	38636981	My daughter and I had a great time in Seattle and Huong and Bill's place met our needs perfectly. It was comfortable and they were very friendly.
22380	1351716	10.0	9.0	39384520	Very pleasant cottage located in nice residential area. Clean and functional. Just what we needed for the 4 of us
22381	1351716	10.0	9.0	40121976	It's good. It is quite neighborhood. 
22382	1351716	10.0	9.0	41231509	"We were in Seattle to locate an apartment from my daughter to pursue grad school.  The target area for our search was Capitol Hill and First Hill.  Huong and Bill's cottage was a great ""base camp"" for this search although the bus lines were a little bit of a walk to reach.  The on-street parking was very nice, particularly in this very difficult city for parking.  Bill greeted my daughter on her early arrival and made her feel at home.  The cottage was as represented and served our needs fine.  Our trip coincided with a record Seattle heat wave, but this is not the fault of our hosts.  The cottage had fans available which helped enormously. (Most of Seattle is w/o A/C)"
22383	1351716	10.0	9.0	41635987	We totally enjoyed our stay in Huong's place. It is located in a very convenient and quiet neighborhood. Would recommend to friends.
22384	1351716	10.0	9.0	42853817	My stay in Seattle was great.  The hosts made me feel very welcome with great communication, and holding my luggage for me while their previous guests checked out.  The neighborhood was charming, quiet, and safe.  I had everything I needed while staying at Huong and Bill's cottage. 
22385	1351716	10.0	9.0	43392792	Perfect location to visit Seattle!
22386	1351716	10.0	9.0	43829378	Very friendly and made it very simple to come and go. The home was very clean. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. 
22387	1351716	10.0	9.0	44190570	Huong and Bill's guest house was a perfect place for us to stay on our visit to Seattle.  The place was clean, cute, accessible, and exactly as described.  Bill checked in with me over the weekend to make sure we had everything we needed and was lovely.  I definitely recommend staying here.
22388	1351716	10.0	9.0	44494883	Huong and Bill were great hosts! The cottage was very cozy and comfortable, and there was more than enough space for 3 people. I ran into Bill as we had got into town a bit early (1:30pm instead of 2pm, check-in was at 2pm), he was very accepting of us beginning our stay half hour early, which was very generous. We didn't see Huong or Bill for the rest of our time in Seattle (2 days, 1 night), the cottage felt like ours for the stay, the complete autonomy was pleasantly comforting. They also labeled all of the switches and left instructions for entering and leaving the cottage, both details were extremely helpful. I would highly recommend staying with Bill and Huong while visiting Seattle. I look forward to booking with them during my next Seattle visit!
22389	1351716	10.0	9.0	44847046	Quiet neighborhood, lots of street parking available, very close to Bus Stops that take you downtown, and had comfortable beds. Host very friendly, provided us with any additional necessities when asked. Provide guests with many travel guides and suggestions for restaurants or attractions as well as public transportation routes.
22390	1351716	10.0	9.0	45261508	"Huong and Bill welcomed us to their cottage with clean towels, beverages in the fridge, and sheet with useful information about Seattle.

They responded quickly to all emails and texts  and made sure we had everything we needed. The cottage was clean and felt like a home.

The neighborhood felt safe. I looked up crime data in the area and there was little to no crime, which was reassuring.

I would recommend Huong and Bills cottage if you are traveling to Seattle."
22391	1351716	10.0	9.0	45609766	The whole pace was very clean and neat. My family had a great time in Seattle, being able to rest whenever we came back to the cottage house.
22392	1351716	10.0	9.0	46743659	This is the perfect place to stay if you have a car and are looking to put your bags down and go exploring in the city.  Bill and Huong provide everything you need to keep your focus on your vacation.  There was plenty of street parking right out front when we got back after 9pm and the neighborhood is quiet as can be.  Added bonus, there is a bread factory near by and the air smell amazing when you head out in the morning!  Bill and Huong were great at communicating.  Their instructions were crystal clear so we were able to pull up, get inside, get on wifi, and enjoy a few pieces of candy they put out for us without having to send them any questions.  This was the best AirBnB experience you can ask for.
22393	1351716	10.0	9.0	47389525	The listing was accurate. We never saw our hosts as we were out most of the time. Therefore, didn't see much of the neighborhood.
22394	1351716	10.0	9.0	47741056	Huong and Bill were great hosts.  Everything was exactly as pictured on the website.  Our method of transportation to and from was using Amtrak. The house was very close to the train station as well as other activities to do in the city.  They were very responsive to all questions and they have an unending supply of magazines/travel guides to help you with your travels. We were not at the house very much, but it seemed to be a very safe and quite neighborhood.  
22395	1351716	10.0	9.0	48755885	"Very nice cottage, close in to city sights and to freeway, yet quiet. Check-in easy. House was very tidy and well equipped. The cottage is truly adorable! Excellent guest information. Neighborhood diverse and changing with fair selection of eateries nearby. We requested a second bed, which our hosts set up for us and which was very comfortable. 

Despite never meeting our hosts face to face, we felt that they genuinely cared about us and wanted to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Met and exceeded our expectations!"
22396	1351716	10.0	9.0	49641238	Overall a great stay. The guesthouse was very clean and had all the amenities I needed for my stay in Seattle.  The place is close to the International District/ Chinatown Central Link light rail station which makes it easy to get to/from the airport.  Downtown is also a short bus ride away or a 30 minute walk.   I would highly recommend Huang and Bill's guesthouse if you need a place to stay close to downtown Seattle. 
22397	1351716	10.0	9.0	49947737	We received a friendly greeting from Bill and were shown the cottage.  It was very roomy and comfortable.  Quality furnishings and linens are important to me and I was pleased with everything.  The cottage was very clean and well equipped.  The neighborhood seemed very safe and quiet.  The location was just great for getting into downtown and to Century Link Field for a SeaHawks game.  My husband and I work remote and the WiFi worked well for checking in at work.  I highly recommend it.
22398	1351716	10.0	9.0	50695308	The listing description was super accurate. The place was tidy and fit our needs perfectly. The neighborhood was really nice and quiet. Our bed was pretty comfortable and we got to watch our favorite shows at night.The hosts were very responsive over text and answered our questions. Also gave us a heads up that Obama was in town, so we knew what areas in downtown to avoid. 
25116	7401671	8.0	9.0	39134928	Thanks Rebecca for welcoming us into your cozy home. It felt like being in a family home , especially with Paddington your kitty. Paddington is such a cuddler.. we wanted to adopt him :) We loved all the awesome collections and funky pictures.. If we are ever in the Eastlake area and need a place, we will definitely hit you up.. and thanks for the cat tree!! xxoo Amy and Jonny
25117	7401671	8.0	9.0	39453933	Rebecca and paddington are wonderfully gracious hosts, the little studio was perfect for one night with my closest friend. We had a great time walking around the neighborhood and watching the sunset from the lake. Very friendly neighbors, wonderful views of the lake, had a great time! Thank you!!
25118	7401671	8.0	9.0	40025004	"Rebecca was quick to respond, apologetic for our experience and kindly refunded us for our stay. She was the highlight to this experience.  
When we got there we stepped in cat throw up on the floor, no food or water in the cat bowls. The cat is ricdulously needy and will not leave you alone or stop meowing. He also scratched me when I tried to move him off of me. He is relentless and we were not able to get any rest after driving all day. I have to say this was less than ideal and I don't believe I'm exaggerating our experience.  Besides the issues with the cat keeping us up all night we were woken up twice by people coming by, I understand maybe a friend stops by early in the morning but 3am is slightly an inconvenience. Both people seemed friendly enough but on top of everything else it was very irritating. My boyfriend and I are both covered in cat hair and were exhausted for our wedding plans the next day. Also the bathroom toliet handle was broken and we found a dead mouse. This experience was less than convenient."
25119	7401671	8.0	9.0	41133834	Rebecca and Paddington were wonderful hosts! She had loads of recommendations for things to see and places to eat in Seattle. Her place was small but very comfortable, clean and decorated so nicely. Paddington woke me up a couple times at night but he was very nice and super cuddly! I will definitely try to look up Rebecca next time I am in Seattle!
25120	7401671	8.0	9.0	41657839	Had a great time and relived my youth living in this cozy funky little urban retreat.  Wish I had Rebecca's talent for DIY decorating and efficient use of space.  Super responsive, she anticipated all my questions and answered right away when new ones arose.  Easy to park the car for the week and just catch the bus to the UW or street car downtown (or uber in a pinch).  Enjoyed glorious strolls along the working waterfront every single evening - I lucked out on a string of sunny days and gorgeous sunsets.  After all that walking, I promptly refilled my calorie deficit at a value priced local eateries and splurged one night on steak and sushi in the harbor. Paddington the Cat is extra friendly - his antics were a big hit with my daughter during daily Skype calls back home.  Many thanks for the warm welcome and use of your quirky studio!
25121	7401671	8.0	9.0	42012044	Thank you for opening your space to us!  Great vibes, quiet, nice walking, love Grand Central!! Paddington was snuggly and entertaining! Thanks again! 
25122	7401671	8.0	9.0	43113493	We had a great time. Rebecca lets us know about local live music and was willing to offer any suggestions. Paddington was entertaining and loved to cuddle. 
25123	7401671	8.0	9.0	44202685	"Great little place in a great neighborhood.  Lots of cool restaurants and pubs around and nice and close to downtown.

We enjoyed hanging out with Paddington and having lots of cuddles with him!"

25127	7401671	8.0	9.0	48474796	"Rebecca was a very nice host. The appartment is in a very good neighbourhood. You can reach downtown easily by foot. The appartment has a really nice and fancy decoration but it is very very small.
Paddington... the cat...  he is adorable and likes to cuddel all the time. The problem was that he was alone the whole day, since we were sightseeing in Seattle. And so he needed a loooot of attention during the night. No problem when you don't need to sleep. He throws everything on the ground he can find, jumps all oder the place and rests on your head and everywhere,when he is finally tired. You can let him out, but he will comeback within three hours and wakes you up again with lots of ""meow"". The bed makes a lots of noise if you move and the shower is not in the best condition any more. 
But all together it is a nice place to stay and Paddington is a hell of a cat."
25128	7401671	8.0	9.0	49703481	Rebecca was a great host!  She was there when we arrived and had a lot of recommendations for while we were in Seattle.  As previously mentioned her cat, Paddington, was staying with us.  He was a really loving cat but had a lot of energy that seemed to only come out when you wanted to go to sleep.  However if you let him outside before you wanted to sleep and let him unwind he was fine.  Overall it was a great experience and we had a great weekend!
25129	7401671	8.0	9.0	49927305	"Really nice place to stay at Seattle, really close to downtown, easy access to transports, easy to park.
Rebecca is nice and available to answer any question!
We highly recommend it."
25130	7401671	8.0	9.0	50715022	If your staying in Seattle for a few days Rebecca's place is great. Easy access, easy/free parking around back, & private entrance up the back stairs. Rebecca is very easy going and gave us some good places to check out in the city.
25669	5195064	9.0	9.0	26766489	Our stay at Luyao's place was very nice. Lea was out of town, but her boyfriend was welcoming and gave us the keys. The bed was comfy and the house was clean. I'd recommend this place to someone looking for a quieter neighbourhood but still close to downtown. 
25670	5195064	9.0	9.0	27816717	We had different schedules so I only met her once but it was what we needed. My husband and I are quiet people so it was nice to have that privacy. We ran into Tao a few times and he was really sweet and left us to our privacy. The room was big and the beds were very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. 
25671	5195064	9.0	9.0	27865192	We stayed for one night at luyao's and Tao's place. The room is big and there is plenty of space to put your stuff. The bed is very comfotable! Everything was clean and tidy, we really enjoyed staying there.
25672	5195064	9.0	9.0	28401370	We had a wonderful time staying at Luyao's place. It was a wonderful neighborhood with beautiful views. A very easy ride to downtown and in walking distance to several bars and places to eat. Luyao and Tao were very friendly and the bed was super comfortable. A great place to stay! 
25673	5195064	9.0	9.0	28496644	Review done as we added a day in seperate booking
25674	5195064	9.0	9.0	28565037	"My husband and I, both in our 50's, stayed with Luyao and Tao for 3 nights. The upstairs room was very spacious and the queen bed extremely comfortable. Enormous wardrobe space, large desk and chair are also provided. We could enter and exit the home without disturbing the living area and there was kitchen items and fridge/ cupboard space allocated for guest use. The shared bathroom was adequate and even though there was another guest we had no waiting. 
We had a car so unsure about public transport but parking in the street was easy. We would recommend this lodging to Seattle visitors. 

"
25675	5195064	9.0	9.0	28799217	My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights, and it was great! The bed was very comfy and there was plenty of room. Luyao keeps a powerful hairdryer in the bathroom which made packing a little easier, and even though we shared a bathroom with other guests, it wasn't ever a problem. Stay here–it's a great value.
25676	5195064	9.0	9.0	29177265	Nice host. The bedroom was big and clean. The bed was comfortable. 
25677	5195064	9.0	9.0	29672288	Luyao and Tao have a lovely home, and were very friendly. Our room and bathroom were very clean, and they were very helpful and quick to respond to messages.
25678	5195064	9.0	9.0	29798989	I had a pleasant stay. Hosts are very welcoming and helpful. Everything is accurate in description. I recommend this place. 
25679	5195064	9.0	9.0	31050114	We stayed at Luyao and Tao's place during our 3 night stay in Seattle. They were really nice and accommodating. The room was clean and  spacious, which we really enjoyed. We were traveling up the PNW for a few days already so we wanted to do a load of laundry before we continued our trip and so they let us use their washer/dryer and detergent. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would totally recommend any other travelers to stay here if they're visiting the city. 
25680	5195064	9.0	9.0	31302521	Luyao was very friendly and helped us out where ever necessary. The room was spatious and we had everything we needed! Concerning the location in Seattle, one has to be aware of the bus timetables at the weekend.
25681	5195064	9.0	9.0	31811563	Luyao and Tao were very hospitable and welcoming. The house is situated in Magnolia and the area though situated near the city is not noisy. The room was quite big, very clean and very close to the bus stop for taking a bus to downtown Seattle. Luyao provided all the amenities (including Wifi :D).  Awesome place to stay, definitely 5 star!!
25682	5195064	9.0	9.0	33206191	"Perfect! It is a huge room with a comfy bed. 
They are really kind and helpful.
There is free parking for the car around their house and they let us lock our bikes in their little yard. 
We usually park our car and discover the cities with the bikes; the location is perfect! Nice ride across the canal to downtown. "
25683	5195064	9.0	9.0	33413477	"Very Big and clean room! You get everything you need!
You are not far from public transportation which take you downtown within 30 minutes..
A very good place to stay in Seattle !"
25684	5195064	9.0	9.0	33552078	Friendly and cute couple! The house was clean, neat, and quite. Everything was great from our experience with them. It's not far from buses and quite convenient to go downtown. 
25685	5195064	9.0	9.0	33953716	Clean, comfortable, and courteous! What more could you ask for? Great location at an even better price. I would recommend spot to anyone.
25686	5195064	9.0	9.0	34566530	The room was very clean and spacious! and Luyao was very responsive and helped us anytime we needed anything. There was a large desk in one corner with a comfortable chair. There was plenty of storage in the room as well for our luggage and other things. The bathroom was shared so the cleanliness also depends on the other guests that are sharing it at the same time. There is a hair dryer to use in the bathroom. The only discomfort we had was there was no fan (it was hotter than usual that weekend) and if you open the window at night, there is some street noise which may wake you up as it did me. 
25687	5195064	9.0	9.0	35239148	The price was very reasonable, the location was good. The room was adequate.
25688	5195064	9.0	9.0	35494896	Luyao is very timely response whenever I reach out to her. The house is in the quite neighborhood, and just 1 minute to the bus stop. The room is spacious.
25689	5195064	9.0	9.0	35822732	Luyao was a great host and very accommodating to my needs. The room was very cozy, clean, and had everything I needed. 
25690	5195064	9.0	9.0	36553250	"Luyao and her husband were great hosts! Their place is very quiet and comfortable. It was only a half block from the 33 bus stop so it was really easy getting to downtown and the other neighborhoods. This room is on a separate floor from the hosts room and the living room/kitchen. You do share the floor and the bathroom with another room they rent out but we stayed for 5 days and never even saw the other guests so it worked out really well. 
Luyao and her husband are total AirBnB pros so everything is very organized and neat. 
Would definitely stay here again!"
25691	5195064	9.0	9.0	36881990	Luyao and Tao were just very kind and friendly hosts. The room was exactly what was described and it looked even better in person. It was very clean and spacious. My girlfriend and I were very pleased with our stay and amenities that were offered by the hosts. The location of their home in our opinion was ideal. There was street parking everywhere outside of their home and it only takes one bus to get downtown. I would consider this place again if I were to come back to visit Seattle!
25692	5195064	9.0	9.0	37100713	Clean, quiet, spacious room. Neighborhood very residential with few vegetarian-friendly restaurants nearby. Hosts were very kind.
25693	5195064	9.0	9.0	37759960	Luyao I would like to say thank you very much for hosting us three days. Everything nice, quite room convenient location etc. recommend this if you come to seattle
25694	5195064	9.0	9.0	37983650	Great place, great people. Bus to downtown very close to the house. It takes about 20 -25 min to get to the center. Good Irish pub and restaurant 5 minutes walk from the house. Quiet and beautiful room, very clean shared bathroom (only with one other guest). Luyao is very nice, helpful.
25695	5195064	9.0	9.0	38604664	Normally, my friends and I stay at hostels when traveling, but we decided to give airbnb a try and chose Luyao's place. It was the best decision we made on this trip. The room was clean and tastefully decorated. Both the bed and pillows were comfortable (I especially love the soft pillow). Luyao and Tao (the hosts) were both very nice. Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive in Seattle until 1:00am, but Luyao was able to accommodate our late arrival. The location of the apartment is also ideal. The bus stops are just down the street and take you to Downtown quickly. If you want to travel and still feel like you're returning to a home after walking up and down the hills of Seattle, stay at Luyao's apartment! 
25696	5195064	9.0	9.0	38802894	The place is in a nice clean state. We had a comfortable stay at Luyao's place. Will recommend!
25697	5195064	9.0	9.0	39024639	"My boyfriend and I stayed with Luyao and her husband for two nights. Upon arrival, we were shown our accomodations upstairs. The room itself is just as pictured: a very spacious room with a large desk, several plastic drawers, and an entire closet-worth of space. The guest bathroom is shared with the other guests staying at the house. It was never a problem because our showering schedules didn't overlap and the bathroom was always kept clean. Shampoo, body wash, towels, q-tips, and floss were provided for guest usage.

We were given the key and given the freedom to enter and exit the home as we pleased (at any time). Luyao is very trusting of her guests, and her only expectation is for guests to abide by basic home etiquette. We had access to certain appliances in the kitchen downstairs-- the coffeemaker, toaster,  and water boiler, which we did have the chance to take advantage of, but was definitely nice to have. The wifi is very fast and reliable, which made evening web-surfing very enjoyable.

Both Luyao and her husband Tao are quiet individuals who are very welcoming and open to new visitors. Our contact was kept to a minimal, since we were out most of the day, but they would open the door and say hello as we returned. My boyfriend and I keep to mostly keep to ourselves, so this arrangement worked very well for both parties. 

Parking was provided on the street, and the home itself was about 20 minutes away from downtown Seattle. The nearest drugstore, gas station, and foodplace is at most 5 minutes away.

If you have a set agenda for your trip and are just looking for a very clean, comfortable, and quiet place to spend the night, I highly recommend staying here. If you're looking for a highly-interactive host-to-guest BnB experience, I would suggest searching elsewhere.  

We were very pleased with our stay, and would definitely stay again if we are back in the area."
25698	5195064	9.0	9.0	39408015	Luyao and Tao are very kind and the house is so lovely and comfortable. It looks like same as the picture and the room is very clean. It is very easy to communicate with host and they alwayse answered very kindly. I really like her place and i want to recommed to everyone :)
25699	5195064	9.0	9.0	39563799	Good central location to downtown Seattle.  Home is clean and comfortable and quiet.  Luyao helped us to find our way out of the city, provided us with use of the kitchen and helped us with any questions we had. This is an excellent choice if you are looking for a more private airbnb experience.
25700	5195064	9.0	9.0	39940016	Great stay! Everything was super organized and laid out perfect just like a hotel. I'll say it probably wasn't the best fit for our almost 2-year old, but few things are. Great place, PERFECT location!
25701	5195064	9.0	9.0	40395142	"This was my first experience with AirBnB so I hope that my review is not overly negative.

The BnB was part of a bigger house. I arrived and knocked on the door. I had booked through a women named Luyao but her husband answered the door. He was not exactly unfriendly but didn't exude warmth, despite my attempts to be chatty. He pointed me in the direction of the room and up the stairs I went. 
The room was clean, that's for sure, but rather spartan. There was a double closet full of shelving - if I wanted to stay for a couple of months, I would have had room for all of my clothes as well as a few other boxes of belongings. There was a desk with a chair and a small fan on the floor. The bed itself was ok but the pillows meant for sleeping (not the decorative ones) were pretty flat and small and there were only two. The room was upstairs and was hot. There was a small fan but it just did not kick out enough of a breeze to cool me down. I was hoping for a TV but none was in evidence. There was wifi, thank goodness, so it was a good thing that I had brought my iPad. It wasn't clear to me if I could share the family TV but that would have been uncomfortable, at least for me. 

In the write up for the BnB, they had said that shampoo and soap would be supplied for people staying short term. I went into the bathroom and the only shampoo and soap were half empty containers in the shower and a used piece of soap. It felt like I was using someone else's bathroom supplies!  

As for the B and B part - well I was welcome to use the kitchen, according to the instruction sheet, but there was nothing about breakfast being provided or food, for that matter. I didn't want to buy a loaf of bread in the morning just so I could have 2 pieces of toast! In my travels in Europe, the second B meant breakfast - I guess not in this case. 

I went back down after the shower to go for something to eat at a local pub. I made a bit of noise at the door because I knew my hosts were there but I didn't get a response. 

It was definitely a clean place to stay in a good area and a very good price. Most people who have stayed love this place, according to the reviews, so I am definitely in the minority but I felt that the hosts were a bit too shy and not in evidence and that the room itself, although large and clean, lacked the feeling of being more than just a place to sleep. "
25702	5195064	9.0	9.0	40954349	When we first arrived, the host wasn't there, but they left us the keys and stuff along with a letter that has rules and regulations on it. I really like the house. The room was clean and neat. The bathroom was very clean as well. They have prepared everything for us so it was, all in all, a wonderful experience.
25703	5195064	9.0	9.0	41947563	"Great experience, Luyao was very welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed! Great room, tons of space to put stuff and the desk is very convenient. The location is great, quick access to the city.

Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
25704	5195064	9.0	9.0	42546633	Great experience overall. The bedroom and bathroom were all pretty clean. Luyao and her husband are very nice and they provided everything for us. The only thing that bothered us a bit was the guest wifi. 
25705	5195064	9.0	9.0	42860095	Luyao's house was comfortable and quiet. The room was spacious and everything was clean and neat! However, wifi didn't work well. It takes about 30~40 min to downtown Seattle by bus. The bus usually doesn't keep the time but if you get the bus, it comes right in front of her house! If you don't like waiting for a bus for a long time and are willing to have a 10~15min walk, I would recommend you to take bus line D. Overall, it was a really nice experience to stay at her place!
25706	5195064	9.0	9.0	43935059	Luyao's home was beautiful! My friend, Natalie, and I stayed with Luyao for a week and had an amazing time. The room is clean and so, so spacious and the bed is absolutely heavenly after a day of walking around hilly Seattle. The neighborhood was a quick bus ride away from downtown (I would guess about 15 minutes, but it felt like less) and the closest bus stops are about a 5-minute walk away from Luyao's front door. We didn't interact much with our hosts (we are night owls and usually didn't wake until after everyone had left the house), but when we did they were friendly and helpful. A cabinet with glasses and kitchenware for guests to use and toiletries provided by the hosts are clearly marked. We did have to share a bathroom with other guests, but our unorthodox sleep schedule worked well in that way and it was never an issue. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable! I would definitely recommend staying here!
25707	5195064	9.0	9.0	44903093	My first Airbnb experience was great. The host was easy-going, and friendly. The bedroom was as clean as the photos look like. The bus station to downtown is 2 minutes away by walk. I would recommend it to others who would like to live near downtown Seattle, and explore Seattle.
25708	5195064	9.0	9.0	45384998	Luyao was a very friendly host and very communicative! Her home is very clean and cozy with a lot of space. The location was good but is a 5 minute walk to a bus stop, which was a good distance for our needs.
25709	5195064	9.0	9.0	45897580	"Luyao was very sweet, responded quickly, and made my stay nice and easy. I LOVED how clean and comfortable the space was. I had just arrived in town after a VERY long drive and just wanted to rest for the night. My stay was very peaceful and I was able to recharge. I would highly recommend!

P.S. The bed was SO comfortable!!"
25710	5195064	9.0	9.0	46294632	Luyao was sincerely a welcoming host.  Very helpful and kind.  Offered all the basic necessities and the stay was clean.  From the reservation to end of the stay, everything was smooth and easy.
25711	5195064	9.0	9.0	46906122	Luyao was very accommodating and provided a lot of quick and useful pre-stay communications. She allowed us to check in early, however, We never made it there until after 10pm and still had no problems getting in. The room was clean and ready to go when we arrived. I never actually got to meet Luyao but I would recommend her place if you're on Seattle for a quick stay. 
25712	5195064	9.0	9.0	47849165	We had a great stay in Seattle. Upon our late arrival, Luyao's husband awaited us and showed us around. He was very welcoming and friendly.  The room was very clean and large and fresh towels and slippers were provided. The house was very quiet and even with there being other guest staying we had absolutely no problems. Great neighbourhood and easy to find. Street parking was right outside and we didn't have any problems finding a spot. Overall great experience and we would be happy to stay here again.  
25713	5195064	9.0	9.0	48906171	"Absolutely a nice & first experience on Airbnb, as other guests said, the room is quite clean, quiet neighborhood, and nice people living around. Luyao and Rentao were both accommodating, we had pleasant talk whenever ran into each other.

Slippers, towels, shampoo and tooth paste are well prepared, you can release your luggage case if you don't mind to try something different during stay.

Parking is not a big issue, find a spot on the street beside is not a matter.

Convenient place to downtown area, restaurant, gas station and grocery store can be found nearby.

Overall, nice and comfy place to stay if u are looking for a lodging while stop by Seattle.
"
25714	5195064	9.0	9.0	49173357	Listing as described. Luyao & Tao were in constant communication on when we'd arrive so we could meet and get a tour of the house. Room/bathroom/kitchen were as described and very clean. We loved how Luyao labelled everything that was for guests to use (fridge space, cupboard space, kitchen utensils, plates, etc.). Would definitely stay here again!
25715	5195064	9.0	9.0	50318097	The place was exactly what we were looking for! Luyao created a space for her guests that was clearly delineated and extremely useful. It was private and restful. Traveling is so much easier when you have an actual home base and Luyao made her home available as our own. 
25716	5195064	9.0	9.0	52661024	My brother and I were just in Seattle one night, so this was a perfect little stop for us just to sleep and then take off the next morning. The room was nice, with a desk and a comfortable bed.
25717	5195064	9.0	9.0	53560374	Very peaceful night's sleep in this convenient and well looked after joint! I suffer from early morning insomnia and am usually awake before 5 but on this memory foam I slept until an unheard of 7! Really a great place to crash. Will be back!
25718	5195064	9.0	9.0	54722366	We had a wonderful stay! The room is very clean and plenty of space for us. The house quiet and conveniently located. We'd definitely stay again!
25719	5195064	9.0	9.0	55013496	Ms Luyao's place is described as posted. Very clean and comfortable. Host is very nice and helpful to traveler whom take time to tour the area with tip and provide reasonable accommodation for the stay. Highly recommend place to stay in Seattle. 
25720	5195064	9.0	9.0	55590379	This is a great place for 1 or 2 people who want quick access to downtown. Luyao's place is just a few minutes away from downtown Seattle (without having to take the freeway!). The room is very clean and the communal areas (bathroom and kitchen) are clearly labeled. I enjoyed their cute cat and the overall simplicity and ease of this stay. Even though there was another party staying in the second room, we didn't feel the burden of shared spaces. As a remote worker I had to work from the room all day and the wi-fi connection was great and was even able to stream the Walking Dead without issue (major plus). 
25721	5195064	9.0	9.0	56745385	Very comfortable room, but be sure to ask Luyao for the heating if it's cold out. I foolishly didn't! Luyao and her husband are charming and very accommodating.
25722	5195064	9.0	9.0	57227999	The place was as pictured but the room was larger than we expected it to be. Luyao and her husband were also very friendly and accommodating, which makes you feel really comfortable and at home. I will definitely return if I am in Seattle.
28373	4257097	10.0	9.0	43922897	Beautiful luxury apartment. Very comfortable and parking in the building is excellent.
28374	4257097	10.0	9.0	50519183	The apartment was amazing! The pictures do not do it justice. It is very rustic in decor and very clean. It is pretty much located where you want to be if you are visiting Seattle for the first time, like my friends and I were. It is a short walk to Pike Place Market and a short walk to the Space Needle. A whole foods is super close if you need some groceries. The pull out couch is very comfortable once I figured out it was a blow up lol. I would defiantly stay here again next time i decided to come back! Thank you for a great stay :) 
31849	8501705	10.0	9.0	48474369	Space was as advertised and fine for the two of us. Wifi and TV were good. Brian was a good host and a great communicator. Location is perfect if coming to town for a sporting event and you only need basic accommodations. The walls are a bit thin and the building is old with a very slow elevator. If you don't want to spend a lot this is a great option but be aware this is not five star hotel. 
31850	8501705	10.0	9.0	48660942	Brian was an outstanding host, and a proactive communicator. I ended up arriving slightly later than expected due to traffic, and he was very understanding. The place was as-advertised and clean. 
31851	8501705	10.0	9.0	48824866	We had a very good stay at Brian's! The place is exactly as described, tiny but very well located. The area is quiet and full of Asian restaurants, very close to the train station and to the train for the airport, as well as to Downtown Seattle. And the bed is so comfortable! Brian was very nice: he ensured we had a prompt access to the room and was always available for any need. Thank you Brian!
31852	8501705	10.0	9.0	50150797	Brian was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  The place is exactly as described.  Small but clean, comfortable, and in a good location.  Perfect if you are visiting without a vehicle.  A block away from train station and light rail.   Thank Brian.
31853	8501705	10.0	9.0	50353222	This place was great!. It was close, easy and convenient to get to all the seattle attractions.
31854	8501705	10.0	9.0	50733701	Brian was very easy and pleasant throughout the whole process. His communication leading up to the stay was outstanding, and he was very flexible with the check in time. He met us on site and showed us the apartment. Location is a unique location; close to stadiums, restaurants and a short walk to some of the cities sites. Finding a parking spot was also simple. He also very close to the central train station, which would be very convenient for those traveling by train or bus. 
31855	8501705	10.0	9.0	51172002	Brain's place was perfect for us! We didn't spend much time there since we had so much we wanted to do and such little time with which to do it all, but it's really close to the stadiums and a bunch of transit options, which was fantastic. The place was also well equipped with essentials, including Netflix access and we didn't find ourselves wanting for more. Would definitely rent again if available for future visits.
31856	8501705	10.0	9.0	51333086	We stayed here for one night. The space was unique and fun. It was small but had everything you needed and was  a fun city feel for two people from the country.  The  details made the stay. Brian was very flexible and easy to communicate with.
31857	8501705	10.0	9.0	51555524	Our stay with Brian was exactly what we were looking for - a place to crash for a day exploring Seattle and an early airport start the following day. The flat was easy to access and in a great location (especially if you're visiting for a game!), and we found it a great base for exploring town as well as evening drinks in the Pioneer Square Area and guaranteed late-night cheap eats in the International District. The area was a little rough at night with quite a lot of people hanging around on the streets and/or begging. So I would advise being alert, particularly if travelling alone. However, I also think this is to be expected around any transport hub/downtown in a major city. Communication with Brian was great and he was a very friendly host, leaving information guides in the flat and providing tips in person - we would definitely recommend him!
31858	8501705	10.0	9.0	51758562	"Brian was a great host. He met with the key as planned. The apartment is exactly as described, very comfortable and cozy, and perfect for my needs. I was attending a soccer game at the stadium which was a ten min walk away. There were many places to eat nearby. The neighborhood was a little sketchy walking home late at night so best to pay close attention to surroundings but that is the case in many urban neighborhoods. I was up early and was able to walk to the ""light rail"" station five mins away which took me directly to the airport in 30 mins. I would certainly stay here again in the future. Thanks, Brian!"
31859	8501705	10.0	9.0	51936046	Great little apartment, very basic and has everything you need. Lots of food nearby, and it's within walking distance to the Showbox SoDo which makes it perfect if you're coming out overnight for a concert. I'd definitely stay here again!
31860	8501705	10.0	9.0	52091979	The apartment is nice. Very easy to get around from the location. Brian is nice and very helpful.
31861	8501705	10.0	9.0	53869655	Brian was a great host and accommodated us on very short notice! The apartment was clean and comfortable, and offered a binder filled with information on local attractions. We took the Bolt Bus from Portland and it dropped us off two blocks from his home! The neighborhood was great--lots of restaurants and bars, and we walked downtown and to Capitol Hill from the location. Thanks for making our night in Seattle a great one!
31862	8501705	10.0	9.0	54073090	It was an awesome little appartment and we enjoyed the netflix.
31863	8501705	10.0	9.0	54212466	Brian was very accommodating.  I booked the apartment fairly last-minute and he was flexible about meeting up for me to get the key.  The room was very accurately described and I found it to be comfortable.  I was expecting the neighborhood to be a little dicier by his description but I found it lively and perfectly nice.
31864	8501705	10.0	9.0	54860217	Brian's little apartment was perfect for our needs and in a fun and convenient location. Check in (and out) and communication was a breeze. He had space in the fridge and in some cabinets for us, which doesn't always happen when renting someone's space. Staying in the international district was a blast, and the food was great!
31865	8501705	10.0	9.0	55461469	Had a great time in Seattle. The TINY apartment was just perfect for my husband and I.  Brian is not lying.  The place is MINI, but just right for 2 people.   Brian was very helpful with any questions I had.   Perfect location if you are coming to town for a game!  Yummy fried rice and bubble tea just steps from the door!  
31866	8501705	10.0	9.0	55608062	Perfect little flat in a great location. Perfect if you want to walk around Seattle. 
31867	8501705	10.0	9.0	57735749	Amazing. What a great guy. Our plane was delayed. Brian met us at 1am with the keys. Then the guy let us leave our stuff after the checkout time so we could tour the city!!! Great guy, perfect place for downtown. 5 minute walk to the Seahawks game
31868	8501705	10.0	9.0	57836135	Just what I needed for an overnight layover. Brian was very accommodating on check in time, the neighborhood is really unique, and if you need to head downtown it's not very far. Description was accurate: tiny place, but perfect if you're only planning to sleep there.
31869	8501705	10.0	9.0	57969851	Brian was great! He was very fast to respond to any questions and was super flexible with our arrival/departures times. The description of the apartment is accurate, it is definitely small. However, if you are looking for a warm, comfortable place to sleep at night while exploring a city, this is the perfect spot for you! 
31870	8501705	10.0	9.0	58103154	The apartment great! Just as described. Had everything we needed and Brian always responded very quickly. After we checked out, we had an emergency that required us to stay in Seattle an extra night and Brian went out of his way to allow us another night for free due to the circumstances. Incredibly generous and kind host. 
37684	3821663	9.0	9.0	18043636	The apartment was clean and close to downtown. The Wifi didn't work any time.
37685	3821663	9.0	9.0	18632337	Darcy was great, unfortunately there was a last minute complication with our room. She went above and beyond to provide an alternate room even though it meant money out of her pocket. We look forward to staying with her next time we're in Seattle!
37686	3821663	9.0	9.0	19421685	Beautiful location and perfect getaway! 
37687	3821663	9.0	9.0	20025981	Great experience. Never met Darcy but the bar staff were friendly and helpful making getting the key and access easy and smooth. The location puts you in the heart of Seattle. Stay here to truly experience Seattle. Apartment was beautiful and immaculate.  I highly recommend staying here.
37688	3821663	9.0	9.0	20593844	I was able to get a room for two night on just a few hour notice. The building was very shabby sheik with a good view of Pioneer square. This spot is very central for all of your traveling needs. Lots of great restaurants, bars, shopping, and the water front in walking distance. Everyone was friendly and very accommodating.
37689	3821663	9.0	9.0	20874982	Didn't meet Darcy but the key pick up was easy. The location was perfect!! Better than we even realized it would be! The apartment was cute and clean. It had everything we needed. Would definitley stay there again! Highly recommend it!
37690	3821663	9.0	9.0	21535484	Loved this place. We stayed for 2 nights. The apartment was SO clean. It is above two bars, so if you need total silence to sleep, don't come here on a weekend. Centrally located in a fun part of the city, lots of restaurants and bars around. The bed was nice and soft too. We really enjoyed our stay. Oh, and if you're easily freaked out, this place is in fact haunted. 
37691	3821663	9.0	9.0	21732763	Nice location up above the bar. Great apartment, much bigger than we had expected. Didn't meet Darcy, however the bar staff made us feel really comfortable when we arrived.
37692	3821663	9.0	9.0	22006582	We enjoyed our stay at the apartment.  The bed was very comfortable, the apartment was light and airy, it was easy to find and centrally located.  Darcy was able to arrange for parking, which was very helpful.  We were worried the bar below might be loud, but we couldn't hear anything and it was quiet.
37693	3821663	9.0	9.0	22466477	I would recommend staying here.  The check in process went smooth and the staff is very friendly.  It truly felt like I was apartment sitting for a good friend, everything you needed was provided. great location, walking distance everywhere. I came for a conference and I could walk to there, it was great.
37694	3821663	9.0	9.0	22651967	My husband and I had a wonderful time in Seattle at Darcy's. The location was convenient walking distance to Century Link, Pike Place and downtown shopping! There were lots of greats bars and places to eat near by as well! The only down side to this place was it is next to a nightclub and a very old building so my husband were unable to get any sleep on the Friday and Saturday night with theistic going until 2am and then the fights and drunks on the street until 4am
37695	3821663	9.0	9.0	22721878	Awesome apartment.  Everything was perfect.  Would love to stay here again.  Didn't see any ghosts :( 
37696	3821663	9.0	9.0	22907094	Darcy and the staff of the Merchant's Cafe were extremely welcoming and friendly! My boyfriend and I were able to walk to all the Seattle sights, and the location was extremely convenient to the Link Light Rail Station (for transportation to SeaTac Airport).  The place is near a club which plays loud music on weekend nights and has a loud crowd outside, I slept fine, but if you're a light sleeper it might be a problem.  The area is a little seedy at night, but I felt safe walking with my boyfriend.  Overall, the apartment is spacious and well furnished and pros definitely outweigh cons of this place!  We'd stay there again in a heartbeat.
37697	3821663	9.0	9.0	23106077	Darcy is a great, friendly host. The cafe/bar downstairs is very convenient for leaving bags or picking up keys whenever you arrive. The building is very old but the rooms have been nicely redone, keeping a lot of the original features. The location is super convenient if you plan to catch rail to SeaTac.
37698	3821663	9.0	9.0	23197063	My brother and I came to Seattle for a night to go to a Seahawks game and this location was perfect. The apartment was exactly as advertised and the whole visit was great. Parking is always an issue on gamedays, but Darcy was able to arrange a discounted parking pass across the street. 
37699	3821663	9.0	9.0	23608321	This is a beautifully appointed place above colorful Pioneer Square with high ceilings and a lot of natural light. I did not get to meet Darcy in person, but she was very responsive and helpful. No problems checking in or out. There is a bit of noise at night from nearby nightclub, but it did not bother us. Lots of restaurants nearby.
37700	3821663	9.0	9.0	23952604	"What a fun place to stay in Seattle. The apartment was adorable and kept very true to the historic charm of the building. As other reviewers have mentioned it does get noisy on the weekends as there are bars right below but we brought ear plugs and were just fine.

Thank you for a fantastic stay. 

"
37701	3821663	9.0	9.0	24126233	The location and apartment were perfect for what I was looking on my last minute trip. Great size, clean, and cozy. The bartender at Merchants Cafe & Saloon showed me to the apartment and explained any pertinent information. Being able to leave my (email hidden) was convenient. 
37702	3821663	9.0	9.0	24202477	Darcy was extremely helpful and the rooms were beautiful. We ended up staying in two of the rooms above the Merchant Cafe, and they were both great. Everything was working properly, the rooms were as depicted, and the location in Pioneer Square was close to everything we wanted to do.
37703	3821663	9.0	9.0	24413835	Darcy was great, and the fact that the apartments are run through the cafe downstairs makes it very easy to coordinate checking in and out. I loved the apartment- it was quieter than I expected for being in such a major location in Pioneer square. It was spacious and clean.
37704	3821663	9.0	9.0	24493394	Great, comfortable room right in the heart of everything. We were only there one night, but came back a couple days later to stay at another room in the building. Parking wasn't even a problem, even though we were downtown on a game day. Perfect for sightseeing. 
37705	3821663	9.0	9.0	25455531	Really really great place to stay. Clean, Central and stress free check in and out. My first air bnb experience and I'm entirely convinced. Had a great day/night in Seattle and sill definitely use again. 
37706	3821663	9.0	9.0	25547847	"I booked Darcy's apartment for my parents' visit. They stayed for 3 nights. We arrived at Merchant's Cafe, which was downstairs from the apartment, at around 8:45pm to pick up the keys per Darcy's instructions. The bartender who handed us the keys was warm and friendly. Darcy also took the time to meet us and give us a tour, which was a pleasant surprise, as it was kind of late.

We all loved the place. It looked exactly like the photos. I even told them I wanted to stay here for the next 3 days, and they could stay at my place instead. :)

The apartment building is in the heart of Pioneer Square, so it has its pluses and minuses. It's close to a lot of good restaurants. It's also within walking distance of the International District, which is awesome, as my parents love dim sum. And if you're a Seahawks fan who wants to go to a game or just be super-close to the action, look no further!

The building interior has so much character with its very old-fashioned decor. The apartment unit itself is 3 floors up, and there are no elevators. It is very spacious and really well put together. Everything my parents needed and more were provided. A fridge, a TV, a nice bed, a comfy couch, towels, extra blankets, coffee...

All in all, they really enjoyed their stay here. Thank you so much, Darcy!"
37707	3821663	9.0	9.0	25985932	The apartment was awesome! Tons of space and very high ceilings. The bartender who helped me with getting into the apartment was very friendly and helpful. 
37708	3821663	9.0	9.0	26494346	It really was a lovely place, but it was definitely a difficult sleep. Very loud area. Maybe it is just because we live in a quiet area and aren't used to booming music from a nightclub below. Bring earplugs if you want to sleep. Great location in a historic building. Clean and kept up well.
37709	3821663	9.0	9.0	26936239	We had a great first experience with airbnb and Darcy. The apt was clean, charming and very close to great things to do in Seattle. We had a great time at the Merchants Cafe next door too! The neighborhood is very noisy at night but the location made it worth it. 
37710	3821663	9.0	9.0	27387686	"We really enjoyed staying here. The pictures are an accurate depiction of the apartment. I was worried about the noise, after reading other reviews, but we bought ear plugs and it was fine. We really only heard the street noise on Friday night. The rest of the nights were pretty quiet. Monday morning is trash pick-up day, so the garbage trucks were SUPER loud in the AM. The neighborhood is up-and-coming. There are a few AWESOME restaurants and cocktails bars really close, but there is a questionable street crowd hanging around as well. It really didn't bother us (being from San Jose, we're used to the homeless crowd). 
Check out these super close places:
Damn the Weather - Cocktails & Late night food
The Pharmacy - Awesome Underground Bar 
Casco Antiguo - Mexican Food
Alstadt - Great Bar / Bar food 
You're walking distance to the water front, Pike Place Market, and Belltown area. We walked all the way to the Space Needle (40 min. walk). The apartment was clean when we arrived, the bar staff was very welcoming. Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely stay here again. "
37711	3821663	9.0	9.0	28700219	The apartment was as described, clean and comfortable! As others have mentioned, it is sometimes noisy at night. We had a great time!
37712	3821663	9.0	9.0	29443833	Listing description accurate.  Apartment matches host's presentation.  Very convenient to public transportation, air, rail and bus.  Convenient to dining, shopping, sight-seeing and stadiums.  Neighborhood residential housing consists of missions and thus many homeless people; some panhandling but not pushy.  Immediate area is very loud both day and night, expect to be sleepless in Seattle.  Overall good experience with accommodations.
37713	3821663	9.0	9.0	29777841	Fabulous apartment. Great neighborhood. Easy check-in. All in all one of my best Air BnB experiences. 
37714	3821663	9.0	9.0	30378359	I only saw my host briefly, when she was cleaning the building.   The bartender in the restaurant below was very helpful and welcoming.  It was easy to get the key.  The neighborhood was great, with a view overlooking Pioneer Square.  The area is in transition between being a little  seedy and hip.  The place was clean and spacious, although it was lacking in a place to sit down when eating and there was no place to store clothes other than a closet for hanging them.  However, Darcy brought a bar stool to make it possible to sit at the counter.  This should have been provided as a standard feature.  
37715	3821663	9.0	9.0	30665501	Check-in was easy - the bartender at the cafe where you pick up the keys was friendly. The apartment is super cute and clean.. very cozy. Love all the antique accents and exposed brick walls. Plenty of linens and towels. Having a kitchen was very convenient. Way better than a hotel! The area is convenient transportation-wise. Walking distance to a lot of touristy things, and close to a public transportation hub. As other reviews state, the only major negative was the weekend night noise. Our first night there was totally fine, but Friday & Saturday nights were very, very loud, as there is a nightclub right downstairs. Heavy bass from 11ish-2 am, yelling and bottles crashing kept both of us up until around 2:30. Definitely bring earplugs!! Otherwise, a great stay - still much preferable to a hotel. 
37716	3821663	9.0	9.0	33068722	Great location to walk everywhere (one of the few Seattle areas that is not yet gentrified....which I appreciate.)  Unit was as described; easy check in; it was great having the Merchant's Cafe below -- bartenders and staff friendly.  The unit had all the basics; however, there is no microwave or toaster, no coffee table/side table/kitchen table; no chest of drawers in the bedroom.  I loved the big windows looking out on the street scene, and the TV was the best of any airbnb I have stayed at, as it included lots of cable channels, including ROOT for local sports coverage.
37717	3821663	9.0	9.0	33503590	The apartment was fantastically decorated and up to date, with all utilities as described. We were able to check in very late with the bartender at the cafe below getting us set up despite it being after 10pm. In terms of location - the apartment is right on Pioneer Square so within staggering distance of the sports stadiums to the south and the city centre to the north, with public transport links nearby. No noise from the bar or neighbours. Good, prompt communication. 
37718	3821663	9.0	9.0	35537977	This was a great place--excellent location, just as described. :)
37719	3821663	9.0	9.0	35658672	Our flight from San Francisco to Seattle was cancelled and we were put on another, later flight.  We did not arrive until midnight.  I was in contact with Darcy about what to do with our late arrival and how to get keys even if we arrived after 2am.  She even approved an hour later check out.  The apartment is quite charming: the pictures really show the historic appeal.  We really appreciated the ceiling fans in the living room and bedroom, the great water pressure in the shower, and the comfortable bed.  The location was perfect to walk to Safeco Stadium for baseball the next day.  We will definitely think about a return visit.
37720	3821663	9.0	9.0	36203438	This was my first experience with airbnb, and I would definitely use it again. The apartment was well furnished and clean. It was clear that the building and apartment are historic. The bed and couches are comfortable. The location of this listing is AMAZING, so close to (almost) everything you want to see in Seattle. We did experience some noise from the alley below the apartment very early in the morning, but didn't have much trouble going back to sleep. The wifi was spotty.
37721	3821663	9.0	9.0	36954159	It was great to have this as our home base while we were visiting Seattle. Darcy provided everything you could need while staying there and it was nice to know Merchants cafe was just down the stairs if we needed assistance.
37722	3821663	9.0	9.0	37444227	We had a pleasant experience staying here. Location is close to public transportation (busses, farry's, and light rail all within a few blocks). Easy access to and from the airport. Area does include some homeless folks, but it's a major city. Again, it's the heart of downtown so it's louder than the suburbs are at night. Our visit was during a heat wave, and with no AC we had windows open at night.  The area nightclubs do stay open late into the night.  It was nice to have some good couches and space to spread out and relax after a long day of walking and exploring the city. We didn't use the kitchen (too many restaurants very nearby to try), but it appeared to be well stocked. 
37723	3821663	9.0	9.0	38379018	"Wonderful location. Great looking appartment. No real eating facilities since the appartment has only one stool, no chair and no table, not even coffee table. Lack of basic kitchen tools like a real pot cooking simple things like pasta. Darcy was to slow to respond to sms to be really helpful with ou question. A chance that the employee of the Café are helpful. Darcy was also mixed up with dates an reservation (she send us an email 2 days after ou arrival, askign if we did cancel !). The room was not ready when we arrived (3 pm), the maid wa feeling so bad about that she forgot wet laundry into the washing machine and the dryer. More a ""(website hidden)"" kind of place than the real Airbnb spirit. Knowing that, still a good place to stay in this wonderful city."
37724	3821663	9.0	9.0	38712213	Very clean and cozy apartment with an awesome location. Neighbourhood can be noisy. 
37725	3821663	9.0	9.0	39013827	Great location, easy walking distance to the market and metro station.  Very cute, historic apartment, all the amenities you could need...minus A/C in unexpected 90 degree weather!  But heat aside, fantastic experience and would highly recommend.
37726	3821663	9.0	9.0	39241435	My wife and I had a great stay in Darcy's apartment, #302, which had a corner/end unit living room with views as well as a kitchenette, a nice sized bath equipped with a washer and dryer, and a separate bedroom with a comfortable bed. All towels and linens were clean and nice. It's nothing too fancy but the place was a fair price in a historic location and within spitting distance to Link light rail and Amtrak. The only negative for us was the outside noise level, which was considerable at times throughout the night.
37727	3821663	9.0	9.0	39587426	It was good, the description was accurate.  The location was perfect and was close to many attractions that we wanted to see.  For my taste the bed was too soft.  When we first arrived it seemed like there was a double booking for our room, the guy checking us in gave us free drinks to keep us happy, thankfully our room was not double booked.  Good experience overall!
37728	3821663	9.0	9.0	39724937	"The location was perfect. If you are visiting Seattle without a car this is where you want to be. 1 block from the light rail station to SeaTac. Short walk to the stadiums and Pike place market.

The price was great. The room was nice and clean and the exposed brick In the 120+ y/o building was cool. 

The staff at merchants cafe were friendly and helpful.

This location is in the middle of a busy neighborhood and it will be loud at night. We were aware of this and were OK with it. If you are a light sleeper or easily annoyed by a car horn or drunken argument you have been forewarn.

The neighborhood is trendy with lots of restaurants,cafés, bars,galleries but also a neighborhood where you'll find homeless on the streets and pan handlers. Again this did not bother us. It's an issue in every city.

The only issue we had was with the WiFi not working.  We contacted Darcy and she had a staff member bring up a booster for the signal but that did not work either. She offered us a drink down stairs while we used the WiFi in the bar. While it was a very nice gesture and not having the internet in our room didn't ruin our weekend in was  disappointing.

We would stay again"
37729	3821663	9.0	9.0	40202949	We had a great stay here. The pictures and description were accurate. This is a very cool building in a great location!
37730	3821663	9.0	9.0	40455188	Fantastic location, clean and as pictured. No fuss.
37731	3821663	9.0	9.0	41591170	First time using air Bnb, could not be more pleased! Super easy check (email hidden) next door. Amazing location. Adorable little apartment. Great experience! 
37732	3821663	9.0	9.0	42038634	Everything was exactly as described and expected. Cute place in a cool location downtown. Great central location for everything in Seattle. Checking in and out was simple. Bedroom is in the back so the street noise wasn't a problem at all.
37733	3821663	9.0	9.0	43169233	I couldn't meet Darcy but other person in charge was kind and explained how to use the room well. Easy to find it with the information posted in airbnb. Location is very good to reach good tourist spot. There are good restaurants and Safeway next to this apartment so it was very convenient. Room is pretty broad compared with the price.
37734	3821663	9.0	9.0	44106474	This was our second stay at Darcy's.  The apartment is extremely comfortable and has everything you could need - washing machine and dryer very helpful.  The location is unbeatable - great bars and restaurants but being  inner city that means a bit of noise - wasn't a problem for us though.  Would happily stay again and also happy to recommend.
37735	3821663	9.0	9.0	45304038	"Before booking this apartment, allow me to share the good and the bad aspects of this rental unit.

First, the good. The apartment was a clean and tidy and pretty much as described. The bed was comfy and clean. We had no issues checking in, getting the key and felt warmly welcomed.

So far, so good.

Now, the not so good. For someone not familiar with the city of Seattle, it's hard to know prior to booking what the neighbourhood will be like. In this case, we were in for a real disappointment. Directly across the street from the second floor apartment is Pioneer Square, which at night turns into a hangout for drunks, drug addicts, and homeless people. With the sounds of fighting, bottles smashing, and yelling all night long, it becomes hard to get any sleep.

If you want somewhere peaceful to spend the night in Seattle, this is not the place. Be warned."
37736	3821663	9.0	9.0	46155801	Overall, our stay was very nice. The property was listed accurately in a historic building that had both charm and intrigue. The only hiccup that we had was upon our arrival, trying to find parking. We recommend the parking garage, not directly across the street, but one street further--used by Best Western guests. Our first parking choice (behind the building) made us honeymooners from Kansas very uncomfortable. The area, while safe, holds many of the city's homeless because of the nearby social services. It was mostly a non-issue once we figured out where to park, but we did encounter a few aggressive panhandlers in the area. The bartender downstairs was GREAT, offering some fun insight into the area. He took care of us, to the extent of moving a microwave from another unoccupied room to ours. Overall, WE RECOMMEND--the history and experience are worth some discomfort outside the building. If you're used to the city, this is a non-issue anyway.
37737	3821663	9.0	9.0	46485178	"This is the place to stay when visiting Seattle!  A beautiful apartment within walking distance to pike market, safco field, capitol hill neighborhood, EMP museum and international district. Darcy made is super easy to check in/out and quickly responded to all questions.  I'm definetaly staying here the next time i come through Seattle. Also, another bonus you're a block away from the light rail which you can take to/from the airport.

37739	3821663	9.0	9.0	47377148	"Place was quaint and good location between the stadiums and downtown tourist attractions. Neighbourhood is ""up & coming."" If didn't feel like walking, cabs were around $8-$10 to the (website hidden) staff were very friendly and helpful in Darcy's absence. Biggest complaint is the WiFi - never worked"
37740	3821663	9.0	9.0	48023112	"Awesome little apartment, great location in Pioneer Square.  Easy walk to everything downtown.  Check in/out couldn't be easier.  

One caveat- no decent overnight parking.  The area has a LOT of homeless people at night, and made me very nervous leaving our car. Darcy also warned us about many recent break-ins in the parking lot next door.  

So if you don't have a car(or can find a secured lot), I absolutely recommend the place."
37741	3821663	9.0	9.0	48136401	Good location, we like to walk so it was perfect for us. The apartment feel was very cute felt at home. The bed was extremely comfortable, we had a great sleep. We will definitely be back here when we are in Seattle again
37742	3821663	9.0	9.0	48188024	"Let me start with the positives. Darcy let me check in early and and check out late. Also, the bartender that provided me with the keys, carried my 50lb suitcase up three flights of stairs for me.  The apartment is cute and in a great location for sightseeing. I walked to Pikes Market and the Space Needle.

On the negative side, I found out when I was checking in that the building was said to be haunted.  It was even featured on a TV show.  I didn't have any ghostly encounters, but I wish I had known that prior to my reservation.

However, if that kind of thing doesn't bother you, Darcy was very accommodating and it's a great location."
37743	3821663	9.0	9.0	48540683	We had a great stay above the Merchants Cafe. We didn't get the opportunity to spend a lot of time there, too busy being out on the town, but the location and the turn of the century feel of the apartments was definitely the kind of place worth staying at again!
37744	3821663	9.0	9.0	48765011	"This was a great place and a great stay right in downtown Seattle. It's two blocks from the waterfront, across the street from some yummy eats and about half a mile from Pike Place Market. The pictures accurately show the apartment and it was as close to a hotel stay as I could get for a very reasonable price. The apartment looks just like the pictures for the listing. Linens were provided, the bed was very comfortable, WiFi worked well and there were nice amenities like a coffee maker, small fridge and stove available for use. I'd definitely stay there again -- it's a super convenient, great and safe place right in the middle of everything!   
A few things to consider (that I considered) based on others reviews of the property:
- Yes there is noise. The apartment is in downtown, on top of a bar. If you are a light sleeper, this place will not work for you. Between the folks who are leaving the bar late at night or the trash truck coming at 3 am, you will not sleep. But, if you're like me and can sleep through pretty much anything, you will be all set.
- Stairs and walking. If you have any sort of physical impairment or really large luggage, this may not be the place for you. Darcy was very explicit in saying both in the listing and in-person that it is a historical building. That means lots of stairs and no elevator. The apartment is on the top floor. It wasn't a problem for me, but may be a problem for others."
37745	3821663	9.0	9.0	49233355	The apartment itself is great. The location is (website hidden) just 1km far to the Pike Market.But there are so many homeless around the building.And my husband lost his wallet in the street .Maybe it was stolen.
37746	3821663	9.0	9.0	49652902	"Darcy actually bumped me to a different, better apartment in the same building. She gave me the option to switch, with plenty of advance notice. The location was nice, within walking distance to many bars, restaurants and local attractions. The apartment I rented was clean, well decorated and had everything I needed. 

I would strongly recommend this location as long as you're comfortable with the standard noisy nature of being in a vibrant downtown area. "
37747	3821663	9.0	9.0	50993741	Had a great experience - super easy check in/out and the place itself was clean and as described. The location is about as good as it gets in Seattle: very transit connected and walkable to most downtown locations. 
37748	3821663	9.0	9.0	51544173	This was a great apartment in the oldest part of town. The Pioneer Square neighborhood has a great feel for art and historic venues. The apartment was clean and secure. I would gladly stay here again. There is a prevalence of homelessness in the area surrounding the location. We were able to receive over 100 requests for handouts during our stay. It is unfortunate that we were unable to enjoy the park across the street from the apartment. I hope that the City of Seattle works to resolve this problem, so that Darcy can fully capitalize on the Merchant's Cafe location.
37749	3821663	9.0	9.0	51798772	"If you're looking for a place that's conveniently located to many of the popular attractions (Pike Place Market, Space Needle, etc.) and also walking distance to the Amtrak King Street Station, this would be a good choice to consider. However, I wouldn't recommend staying for more than 1-2 nights here.

In addition to what many reviewers have already mentioned about this apartment being noisy, we found this apartment to be far from a pleasant, restful stay. The wifi signal was weak and erratic. If wifi is important to you, I wouldn't recommend this apartment. 

Also, the communication with the owner was very poor. We never received any greeting or proactive communication aside from the automated message after we put down the deposit. This is very much unlike most of the Airbnbs that we've stayed at all over the country where the owners are so proactive to help and welcome their guests.

The greeting by the female bartender was (email hidden) downstairs, which is where you check-in. My wife and I found this check-in process to be a bit awkward, and the bartender that particular afternoon was not very friendly to us at all. We were the guests and we felt like we were burdening her for some reason. It was not the welcome we anticipated from Airbnb as you are usually greeted by the host -- not a bartender. We actually never saw the host during our stay. 

The only time we communicated with the host was when the toilet overflowed upon our first flush. There was no plunger anywhere to be found in the apartment. We were concerned that the single toilet would be broken for the night so we reached out to the host right away. She responded by instructing us to talk to the bartender downstairs. As a paying guest, I was expecting someone from the bar to come upstairs to help us as the toilet was actively overflowing. Eventually, someone came up with us to plunge the toilet. No Lysol or disinfectant was used. The gentleman was nice, but he basically wiped the urine with a towel to clean up the overflow. No apology or follow-up was ever given to us by the owner. 

Needless to say, we will spend a little more money next time to find a better apartment with much better service."
37750	3821663	9.0	9.0	52091327	The apartment was nice. Having a kitchen and washer/dryer was great. I've read some comments about the neighborhood but those people must have never visited a city before. Don't look like an obvious tourist, and the beggars won't approach you. It felt perfectly safe coming home at night. One issue--The apartment I received was not the one I booked, which was annoying because it put us right above the bar instead of on the third floor. 
37751	3821663	9.0	9.0	52272573	A comfortable place in the heart of old Seattle. Very conveniently located close the light rail link to SEA TAC. Perfect for me short stay. 
37752	3821663	9.0	9.0	52697759	"We never met Darcy, but it was easy to get the keys from the restaurant downstairs and the apartment was incredible. This apartment is beautiful, clean, and in a great area of town for sight-seeing and enjoying the city. 

It is a little loud at night, but that should be expected when staying in downtown Seattle. We highly recommend this apartment to anyone staying for a weekend in the area, it has a unique and historic vibe. Plus, there are a lot of great restaurants nearby and things to see. 

Thank you, Darcy! "
37753	3821663	9.0	9.0	53255052	"Great location if you're looking to do stuff downtown (it's VERY walkable to a TON of concert venues and the stadiums).  LOTs of great food and drinkin' to be had in very close proximity.  

Only drawback is it can be a bit noisy in the wee hours (mostly due to the recycling truck making rounds at 3 a.m.!) but, hey, you're in the City.  It's to be expected.

Apartment was clean and easy to access.  Be prepared to climb some stairs though.  Easy to get the key and easy to return it."
37754	3821663	9.0	9.0	53577674	"Good, comfortable, as advertised.
Great location, comfortable bed, comfortable furniture."
37755	3821663	9.0	9.0	53972414	This place is adorable. Directly across from the park it doesn't get more historic than this. Very clean! Quiet. Interesting building and location. But beware of the stairs--26 steep steps just to the second floor and we were on the third. For travelers with mobility issues the stairs really are a consideration. For travelers with good knees, it's a great choice--reasonably quiet for the location, close to public transit, great neighborhood with wonderful restaurants and watering holes. There is a popular nightclub in the building and a great old fashioned historic saloon on the first floor. We enjoyed our stay.
37756	3821663	9.0	9.0	54726248	Amazing experience. The apartment was beyond adorable and very clean. 
37757	3821663	9.0	9.0	54852905	We never met Darcy nor conferred with her directly, but her employees were pleasant when they showed us the apartment. Aside from the considerable nighttime road noise, we enjoyed our brief stay. It was very convenient to public transit and downtown Seattle sites. The bed was very comfortable, but the space (and shower walls) could have been cleaner. Generally, the feeling was more impersonal, like a hotel, than what I have come to enjoy about Airbnb stays. 
38320	6278680	10.0	9.0	35004730	"Gina's place was great and very welcoming. We spent a week there and found the place very tidy and peaceful, it felt more like a quiet little cabin in the city than an urban studio, which was very perfect. 
Gina was great at keeping in touch and made sure we had all we needed.

"
38321	6278680	10.0	9.0	35583413	Our stay at Gina's airbnb was awesome!!! A cool little set up! I will definitely stay here again if I get a chance to come back to Seattle! 
38322	6278680	10.0	9.0	36045546	My folks stayed at the home and had an excellent experience. Gina was very responsive and answered our inquiries quickly and had all the info needed to check in ready to go. The mini kitchen was simple but nicely outfitted and the treats left delicious (from the candy and salty snack foods, beverages in the fridge, coffee/tea choices to the special bakery tarts left one morning). The bed was comfortable - it had been hard to find a place with a King bed. The unit was well fixed up and comfortable to hang out in. They prefer a bit more bathroom space, especially counter space. All was clean and ready to go at check in. Thanks, Gina!
38323	6278680	10.0	9.0	38238940	Gina's Cozy West Sea studio was definitely a great place to stay.  We had a last minute booking for my mom.  Gina was super responsive and in communication to make sure the place was ready for arrival.  The studio was super comfy, lots of light, lots of privacy including outdoor seating and eating area, quiet, easy parking, easy access.  Had everything Mom needed to feel comfortable.  And the extra touches Gina provided, including a loaf of fresh baked bread, made things perfect.  Mom is already looking forward to staying again on her next visit.
38324	6278680	10.0	9.0	38662744	"Gina was an awesome host, she set the bar very high! We had a great time, not to mention a TV with channels for days!  Also, a king bed , microwave, and refrigerator ! Place was great!
"
38325	6278680	10.0	9.0	39115707	This was my first experience with airBnB and it couldn't have been more perfect. The cabin is located in a nice, quite residential area. Beautifully furnished & comfortable. It even has a little private yard! Kitchen was well stocked with necessities & even some lovely snacks! Cable TV, great wifi connection. Directions clearly laid out for both. Ample parking right next to cabin is an added bonus. Easy drive to everywhere, but away from the hustle & bustle of the city which adds to the peacefulness of the place. SO much nicer than a hotel. Gina is an A-1 hostess and stayed in constant contact so that nothing was left to chance. Not only would I not hesitate to book this cabin again, I would actually be more likely to visit Seattle knowing this charming place exists! I can't recommend this place highly enough!! 5+ Stars! ☆☆☆☆☆+ 
38326	6278680	10.0	9.0	39967770	First time using air bb and Gina's studio was perfect for a weekend getaway. From the courteous snacks of kettle corn, fresh baked baguette, and local suggestions like the junction west (email hidden)uld not have asked for a better experience. Thank you! Very quick bus ride into the city. Will surely return in the future.
38327	6278680	10.0	9.0	40795170	This place was exactly as pictured and comfortably furnished!  Very snug and quiet location.  The kitchen is very well equipped and everything was so clean!!  Gina was a great host!  
38328	6278680	10.0	9.0	42539025	Very Clean and Comfortable studio.  Gina was welcoming and accessible.  I stayed at the studio for two weeks and enjoyed the privacy of the little yard, the parking, but most of all the bed.  I think the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  I highly recommend this retreat.
38329	6278680	10.0	9.0	43129470	The studio was everything we expected and more--- everything so well done and good quality.  Bed was super and we loved how quiet the area was.  Wonderful extra touches, snacks, creamer in the fridge, coffee and tea choices and the BEST bread---.  This was very convenient for us as there are limited places to stay in West Seattle.  We would stay here again.
38330	6278680	10.0	9.0	43791704	The apartment was great! We had 3 wonderful days in SEA and it was so nice to come home to Ginas apartment. It was very clean and nice, Gina provides the kitchen with coffee and tea. Thank you again - Andreas and Fabian
39340	6436772	8.0	9.0	35957696	Very nice house in a very nice neighborhood.   Everything was easy.
39341	6436772	8.0	9.0	37674223	"The house was incredible and absolutely perfect for our family!  We really liked the layout of the house and the separation between the living area and the rooms of the house. The neighborhood was awesome!  Very family friendly and quiet. Great bars, eateries, shops etc.. close by.  And of course the beach! Minutes from Alki, which we enjoyed several times.  
 Their communication with us during our stay was A+. Fast, attentive and effective.  
We were very happy with the house and the surroundings. Thanks!"
39536	3061918	10.0	9.0	13386373	"Having made last minute changes in our travel plans, Scott was eager to accommodate our needs. With prior approval, he even allowed our small dog to accompany us. His house is located within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and Rapid Transit to downtown Seattle. We had our own entrance which was easily accessible. 

Scott greeted us at the prearranged time and gave us a tour and the key to his home. The bedroom was located in the finished basement with an adjacent sitting room equipped with large flat screen tv for our use.  

Even though we left early each morning and returned in the evening we felt we could have easily spent more time relaxing in Scott's home. "
39537	3061918	10.0	9.0	14104737	I must my stay with Scott  was awesome! A truly gracious host, and a really laid back and cool guy to hangout with. He's got a really cute house in west Seattle that's about ten minutes from the main drag of bars and restaurants. Great location!  He's very knowledgable about Seattle and can direct you anywhere you'd like to go. The room downstairs was super private and spacious. It was actually a living room and a bedroom with a separate entrance that made it see like a separate apartment unit. Very private! The house was super clean and cozy, and with a cool host like Scott it's a no brainer to stay there when in west Seattle!
39538	3061918	10.0	9.0	14645140	"Scott was very accommodating. His house was very clean and well-organized. He was welcoming and concerned for my comfort. He asked if all was OK or if he needed to provide anything. When I asked for something, he quickly got what I needed.
Neighborhood is nice. One block away is a marvelous view of Mt. Rainier!"
39539	3061918	10.0	9.0	15158139	"This was a great spot in an excellent neighbourhood as a base to explore a little of what Seattle has to offer. 
Good locale for access to transport, shops & restaurants a short walk away.
Scott was a great host giving of his time, without intruding on our privacy. 
Easy place to stay & would recommend it to others.
"
39540	3061918	10.0	9.0	16121173	"My stay at Scott's ""classic tudor"" was a great Airbnb experience. Scott is a fantastic host and very welcoming. The room i stayed in was very clean, well furnished with a comfy bed, TV and Wi-Fi access. All in all, pretty awesome experience. Would definitely recommend."
39541	3061918	10.0	9.0	16322666	"Scott was an excellent host!  He was a maintaining a perfect balance between making sure we have everything what needed and respecting our privacy.

Neighbourhood is really quiet and easily accessible by a public transportation - West Seattle is really worth exporing.

The bedroom we've stayed in was tidy and had a comfortable bed.  There was also a separate, spacious room with TV+cable+Xbox combo.

I would definitely recommend staying with Scott if you get a chance."
39542	3061918	10.0	9.0	16636499	Scott was a wonderful host, his house was clean and tidy and located in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to downtown. He gave us some great suggestions of things to do and places to eat in both West and Downtown Seattle. We would suggest using the water taxi from West Seattle, its easy and within walking distance of Scott's place and provides a nice view of the city and surrounding areas. We felt very welcome in his house and would definitely recommend Scott to anyone using Airbnb in Seattle. 
39543	3061918	10.0	9.0	16869925	Scott was a very friendly and helpful host. He had maps and guidebooks of the area, and were very knowledgable about the national parks and bars/restaurants around Seattle. The room were cool and separated from the rest of the house, as it is located in the basement. The location is in WestSeattle, which requires you to take a water-taxi or a bus into town. This will take you about 30 min from the door. We had everything we needed and found the stay with Scott to be really nice! 
39544	3061918	10.0	9.0	17075324	This was really a first rate experience.  You get the whole bottom floor (a bedroom and living room area) to yourself and everything felt new and immaculately clean.  Scott was extremely friendly and helpful.
39545	3061918	10.0	9.0	17709806	Scott was a great host. I definitely felt welcome there. He made accommodations for my bikes as well as took me out a couple times to show me around the city.  I felt like i was visiting an old friend. Would definitely recommend him to any guest.
39546	3061918	10.0	9.0	30799059	Scott was very welcoming when I arrived.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and with very comfortable accomidations.   If I had any questions or issues, Scott was helpful in resolving them.  Thanks again Scott!
39547	3061918	10.0	9.0	32609227	"Scott  was a great host. Extremely welcoming and friendly. The apartment is nice and clean. He help me a lot (and still helping) with my pre-admission UW 
I highly recommend it and recommend to others!
Thank you Scott"
39548	3061918	10.0	9.0	32928218	Classic Tudor in West Seattle hosted by Scott was an excellent location to stay for seeing Seattle. It's in a very quiet, safe neighborhood with all the charm of local Seattle just a few blocks from Puget Sound. It is within walking distance of several restaurants and coffee shops on the California Avenue business corridor as well as Fauntleroy, Avalon and Harbor Avenue-that leads out to Alki beach. By car it is a few minutes from the West Seattle bridge towards the rest of the planet.  There is a public library down the street.  Great Wi-Fi and television in the private downstairs space with its own entrance. The host shares the upstairs bathroom and provides towels and soap at the time of this review; also shares his refrigerator, and makes great coffee for you in the morning.  He's working on the finishing touches of your own private full bathroom in the down stairs area and it is impressive. The bed was very comfortable and the space was welcoming- very easy. The host is very mechanically and IT inclined, a peddle bike and motorcycle enthusiast. He knows a lot about the area and is very helpful about all things Seattle. I  highly recommend.
39549	3061918	10.0	9.0	34587579	Scott was the perfect host- he was friendly, helpful, and made time for us. He also lent us bicycles to wander around West Seattle with! Scott had great suggestions for restaurants, watering holes, and activities. The house was peaceful, clean, and very well appointed.  If you want a really 'local' experience of Seattle, this is the place to stay-- we wouldn't want to go anywhere else!
39550	3061918	10.0	9.0	38233716	We can see why Scott is a super host. He is outgoing, friendly, kind and accommodating. The space was exactly as advertised and the completely remodeled bathroom was a plus with its fantastic shower. The backyard is a comfortable place to hang out around a fire pit under a gorgeous tree. We would definitely stay here again. The West Seattle neighborhood is a gem and Scott's home is a jewel.
39551	3061918	10.0	9.0	40765575	"Scott was incredibly hospitable to both my dog Martin and I, making any number of accommodations for us and going above and beyond to make this a memorable stay at a truly AWESOME place. A few of countless examples: He put a paving stone with a water bowl that he bought outside the back door for Martin and took him for regular walks. He gave me more West Seattle recommendations and kale from his garden than I knew what to do with. 
Scott's house has just been renovated (mostly by the man himself); the lower level (guests' quarters) has got to be one of the freshest pads in the city and is stocked with great reading material, tech gadgets, etc. The kitchen is equally well-stocked and the whole house and neighborhood itself are indeed quiet, clean, and couldn't be more conveniently-situated. 
The fusion of Scott's amicable personality, his constant efforts to be a caring, courteous host, and the breadth and depth of interests and experiences that fill his active life all mean one thing: if I had one recommendation for a place to stay in a city I know and love (but not like Scott does), I wouldn't stay anywhere else!"
39552	3061918	10.0	9.0	41803936	Scott is a nice host. And the house is really nice. I have a perfect experience these days.
39553	3061918	10.0	9.0	44317053	This was a most welcoming nearly two week stay. With its location in a lovely neighborhood, with a sweet bedroom, an excellent well-working and lovely bathroom and a well-equipped sitting / work space with more electronics than we were up to, with easy street parking and a short walk to both the Junction and to the Admiral district, the space was outstanding. Scott was / is the other half of this excellence; friendly, interested and welcoming but also sensitive to our needing to get a certain amount of work done during the stay, Scott was a terrific host. While we wish we could have visited more and perhaps shared a meal, we were certainly grateful for guidance around and suggestions about West Seattle. We would return in a heartbeat. 
39554	3061918	10.0	9.0	45876687	Scott was an excellent host and his spot is a great little place to stay when visiting Seattle.
39555	3061918	10.0	9.0	54243253	We just returned from a great 6 day trip to Seattle and Scott's comfortable retreat. We had the entire basement, with a private outside entrance. The gorgeous bathroom had a shower my husband still raves about. Scott is a friendly, knowledgeable and very gracious host. His Seattle coffee was a treat every morning. This is a very charming home. The downstairs bedroom has a twin size trundle bed, which pulls out to another twin bed. The family room has a comfortable futon. The location is a short walk to West Seattle shops. You will be happy you stayed here!
39967	6403104	10.0	9.0	34878962	Great accommodations;  better than home.  Host was very kind and generous.  Thank you Liz! 
39968	6403104	10.0	9.0	49020273	Elizabeth and her family were very welcoming. We felt like we were getting more and more attached to them as the days went on. This was the best home for us to stay in for the amount of time we needed. The room was big and clean along with the bathroom that we had as our own space within the house. Liz and her family are very accommodating and love to make their home as comfortable as possible. We loved staying here and we would recommend anyone to stay here as well. 
39969	6403104	10.0	9.0	53071707	Simply the best. This place is unbelievable! The hospitality is off the charts. The host family is so welcoming and caring. If you are outgoing and love family this is the place to be. Period!
40757	7459637	9.0	9.0	41833066	We had a bit of trouble getting in the house and no one answered the number we were given. Once we were finally in, though, the house was comfortable and ready for us. We didn't realize it was a 3 story townhouse so we had to do some exploring to find things. Maybe because of the acoustics in the townhouse complex we woke up more than once convinced that someone was in the house. It sounded exactly like someone walked up the stairs and was opening doors in the hallway. It was very creepy. All in all, though, it was a good price for one night. 
40758	7459637	9.0	9.0	42922239	My boyfriend and I travelled from Vancouver to Seattle for a few nights and we absolutely LOVED Kristina's house. Very very clean, safe feeling, and has that comfortable homey feeling..something that is important to feel when you're away from home. Beautiful kitchen and family room - very spacious. The bedroom was comfortable and cozy.  The house was in a perfect area with lots of parking directly infront and lots of restaurants/coffee shops/Convenient stores around within walking distance. It Was a quick Uber ride to downtown ( about 10-15 minutes (12-15$ roughly) very close to all the essentials. Kristina and Colin were very accommodating and asked (multiple times) if there was anything they could do to improve our stay. Upon arrival, there were some delicious breakfast items left on the counter for us -very thoughtful.  They answered any messages promptly even though they were also on vacation.  Very pleasant to talk with. I Would recommend this home to ANYONE interested in staying in Seattle and we will hopefully be back one day. Wouldn't change one thing about our stay. Thank you Kristina!
40759	7459637	9.0	9.0	44033241	"This home is very relaxing and comfortable, and the hosts will make you feel right at home. Kristina and Colin made sure we had all the information we needed prior to our arrival and that we knew how to contact them should we need anything else. But we didn't need anything as they made check-in and our stay really easy.
The town home itself has a cozy, comfy interior with a nice kitchen and spacious living room. And it's located right near some really amazing restaurants and shops. 
Kristina and Colin really make you feel welcome. Among the particulars were breakfast snacks, clean towels, soft bedding, as well as coffee, coffee filters and a coffee pot (which is really important to me since I was departing before the coffee shops opened).
Overall an exceptional experience with outstanding hosts. Highly recommended. (I did not get a chance to use the public transit from here, but it looked like you could get on a quick bus ride just about anywhere, including downtown Seattle)."

We landed in Seattle a few hours earlier than our check in time, but Kristina graciously allowed us to come by the house to drop our suitcases off, which we greatly appreciated. Their home was just as they had described it and they had created a folder with very helpful information about the home, transportation, and different things to do in Seattle. They had breakfast goodies for us on the counter and coffee was provided as well, which was great!! 

The check in/ check out process was a breeze and we had an amazing stay in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying at their place if you are coming to the area. It is a short drive (~15mins) to Downtown and there is even a bus stop super close to their home. This was the first time I had ever used Airbnb and it was an amazing first experience. Thank you Kristina and Colin!

41212	6438013	10.0	9.0	56417336	Larry is a great host. The loft is beautiful, lots of space, natural light, extremely clean and very comfortable bed with lots of pillows. There is plenty of water bottles in the fridge & candy/snacks, I was thankful for that :) Communication was great, Larry responded quickly to any questions or help I needed. He was also nice enough to let me check in early and leave late. Everything is as described and went smooth, Thank you so much Larry. I would stay here anytime and would recommend this listing to anyone.!  
41213	6438013	10.0	9.0	57610837	"Larry was great to deal with for this property! So glad we decided to stay at the loft and will recommend to friends and family. The loft was just as pictured, king size bed, small but completwly functional kitchen, 3/4 bath, and work/office area in room. On site amenities were nice too, not that we used them much due to weather and 1 night stay. Nice location with walking distance to Whole Foods, a Wells Fargo bank, and just across the street from a distillery and sampling room. The location made it an easy drive to enjoy downtown and the Seattle center while not staying in a typical touristy area of town. Plus the building we were in was quiet so it made things that much more enjoyable. 
In short, we enjoyed our stay and look forward to making another reservation when we travel to Seattle again. Thanks Larry!"
41214	6438013	10.0	9.0	58215149	Larry was great! Very helpful and friendly. Our stay was great. The location was perfect close to everything and the building felt secure and comfortable. Highly recommended 
41221	6780615	10.0	9.0	38218266	Pleasant stay in Andrea's place.  Everything appeared to be brand new and was absolutely as described.   Neighborhood and area convenient to both downtown and Magnolia village.  Plenty of on street parking.
41222	6780615	10.0	9.0	38760484	Andrea's apartment in Magnolia is immaculate and inviting.  It had all the comforts of home, and she was a charming, gracious host.  We never parked more than 20 steps from the front door.  Hulu and Netflix are available on her newer Samsung flat screen TV, although no cable/local broadcast stations are.  Ask her to tell you about her time living with her family on a boat in the Puget Sound.  When her daughter practiced the cello, orcas followed the boat.  Interesting woman.
41223	6780615	10.0	9.0	43287092	"Thanks for the great apartment.  We had an awesome time in Seattle and this was the perfect location to start all our adventures.   Parking was easy and very close.  The next time we are in Seattle we will make sure to check in with you first to see if it is available.  
Thanks again"
41224	6780615	10.0	9.0	44026547	The apartment was lovely!  Would definitely stay there again!
41225	6780615	10.0	9.0	44709810	Great place and great host, Andrea was very attentive in checking if everything was okay. Place was very clean and nice looking, Andrea also makes it a point to completely replace the pillows for every guest so you are sure its super clean.
41226	6780615	10.0	9.0	49616022	The apartment was just as described, a lovely clean modern space in a peaceful area, with easy street parking. There had obviously been a lot of thought put into exactly what guests would need, even down to the last kitchen utensil and we really appreciated how easy that made everything. Andrea was responsive and super helpful too. We enjoyed the Netflix a little too much and now really miss it! Would recommend heartily. 
41227	6780615	10.0	9.0	50994695	I rented Andrea's place for my parents who were visiting from Minnesota.  We live in Magnolia, so it was very convenient for us to have them staying in the neighborhood.  The apartment was modern, clean and fully equipped with everything a traveler could need.  Andrea was not there to greet us, which was completely fine with us.  She was very responsive to emails/texts and thorough in her welcoming information.  Will definitely use Andrea's place again when others may visit!!  Thanks, Andrea.
41228	6780615	10.0	9.0	51563654	We absolutely LOVED Andrea's place! It was like our home away from home. We almost felt like we lived there just because it was so comfortable. By the 2nd day, it felt like we had been there for 5 days! Parking! What can I say? FREE! That was an absolute plus! Saved us so much money compared to if we were to have stayed at a hotel. The yen location was about 15-20 min drive to most of the places we wanted to go to. It was nice to not stay in the the city where it's so busy. The next time we come back to Seattle, we will definitely be staying here again!
41229	6780615	10.0	9.0	54994209	"We had a wonderful few days at Andrea's apartment in Magnolia. We were visiting family who live nearby, so the location was perfect for us. Andrea provided everything we needed, and prepared us for arrival perfectly.
"
41230	6780615	10.0	9.0	57264878	"Andrea was wonderful!

We had a small mixup of information when we first arrived at her place. However, Andrea couldn't have been more helpful! I would absolutely stay at her place again. After Andrea settled our initial mixup my girlfriend and I got right to feeling at home. Her place is very pretty and is easy to feel at home. It also has a really cool view and a bus stop just steps away :) 

Thanks Andrea! "
41913	7247518	10.0	9.0	38785054	"Angie was an absolute dream. A wonderful host and a warm, welcoming person all around. Her home was just that, it felt like home. Very cute. Nicely decorated, and clean, it made us feel like we actually lived there for the time we stayed. It was easy to Uber in and out of downtown from the place and was in a super nice, safe, quite neighborhood. I would certainly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an affordable and spacious place to stay during a trip to Seattle. It was a big part of me falling in love with the city! I'll be back soon! 
Thanks Angie "
41914	7247518	10.0	9.0	40513721	Great place and very comfy. A little further than I initially wanted to be from downtown but it was perfect.
41915	7247518	10.0	9.0	42164527	Angie's place was beautiful, spacious and very homey. Had to go to Seattle for an interview and really enjoyed staying here. Close to the city and a very quite and friendly neighborhood. I will definitely be back again :)
41916	7247518	10.0	9.0	46420463	The house was excellent.  Exactly as described.  The livingroom and bedroom were large and very comfortable.  The house is in a nice neighborhood and a quick drive to downtown (on the weekend.  I did not try during a workday.)  Few minor inconveniences for me: noisy refrigerator, shower head is for small people.  Overall, excellent.  I would stay here again.
42573	6166307	10.0	9.0	32198529	"First thought that came to my mind when I walked in to the apartment was, ""Wow, this place is gorgeous!"" It was exactly as described and shown in the pictures, very clean, modern, and comfortable. The TV was amazing...I used the Roku to watch Hulu as well as HBO Go while relaxing in bed at night. The bed is so comfortable...the sheets were soft and the comforter had a nice weight and feel to it. The apartment is filled with light thanks to the huge windows that were almost floor to ceiling while at the same time providing a lot of privacy. The curtains blacked out the bedroom light nicely so I could easily sleep in. This place came with all the amenities one would want or need: washer/dryer, dishwasher, tv with roku and HBO, keyless entry system. I absolutely loved the Greenwood neighborhood, often waking to Greenwood Ave and to the Phinney Ridge neighborhood where I found amazing local bookstores, restaurants, reflexology, vintage shops, and a library. Lastly, the owners were so nice, checking in with me via text and always were available if there was anything I needed. I can't say enough positive things about this place...I loved it! Perfect Airbnb experience. I use Airbnb everywhere I travel, and this place is in my top favorite places to stay now. I felt very at home here and wish I could stay for a longer time, but would love to stay here again in the future! :) "
42574	6166307	10.0	9.0	32725430	If you want to get up fresh in the morning with the sunlight, this is the place for you. The modern home is bright with natural light and is well stocked for your every need. What's even better is that there is convenient parking in the safe neighborhood close to the city! Bernard is a very kind and welcoming host and always makes himself available for you. It was a wonderful experience for us, and we'll definitely return when we visit Seattle. 
42575	6166307	10.0	9.0	33300908	The space was awesome! It was very clean, comfortable, and airy. Natural light flooded the apartment through huge windows, all day. I felt very much at home. The bathroom was spacious and sleek. Having access to Roku was a plus, we mainly used pandora to just stream background tunes. The neighborhood was quiet and very walkable. I would definitely love to stay here again!
42576	6166307	10.0	9.0	34651295	Such a fantastic stay! Bernie and Stef were nothing but hospitiable and friendly. The apartment is nice and cozy, with just what I needed and some cool shops just around the corner. I would come back in a heartbeat 
42577	6166307	10.0	9.0	35308324	What a great place to stay! The apartment was clean and relaxing, a great place to return to after being in the city all day. The apartment is close to two of the RapidRide routes that run to the northern neighborhoods and provided great, quick access to most of the city. Both Bernard and Stefanie were very warm and welcoming and willing to point out great local spots. Next time I'm in town I will definitely be booking the apartment again.
42578	6166307	10.0	9.0	35667441	With the great pictures and description of the apartment, we were pleased that the space was even better than we expected. Our hosts seemed to think of everything--tea, coffee, nightlights, Internet access, and privacy.  They checked to see if we needed anything and responded immediately.  This was our first airbnb experience, and we'd like to take advance of our host's hospitality again. We totally enjoyed being close to Golden Gardens Park and the coffee houses and fun places to eat on Greenwood Avenue.
42579	6166307	10.0	9.0	38132818	This was a wonderful apartment and was exactly as described in the listing.  It was beautiful and sleek.  Concrete floors, well appointed countertops and subway tiling in the bathroom.  We stayed with 2 adults and 2 toddlers which is the max number of people I would recommend staying in the space.  The couch folded out into a queen size bed which our daughters slept on comfortably every night.  Bernie and his wife Stef were wonderful and friendly hosts who helped accommodate our needs.   And Stef was a wonderful and talented masseuse as well.  That is also highly recommended.  The location was within 15 min drive of most everywhere in Seattle.  Anytime we visit Seattle, we will come back to this listing.
42580	6166307	10.0	9.0	38524783	Bernard was a great host and gave us great ideas on the best places to bike and his favorite restaurants in the area. The neighborhood was in a very convenient location with easy access to the surrounding neighborhoods. Bernard thought of everything one would need in the apartment right down to the french press. We would definitely recommend this space and hope to return soon.  
42581	6166307	10.0	9.0	41632334	"Bernard's place was fantastic!  Right away we felt welcome, with snacks, filtered water, and a clean private space.  The bed was comfortable and the fold out couch was very convenient.  The area is close to Ballard and within walking distance of coffee shops, grocery stores and restaurants, while still being far enough away to be quiet.

Highly recommended and I'd stay here again if I'm in the area."
42582	6166307	10.0	9.0	42120834	The listing/pictures are very accurate. This space is sleek and modern and very comfortable. We spent two nights here after our wedding and it was exactly the quiet/peaceful place we were hoping for. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.
42583	6166307	10.0	9.0	43496213	"We had a fantastic time staying in Seattle.  The apartment is great.  Slept two adults and a kid comfortably and easily could have fit another on the pull out couch.  All super new and modern.  Ping pong table out back was a hit.   I only wish I had had time to get a massage!  

Being slightly out of Seattle center was nice and we got to see some other neighborhoods, but super easy to get to town and back.  

I would highly recommend staying here on your next visit and we will definitely return."
42584	6166307	10.0	9.0	44064516	"We reserved this place at the last minute due to change in travel plans.  Bernie responded within minutes and stayed in communication during our visit.  

The apartment was brand new, clean and decorated with style.  Everything worked.  We appreciated that it was roomy because we have a very active toddler.

The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood.  It's not hip and trendy like Ballard, Green Lake or Fremont, but is conveniently located so all of the places mentioned above are within a short drive.  There is a big park with a playground and a very nice independent toy store ( ""Too Ten Toys) within walking distance.  My husband enjoyed checking out the craft beer store (over 1000 kinds!) steps away from the place. 


"
42585	6166307	10.0	9.0	45265178	"This apartment was everything it was stated as being.  Clean, stylish, new and with easy access.  All the modern amenities you would expect with a super comfortable bed.  

The host communicated frequently and made sure I was comfortable.  

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking at staying in this neighborhood.  The fact that it is 4 blocks away from Chuck's Hop Shop seals the deal.  "
42586	6166307	10.0	9.0	45537425	Bernard was delightful in making us feel welcome. His place is immaculate and well appointed. Very comfortable. A lot of attention to detail. I hope to stay again when I visit Seattle next. 
42587	6166307	10.0	9.0	47836535	Welcoming and cheerful apartment.  Everything we needed for a great stay.
42588	6166307	10.0	9.0	48469701	Description says it: modern, green, sleek -- a stylish, clean and well-appointed base for a Seattle visit. Two friends had plenty of room for a 3-night stay, with both the bed and the pull-out sofa comfortable. Lovely, quiet neighborhood, walking distance to tasty coffee/breakfast. Furnishings: plenty of clean, high-quality linens; all you need in the kitchen; and even robes hanging in the bath. Tech perks: wifi, laptop, plus Netflix & Amazon on great TV. Hosts had the lights on for our late arrival, and they even included helpful guidelines to help comply with Seattle's green trash policies! Easy to connect with for entry and during stay. We're definitely recommending to others. Thanks so much! 
42589	6166307	10.0	9.0	49855008	"Bernie and Stef's place was just as clean and beautiful as shown on the site.  They were able to accommodate us last min.  Stef greeted us upon arrival and we met Bernie on a later day.  Both very sweet and answered our texts promptly and made us feel comfortable and welcomed...
The bed and pull out sofa were firm, (as I preferred) pillows soft, and the blankets super comfy and plentiful.  The neighborhood was quiet and street parking was never an issue.  We recommend a car rental if you want to see more of Seattle's different neighborhoods.  We loved the going green concept incorporated in the living space! 
The only issue we encountered (but did not mention during our stay secondary to this not being an issue that could have been ""fixed"") was that the walls were thin and we could hear every footstep and object being moved for ex.  Unfortunately we are light/med sleepers and were not able to sleep past ~ 7:30am esp over the weekend....however, if you are a deep sleeper, than this would not be an issue and we definitely recommend this place!
We had a great time and our only regret is that our schedules did not allow us to book a massage with Stef despite her open availability....next time hopefully!
Thank you Stef and Bernie for sharing part of your home with us :)"
42590	6166307	10.0	9.0	52961028	This is a great base if you want to stay near the Ballard/Fremont area. Just bear in mind that it's hard to sleep in late because the family lives upstairs, and they're up early walking above your head—not too bad on the weekend but 6am on Monday. Bed is fairly comfortable, and the sitting area is spacious for hanging out and getting ready. Nice, quiet residential street. 
42591	6166307	10.0	9.0	54532065	This is an easy experience from start to finish. The hosts don't even have to meet you so you can let yourself in when you're ready to check in. The accommodations are great for short or long extended stays. Ideal for a couple or a small family with 1 or 2 young children as well. The furnishings and amenities will give you flexibility of options to stay in or head out. The location is super convenient, with a large grocery store, a beer shop w/food trucks out front every day, restaurant options and a gas station a few blocks away. It's almost like staying in an Aloft hotel but BETTER. Hosts were great and helpful & responsive. A great place for a home away from home.
42592	6166307	10.0	9.0	56370905	This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was very nice.  The place was comfortable, homey and had some lovely touches to make the stay enjoyable.  I picked the location primarily because  it is just down the street from my daughter and grandchildren, but I am sure glad I did.  
42593	6166307	10.0	9.0	57184127	"Overall, the trip was very good. Nice new building below the owner's living space. Very quiet neighborhood, didn't have trouble parking. 
All the amenities were more that what we needed: basics such as soap, shampoo, body wash, towels, kitchen utensils (plates, cups, knives, etc) TV, laptop, wifi, etc. 

There was a loud construction on one of the morning that we were never told about. 

overall it was a great trip. 
"
42868	4038347	8.0	9.0	19580494	The listing was accurately represented and Lisa and her son were welcoming. The listing was a good value in a quiet neighborhood just outside of downtown Seattle. The location offered a good alternative to I-5 with a main road directly to downtown Seattle being a block away form the street Lisa's home is on. 
42869	4038347	8.0	9.0	20776928	Lisa was very nice and friendly. Room has ample closet space and dresser. House is located right off the E rapid, which gets you to/from downtown in about 20-30 minutes. I was doing research at UW, which was about a 30 minute bus ride off the 48. Greenwood also has a nice strip on Greenwood Ave, good cafes and restaurants, plus a  cocktail lounge.
42870	4038347	8.0	9.0	21173875	"I would never recommend this host. First, the house was really messy,  I never used the living room even one time. the bathroom was quite messy as well. I spent most on my time at a medical conference and stayed out as much as I could so I would avoid the messy environment. I booked 3 nights but I was unable to continue to staying there. I left after two day and as her profile states, she has flexible cancellation policy. I left early at 0800 and requested a days refund but she declined to honor her own policy. No beef, this I ended up paying for the rest of the stay. 
That said, Lisa was prompt in replying to messages. She was however unable to present me with the keys until after the first night, and I had to request for it. The location is great for what I was to do in Seattle, close to University of Washington. 
"
42871	4038347	8.0	9.0	21327061	Nice location.  Only 10 minute walk to Greenwood and 20 minute ride to downtown
42872	4038347	8.0	9.0	21451563	The house has very good location, room nice, clean and spacy. Lisa is very nice, easy to communicate, she just made some potato soup when I arrived and offered me, so nice!
42873	4038347	8.0	9.0	21559000	Lisa was a very accommodating host. The room was comfortable. Excellent public transportation to downtown Seattle. 
42874	4038347	8.0	9.0	22048448	Lisa (and her son!) were very nice/accomodating. Room was as described. Internet was a plus. Hope he feels better! :)
42875	4038347	8.0	9.0	22382454	Bed was very comfy, photos in the listing are accurate. Very easy to get to downtown Seattle on the bus. Lisa pretty much left me to my own devices which was ideal.
42876	4038347	8.0	9.0	22940936	This is a great place to crash. Lisa was very welcoming, and the neighborhood was safe, quiet, and with ample parking, as described. I was in and out because of an early flight, and got everything I needed for a great price.
42877	4038347	8.0	9.0	23000994	Lisa is so great!  She was very gracious and made me feel very welcome.  The room is nice and clean and the bed is SO comfortable!  Best sleep I've gotten in quite some time! 
42878	4038347	8.0	9.0	23731030	Lisa was very nice, and accommodating. The neighborhood was nice and the room was a good size and comfortable. 
42879	4038347	8.0	9.0	24159796	"Lisa's been very pleasant during my stay, which I actually extended by another week (to a total of two) after feeling things out the first few nights.

She has been very accommodating and has generally left me to my own devices unless I engage her in conversation, and is friendly in the passing.

I haven't had any issues during my stay, and I'd use this place again should the need arise."
42880	4038347	8.0	9.0	24389833	"Extended previous stay, pleasant experience all around.

See previous review for more info."
42881	4038347	8.0	9.0	25624397	Lisa was nice and accommodating. The house was messy, but the room was clean with clean bed sheets. The bathroom was messy, and the shower is lower, so something to consider if you're taller. She provided fresh soap and a clean towel. I was given my own space and privacy. 
42882	4038347	8.0	9.0	25913395	Had a great time at Lisa's place. She was very friendly and welcoming. Her knowledge of Seattle and the world was very much appreciated. The location has great parking which is highly valuable because many parts of the city lack easy parking. The atmosphere was very relaxed and chill. Her sense of humor is great as well. The area is close to bus stops and coffee shops if needed. The desk in the dining room was totally acceptable for doing any work. Used it quite often at night with no problem. The bed is large and comfortable and the neighborhood is very quiet. So overall I had a great time and learned a lot from Lisa. 
42883	4038347	8.0	9.0	26654007	Yes the room described exactly as it looks in the ad.  Lisa was very accommodating and helpful.  Her location was less than a half mile from the conference site I was attending which was perfect.  I was hardly there except late at night.  It was easy to navigate to food and drink.  She is very sweet as is her 4 year old son.
42884	4038347	8.0	9.0	27749811	Lisa was a wonderful host towards me. She has a nice house to live in and it was 20 min - 30 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle which is very convenient. I had a nice time leaving in her place when I needed a place to stay. Thank you, Lisa.
42885	4038347	8.0	9.0	28631257	Lisa was very pleasant and accommodating.  The room was a good size and the neighborhood was quite.  
42886	4038347	8.0	9.0	28762866	Lisa was pleasant and a good host, the room was clean and comfortable, and the neighbourhood is nice and quiet. However, it does not mention in the listing that she has a four-year-old boy who sleeps in the neighbouring room, and I think that's very important for establishing expectations as to what the atmosphere and noise level in a home will be. I had booked this room only needing a quiet place to sleep overnight. I arrived late at night after a long, tiring day driving, and was very taken aback to be greeted by a boisterous child. He's a cute kid and Lisa seems like a good mom. But even the best-behaved four-year-old boy is still going to be bursting with energy, and it's not fair not to tell people up front to expect this. Some people won't mind a bit, but those of us who are light sleepers want to be able to confidently pick accommodations where we can expect quiet.
42887	4038347	8.0	9.0	30156715	This was a great spot, close to a bus and as described. It was for my son to stay while relocating to the area and it was a great value and good location. 
42888	4038347	8.0	9.0	30747013	I was comfortable at Lisa's house.  I had what I needed, a private space to rest at night while busy with work in the city.  If the timing works out I'd like to stay at Lisa's house again.
42889	4038347	8.0	9.0	31219539	The room is exactly as shown in the photos. The neighborhood is relatively quiet, and there is parking on the street. It is very close to stores and restaurants.  Lisa is good at making you feel welcome and making sure your are comfortable.
42890	4038347	8.0	9.0	31615553	The room was clean, and Lisa was very welcoming. The place was near the public transportation stops which made it convenient to get around
42891	4038347	8.0	9.0	32134502	I had a great time staying at Lisa's house. She was very welcoming and the room was bright and homey. The neighborhood was great and close to lots of tasty restaurants.
42892	4038347	8.0	9.0	32284833	I good a good experience staying at Lisa's. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Lisa was very welcoming and friendly. This place is perfect if you need easy access to I-5.
42893	4038347	8.0	9.0	35617292	"Lisa was a fantastic host. Although, I arrived very late in the day to her apartment, she ensured to welcome me and provide the basic stuff to have a nice stay. The location was very nice in a safe neighborhood with easy access to bus to downtown. 

I will definitely stay again at her place!"
42894	4038347	8.0	9.0	35891267	"The room was exactly as advertised. Lisa was very nice and offered water, towels, and key to the house. She was able to accommodate my last minute reservation and late checkin! I felt comfortable coming and going as needed and parking in the area was just fine.

A few things to note: Lisa does not run the house much like a B+B or hotel. You are simply renting a room in an active, busy house. She has a kid who stays with her some of the time. So, be forewarned it's just going to be a bit louder if he is there. Bathroom is shared (and quite messy) but close to the room. 

This was a great place for me and for the price."
42895	4038347	8.0	9.0	36578397	"Lisa is Very nice and friendly person.
The Room was very clean.
She provided me iron for clothes.
I am very happy with her.
Suggestions : 
1. Please provide Fan in the room in summer time.
2. Bathroom have so many used/ unused thing. Please keep the only things guests needed."
42896	4038347	8.0	9.0	36919811	Lisa was very friendly. It was very hot in Seattle when i was there and she gave me the fan out of her room to use, which was very nice. She also provided bottled water upon arrival. Her place is a short walk to the restaurants on Greenwood. 
42897	4038347	8.0	9.0	38110808	"I am very grateful for the hospitality and friendliness of Lisa.
  It was a great experience I had stayed at home.
The habtacion is spacious and bright, with a large, soft bed, where sleep is placentero.El bathroom is shared with a large shower pressure.
  His home has fruit trees (fig and apple trees), which dated back to me my childhood.
  The neighborhood is aromatic and peaceful, with large gardens, with rosemary, lavender, pine and cypress.
  One block no public locomotion, which is very efficient and punctual, which allows to reach the center of Seattle in an expeditious manner.
   Lisa was very friendly, she kindly helped me meet my requirements."

This   was my first  experience with Airbnb, and it  was  a very 
positive  experience....My flight got in later than I anticipated,
but she told me   not to worry..I arrived at the house..she showed me the room and the (email hidden) it all went  well...I would get up early 
and  try to see as much of  Seattle as  possible..I would be  gone all day,and come back and go to bed..so we did not really have much
chance to interact...as I was  leaving, she came out and said good by
The bed  was  comfortable, the shower was  great , nice residential
neighborhood ..the  bus  stop was only two minutes from the house
and took me  downtown in about 20 minutes....there is an area
about  10 minutes  from the house with lots of restaurants all in all
a  pleasant  stay "
42899	4038347	8.0	9.0	39416729	Lisa is a kind and friendly person. The room was clean and comfortable. The place is easy to find and close to bus stations. I could walk down to Green Lake and the lake is a great place to relax and for walking or running.
42900	4038347	8.0	9.0	39711844	"Had a lovely time here! Lisa is a communicative and gracious host, and made everything quite easy. House is on a hill, and there's a great backyard / patio section that she invited me to use, which I did, doing work on a laptop. Backyard has some adorable chickens and a fig tree (Lisa let me have a sample: was delicious). The bed was quite comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. Pleasantly woke up each morning to the sound of birds. Would come back here for sure.

If you're coming to town to check out UW, I would recommend staying here, as it's a quick 10-minute drive away, but more charming and quiet than anything you'll find in the U-District.

42901	4038347	8.0	9.0	39888986	Great stay for my first airbnb. Confortable bed & clean room.
42902	4038347	8.0	9.0	40131765	I had a wonderful stay at Lisa's place.  The room was clean and comfortable.  Lisa was a very welcoming hostess and fun to talk to.  I would definitely return there for future trips to Seattle.
42903	4038347	8.0	9.0	40977670	Lisa was very caring, sweet and accommodating. Her place was perfectly what I needed for a one night stay and I slept like a baby.

Since I am an ex-Seattlite Lisa didn't have to guide me or provide suggestions but my guess is if you needed help or suggestions she would not hesitate.
It was easy to come and go which I appreciated.
Thank you, Lisa!!!!!"
42907	4038347	8.0	9.0	42031807	The room was clean and cozy and just as advertised.  I would stay at the location again.  Even let me borrow a phone charger.

42909	4038347	8.0	9.0	45608593	Lisa was a very nice host. She even prepared some food for me when I got in late from the airport on the first night. The room is comfortable and clean, and there is a good bus connection to downtown.
42910	4038347	8.0	9.0	46531743	She is awesome! she always welcomed to ask any questions or helps. The location is very nice and quiet and the bus station is just 5minuts walk from the house. I had a private room which is clean and nice. The best part of this staying is that the bed is super comfy!!!! If you are planning to stay in Seattle, I do recommend this place. Thanks Lisa!

The room was very clean and comfortable, just as presented in the photos, with some bottled water provided-- a thoughtful touch that made me feel welcome immediately. She even brought me delicious homemade cookies when I first arrived!

The house was just what I was looking for-- close enough to downtown, but quiet enough to find some peace and calm. Lisa was very accommodating-- she was happy to talk about local places to eat or see and offer recommendations. Overall a very nice experience.

42913	4038347	8.0	9.0	53164375	She was nice , very understanding and a good women to me while I visited :)
42914	4038347	8.0	9.0	54363484	Lovely room, friendly host. I was busy doing some last minute studying so I wasn't available a lot but for when I was she Lisa and Adrian were nice to me. Would stay again. 
42915	4038347	8.0	9.0	56458999	She was a nice host and I enjoyed my stay
43214	749758	9.0	9.0	4574992	Rita and Elwin were great. They are very nice people, easy to have a conversation with, and attentive to needs. They converted their house to a duplex and offer of the back half to you, with a couple of doors separating the spaces. For this reason, the house can be a little noisy. The walls are thin and you can hear things going on in other rooms. It isn't bad, but something you should be aware of before you stay here. Another thing you should be aware of is that the kitchen is very small. If you plan to stay for a long time and cook each night, this can become a problem. It is fine if you aren't staying for long or aren't planning on cooking a lot of big meals. It works well for most circumstances. The neighborhood that the house is in is great. There are many restaurants, bars, and grocery stores to walk to (although most require walking up and down a small hill). And you're only a 10 minute walk to bus terminals in every direction that can take you anywhere else you might want to go.
43215	749758	9.0	9.0	49681684	Thank you, Rita and Elwin, for your friendly hospitality and comfortable apartment. My daughter and I loved meeting you both. Your place was so convenient and had a great little kitchen! Thanks for hosting and making our weekend carefree!
43216	749758	9.0	9.0	50341103	Thank you Rita and Elwin for a nice stay in Seattle. You were very kind and helpful and easy to have speak with. Your home was well placed, and easy to take the bus to downtown Seattle and great grocery options in Greenwood. 
43217	749758	9.0	9.0	51317581	My friends and I had an amazing time in Greenwood at Rita's place! She is warm, friendly, and very helpful. The neighborhood is quaint, but there are still lots of fun restaurants and cafes to check out nearby! 
43218	749758	9.0	9.0	51600171	Rita was very welcoming when my little dog, Annabelle, and I arrived at the house.  The location was very convenient and the house roomy and comfortable.
43219	749758	9.0	9.0	51839143	Rita and Elwin were there to greet us upon arrival. Both were very friendly and Elwin was a witty young man. He had several suggestions for restaurants in the area which was very helpful. The house is exactly as described and was perfect for my family of 4.  Off street parking was a plus, location was great, only 10 minutes to downtown Seattle. We were not at the house much but the washer and dryer came in handy. It is a very reasonable price for the location, cleanliness and spaciousness of the house. I would stay here again on any future trips if it were available.
43220	749758	9.0	9.0	52777044	Rita was a great hostess! The apartment was clean and welcoming. The apartment is close to lots of great places. We would stay here again for sure! 
43221	749758	9.0	9.0	53103717	The host canceled this reservation 49 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
43222	749758	9.0	9.0	53489421	Rita and her husband made us feel right at home.  They were very friendly and responsive. 
43223	749758	9.0	9.0	54616502	Rita's location was perfect for us.  Her home is located in a safe and well lit neighborhood with easy access to public transportation.  Rita was very accommodating to our late evening arrival and early morning departure.  The apartment is spacious, roomy, and comfortable.  I would recommend this space as well as return in the future.  
43224	749758	9.0	9.0	55127220	"This was a great house with very welcoming owners. The house was quiet and comfortable and next to a great park. 

The owners were friendly and available as needed, and quiet courteous. 

Would definitely stay at this place again if the need arises."
45488	6793490	10.0	9.0	38630982	He is so friendly. I was first guest at the house. The house is awesome. Everything is new and nice. The location is good. The house is the best in airbnb that I stayed. I hope to stay again. I was satisfied so much.
45489	6793490	10.0	9.0	39217137	"The host was responsive and easy to reach.  They house was small but not too much so.  They had a bed and a futon that made it so that up to 4 adults could sleep comfortably.

The house was close to downtown, the airport, and the other neighborhoods in Seattle making it a great location.  The neighborhood was quiet and that was nice for a restful place to stay.

The bed was a sponge mattress which was a little soft to my liking, but I know many will appreciate it's coziness.  Both the futon and the bed were comfortable.

Biggest drawback was there is no AC.  There are fans and a decent breeze.  Since most of the day we were out exploring this was not a major issue but something to be aware of.

So for the short version.  I would stay here again as the house is a charming small but not tiny house located close to everything in Seattle.  Accommodations are well suited and the hosts are easy to communicate with."
45490	6793490	10.0	9.0	39662237	Great location, house, and host. Rob quickly responded to all of our messages. The house was clean and modern. Highly recommended.
45491	6793490	10.0	9.0	40110693	Place was great for a couple of nights in Seattle.  Perfect location for a short walk over to the LINK to get to the stadiums or downtown.  Listing was accurately described and check-in/check-out process was easy and efficient.
45492	6793490	10.0	9.0	40461710	The house was wonderful.  I love the fact the house was provided with dishes, cookware, and fridge.  I would have loved to see a microwave.  The second floor where the bedroom is can become very stuffy and hot as the day progresses.  The fans definitely helped.  The bathroom was a little small and lacked counter space or a shelf to place our toiletries.  We did not get the chance to meet the hosts but the check in process was easy.
45493	6793490	10.0	9.0	40929789	It was easy working with Lori & Rob for are stay. If we had any question they got back with us right way. That house was as they described. Very clean  and we love are stay and the neighborhood. Would recommend it to anyone and would stay again.
45494	6793490	10.0	9.0	41383918	This little house was exactly what we were looking for! The house itself is cozy with all the amenities you need. The location is extremely convenient, in a residential neighbourhood only a few light rail stops from downtown. We didn't get to meet Lori and Rob, but they were very responsive to texts (including a locked bathroom door situation we had which was quickly resolved). The self check-in and check-out are very well organized. We highly recommend this place!
45495	6793490	10.0	9.0	41650255	We were pleasantly surprised with our stay at the back house. The location was perfect, very close to everything. The apartment was very clean and neat. We had plenty of room for our family (2 adults 2 young kids) parking was extremely convenient. Check in check out process was very simple. I would definitely stay there again!
45496	6793490	10.0	9.0	42274003	"This home has been recently and nicely updated and offered us great privacy within a few miles of downtown Seattle.  It's in an older neighborhood and basically situated on an alley so the views aren't great, but having a 2 story house to yourself is fabulous.  I would note that this neighborhood is also in a flight path for the airport and you may be awakened by the planes overhead in the early morning as we were.

Rob responded to my texts/questions promptly. I would stay here again!"
45497	6793490	10.0	9.0	42542208	This house was so clean and welcoming.  It was just the right amount of space for our family of four!  The hosts were helpful and friendly! 
45498	6793490	10.0	9.0	43262863	I had an amazing stay at Lori and Rob's place in Beacon Hill. The house was impeccably clean and very spacious. Check-in was very convenient. The neighborhood is safe (with friendly neighbors too!) and the house is a quick walk to the rail to downtown. I would love to stay here again!
45499	6793490	10.0	9.0	43801327	This house was perfect for our little family. Rob was so helpful all the details for an easy check-in/check-out process. All the amenities that were provided were just what we need for our weekend stay. The location was great, neighborhood was very quiet and a short walking distance to the local market and a few shops. We didn’t rent a car during our stay so the proximity to the light rail was perfect with it being just a 6-7 min walk to the Beacon Hill Station and then a quick 15-20 ride into downtown Seattle. Definitely a great little place to stay for our next visit to Seattle.
45500	6793490	10.0	9.0	44320388	We had an amazing experience staying with Rob & Lori in Seattle!  The space was clean, very inviting, secluded, and very close to downtown.  It was everything we were looking for.  We plan on going back in the future and will definitely try to use this house.
45501	6793490	10.0	9.0	44792553	"Amazing location! If you are primarily visiting Seattle a car is not necessary if this cottage is available. You can take the train from the airport to the Beacon Hill stop and from there into town. Should you find yourself having too much fun and don't make the last train, then Über X was only $12.

I really appreciate the bottled water and emergency coffee stash left in the cabinet.  The grocery store is next to the train stop and easy to walk to for extras. The bed upstairs is crazy comfortable with amazing pillows and the shower was huge!

Just book it! The train platform is underground so it's not like it is inconvenient to take public transport!"
45502	6793490	10.0	9.0	45078804	A very clean and quaint space newly renovated and in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the light rail station. Lori and Rob were great hosts. They were extremely accommodating in letting us drop off our bags at the house prior to check in so that we could get right to exploring the city. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely keep this rental in mind for our next visit!
45503	6793490	10.0	9.0	45403668	This is a lovely home, in a great location.  Rob and Lori were great hosts, giving us information in a really clear and timely fashion.
45504	6793490	10.0	9.0	45601258	Rob and Lori are great! Their place was beautiful and very clean. They were very easy to communicate with and were super polite. I would highly recommend their place! 
45505	6793490	10.0	9.0	46386978	This house was great! The place was super clean and tidy, and Lori and Rob were extremely easy to reach and accommodating. I would absolutely stay here again in the future. 
45506	6793490	10.0	9.0	47331400	"Rob was very accommodating and accepted a booking at the last minute. Also was helpful in allowing us to drop our bags prior to check in so we could visit the city.  Stand up fellow.

House was clean and well laid out for a short stay. An affordable gem in a pleasant Seattle neighbourhood. Easy access to the light rail station making for easy access to downtown and the airport. Good grocery store a short walk away. Highly recommended."
45507	6793490	10.0	9.0	47749131	My husband and I stayed at this charming home for our mini vacation. There are large windows and even a fire place! Its conveniently located 15 minutes from all the tourist spots. It was a very easy check-in and check out. 
45508	6793490	10.0	9.0	48877037	Rob was incredibly nice and accommodating from the get go. The location of their beautiful place couldn't be more convenient for getting pretty much anywhere you want to go on the train. If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, this is it. 
45509	6793490	10.0	9.0	49139538	Staying up at Lori and Rob's place was perfect for my trip. It was very easy to come and go and the location was great. Rob was great at communicating the ins and outs and even let me check in a little bit early which was a huge help. The space was very clean and everything was exactly as advertised. This will definitely be a consideration for me on future trips to Seattle.
45510	6793490	10.0	9.0	49375845	My husband, son and I stayed at Lori and Rob's for two nights and really enjoyed our stay there. It exceeded our expectations. All of our communication was managed through text messages which was fine. Rob was very prompt at returning text messages. The cottage was cozy but provided ample space. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt safe walking around. The cottage is fairly proximate to downtown and other tourist destinations. We would surely stay there again. Loved it!
45511	6793490	10.0	9.0	50195706	This was a nice little two-floor house with all the amenities and independent entrance . The neighborhood is nice and quiet, is close to the Link Rail Beacon Hill Station (.5 mile), and takes just 10 minutes to get at the Pioneer Station in Seattle. There is a supermarket a few blocks from the house. I never spoke to or saw the owners.
45512	6793490	10.0	9.0	54233674	This house was very quaint but spacious for two! Really enjoyed the cleanliness and amenities provided. Rob was very accommodating with the check in time. The best part was definitely the bed, very very comfortable!The neighborhood is very quiet and comfortable and we enjoyed being on the porch. The only thing that was a drag was the tv service was going in and out, just a few channels to choose from. But otherwise thank you Lori and Rob for the amazing house and the opportunity to stay in Seattle! Definitely coming back! 
45513	6793490	10.0	9.0	55116909	Great spot!  It has everything you would need in an apartment and everything is very clean.  The floors felt very cold, because you can only use space heaters.   Bring slippers and you will totally be fine!  The owners also provide a few ikea slippers, but we did not want to use communal slippers.  Otherwise, this place is great!
45744	1556170	10.0	9.0	8072944	"this place was great! everything was in tip-top shape, clean and comfortable. cute and safe neighborhood within a short walk from coffee shop, bar, convenient store, grocery store, and light rail.

and anna was a fantastic host! i came in late, so we did not meet, but the key was in the lockbox and everything was ready for me. she went above the call of duty by leaving a personal gift bag and some treats in the kitchen."
45745	1556170	10.0	9.0	8199577	I've use Airbnb a few times and this was, by far, my worst experience.  The pictures are deceiving.  This place is very small.  The furniture is cheap and tiny.  I swear the chairs in the living room are made for infants.  She lives right across the street from a Fire Station, so you can imagine how loud it gets at night.  The bus stop is right outside, which is convenient, but contributes to the noise.  It was good exercise hiking up and down the stairs that lead to her unit.   
45746	1556170	10.0	9.0	9518991	This apartment was perfect for our needs.  We stayed almost a week from Christmas to New Years Eve and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Bed was comfy, and the location with the bus stop steps away was very convenient.  Anna even left us a bottle of wine, snacks, and a miniature Christmas tree.  I highly recommend it!
45747	1556170	10.0	9.0	10211697	"It was my first time with airbnb. 
•Overall my experience was good. 
•Communication was really good, Annan replied to my inquires and  questions really quickly. 
•The please was very nice just like the photos. 
•Annan welcomed me with beverages, snacks, coffee and tea. ( I didn't meet her but she made me feel welcomed through our communication.) 
•Towels and slippers were provided. 
•The only thing that you might not like is the noise coming from the streets.  "
45748	1556170	10.0	9.0	10303788	I stayed at Anna’s apartment two nights and it was a great experience. Apartment was very clean, everything was well-organized and had everything I needed during my weekend stay in Seattle. I didn’t get to meet Anna in person but she replied all my questions very quickly and sincerely. I strongly recommend her apartment to other travelers and I’ll definitely prefer to stay at her place during my upcoming visits to Seattle. 
45749	1556170	10.0	9.0	10404564	Very good communication. Thanks Anna!
45750	1556170	10.0	9.0	10669649	"I work often in Seattle and really appreciate places that take me out of the tourist element and into ""real"" Seattle.  Anna's place is very nice, clean and well-appointed.  I felt very comfortable there and appreciate the little extra touches that made it feel homey and comfortable. I really hope I can use her place next time I come.  I also really appreciated the parking space."
45751	1556170	10.0	9.0	10984651	The apartment was very clean, organized, and comfortable. Ana was so kind and considerate that she had left some cookies and snacks before I arrive at the home. Also, she was very responsive. I had a great time at her apartment. 
45752	1556170	10.0	9.0	11185624	It is a lovely apartment. Great location. We were there for over a week, Everything was in great shape, clean and comfortable. Great neighborhood, close to coffee shop, bar, convenient store, grocery store, and light rail.  Great having a parking spot as well.  Always better than a hotel.
45753	1556170	10.0	9.0	11267289	Anna's place was awesome! Stylish decor and very cozy furniture. Well insulated so you really didn't have to run the heat much (which is a huge plus given how cold it can get in Seattle). I love that the 36 bus stop is literally right in front of the building and it's a reasonable walk to the Beacon Hill light rail station, Red Apple, Jefferson Park, the library and a slew of other little shops, restaurants and such. And if you happen to drive, the place is located just a couple minutes from I-5. There can also be some Car2Go vehicles around the area (if you're into that) and there are two ZipCars at the light rail station. I appreciated the prompt and thoughtful communication from Anna and the ability to come and go with ease. The place is very clean and personalized so it feels like your own apartment for the duration of your stay. I said I didn't want a touristy experience since I'm from Seattle/Tacoma visiting home and I most definitely felt at home, but always a text or phone call away from assistance if I needed it. This experience is ten times better than a hotel. Such a comfortable place, supportive and attentive host, and an all around beautiful community. Thank you, Anna! 
45754	1556170	10.0	9.0	11489627	This place was great! I needed a place to stay for a few nights, as I finalized plans to move away from Seattle. And Anna's place suited me perfectly. Gorgeous little apartment with TONS of natural light, right on a major bus line. It took me minutes to get downtown. Anna was very communicative regarding any questions I had about the ins and outs of the place, and made me feel right at home, providing snacks and bottled water. I'll definitely stay here again when I visit the city!
45755	1556170	10.0	9.0	12040998	The reservation was canceled 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
45756	1556170	10.0	9.0	12197446	"This was the perfect place for a get away with my husband; roomy, stylish but not fancy, and a good kitchen too. Anna was a responsive and attentive hostess and the instructions for our arrival were very clear and easy to follow (late at night in the rain)

45757	1556170	10.0	9.0	12540508	Clean and comfortable, looking forward to staying here again.
45758	1556170	10.0	9.0	12984124	"Anna's place is very clean and brightly furnished. It is close to easy transit options. She offers a welcoming atmosphere with coffee, snacks, tea, and more. It is a good value. Anna's place is within a very active area and can be noisy although everything is pretty quiet after 10 pm and before 6 am. I was not able to connect to the internet upon my arrival but she came the next day and fixed it, which I appreciated.

45759	1556170	10.0	9.0	13042699	The place was very clean. Anna was professional and made it easy for us to find and stay at her place. Go choice for seattle visitors! 
45760	1556170	10.0	9.0	14076416	Wonderful place in a very central location! Loved that Jefferson Park was literally right around the corner. Very quiet area (except at night). Anna is a great host and is always there to answer your questions! Wonderful experience! 
45761	1556170	10.0	9.0	14427727	I knew my experience with Anna and her apartment was going to be great before it even began.  I requested an early check-in because I had to bump up my flight to an earlier time to get to a meeting.  Anna was quick to respond and accommodate my needs immediately on short notice.  Anna sent detailed instructions on how to get into the apartment.  The apartment is LOVELY.  I was in Seattle apartment hunting for my move the following month, and I kept thinking that I could only hope to get an apartment as nice as hers.  The apartment is tastefully decorated and has all the amenities a person would need.  It was easy to get anywhere from her apartment using either the lightrail a few blocks away or the 36 bus right outside the doorstep.  All in all, my experience here was fantastic.  I would highly recommend Anna and her apartment for anyone's stay in Seattle.
45762	1556170	10.0	9.0	15067737	"Anna was very responsive. Check in was easy, the apartment was very clean. The bottled water in the fridge was a nice touch. 

The only thing folks should know is that it is on a busy street. There is significant traffic noise, but it quiets down after 11pm. Also if you are sensitive to scents, she uses a Glade plug in air freshener. I just unplugged it, put it outside, and opened the windows for awhile. It was much better. 

The price and location are excellent. I recommend it as a good place to stay."
45763	1556170	10.0	9.0	15417065	Very nice, comfortable and clean apartment. Nice fully equipped modern kitchen. As others mentioned, there is road noise but I was able to sleep comfortably with earplugs and my companion slept well without. It is a reasonable walk from the metro and there is a bus stop just out front. The only real complaint was internet connection which was very spotty. We both work online when we are away and it was extremely frustrating to lose the connection so frequently. The modem is not located in the apartment so it's difficult to say why.  
45764	1556170	10.0	9.0	15970396	"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle! This apartment is by a lovely park I went jogging in, with a gorgeous skyline view of Seattle. You can tuck your car in at the back of the apartment, and then drive to downtown Seattle in EIGHT minutes!
The apartment itself was a little warm in July, but if you leave the windows open it's fine. The host was excellent with communication, and we would totally stay here again!"
45765	1556170	10.0	9.0	18873328	My experience at Anna's place was awesome. The location was great and the unit was exactly as described! I would highly recommend her place to anyone.
45766	1556170	10.0	9.0	19012417	"Appartment was awesome.. Clean.. Plenty of sunlight.. Very private.
No concerns at all.. Anna was a great host.

Tip:
I have rented from AIRBNB before and it seems that majority of the places do not supply soap, shampoo or conditioner??? Bring some with you or keep it in mind cuz many of the places dont have them"
45767	1556170	10.0	9.0	19136941	Anna was a great host, very responsive and courteous.  The place was well stocked and very clean.  The location was perfect for a low key place near (~0.3 miles) the light rail that goes right into the city. The neighborhood felt very safe and was a welcoming place to stay. There was traffic noise from the street, but it did not bother us.
45768	1556170	10.0	9.0	19699417	Great apartment, convenient location.  Clean, comfortable and inviting.  Would definitely stay here again.  Yes, you can hear the road noise, but otherwise it was a quiet spot.  
45769	1556170	10.0	9.0	19850168	Great little space! Very well decorated and clean. Communication sw clear and appropriate. A bit of road noise but I knew that before reserving the unit. Close to lots of things. I'd stay again!
45770	1556170	10.0	9.0	20082730	"I had a wonderful stay in Seattle. This Beacon Hill location was perfect and trips downtown only took 15 minutes. If I had flown instead of driven the bus that was right curbside would've been perfect.

I enjoyed my not having to worry about parking as it was readily available for my personal vehicle that I drove from Montana.

Anna was available and very responsive via message, and the location felt very safe.

There were even plum trees with ripe plums falling to the ground! And the little slippers waiting within the front door as well as the bottled water in the frig were greatly appreciated.

Lovely apartment and host. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you Anna!"
45771	1556170	10.0	9.0	20604085	I had a great stay in this pristine and light filled apt.  It was inviting and I felt safe and secure.  Very convenient also.  Loved staying there!
45772	1556170	10.0	9.0	20764513	Such a cute and comfortable space!! Easily one of the nicest and most convenient places I've stayed in Seattle! Anna was available but the space was totally private - it was awesome and I want to stay there now every time I come to Seattle. 
45773	1556170	10.0	9.0	21026029	Really gorgeous apartment grat facilities, having bus stop in front was really handy getting around, easy to get to and from airport, thanks so much!
45774	1556170	10.0	9.0	21164323	Anna's place was perfect! Just as advertised and better. The apartment was exceptionally clean and in a great location close to everything. There were little touches that made me feel very comfortable and at home. I will definitely be staying here again! Thanks, Anna. 
45775	1556170	10.0	9.0	21312983	The apartment was as advertised, very clean. The location is very near downtown Seattle -- nice, easy access. 
45776	1556170	10.0	9.0	21705326	"I really enjoyed staying at Anna's! So much better than a hotel. The location was super convenient to downtown and other parts of Seattle (there's a bus stop right in front). The apartment was safe, clean and very comfortable. Anna was nice enough to arrange for an early check in since my flight arrived early in the day and let me know about public transit options as well as where I could park if I had a car.

Such a great host and stay! "
45777	1556170	10.0	9.0	22401721	"Anna's place is beautiful, located conveniently near public transportation, and had every I needed for a comfortable and easy stay. Check-in/check-out was a breeze, the space was spotless, and essentials were stocked in the kitchen and bathroom.

Anna was quick to reply and kindly offered to make herself available should I need anything during my visit... of course, I didn't need a thing because she had already thought of everything.

I highly recommend Anna's place and hope I'll have a chance to visit again soon!"
45778	1556170	10.0	9.0	22609670	Great location, very clean, no problems getting in or out. Loved the ceiling beams! Having a parking space is a great benefit for those with cars.
45779	1556170	10.0	9.0	23217666	"I had a great stay at Anna's place. The apartment met my expectations exactly. It was cleaner than the average hotelroom, and a lot cleaner than my home usually is. Anna was quick to reply in all comunication and was available for questions on both email and text. Her place had a perfect location for exploring Seattle and other areas with easy acsess to the freeways by car, and the bus to downtown Seattle right outside the door. I would defenently stay here again. 

Ragnhild"
45780	1556170	10.0	9.0	24106868	Anna provided a very clean, recently remodeled, and conveniently located place to stay for a few weeks.  Having a spot for off street parking was a huge bonus.  I was completely satisfied with the accommodations and service.  
45781	1556170	10.0	9.0	24869711	"Working with Anna was easy with fast and accurate responses - the location and amenities were exactly as advertised.  Loved the apartment and would highly recommend for other travelers looking to experience Seattle in a cool neighborhood.
"
45782	1556170	10.0	9.0	25747139	The apartment was clean, modern, and overall nice. Anna (the host) was responsive and friendly. The apartment was thoughtfully furnished. The only concern about this apartment is the noise from the street, the apartment can be a bit noisy but this was not overwhelming  for me. Overall, my stay here was very nice. 
45783	1556170	10.0	9.0	25920061	This apartment is awesome!! My Seattle friends were super jealous and wanted to move in. Anna was really accommodating with my same-day booking. Neighborhood is close to downtown and in a decent area. 
45784	1556170	10.0	9.0	26010443	Anna has a really nice and modern place in a great location. We had a rental car and it was only a couple exits away from down town. Even more great is you have the option to use the light rail system that's close by if you don't feel like driving. We had no problems whatsoever during our stay and Anna was most helpful to us. I will definitely recommend this place to stay when coming to Seattle. 
45785	1556170	10.0	9.0	26374934	"Ann was accommodating, and I appreciated she was able to be flexible when my co-worker Trevor and I had some last minute changes.
"
45786	1556170	10.0	9.0	26703057	"Note: Anna had us stay in her other unit so this review is actually for ""1 Bedroom Apt In North Beacon Hill.""

Anna was a friendly and responsive host. We got clear instructions for check-in, and she messaged later that night to be sure everything was fine. The unit was very clean and as pictured. There is a nice park across the street, and it's just a couple blocks from a good coffee shop and restaurants. 

The only issue we had was with the wifi, which we found to be unreliable. We needed to do some work on a laptop during our stay and ended up having to go to a coffee shop. To Anna's credit, she responded quickly when notified about the wifi troubles, but given that we were only staying a short while, the issue couldn't be resolved before our departure. She was going to have Comcast look into it so hopefully it will be resolved for the next guest."
45787	1556170	10.0	9.0	27263511	"Anna was a great host and help.  Answered any and all questions in a timely manner and was very accommodating to the many requests and questions I had. 
The space listed is quite beautiful and within easy reach of both the bus stop out front and the Light rail station just blocks away and a free parking space to boot. 
Great and spacious kitchen with a standard fridge with basic cooking supplies and utensils. 
Beacon hill is a great neighborhood and the apartment is located near parks and golf courses. 
If I'm in Seattle I would definitely stay at Anna's place again. "
45788	1556170	10.0	9.0	28485562	From the first message with Anna, she was super helpful and very good with getting back to you. Even with some silly questions, she graciously answered everything. The apartment was bright, clean and exactly what was advertised. The bed was super comfy as well. I had a great nights sleep every night There was everything basic you would need. She even came by the second day to drop off toilet paper and paper towel. It was pretty central to everything as well, being only 20 minutes from the airport and 10-15 minutes from downtown or West Seattle. The neighbourhood was nice as well, although the only complaint I had was that I did find it quite noisy, as there is a fire station across the road, as well as being on the corner of 2 busy intersections. But I would hardly fault Anna for that. If you can tolerate some traffic noise, I would 100% recommend anyone to rent this place. Between Anna and the great apartment, your stay in Seattle will be comfortable and easy.
45789	1556170	10.0	9.0	29046626	"Anna was very easy to communicate with about or travel plans and always responded quickly. Our arrival time changed multiple times due to airline delays and it was no issue for our arrival. Everything we needed was at the apartment and in good working condition. There was plenty of space for the two of us. There are enough kitchen utensils/pans to cook if you need to, although there is so much good eating in the city. We just cooked breakfast.

Of note, the thermostat is automatically set to a very cold temperature, be sure to modify it upon arrival to the unit if you plan to be there. I think it might need to be modified daily, as it will reset to the cold temperature in the morning.

We had a car but did use public transportation some of the time. The location of this apartment is very conveniently located to public transit options and you truly can get around easily, from the airport to the apartment to the city with out a car.

I highly recommend this as a place to stay."
45790	1556170	10.0	9.0	29841255	"Residential Neighborhood.

15 minutes to down by bus. Bus runs every 30 minutes or so.

Big city park located across the street. Pleasant for a stroll.

As for Anna's place it was clean. Very clean, Spotless.

It was also quite spacious with plenty of room for an individual guest or a couple.

A few (minor) negatives:
- No Cable TV (I am a political news junkie)
- Place was somewhat charmless.
- Could occasionally hear noise from the street.

3.5 Stars out of 5."
45791	1556170	10.0	9.0	30753469	We came out to visit our son and his fsmily who live in Seattle. Anna's place was just about 4 blocks away so it was very convenient for us. The unit is just as described. We didn't spend a lot of time in the unit (most of our time was spent with our granddaughter) but it was very well equipped. The bed is VERY comfortable and everything was VERY clean. Location was great; close to coffee shops, restaurants, a golf course and a beautiful park. It's also a nice quick walk to the light rail and only 3 stops to downtown Seattle. There is a bus stop right in front of the building as well. We went to a Mariner's game while in town and it's only 2 stops on the light rail to the stadium. You definitely do not need a car to stay here although there is parking on site.  Anna was very responsive to any of our emails and everything went very smoothly.  The unit is on a main road so there is some traffic noise but we didn't notice it after the first night. If you need a dark room to sleep in I suggest bringing an eye mask as there is a bright light on the building next door that lightens the bedroom through the blinds. It didn't bother either of us but I thought I should mention it. We will definitely stay here again and we thank Anna for her attentiveness and for providing such a nice, clean home for our stay in Seattle.
45792	1556170	10.0	9.0	31778912	Anna was a great host. Left easy details on getting set up in the apartment and had a nice clean space that was close to almost everything you need! Loved it 
45793	1556170	10.0	9.0	32496550	"This was my first time using AirBnB and I must say, it was terrific. I got in to town a littler earlier than expected so I reached out to Anna to see if an early check-in was possible. She responded to me immediately and told me the apartment was ready and waiting. The apartment was great. Clean, cozy and in a great location. Bus stop right outside. Small market and convenience stores/gas stations about a half mile down the street with everything you might need. The apartment is close to freeways which made it easy to get around Seattle, plus you have your own parking space(as well as off street parking if needed).

Anna was always quick to respond to any questions I might have had leading up to and when I arrived. I received a very detailed check-in email explaining anything I might need to know regarding the apartment.

Given the opportunity I would definitely rent Anna's apartment again."
45794	1556170	10.0	9.0	34124288	I had a great time staying at Anna's apartment.. It was clean and good size. The bus stop right out the front and the light rail just down the road made it easy to get around Seattle.. I would stay here again when I'm back in Seattle.
45795	1556170	10.0	9.0	34525545	Anna is very responsive and provides very clear instruction how to access the apartment on the day of the arrival. The apartment is very clean and neat with modern appliances in the kitchen and living area. There's a bus stop right in front of the apt although we don't get to use it as we had rented a car, which we parked at the designated parking. The location is very strategic with only 15 minutes away from downtown and 10 minutes away from Chinatown. Unfortunately we arrive at one of the hottest weekend in Seattle so the indoor temperature gets really warm without AC, but we know that before booking in.  Also Anna is kind enough to provide a rollaway bed so that my wife and toddler can use the queen bed themselves.  Overall a pleasant experience and would love to stay here again.
45796	1556170	10.0	9.0	35070091	Anna was great to work with in leading up to our trip.  She was so easy to contact and her instructions for check in was very easy to follow.  The place was exactly like the pictures and it was very spacious for the two of us.   Parking was sufficient on the street and city center was only 10 minutes away!  
45797	1556170	10.0	9.0	35424326	This place was just as advertised. It was clean and very suitable for my 3 day stay. Although there i no cable, the tv has an antenna and with the wifi you can hook up your laptop to the tv an watch whatever you want. It's in a nice quiet neighborhood and i felt safe. All the appliances worked so i was able to keep some groceries in the apartment.  The location was ideal (10-15 minutes to the pike market) and i would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Seattle area. 
45798	1556170	10.0	9.0	36118671	We were very happy with our stay at Anna's apartment. It was very spacious for the two of us and has many windows for great natural light. The apartment was very clean and is exactly as in photos. We appreciated the private parking space outside the apartment. The location of the apartment is ideal, ... we were particularly happy with not encountering any traffic while getting around in our rental car. The bed was firm but very comfortable and the shower had good flow and drainage. We enjoyed the access to a balcony on the evenings.
45799	1556170	10.0	9.0	37093591	"Everything exactly as described, the place is clean and new, spacious and with a comfortable bed.  We went in summer and with no air conditioner it was kind of hot.

Downtown is 10 minutes away using the Link Light train in Beacon Hill."
45800	1556170	10.0	9.0	38045521	"This apartment is extremely convenient for public transit and is super clean. It is probably the cleanest place I have stayed via Airbnb. And the pictures are very accurate. This is truly a nice place to stay. There were more than enough towels, blankets, and fans (it was quite warm when I visited - what a life saver!)

Kitchen is fully stocked with dinnerware, nice appliances, big refrigerator, etc. If you are looking for a week long place to rent, this is the place to be. I am not terribly picky, but other homes I have rented had very old, dirty appliances. There is a fire station on the corner. If you are a light sleeper it would be worth bringing some ear plugs.  I only remember hearing a fire truck once during my two night stay. The rest of the time it was very quiet in the neighborhood.

Anna checked in on us our first night and stayed out of our way. She seems kind and available in the event there are problems. Thinking back, I may have forgotten to clean something up in the kitchen. Hope she doesn't hold it against me!"
45801	1556170	10.0	9.0	38477083	"From the beginning, Anna was a wonderful host.  My aunt and I wanted to book about five months in advance, so I appreciated that she has her calendar up to date and that she was quick to respond.  

The apartment is very ideally located for anyone wanting to be near downtown, without being too close to all the busyness of the city.  It was clean and light, just like the pictures show, and had everything we needed.  The light rail station down the road was so convenient for getting to/from the airport and into downtown, being about five stops away in both directions.  We had a car for a few days, and had no trouble getting around, and loved having a free parking space.

Any time I had questions, Anna always answered promptly and was extremely helpful.  She was even kind enough leave the fold-a-way bed with clean linens for me so my aunt could have the bed/bedroom to herself.  And since my aunt had an earlier flight than I did the day we left, Anna let me keep my things at the apartment a little later than her usual check out time so I didn't have to tow my bags all over while I did a few last minute errands, which I was soo thankful for! 

Overall, we had a great stay at Anna's apartment, and I recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle! 
"
45802	1556170	10.0	9.0	39004823	Anna's place was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle. We did not rent a car, so it was great to have a bus stop right outside the front door. The neighborhood was a little noisy with the fire station across the street, but it didn't bother us. I would absolutely recommend staying at Anna's apartment. She was easy to communicate with, her directions were easy to follow, and the apartment was very clean. Thank you, Anna! p.s if you're looking for a good restaurant in the area, I recommend The Oak (just a few blocks down the street).
45803	1556170	10.0	9.0	43028160	"Nice place outside the busy-ness of the city, but still close enough to get to get into the city. Easy access with a direct bus which stops right outside the building, and also easy access to the airport via the train which was a quick bus ride (or you could do a 10 min walk). Supermarket near the train station was also handy.

Anna's place is exactly like in the photos and Anna was also quick to respond to questions through airbnb or sms which was also appreciated.

Thanks!"

The owner Anna helped me a lot!!!
Anna was always available for questions.

10 minutes drive to downtown Seattle
Will love to come back to Anna's place

Thank you Anna"
45805	1556170	10.0	9.0	44274757	"The apartment was very clean, bright and spacious and as documented in the listing and all essentials were provided. The large fan was very necessary as the apartment heated up during the day. The location was near a busy intersection and so was noisy, as was Seattle in general to our ears.  The environment was pleasant with a large park closeby and Italian, Mexican and Phillipino restaurants a short walk away. Bus stop was at the door and light rail station was accessible by bus or on foot. Stairs were not very suitcase-friendly.
"
45806	1556170	10.0	9.0	46145236	The place was super close/convenient to downtown and the apartment was more than I was expecting. This was my first time using Airbnb and I intend on using it again.
45807	1556170	10.0	9.0	47959482	"I stayed here while visiting Seattle for a workshop at a studio in the Stadium area. The apartment's proximity to the light rail made it easy to get to where I needed to be each day and to get to downtown. The interior is exactly as it looks in the pictures. The apartment is remodeled and very clean. Anna was very helpful with tips for the area and answered questions quickly. 

I travel alone all the time so I'm used to paying special attention to my surroundings. The 10 min walk to the light rail station was no problem at all during the day, but I'm not sure how I would have felt walking around alone late at night. If I had not had friends drop me off each night, I likely would have taken an Uber versus the walk, but bus 36 does stop right in front of the apartment. The market right next to the rail station was nice for snacks. There were 3 or 4 cute restaurants nearby that I definitely would have tried had I not had plans downtown. They looked to be very popular. The park that is on the opposite corner from the apartment was hopping on Saturday morning with runners, walkers and youth sports. It was a nice place to get in a short run with a great view of the city. "
45808	1556170	10.0	9.0	48893748	"I stayed at this apartment over a long weekend in September. This apartment is located fairly close to the airport, which was very appealing. There are several bars, restaurants, and cafes within walking distance. 

The apartment was clean and the host, Anna, was easy to communicate with. I would recommend this apartment. "
45809	1556170	10.0	9.0	50438702	Working with Anna was wonderful. She was super accommodating and very helpful. My in-laws were visiting to meet our newborn and don't have much money to spend and Anna allowed them to check in for a couple of days and then stay with a relative in between and check back in for the remainder of their trip. She was lovely and always checked in with us to make sure they got in ok. The apartment is clean, in a wonderful location and easily walkable to restaurants, the light rail, the park, etc. I'd recommend this place for sure.
45810	1556170	10.0	9.0	50858133	"Apartment was exactly as listed. Everything was very clean; kitchen was outfitted with the basics. Conveniently located on a bus line; bus stops just outside the apartment. The traffic sounds are quite noticeable in the apartment, particularly in the living room, but I had no trouble sleeping at night. If you have a car, there is parking available behind the building.

Anna was an extremely responsive and thoughtful host."
45811	1556170	10.0	9.0	52315570	We really enjoyed the condo.  Anna answered all of my texts promptly and with excellent information.  Condo was spotless when we entered.  My wife commented that she didn't think anyone had ever stayed there.  It looked exactly like the pictures online.  It is located in an older neighborhood, but a clean one.  A little noisy due to traffic, but we live by a busy street so that didn't bother us at all.  Just a couple of suggestions:  A TV channel lineup would have been helpful.  Also an extra blanket in the colder months.  And a pen and some paper would have been nice.  We discovered a great shortcut to the downtown area avoiding the freeway, and we loved that.  It took us right by the two sports fields on the way.  All in all it was much more fun than a motel.  We love Seattle!
45812	2486612	9.0	9.0	10790788	Thanks so much to Genjo, Dana and Michael for welcoming us at a moment's notice. We were rolling into Seattle after a long road trip not sure of where we were staying that night and within minutes of requesting, they replied and readied the place for us. We were honored to be their first airbnb guests in their beautiful and quiet apartment atop a zen meditation center. It's located in a nice suburb within walking distance of some great restaurants (try the Mexican place around the corner) and very easy and close to all major metro areas. My only regret is not taking them up on their offer to join the meditation class but we were all to tired after the trip. I definitely will if I find myself In Seattle again. They were also very flexible with our schedule and let us book a second night on the spot. I can't recommend their accommodations and hospitality highly enough. Thanks!!
45813	2486612	9.0	9.0	11388109	"Dana who is the building manager met us promptly when we entered and we did not even give notice to when we would arrive (we didint know) The apartment was quite large and lots of room for two people. It was colorful and lots of windows on the second floor. Furniture and decorations were cute and didn't take up too much room. We were left peacefully although we were mostly out in the city. Dana also recommended some food and parks around the area to see. 

There is a meditation center downstairs and we were offered to join in but had no time. The back yard is gorgeous with plenty of parking on the gravel spaces. We will definitely come back on our next trip down. "
45814	2486612	9.0	9.0	11808323	"I was in Seattle on business and wanted a quiet, restful place to stay and sometimes work. The ""Zen"" apartment was just what I needed. The apartment was larger than I had expected, airy, peaceful, and bright. The neighborhood was quiet and full of spring.  We enjoyed the garden behind the house, Genjo was an excellent host, responsive to emails, and accommodating when we missed a ferry. And Dana was great in showing us around. We'll be back!"
45815	2486612	9.0	9.0	11902534	We only stayed over night, but the place was clean, comfy and well kept. We we greeted and treated really well and had a great stay. Thanks!
45816	2486612	9.0	9.0	12011041	"Had a perfect stay -- very easy to check in and out, the apartment was *great*! We had everything we could want -- kitchen, table, bath, towels -- and we slept soundly. The apartment was as well taken care of as the pictures look.

We are looking forward to staying here on all our return visits to Seattle."
45817	2486612	9.0	9.0	12242076	"This was the best place to stay. It was so clean and quiet that it was easy to concentrate, meditate and get centered. The garden was lovely, and the kitchen was perfect for me. I hope that I can stay here again in the future (but actually join the larger group for meditation!).

Thank you again. Lovely people and a lovely place."
45818	2486612	9.0	9.0	12505062	"Genjos apartment was a good place for a night. The Zen garden is very nice, and the neighborhood seemed quiet with lots of cool restaurants nearby.

Even though the listing says it sleeps 5 people, please bear in mind that the apartment is optimally set up for two people.

The location is outside Downtown Seattle, so be prepared to take transit or drive."
45819	2486612	9.0	9.0	13146329	The Zen apartment is an oasis of peace, with a lovely garden, in a quiet neighborhood.   I felt completely safe walking around in the evening.  A public bus was a block away, making it easy to get around the city without taking our car.  Having an off-street parking space to leave the car was a plus.  Two of us stayed in the apartment and I slept on the pull out single bed----it was amazingly comfortable!  The two hosts, Dana and Genjo, and both were very helpful and made check in and check out easy, and they provided information about the neighborhood, making it easy to find what we needed.  I would definitely stay here again, primarily because of the quiet atmosphere.  The building does house the meditation center, so I would hope guests would both be attracted to it because of that and respect the peace and quiet of the building.  
45820	2486612	9.0	9.0	13675135	This place is awesome!  Host and place are perfect. Bring your own food. Nearby aGreat Indian, coffee, and market within walking. Very easy to either take public transportation or drive your own car to see all the sights in the vibrant city of Seattle. Enjoy
45821	2486612	9.0	9.0	15859843	"Our stay at the ""zen"" appartment was   enjoyable. The appartment is conveniently situated in a quiet neighbourhood and it is easy to access downtown Seattle. Dana was a perfect host and she was available to help us.

Merci beaucoup.

45822	2486612	9.0	9.0	16458196	A friend and I traveled to Seattle as part of our West Coast vacation and stayed in Beacon Hill on a recommendation from another friend. This apartment was comfortable and quiet -- perfect for a three-night stay at the tail end of a long trip. Our host welcomed us warmly when we arrived, and we immediately felt at home in the bright, spacious living room. Everything was clean and neat, and we loved the little extras, like the high-quality handsoaps and the handy packet of information about the neighborhood. We left on Sunday morning feeling rested and grateful. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!
45823	2486612	9.0	9.0	16687663	Lovely simple apartment, quiet with all the necessities.
45824	2486612	9.0	9.0	16747626	Genjo and Dana were wonderful hosts. Good communication prior to the trip, met us when we got there to let us in. The apartment had everything we needed, great location, short and sweet stay. Thank you for having us. 
45825	2486612	9.0	9.0	16973170	My wife, 13 year old son and I are from England and we recently spent 4 nights at the apartment.  Firstly do not be put off by the title - this is a great place to stay.  The location is good - a quiet residential neighbourhood with restaurants and a very good grocery store close by  (lots of information made available by the host) and the bus stop to get down town (15 mins on the bus) is only a couple of blocks away.  The apartment is comfortable, spacious and very good value for money - large living room, with good sized kitchen, bathroom  and bedroom.  We didn't meet Genjo as he was away but Dana and Carolyn who also live in the block couldn't have been more helpful - thanks ladies for being of assistance.  
45826	2486612	9.0	9.0	17122621	Staying at the Zen apartment was an excellent experience. The place was clean, nicely furnished, the bed was comfy, and the building was very peaceful. We were also happy to have good food and coffee within walking distance. Sally, who greeted us, was very kind and made us feel right at home. I would absolutely stay there again.
45827	2486612	9.0	9.0	17141645	We had a great stay at the Zen Apartment. Lots of light with the large picture windows. We came in at the end of the day and left early the next day. The apartment was a  great size. It was quite warm but the space had great ventilation. The grounds are beautiful!
45828	2486612	9.0	9.0	17240717	Very friendly and communicative.  We were booked to stay at the Zen apartment, but due to my mother falling ill, was not able to make the trip to Seattle.  What I can say is that Genjo was understanding, and communicated well, and the next time I am in Seattle I will be looking to rest here first.
45829	2486612	9.0	9.0	17431723	The apartment was exactly as listed. Dana was a great host, and was accommodating with our late night arrival. The area around the apartment was nice and quiet at night, and the apartment was very clean. It was about a 10 minute walk to the light rail, which was very convenient to downtown and the airport. I would definitely look at staying here again next time I am in Seattle!
45830	2486612	9.0	9.0	17573134	"We had a great stay at the ""zen"" apartment. The apartment was comfortable and spacious. We did not meet Genjo during our stay. However, Dana, 
who lives in the same building was extremely kind and helpful. She made check in/out easy and was available when needed. She also provided some helpful hot spots to check out. The location was not too far from downtown. We had a car and there was always parking available on the block. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and hope to visit Seattle again soon! "
45831	2486612	9.0	9.0	17693982	The zen apartment was very spacious and clean, and the neighborhood had some cool restaurants to check out. Unfortunately, we were only able to stay one night, but the time we spent there was enjoyable. No complaints!
45832	2486612	9.0	9.0	17787326	We had a lovely stay at Zen Apartments. Genjo contacted us before our visit to give us directions and it was easy to find. We felt safe leaving our car parked out the front. Jaye met us with a warm and friendly welcome and helped us settle in with lots of recommendations of the area. The apartment was clean and peaceful. Plenty of room for 3 people - 2 in the bed and 1 on the couch. We appreciated the clean towels and bathroom products that had been left. Some coffee would have been nice for the coffee maker but there was a great cafe around the corner that did really good espresso! Wish we had tried some of the bars and restaurants, nice area! Great stay for one night. Thank you! Some guidebooks on Seattle and some more brochures/flyers would have been nice! :)
45833	2486612	9.0	9.0	17820628	"We were met by Dana, who was extremely accommodating by letting us check in a little early. Dana was very kind and helpful. She had even left a little plate of brownies for us. There was a printed version of the guidebook, so we could find places in the neighborhood.

The apartment was everything promised: quiet and clean, quite comfortable, and exactly the type of place where I would take my mother when she comes for a visit. The gardens were amazingly beautiful, much more so than the pictures here represent. I highly recommend spending some time out in them. The kitchen was adequate for our short stay. The stove was great, and we had the wonderful surprise of a brand new waffle maker.  It even had a blender if one wanted to make smoothies. When my mom comes, I'll also have to set something to cooking in the crock pot while we explore the city. Fridge was great, clean and plenty large enough, and had a large amount of ice ready for our use. Thanks, Dana!

There were three of us staying, and we had considered staying in the ""nice"" hostel, but we wanted more privacy and quiet. We totally got what we wanted and felt this apartment was a great value. We were minutes away from where we wanted to be, but we felt isolated from the noise of the city. The neighborhood was really nice and friendly. We definitely want to stay here again so we can spend time exploring the neighborhood."
45834	2486612	9.0	9.0	17948535	Clean, bright space. 4 adults stayed very comfortably at this apartment. The host was very kind and welcoming, and even provided a list of nearby amenities. Close to the highway, which is very convenient but can be a bit noisy if you are a light sleeper. All in all a good experience. Thank you!
45835	2486612	9.0	9.0	18067328	"Could not have picked a better place to stay. 
Genjo and Dana were very responsive and helpful with advice on what to do around the area. 
I recommend taking part of the various zen activities that take place throughout the week--a true gift. "
45836	2486612	9.0	9.0	18502111	The place was clean and definitely Zen. Not far from downtown at all. Jaye was super helpful and full of positive energy! I would definitely recommend.
45837	2486612	9.0	9.0	18944603	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!! The apartment is so centrally located, only a 20 minute bus ride to pike place market and downtown. Jaye was so friendly and helpful, the next time we are in Seattle, we will definitely be staying here!!! Thank you so much!!
45838	2486612	9.0	9.0	19146577	"Awesome, loved it. 

Very peaceful, great neighbourhood. Exactly what we needed. We'll be back!!!

"
45839	2486612	9.0	9.0	19676159	The host rep Jaye, was available and made us feel welcome. The apt is as pictured;  wifi available, no tv (which I loved)!  Great neighborhood, especially since our oldest son and family lived about 6 blocks away.  Light rail, grocery store, restaurants and great park for kids but a few blocks away.  We would stay here again
45840	2486612	9.0	9.0	21085762	"The apartment was spacious, as described, with easy access to buses and the rail. 

We could check in once we arrived in Seattle, before the ""official check in time"". We were warmly welcomed at the door. 

We enjoyed our visit to Seattle."
45841	2486612	9.0	9.0	21127250	Genjo was so accommodating to us to check in early and  set up the apartment very nicely. While we only stayed for one night, the space was great for the five of us and the neighborhood is beautiful. 
45842	2486612	9.0	9.0	21656165	What a fantastic, cozy, and peaceful respite from the busyness of our trip! My mom and I stayed here with my 16-month old don and couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. The rooms were comfortable and spacious, the hosts very welcoming yet not intrusive, and we discovered one of the best coffee shops we have ever been to right around the corner from us. All in all a fantastic place to stay. We will definitely be back!!
45843	2486612	9.0	9.0	22061603	Our host's assistant was very welcoming but looking back we would have found a caution about the uneven front steps and info about the coin laundry more helpful than the introduction to the toaster and coffee maker. This apartment would be better advertised as a comfortable place for two sharing the very nice bedroom. The bedding and extra beds in the living room were inadequate for an 8 day stay. My friend and I were dismayed that it took over a day for a response to a complaint about the clunking refrigerator (compressor) and that it was not repaired or replaced (we turned it off at night, which was a poor resolution). The neighborhood was wonderful: beautiful, quiet and convenient to everything we wanted to do and see.
45844	2486612	9.0	9.0	22468865	Our host was very warm and helpful.  My questions were answered almost immediatly.  I loved the place very clean, quite, comfortable, spacious and welcoming.  I was in town for a conference and was able to get some work done while in the apartment. The apartment is in a central location with serveral restuarants and coffee places to go to if you want to dine out or a well equiped kitchen if you want to prepare your own meal.  Genjo and Jaye were very nice and helpful. 
45845	2486612	9.0	9.0	22559631	Enjoyed our stay at this very cute, ckean, quiet apartment on Beacon Hill. Host was very responsive and friendly,  check in and check out were easy and convenient.  Would definitely stay here again!
45846	2486612	9.0	9.0	24343715	"Nice welcome, waiting for us at the door. A small booklet with information about the neighbourhood is provided, which is a nice touch. 
Bedding was OK for 5 people (two couples and one person flying solo) for one night, but would not recommend that much people for more than a few nights.
Bathroom was kinda old, but clean. Linen and soap provided."
45847	2486612	9.0	9.0	24516386	"The place was perfect for our time in Seattle. Quiet and perfectly located, this appartment had a lot of character. There were coffee shop, pubs, and good restaurant around, which was very convenient. 
I will definitely stay there again!!
Thanks for your hospitality, Genjo! We had a great time!"
45848	2486612	9.0	9.0	25458404	The apartment was really nice and quiet. The neighborhood is safe and close to a number of amenities. No TV in the apartment, which makes sense given that it's in a meditation center. Host was gracious and accommodating. 
45849	2486612	9.0	9.0	26408434	Genjo's place was in the perfect location, 2 blocks from the light rail, in a clean, quiet neighborhood with great street parking. There was plenty of space for the two of us, and when a third friend joined us it was still roomy with plenty of beds. Great kitchen amenities and bathroom. Excellent stay for the price- great value!
45850	2486612	9.0	9.0	26986482	The ultimate recommendation is that this is a return to the zen house for Jim and me.  Quiet, clean, everything we need w/in walking distance. The best is that it's only blocks from our son and his family!  Nice to see Jaye again and know he's just across the hall if we need anything.  Reminder, no tv (wonderful) but internet is on site and readily available.
45851	2486612	9.0	9.0	29473959	Genjo and his staff were very accommodating as our flight was late and so we were late in arriving at the airbnb. The location was in a nice quiet neighborhood very convenient to the city.  We enjoyed our stay there.
45852	2486612	9.0	9.0	31658522	"Genjo and Seiho were wonderful hosts and we had an amazing time staying here. The apartment is extremely quiet and close to Jefferson Park, as well as some small shops. Parking near the apartment was easy; there was always a spot in front of the building, even closer to the front door than the parking lot in the back.

Seiho, especially, was really wonderful and accommodated all of our needs. We have a 9-month baby, and Seiho went above and beyond by bringing us extra supplies and baby wipes. He was so kind and understanding, and such a friendly person.

Thank you so much for a great stay in Seattle!"
45853	2486612	9.0	9.0	32084069	The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
45854	2486612	9.0	9.0	32177144	Great location and cute apartment. We booked this unit for family who was coming to town to help assist after the birth of our baby. Unfortunately the baby ended up getting sick and our family felt that it was better to stay at our house to better help us. They stayed one night and ended up canceling the rest of the stay. Genjo was very accommodating to our unforeseen cancellation and quick to respond to our emails. 
45855	2486612	9.0	9.0	32440457	This place was very nice, clean, peaceful, and comfortable. I would definitely come back to stay here again.
45856	2486612	9.0	9.0	32799923	Quiet and clean apartment with restaurants and other amenities nearby.  This part of town is a bit outside of the normal areas I stay, but I definitely would stay here again.
45857	2486612	9.0	9.0	34139749	"We felt very welcomed indeed by Seiho. He was enthusiastic and helpful and gave us advice on where to eat as well as encouraging us to visit the park close by which did have ""killer-views""! "
45858	2486612	9.0	9.0	34800025	My sister and I stayed at the apartment when we took a class in Seattle..  We were welcomed at the time we had set for our arrival by a very helpful and friendly host.  The apartment was just as advertised.  It was simple and we had plenty of room for two to sleep.  The futon in the living room was comfortable as was the other bed.  The neighborhood felt safe and local restaurants were good.  The light rail station was a quick walk, 10 mins, and then we were in Seattle in 10 minutes.  Jefferson park is a 5 minute walk and it has a spectacular view of the city. We had no needs or questions, but our host checked with us as we were heading out to be sure we  had everything.  It was rather hot the week we stayed but the windows open at night and the overhead fan made it comfortable.   I would stay again.
45859	2486612	9.0	9.0	34872202	This was a very peaceful location that was even closer to the train then we had planned. We needed to be downtown by 6am and this was perfect place to crash. There was the main bedroom and 3 additional sets of beds to choose from. The garden was beautiful and overall we both plan to go back here next time we are in Seattle
45860	2486612	9.0	9.0	35228622	Genjo's Zen apartment was well equipped very clean in a good quiet location on a direct bus route into downtown Seattle near a great coffee shop Victrola. Due to jetlag we did not get to meet Genjo but he provided keys to let us get in and was very responsive to our texts and emails.
45861	2486612	9.0	9.0	35451637	Genjo was a wonderful host! He was waiting for us when we arrived and did a mini-walk through of the apartment. The building and the  neighborhood was very quiet. The apartment was conveniently located to a grocery store, coffee shops, the highway and public transportation-I hardly used my car. Having a place to go that was not your standard hotel at the end of a long sight-seeing day made the trip to Seattle a great one! 
45862	2486612	9.0	9.0	43626709	"The ""Zen"" Apartment was just perfect for my dad, brother and me. It was super spacious and warm- we really felt at home with the fully equipped kitchen and the lovely garden outside. The beds and pull-out couches were all very comfortable and we slept very well. We arrived really late at night, but Seiho stayed up to wait for us! He also provided us with everything we needed, from plenty of soap for the bathroom to suggestions on where to hike near Mt. Rainier! He was a fantastic host and we can't thank him enough for sharing the space with us. The apartment is really close to the Beacon Hill stop for the light rail and several buses for getting around, and there are plenty of great restaurants and coffee shops in the area.
I highly recommend you stay in this apartment if you need some Seattle air and want to be in the North Beacon Hill area. It's truly a great home."
45863	2486612	9.0	9.0	44467131	A lovely and clean flat in a peaceful location away from downtown but still close to everything (Light Rail station only a few blocks away, 4 stops to downtown). More than enough space for a family of three. The flat was quiet and the gardens were lovely. We visited the park next door which had lovely views of the city too! We didn't meet Genjo during our stay, instead Seiho was in contact with us and was very helpful with everything. Overall a great experience.
45864	2486612	9.0	9.0	45372569	Wonderful stay and friendly people! Apartment was close to the light rail and convenient to city. Clean and comfy place atop Beacon Hill. Plenty of on street parking too!
45865	2486612	9.0	9.0	46131453	"Genjo was very accommodating with our stay, answering our initial queries within the hour and then inviting us to book. During our stay we hardly saw him as we were out and about, but he and one of his building members were around if needed. The apartment itself was located a short 5 min walk to the Seattle Subway and had all the local amenities needed (grocery store, local restaurants and bars, independent coffee house). During our stay we cooked in as much as we dined out, utilizing the kitchen.

The apartment itself if quite nice as a single bedroom, but we comfortably slept 4 taking advantage of the futon, fold-down couch, and the hide-a-bed chair in the main room. As well, the only noise from the area was either the occasional plane flying in overhead or the occasional siren from the roads. The apartment is a tucked on a side street which is nice and quiet, but close enough to main access roads to get onto the freeway or large road arteries.

If I'm returning to Seattle in the future, this spot will be at the top."
45866	2486612	9.0	9.0	46559035	We were a little thrown off by the apartment being part of an actual zen retreat center vs. being a zen like building. There was a foul smell from some hunters/fisherman that had previously stayed there and I wouldn't say the place was dirty, but it was in need of a clean. Genjo himself was a good host and very nice.
45867	2486612	9.0	9.0	47495673	Fantastic location, close to light rail.  Nice apartment, had everything we needed.
45868	2486612	9.0	9.0	47938244	We were in town for my cousins wedding and had a little trouble with the key exchange process.  Check-in was after the start of the wedding and to get the key we needed to meet with the host.  This became a hassle quickly and I think finding a way for guests to access the apt. Without needing to coordinate meeting would really help.  We ended up racing over between the wedding and reception but were a bit earlier than we predicted and couldn't get ahold of anyone so ended up having to go back to the reception late and without the key still.  
45869	2486612	9.0	9.0	48145744	Genio and Seiho were both gracious hosts and accommodating.  This spot is in a nice neighborhood and extremely quiet.  It is located a few blocks away from the underground and close to a few coffee shops. 
45870	2486612	9.0	9.0	51195080	Our host was the best!  He sent us a text welcoming us, and then another text one day later, just to check in and make sure everything was OK.  The location is great- it was not too hard to find or get to where we needed to go in Seattle.  Also, we thoroughly enjoyed the art that is hanging up around the apartment, not a necessity, but a definite plus!
45871	2486612	9.0	9.0	52091351	We stayed at Genjo's apartment on the last day of our two week trip and it was wonderful. After his wife welcomed us at the house, Genjo also showed us around the apartment telling us everything we needed to know (public transport, where to find towels and so on). The unit is very clean, calm and the neighbourhood is neat and we directly felt comfy. There are a couple of bars around and public transport (Link Light trail) is easily accessible. We would definitly come back again. Thanks again for a wonderful last day in the States.
45872	2486612	9.0	9.0	54271996	My boyfriend and I were greeted by Seiho, who works with Genjo and was very friendly and helpful! He was easy to get in contact with through text messaging. The space is plenty for 2 (or more) people with a full kitchen and two futons in addition to the bed. It's close to the freeways and taking local streets to downtown Seattle was not an issue. It took less than 15 minutes during non-rush hour commutes! Overall it was a great and convenient place to stay. 
45873	2486612	9.0	9.0	54554713	Great
45874	2486612	9.0	9.0	54963847	Thanks for the hospitality. Very welcoming, clean and a great location next to plenty of good eats. Would recommend to anyone!!
45875	2486612	9.0	9.0	57914102	Jaye is always available to greet us, whether we are on time or delayed for some reason.  We love staying in Beacon Hill; we are within walking distance to our son and family. As stated in listing, the apartment is close to stores, restaurants. Walk to the light rail station and go downtown!  Apartment is great, everything you need; wireless available, no tv (hooray). It's our first choice for accommodation when we visit Seattle.
46085	202174	10.0	9.0	1841393	We had a great time staying at Apryl's place. I was a little nervous about booking for the first time. But so glad we did, her place was a really great location. If it works out I would love to stay again at Apryl's place.
46086	202174	10.0	9.0	2183736	This place surpasses all expectations of a vacation rental. It felt like we were being treated to a private modern resort. The style is fabulous and uncluttered, but it somehow was also homey and comfortable. The hosts were very accommodating and thoughtful.  Its location is ideal (close to Capitol Hill, downtown, Lake Washington, and Puget Sound ferries) and the value is very good. Its open plan is on 3 levels: kitchen, living room, and bedroom. So super cool! 
46087	202174	10.0	9.0	11091763	Talk about ideal rental! This place was amazing. The pictures don't do it just to some extent. Beautiful house. The heated floors were so nice. The backyard was the perfect oasis. The soaking tub big and relaxing. It was so great I was almost afraid to touch anything. However Apryl was very encouraging to take advantage of everything. We walked to a grocery store nearby but used Uber for getting downtown. She also picked us up from the train station which was so nice! Easy check in, easy check out. Great overall experience. We will definitely be renting this place again when we return. 
46088	202174	10.0	9.0	11245414	"My husband and I recently spent 6 nights in Apryl's beautiful home. Her home is thoughtfully laid out and well designed. The first floor entry includes the kitchen, a dining table and a private patio. The second floor includes a full bath, living room and office space. The third floor is the master bedroom and bath. The master bath was my favorite space in the house. Dual vanities, a vaulted ceiling with a skylight, a large soaking tub, a stone tile shower and heated floors. Honestly, I miss the bathroom already. 

Apryl's home is close enough to all the action of the Pike/Pine corridor on Capital Hill but far enough away to enjoy the quiet. We had a car for our first few days (hooray for a dedicated parking spot) and then walked and/or used uber to get around the rest of the time. There's a Trader Joe's nearby so we were able to stock up on essentials. 

Overall it was a wonderful experience. Apryl was very nice (met briefly upon arrival) and communicative. Her home was everything we needed and more. I would gladly stay again in the future. "
46089	202174	10.0	9.0	13155061	This property is AMAZING!  The pictures do not do it justice.  We spent 3 nights here in May and found everything to be wonderfully appointed, and within walking distance to great spots in the city.  Having a dedicated parking spot was super convenient, and the kitchen and it's amenities made us not want to leave this peaceful place.  What a cool spot! 
46090	202174	10.0	9.0	13346134	Apryl and Erick's home is beautiful and they are very gracious hosts. If you appreciate modern design and attention to detail, this is the place to stay. The location is ideal. I'd definitely stay again!
46091	202174	10.0	9.0	14397388	We had a wonderful two nights at Apryl's- it was near the end of our trip and I was excited to cook for ourselves since we had eaten out for every meal for over a week. The kitchen was so fun to explore- lots of gadgets to play with! We did venture out for food too and there are plenty of places within walking distance and April gave us some recommendations. It's a quiet complex and like everyone else has written the decor is fantastic. A perfect escape and just a few minutes drive from the downtown area. Thank you both for hosting us!
46092	202174	10.0	9.0	14581441	Absolutely lovely place, very modern and comfy. Apryl was very quick with responses and gave great recommendations. Great location, my girlfriend and I couldn't have been happier. Quick walk to the international district and downtown. 
46093	202174	10.0	9.0	17688250	"This was our first time staying at an air bnb property and staying at Apryl and Erick's home sold us on this way of travel.  Our family of 3, including 18 year old son, spent 4 nights at Apryl and Erick's home. First, the location was great to access anywhere we wanted to go in Seattle. We were on a road trip and appreciated the assigned parking space so we didn't have to search for street parking. There was plenty of space for all three of us, with the master suite on the top floor. The second floor included the TV room, a small bathroom and office that doubled as the second bedroom for our son. At the end of a long day of sight seeing, we took full advantage of Netflix on the Apple TV to wind down. The kitchen is on the main floor and is very well equipped. We only ate breakfast here, as we wanted to experience the Seattle restaurants, so we didn't take advantage of all of the amenities in the kitchen or the grill on the deck.

Apryl greeted us when we arrived with all of the info we needed to enjoy our stay in her home, including an instruction sheet. She also had fresh flowers and a chilled bottle of Chardonnay waiting for us after a long day of travel. Apryl also responded quickly to any questions we had.

We would recommend Apryl and Erick's home for anyone wanting a home away from home in Seattle."
46094	202174	10.0	9.0	19532745	"Apryl and Erick's gorgeous home is amazingly modern, comfortable and decorated in good taste! We were welcomed with a delicious bottle of wine. We especially enjoyed playing in their fully equipped kitchen being such foodies we are. Overall we would want to stay at this place everytime we visit Seattle. Thank you Apryl and Erick for being such amazing hosts!!

Best,
Cole and Pınar"
46095	202174	10.0	9.0	20189157	"It was a pleasure to stay at Apryl and Erick's quiet, smoke- and cat-free condo during my work trip to Seattle, because I too am allergic.  As someone who has been involved in environmental stewardship since college, likes to recycle materials, and with a green building credential, it was a special treat to stay in a green-built home with some furniture that they make from recycled wood. Their place is very clean; they had put out a bottle of local wine, and granted access to a fully-outfitted kitchen, which--although I enjoy cooking--I had no time to enjoy. There is a charming deck in back which I imagine would be fun to hang out when it's not raining. As others have written, the master bath is a welcome place of soaking quiet after a long day at work. The block where they live is undergoing transformation and there is a mix of older small homes and newer condos. Except for getting drenched by the rain, I had no problems walking back and forth to my work site in the International District about 18 minutes away on the first two days. When I told my clients that I was doing that, they recommended that I get rides at night because the walk goes through a few ""sketchy"" blocks. I used a local bus with a very helpful bus driver one night. On my last day I signed up for Uber whose service was great. I used Yellow Cab from and to SeaTax airport and had great service with them too.

The one bit of ""sightseeing"" I did was to visit the fantastic Central Public Library, about 30 minutes walk from their home. If you love books, community spaces, innovation or libraries, CPL is definitely worth a visit. 

Although my hosts were out of the country, communication with Apryl by text and email was prompt throughout, and they made access easy for me. I'm sorry their place is not available for my next work trip, for I would surely ask to book again. I recommend Apryl's and Erick's condo without reservation!"
46096	202174	10.0	9.0	20761705	Apryl's home does a great job of immediately setting you at ease and helping you feel comfortable.  From the warmth of the radiant floors to the relaxing, mid century style, this house was everything we had wanted on this trip and more.  We even took the chance to enjoy a nice long soak in the tub, appreciating the beautiful, Pacific Northwest light that trickled in. 
46097	202174	10.0	9.0	28828516	"This was our first time booking with Airbnb and I must say that Apryl's home truly set the bar for what an Airbnb should be. The entire home was clean, tidy and welcoming. We were expecting the place to be much smaller than it actually was which was nice! We are Apple employees so it was great to find a modern place with great technology and art throughout the home - just as it was advertised on the Airbnb website. The first floor - the kitchen - is probably the most beautiful aspect of the home, so if you enjoy cooking/baking then this place is a must! They have all of the high end, modern cookware and appliances to get your hands dirty, and then clean again! There's a record player with a small library of records to set the mood as you cook or eat. This is a 'no shoes' type of home - but the heated floors save you from cold feet. The living room and office are nestled into the second floor. There is a large flat screen hooked up to some top of the line Bowers & Wilkins surround sound speakers as well as an Apple TV and they also have cable for channel surfing. There is a computer which is not for guest use - bring your own, the wifi is fast and reliable. This second floor is also where you'll meet the first bathroom, complete with shower/tub combo. On the third and final floor, you'll be greeted with an awesome, firm queen sized bed and the lovely master bathroom which has a full size soaking tub as well as a huge shower (separate). There are also his & hers sinks and heated floors. Also, since they didn't have a hair blow dryer, she went out of her way to purchase one & we came down to the table in the kitchen with a brand new one waiting. The washer/dryer are pleasingly hidden within the bedroom closets. There is a tv which has basic cable. There's also a radio which takes auxiliary so you can plug your phone or music player in to play your own tunes. There are windows galore in this home - whether it rains or the sun is shining, you can take it all in no matter where you are in the house! The back yard wasn't put to use by us but there is a grill and plenty of seating for a few guests. 
 Apryl was so easy to work with & very accommodating. It was an awesome first time AirBnb experience!
"
46098	202174	10.0	9.0	49273970	Check-in was super easy as Apryl leaves a keybox in front of the home. Upon entering, a bottle of wine and letter made the experiencing feel welcoming. I was a little disappointed to find that the bed sheets had hair within and also came across a white stain (size of 4 quarters) on the bedding. I contacted Apryl and she assured me that the bedding was cleaned, but it still felt weird to sleep in the bed after finding the stain. Also confusing was that the post listed that it came with essentials, but I had to go out to buy shampoo/conditioner/body soap. Maybe my standards have been skewed from other Seattle Airbnb experiences?
46757	8409975	9.0	9.0	50137623	"It looks like the photos, it's very clean and comfortable. There is a lot of space to hang out but also your own room for privacy. In the morning we had breakfast for free and we could use the big kitchen. 
It is a little bit out of downtown, but the bus station is very close (6min walk) and you will need 45min to get from there to the city."
46758	8409975	9.0	9.0	50974533	This was my second stay at Dario's place. The experience is more like staying in a small private hotel more than a persons home. Which I like. There are several Airbnb rooms so the house is setup for guests with common areas and kitchen access. Bathroom is shared by several people, but there was never a problem with wait time. I will be returning.
46759	8409975	9.0	9.0	51100914	This place is great. There's a lot good that could be said but for brevity...comfortable bed, great breakfast options, nice location a quick bus hop from downtown like strips, peaceful neighborhood, and really friendly hosts. This is a SOLID option for travelers looking for a comfy environment. 
46760	8409975	9.0	9.0	54621512	"I never met the host but the room was really nice and comfortable. We had a good time. 
Mahalo "
46761	8409975	9.0	9.0	55236991	My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights while visiting his brother who lived nearby. The instructions for getting in and out were crystal clear, thanks to Alessandro. The front door is code operated, and super convenient. We met a woman when we first came in, and it was a little confusing at first as to who she was. It turned out that she was the manager of the place. She briefly showed us around and quickly disappeared. We didn't get to meet either Alessandro or Dario. The rooms and bathroom were clean, we stayed in one of the downstairs bedrooms. The radiator worked great, the mattress in the Carousel room is super soft, but comfortable. The downstairs is overall kind of dark, with mostly IKEA furnishings and kitchenware. There is plenty of breakfast options that they provide, which was really nice. Having access to the kitchen was a bonus. The other housemates were generally really quiet and respectful, we didn't have any trouble falling asleep, although footsteps overhead can be heard. Overall, we had everything that we needed, and it was a good base camp with all the conveniences. But if you're looking for a place with more life, love, and human interaction, this would not be my top choice. 
46762	8409975	9.0	9.0	55582733	Dario is very proactive, responds quickly and is clear with information regarding a stay at his house.  The room and the whole house were clean and having use of the washer and dryer are really great perks.  Would love to stay here again!
46763	8409975	9.0	9.0	56289336	The host was amazing! We felt right at home and everything was as we expected it. 
46764	8409975	9.0	9.0	56412729	This host and accommodations are highly recommended for avid and new travelers alike. The Carousel room is cozy and inviting. The home is spacious, well kept and well stocked. If you approach with a good disposition meet new people; this place is a nugget of gold.  
46765	8409975	9.0	9.0	56582745	Clean convenient and good amenities. 
46766	8409975	9.0	9.0	56689646	The house was very clean and overall accommodating.
48635	215882	10.0	9.0	694346	Julie's place couldn't have been more ideal for me. I felt zen. Totally comfortable. Enjoyed a dip in her hot tub under the moon and had lovely walks around her neighborhood. Julie is an absolutely delightful soul. I think half of the books in her cottage are titles I already own. I loved browsing her collection of spiritual and poetic texts. The fireplace and complimentary tea were the icing on the cake - doesn't get more cozy than that! 
48636	215882	10.0	9.0	722198	My wife and I had a fabulous stay at the Garden Cottage.  We really enjoyed walking near Lake Washington and eating in Columbia City.  We can't wait to book another trip and stay with Julie.
48637	215882	10.0	9.0	736146	Julie's cottage is a beautiful, balanced space of open light and close comfort. Wonderful for a respite yet easy to re-route into downtown mode - a straight shot into the city. Thank you the warm welcome in the cold, late night, Julie! Look forward to a return some day. 
48638	215882	10.0	9.0	771827	The private garden cottage is a lovely place in a great Seattle neighborhood, near Seward Park, Lake Washington and the delights of Columbia City.  The cottage is clean, quiet, and the hot tub was a special treat after long work days.  Julie was a wonderful host and check-in and check-out simple.  I would recommend her place and hope to stay there again.
48639	215882	10.0	9.0	925921	Julie was fantastic. The cottage was so warm and welcoming. It was super clean, and even cozier than the photos. The fireplace was more than sufficient to heat the place and although the hot tub looked extremely inviting, I didn't get a chance to indulge - maybe next time! I will definitely stay here again.
48640	215882	10.0	9.0	972375	Julie's Private Garden Cottage is beautifully designed and appointed. Though a small space, it has a cheerful, uncluttered feel. If we had visited during warmer weather, we would have taken advantage of the patio space in Julie's lovely garden, and might even have used the hot tub which she generously offered us the use of. Julie is a thoughtful hostess. She quickly provided us with a few small items that added greatly to our comfort. We enthusiastically recommend her garden cottage to anyone looking for an attractive, tranquil place to stay in south Seattle.
48641	215882	10.0	9.0	1005392	Julie's cottage worked out great for me.  It is very light, airy, quiet and peaceful, with beautiful and simple decor.  The outdoor hot tub, set in a zen garden, was very inviting but I didn't have time to use it due to a busy week with family.  Julie provided a floor mat for an extra guest I had two nights and I understand it was comfortable.  The pilot light of the gas heater went out due to a power shortage one night but Julie came promptly to restart it.  I was there during a cold snap but the cottage held heat well and there was a back-up electric heater in addition to the gas heater so no problem.  This location is convenient to public transit.  All in all a fine experience.
48642	215882	10.0	9.0	1067198	Even though it rained pretty much the entire 4 days, the property is very beautiful & peaceful.  Julie was very kind, thoughtful and helpful.  We had a wonderful stay here.  Considering I had to remain in the room for a last 48 hours of our stay (after my surgery) this was the ideal place to be stuck in!
48643	215882	10.0	9.0	1127445	Lovely airy and bright studio with a very comfortable bed and lovely heater that took the morning chill right out of the air.  the hot tub was very clean and comfortable.  Julie was the perfect host with many recommendations of places to visit and eat. We will definitely be back!
48644	215882	10.0	9.0	1150055	"Julie was a very gracious host, and her cottage is just as appears in the photos.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the room, the bed, the kitchen area, and the atmosphere.  The only downside was the internet, which although fast in the seating area outside, became significantly slower inside the cottage.  It was certainly sufficient for email and web browsing, but Skype is difficult to use inside.  

Overall, I would recommend Julie's place to anyone looking to experience Seattle and have a nice relaxing time!"
48645	215882	10.0	9.0	1217190	Great location! Great host! Great Stay! Charming cottage with easy access to both the SEA airport and downtown seattle.
48646	215882	10.0	9.0	1242415	"Our stay here was perfect! The cottage is just as lovely as pictured, and has a light & bright feel to it. We loved using the cozy fireplace and relaxing in the hot tub. The icing on the cake was the amazingly beautiful garden...so impressive! Julie was extra sweet as a hostess, and her kitty Ursula was friendly and absolutely adorable. We would love to return if we're ever back in Seattle.  

"
48647	215882	10.0	9.0	1373455	Julie's cottage is beautiful, in a great location near the Columbia City shops and convenient to the light rail to go downtown. We had a really lovely stay and Julie was a wonderful and accommodating host.
48648	215882	10.0	9.0	1390892	Julie was a gracious host, very helpful. The cottage was very beautiful, but the location was less than desirable. I went out for a walk one night to enjoy the nice weather and was warned by the police that it was a very bad neighborhood and I shouldn't be walking around...that I was in the middle of gangland.  
48649	215882	10.0	9.0	1454786	Great stay with Julie and we will return often.
48650	215882	10.0	9.0	1481247	We stayed for three nights while visiting Seattle. The location was great- easy access to downtown, highways and the airport. The property was thoughtfully designed and landscaped nicely. Free parking was available right in front of the property. The other homes on the street were well maintained.     
48651	215882	10.0	9.0	1524865	Nice, clean, and serene.  Enjoyed our stay.
48652	215882	10.0	9.0	1557060	Very nice place and within a few minutes drive of the downtown area.  Came to town to watch my fiancé do the Rock and Roll marathon.  He loved having the hot tub to come back to!  We loved the cat - who seemed to be waiting in front of the door every time we opened it, waiting for a head scratch! Overall, a very good first time experience with airbnb
48653	215882	10.0	9.0	1614174	Julie was very nice and gave us lots suggestions for restaurants and things to do in the area, which was very helpful. The cottage was adorable, but sadly we did not have time to use the hot tub! :( But we still had a great stay! 
48654	215882	10.0	9.0	1675818	"This is a very clean and welcoming space in a quieter part of the city. The hostess is very friendly and willing to help as needed.
Rating: Both thumbs up!"
48655	215882	10.0	9.0	1699847	We stayed here for 3 nights. It was a very sunny and relaxing place.  The bed was comfortable.  It was very clean and fresh smelling.  The gardens were beautiful, and the hottub was a treat.  The host was friendly and offered directions to local places to dine and things to do.  Overall, it was a great experience, and I would not have traded it for a hotel.
48656	215882	10.0	9.0	1824105	Great and very clean cottage in Columbia City (short walk from Rainier which has lots of nice restaurants/cafes) with a friendly host, which gave us very good tips for activities and restaurants for our short stay.
48657	215882	10.0	9.0	1889737	My husband and I ended our honeymoon trip to the PNW with 2 nights at Julie's Zen Garden Cottage. We were greeted by Julie, who gave us directions for local transportation and restaurant recommendations in the Columbia City neighborhood. We loved the tranquil space of the cottage, which was clean, calm, and comfortable. The hot tub was an excellent way to relax after walking the hills of Seattle. We were so pleased with every aspect of our stay and Julie's affable and helpful communication throughout the process. We would love to visit again!
48658	215882	10.0	9.0	2110500	Julie's cottage is clean, cozy and private with lots of sunlight and a friendly cat for company. We loved waking up early, turning on the radio, grinding our own coffee and taking a dip in the hot tub each morning before exploring the town. I'd love to stay in this place again sometime in the future!
48659	215882	10.0	9.0	2193699	Excellent cottage. Location is great as well; close to nice restaurants, Seward Park and also both the airport and downtown Seattle.  Julie kindly accommodated a couple of my last minute requests, and she makes sure that you feel at home at this nice property.  I highly recommend Julie's cottage to anyone visiting the area.
48660	215882	10.0	9.0	2253317	Had a great time! Such a lovely place and Julie was very friendly and informative of community events, etc. 
48661	215882	10.0	9.0	2276315	"My boyfriend and I chose garden cottage while traveling Seattle. we LOVE and enjoy it!  it is a lovely and quiet place for (email hidden)nvenient location to go to downtown Seattle and Seattle int' airport. Julie is so nice giving us suggestion for restaurants and places. She knows Seattle really well. OH! and the lovely cat Ursula. both of us miss her so much after we left. 3
I highly recommend garden cottage! "
48662	215882	10.0	9.0	2321956	It was nice—exactly as described.
48663	215882	10.0	9.0	2430710	Julie was very pleasant and her cottage was really cute and comfortable. If I could give her an extra star for the jacuzzi, I would =) It was so nice to relax in the jacuzzi after a long day out in the city.
48664	215882	10.0	9.0	2497427	We have only one 'complaint' about our stay and that is having arrived, it was hard to leave! All to say, the place is lovely, the setting restful, the moon cooperating 'fully' with our hot tub experience and Julie was truly a lovely and responsive host. This is the place you want . . . 
48665	215882	10.0	9.0	2721444	Julie's garden cottage is a lovely tranquil spot - small but comfortable and cozy.  
48666	215882	10.0	9.0	2809184	We celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary with a Seattle weekend get-away and Julie's Garden Cottage was perfect!  It was such a wonderful change from the typical motel experience.  It was private, quiet, and beautifully restful.  We hope to return sometime.
48667	215882	10.0	9.0	2937506	The cottage was as described. Just the feeling of never have left home. I would come back & experience it all over again.
48668	215882	10.0	9.0	2982653	"My partner and I had a great experience at Julie's garden cottage.

The hot tub was the perfect way to warm up after spending the day exploring Seattle in chilly November. A tiny gas stove was enough to keep the cottage warm and cozy. The bed was comfortable, and the light and airy space was a joy to come home to. 

Julie was particularly helpful in giving structure to our spontaneous (aka unorganized) trip. She recommended a great diner a few blocks away, and even wrote up an itinerary for the rest of our trip to Point Roberts and Vancouver. 

The last day, Ursula the cat made a cameo appearance. She and Julie made us feel right at home.

I'd be back to the Garden Cottage to experience Seattle in the Spring or Summer!"
48669	215882	10.0	9.0	3028200	We were very comfortable in Julie's guest cottage. The weather was mostly blustery west coast winter rain but the gas fireplace kept the cottage cozy and the hot tub was great after a run along Lake Washington. Julie was a welcoming host and  gave us a list of local places to eat and activities in Seattle. We enjoyed exploring Columbia City. We would like to return to Julie's cottage in warmer weather so we could enjoy her beautiful garden, morning coffee on the cottage porch looks like it would be heaven. 
48670	215882	10.0	9.0	3477255	"We had a great time at Julie's. I loved the proximity to Columbia City as it's one of my favorite Seattle spots and close to good friends. Staying with Julie allowed us the autonomy to do our own thing but visit who and what we wanted without all the small talk. I enjoyed the hot tub! 

"
48671	215882	10.0	9.0	4216973	My Granddaugher and I loved our stay at Julie's Garden Cottage.  It was homey and bright and provided for our every need.  Having such a quiet retreat after our busy days in bustling Seattle was just what was needed to make the visit perfect.
48672	215882	10.0	9.0	4341597	My husband and I enjoyed our comfortable stay at Julie's garden cottage while visiting our son and daughter-in-law in Columbia City. The cottage is in a great, wonderfully diverse neighborhood, and is lovely, inside and out. Every object in the cottage reflects Julie's discerning aesthetic and desire to create an enjoyable experience—from the twinkle lights to the bamboo flooring to the prints on the wall. And the garden is delightful—I enjoyed sitting on the deck in the mornings, smelling the lilacs. Julie is thoughtful and interesting. I enjoyed talking with her about her work and gardening.
48673	215882	10.0	9.0	4484296	The cottage is great, and Julie is very accommodating. Would recommend over a hotel. The only slightly inconvenient thing is the location, but Seattle's public transportation is reasonable that this isn't really an issue if you have some patience (this place is close to the light rail).
48674	215882	10.0	9.0	4604882	Julie's place is very relaxing and she is a great host. The hot tub is great after a day exploring Seattle - it was the perfect retreat for a quick weekend away.
48675	215882	10.0	9.0	4692311	When my husband and I pulled up we were a little concerned we might not get the privacy we are accustomed too.  We were pleasantly surprised that even though the cottage was in Julie's backyard we completely felt we were alone.  The cottage is so charming and the hot tub was an excellent addition.  We would definitely recommend Julie and even stay again if we are in the area. 
48676	215882	10.0	9.0	4972075	"What a GREAT cottage! The garden was very relaxing and it was just far enough away from Downtown Seattle. It felt like we could really get away from the crowded streets.  The bed was comfy and the ceiling fan really helped, it was pretty warm for early June.

Next time we might even get into the hot tub :( 

The trip was for my wife's birthday and she loved it!"
48677	215882	10.0	9.0	5025932	We enjoyed staying in Julie's cottage. It was very clean and simple. Easy to feel comfortable and relaxed in. It was very quiet at night. Great area, close to Seward Park. 
48678	215882	10.0	9.0	5346984	"Julie's cottage is really nice and I had a relaxing time, chilling out in the sun and hot-tub!

She's very attentive to any questions you might have."
48679	215882	10.0	9.0	5387926	"This place is lovely!! The cozy studio has many windows including skylights, smells great and had great energy. We had just come from staying in a place 4x the size, but loved this one so much more. Not to mention you have access to a hot tub! Julie was great and so helpful. 

It is somewhat of a distance from city center, so you need to be ok with that. The result though, is that you get to escape the city intensity and stay in a space that doubles as a yoga studio."
48680	215882	10.0	9.0	5509550	My mother and I stayed in the garden cottage for five days while i was in town looking for apartments. It was so nice to come back every evening to a homey place! The cottage gets a lot of light and the garden area is beautiful. Julie made sure we were comfortable the whole time, giving us tips on places to check-out and even putting in an air conditioner when we got very un-Seattle temperatures of 90 degrees. The cottage is in a great location, as it is an easy walk up to the main restaurants in Columbia City and to the light rail (we returned out rental car early because it was so easy to get around on the light rail) which is 20 minutes to both downtown and the airport. Additionally, if you like to run- or take a nice walk, it is also very close to Lake Washington, which is beautiful. I definitely recommend staying here to have a comfortable visit while you are in Seattle!
48681	215882	10.0	9.0	5600688	We were very happy with our stay at the Garden Cottage.  It's an adorable place with everything you could need!  
48682	215882	10.0	9.0	5700397	I cannot recommend Julie's cottage enough. It was the perfect space for the two of us and Julie was an amazing host. She was attentive yet allowed us private use of her beautiful back yard. We considered kidnapping her to come landscape our home! It is a zen retreat in the middle of a bustling city and is perfect for a couple or single person. I don't know how well it would work for families but I did see she had extra bedding gear available.  Tips and tricks: if you're like us and are used to a dark bedroom you might want to consider an eye mask. The window shades here are light and there are also great skylights but it all makes for bright mornings! :) Second tip it took us a minute to figure out: the best way to get some cool air in at night is to crank open the windows and clip the shade up a bit. Works so much better than the fan on the window unit (and you don't need air at night in Seattle with the cool temps).  Again, all the positive reviews are for real; Julie's has created such a unique space and we recommend it completely.

The hot tub was heaven.  The cottage itself couldn't have been cleaner or more attractive, and the garden -- gardens, really -- were a delight. This ""relaxing garden cottage with hot tub"" has our highest recommendation."
48684	215882	10.0	9.0	6269860	My college roommate got married in a community center just 5 blocks away from this cottage, so the location was perfect.  We never needed a car since the light rail was able to get us from the airport to the cottage and to the International District, Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market in no time.  I recommend getting an Orca card before arriving for easy public transportation.  We soaked in the hot tub, used the mini fridge and coffee maker and lounged in the serene garden space on a daily basis.  Staying in the cottage really made me feel like I had a 'home' during our Seattle visit.  Julie was quick to respond to my questions before our visit and was able to accommodate our request for two keys for the cottage with only a days notice.  Thank you for sharing your space, Julie.  
48685	215882	10.0	9.0	6372703	We had a wonderful stay at Julie's place.  Although we didn't get the chance to try out the hot tub, we really enjoyed relaxing in the chairs outside.  Her backyard is very well landscaped, and was wonderful to retreat back to after our days exploring Seattle.  Her place is a short walk to the light rail station, and an even shorter walk to some great restaurants on Rainier Avenue.  Julie was a great host! 
48686	215882	10.0	9.0	6420963	Amazingly calm, relaxing retreat. Julie couldn't have been more accommodating. 
48687	215882	10.0	9.0	6512703	Julie's Relaxing  Garden Cottage is indeed very relaxing with a pleasant space and wonderful garden to enjoy. Julie is friendly and easy to deal with and her space is clean and comfortable. The cottage is located within walking distance of Columbia City, a great neighborhood to visit while in Seattle, and also close to Lake Washington and all it has to offer. I highly recommend the Relaxing Garden Cottage.
48688	215882	10.0	9.0	6598314	This cottage is very private, and comes with a bonus kitty cat! The inside is clean, comfortable, and has details that make your stay that much better - dvds, books, tea, etc. I would highly recommend this place, especially if you have a car to get around Seattle (we did not try public transportation, but I hear it works well too). The park nearby was great for a morning jog as well.
48689	215882	10.0	9.0	6663727	Wonderful community! Great local places to eat such as Geraldine's and Both Ways. Lot's to do within walking distance. The cottage is light and peaceful, Julie is an excellent hostess.
48690	215882	10.0	9.0	6807039	Julie was such a great hostess! She even offered to pick us up from the light rail since we arrived late at night! The cottage was beautiful, clean, and in a great location for nearby activities as well as access to downtown. We only wish we could've stayed longer!
48691	215882	10.0	9.0	6900768	"Derek and I made our way from Portland to backcountry (email hidden) Helens and Mt Rainier to Seattle. Instead of sleeping on an air mattress at a friend's studio apartment in Ballard, we opted to book two nights at Julie's cottage.

The cottage was a lovely space; bright and airy, small but not cramped. Both nights we quickly fell to sleep on the super comfortable mattress. In the mornings, we opened the French doors to the patio and adjoining garden to enjoy the cool summer morning. I would have loved to have seen the garden in full summer bloom!

Central Link, the light rail system, was a great way to get downtown. It was a bit of an uphill hike to get to the station but we didn't find it strenuous, just worth noting.

We spent most of our time exploring and enjoying the city so we didn't see Julie much but she was very friendly and responsive to emails and text messages about our trip plans. Her garden cottage provided us with some inspiration for the small house that we'll be building in the coming year."
48692	215882	10.0	9.0	6942944	What a lovely home and great location! Julie was extremely hospitable. The little apartment is separate from the house, and we had the backyard space all to ourselves when we wanted, including the hot tub... but we also really enjoyed bumping into her and having a chat. I can't say enough about what she's done with the garden and how relaxing and homey it was. Also just a few blocks from the thriving Columbia City neighborhood with good food, funky shops, and even a VERY convenient light rail station to downtown. The drive isn't that bad either if you're used to Seattle or city driving. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend Julie's place for its charm, privacy, and warmth. It made me want to move to Columbia City!
48693	215882	10.0	9.0	7223273	Great relaxing space. The hot tub at the end of the day was fantastic. A little bit out of downtown but the little local Main Street had some great restaurants. Would definitely stay here again especially if we just wanted to relax and see the parks and neighborhoods close by. Julie is a great host.
48694	215882	10.0	9.0	7311540	Really enjoyed our stay at Julie's cottage. Secluded and super comfortable bed - also Julie was really helpful with nearby food choices and spot-on. We ate well! all in all, thoroughly recommended
48695	215882	10.0	9.0	7398394	We stayed here right after our wedding - it was a little piece of heaven. Very quiet, clean, smells great, and great hot tub. We would walk to breakfast just 10 min away. We got some much needed R&R. 
48696	215882	10.0	9.0	7529702	"Lorrie and I enjoyed our weekend retreat at Julie's cottage. It was everything we hoped for. Julie was a gracious hostess although we spent most of our time in the city so we didn't have much of an opportunity to visit with her and her kitty Ursula.  

The accommodations including the hot tub were great. The bed was very comfortable and although I prefer a darker room to sleep in, I was able to get two great nights of sleep.

The cottage was very clean and peaceful.

I especially appreciated the Keurig coffee maker and complimentary coffee in the morning.

At Julie's suggestion, we had dinner at Tutta Bella's and breakfast at Both Ways Cafe.  Both were small and friendly with lots of character and good food."
48697	215882	10.0	9.0	7603813	Julie's space was beautiful! Clean, bright, comfy, and exactly what we were looking for. Julie was welcome and friendly but also gave us space to ourselves. We enjoyed the hot tub, access to the well-stocked kitchen area, and comfy bed. The amount of natural light in the space was delightful and you can see how much she paid attention to each detail in making it a comfortable space to stay. Highly recommend staying here!
48698	215882	10.0	9.0	7705983	We LOVED the garden cottage and had an absolutely fantastic time! Julie welcomed us warmly, offered totally on-point advice when we asked (including directing us to the Columbia City Bakery about a 3 minute drive away which BLEW OUR MINDS with deliciousness), and gave us our own space when we wanted it. The cottage was a perfect, bright, warm, cozy hideaway with easy access to all the awesomeness Seattle has to offer. We'd definitely stay there again! 
48699	215882	10.0	9.0	7887598	This was an exquisite experience. Julie's cottage is full of light, very clean and well represented by the photographs. I slept peacefully and naturally enjoyed my stay in Seattle. If you want to treat yourself to a special gift, book in here. 
48700	215882	10.0	9.0	7986920	"We stayed with Julie for 4 nights.She was easy to communicate with, even leaving a key out for us when she couldn't be there when we came in.She was full of information about Seattle. The location is good with many nearby restaurants. The light rail is a reasonable walk, and that made the city very convenient. 
    The room is comfortable and clean. There were plenty of towels and extra blankets. I was expecting a bit more of a kitchen-there is only a microwave for heating food. The only other thing missing is closet space. We pretty much had to live out of our suitcase because of the small size of the rack for hanging clothes.
   The hot tub was nice to come back to after a day of walking and exploring. It was always ready for us. The room and garden yard are very private, which was nice, although the window and door coverings are really thin."
48701	215882	10.0	9.0	8030482	This cottage was a clean and cozy gem.  All of the small touches like tea maker, hair dryer in the bathroom, and clean soft sheets made it feel like home.  We would definitely stay here again.  
48702	215882	10.0	9.0	8114498	"This was the first time we have ever used AirBnb and were not sure what to expect.

There are definaltly some pro's and con's to staying here. 
Pro's- It is a beautiful setting! Juie has done up the backyard beautifully! 
- The neighborhood was charming and we felt safe walking around at night.
- The hottub was amazing! So relaxing after a long day of shopping.
- Some really good restaurants within walking distance (10 blocks)
-Julie was nice and made sure you had you privacy.

Con's
-The location is quite a distance from downtown and if you have plans to be doing alot of things downtown or at stadium you are looking at a $25 cab ride or a 5 block walk to the the train.
- The bed was terrible! A futon on a metal frame, the pillows are older than I am and the bedding was terrible! Old and scratchy!
-The bathroom was ok, but so tiny it was hard to get ready . 

We would not stay here agin as it just wasnt convenient for us."
48703	215882	10.0	9.0	8156221	We had a wonderful, peaceful stay the last 2 days of vacation. The space was relaxing and the hot tub was heaven!  It was the perfect place to finish our vacation time.  Julie was friendly, gracious and provided all we needed to be comfortable.  I loved the choice of lighting-- every ambiance of mood was available.  The space was clean, quite, and felt very private. Thanks Julie!  We hope to share your space again sometime; hopefully more than just two days!
48704	215882	10.0	9.0	8234257	"We had a wonderful 2-night stay at Julie's Garden Cottage. Would definitely stay here again!

Super convenient location just a 5 minute walk to the center of Columbia City. The cottage was tastefully decorated and I loved the ambience both inside and out in the garden. "
48705	215882	10.0	9.0	8372248	"We enjoyed the heck out of our stay at Julie's wonderful cottage. She was attentive on our arrival, even though we arrived quite late. She showed us the ropes of the place and got us all set up for our stay. We didn't see her the rest of the weekend, as we were mostly gallivanting about Seattle.

The neighborhood is pretty awesome and we ate a coupla' meals in Columbia City and loved it. A great, diverse, comfortable, friendly vibe. We also did a huge walk along Lake Washington on Saturday morning - maybe the highlight of our trip.

For starters the cottage is SO clean. Coming from a bit of a clean freak, this is always such a delight. Wifi worked great. Bathroom was tight but very clean and good water pressure. A very quiet night's sleep.

The train to downtown Seattle is a little bit of a hike, but totally doable, and once you're on it..zip..you're there.

We loved our stay..we'll be back!

-Ryan"
48706	215882	10.0	9.0	8646237	Really beautiful quarters, and such a gracious host! She was really great to work with, and helped us out with everything we needed. Highly recommended! :)
48707	215882	10.0	9.0	8693218	We spent two lovely nights in Julie's cottage. It's super charming, a short walk up a paved path lined with twinkling lights and opens into spacious courtyard complete with a hot tub (which we were very grateful for after training 6 hours a day). The cottage itself is clean, bright and we'll appointed and Julie is sweet and responsive.  If I end up returning to Seattle, I'll definitely be staying here again :)
48708	215882	10.0	9.0	8821982	Beautiful little cottage meticulously set up-- I was very pleased
48709	215882	10.0	9.0	8910108	We had a very enjoyable stay! Comfortable cottage, relaxing hot tub, walking distance to Columbia City. A bit further to the light rail to Downtown, but very manageable. Highly recommended!
48710	215882	10.0	9.0	9067285	"This was our first Seattle vacation, but definetly not our last!  Julie's cottage is precious. It is light, airy, open and peaceful. It is nicely appointed and comfortable.  We really enjoyed our stay there. 

Room darkening option would have been perfect, but that is the only non provided amenity.  There is no television and for most people that would be a non issue. However, it is football season and my husband is addicted. Fortunately there is a friendly, cozy, tasty sports bar just around the corner,,,perfect!"
48711	215882	10.0	9.0	9425961	The cottage is very nice and cozy, and the view of the garden is lovely. Liked watching the birds outside while have morning coffee. The only disappointment was not getting to use the hot tub due to maintenance issues.
48712	215882	10.0	9.0	9505945	Julie was an incredibly gracious host.  Her cottage is cozy and comfortable, and the hot tub is an added bonus.  Make sure you check out the Columbia City area, which is just a short walk away.  Julie had fantastic recommendations for food and entertainment, particularly Geraldine's.  She was easy to communicate with, and we enjoyed talking with her.  Her cat is sweet, too.  Highly recommended! 
48713	215882	10.0	9.0	9738973	"Julie was a fantastic hostess! She met us at our car and was superbly nice and attentive. She made recommendations of what to see and do and her home was very welcoming. Make a point to jump in the outdoor hottub each night and stare at the stars. A major perk of this lovely home
"
48714	215882	10.0	9.0	10352187	"Julie's relaxing garden cottage is a true hidden gem! Upon arrival Julie was a very accommodating host telling us all about her charming Columbia City, which is the quaint town with some excellent restaurants and shops nearby. The cottage itself is very cozy, clean and nicely decorated and is the perfect size for a traveling couple. The bed was VERY comfortable and the electric fireplace heater kept us warm at night. Julie let us use the jacuzzi every night and was even sweet enough to turn it on upon request when we were out to let it warm up. She was easy to communicate with and I'd give her an A+ for all her help and generosity.  
Great proximity: It was a very convenient 15 minute drive from the airport and only 10 minute walk to the nearest light rail public transit that takes you right into downtown Seattle. Also it was only a short walk to downtown Columbia City. The location was just far enough outside Seattle to not be located in the hussle and bussle of the city, but still only about a 20 minute drive/light rail ride into Seattle. I would highly recommended this location based on our amazing stay! Must Go!"
48715	215882	10.0	9.0	10394890	My partner and I had a lovely time staying at the Garden Cottage! The space is calm, clean, and smells nice. We really enjoyed soaking in the hot tub and snoozing in the comfy bed. Two thumbs up!
48716	215882	10.0	9.0	10547405	Super cute place!  We really enjoyed staying here. The hot tub on a chilly rainy night was perfect. Julie was so nice and went over everything we needed when we got there.  The lite rail is just a short walk (10 mins) away, used it to go downtown.  Would definitely stay here again!
48717	215882	10.0	9.0	10707152	Steve and I had a great time here. The cottage is cute and warm with a comfy bed and an AWESOME HOT TUB! The landscaping in the backyard and the abundant natural light inside the cottage were added bonuses too. Great location because of the cute community, close restaurants, parks and walk on Lake Washington. Thanks you Julie! 
48718	215882	10.0	9.0	11065451	Julie's cottage was a pleasure to stay at. Everything was very clean and relaxing. There are several windows in the small space so everything feels very fresh and airy. The hot tub was also definately welcomed! 
48719	215882	10.0	9.0	11360893	Julie's cottage is a very comfortable place to relax, especially during a rainy Seattle weekend. Great light and very quiet. Quant neighborhood with lots of restaurants and places to walk. Julie is a wonderful host.  
48720	215882	10.0	9.0	11560193	Julie is a gracious host and the garden cottage is absolutely amazing!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
48721	215882	10.0	9.0	11732103	Julie's place was absolutely perfect for what I needed! I messaged Julie last minute and she was immediately responsive to let me know her availability. The hot tub was on when I got in and it was, on the whole, an incredibly relaxing experience. She also gave us tips for our adventure that day and it was spot on advice. Couldn't have asked for more!
48722	215882	10.0	9.0	11906035	Lovely spot. Welcoming and cozy. Julie is a top notch host. 
48723	215882	10.0	9.0	12301815	What a gorgeous place!  Julie was a wonderful host, very responsive and eager to provide recommendations for local restaurants and public transportation.  We really lucked out with the beautiful cottage, backyard garden, and hot tub!
48724	215882	10.0	9.0	12666985	"Lovely little cottage!! Had such a relaxing and refreshing stay, with the hot tub, the garden, (the rain!), and the fresh, clean feel of the inside. Julie was a great host -- communicative and nonintrusive -- and I'd recommend the cottage, for sure. The little center up the street had some great restaurant and it was a fun area to explore. It's a private spot, great for one or two people. 

One thing -- It's super bright inside of the cottage in the mornings because of the skylights, windows, etc., so if you're hoping to sleep in late, this isn't the place. Otherwise, it's probably the place :)"
48725	215882	10.0	9.0	12716646	My husband and I visited Seattle for the time, and this was our second experience using Airbnb. We stayed with friends for a few days during the first part of our trip, visited Portland by train for a couple days and then spent our last two nights in Seattle. Julie's garden cottage was the perfect place to unwind and relax before going back home. Julie was very friendly and communicative the whole time and extremely knowledgeable and helpful in offering advice on public transportation and recommendations on dining. The cottage is very airy, cozy and beautiful. It has amazing light and lovely French doors, and I loved waking up to natural light streaming in during the morning hours. The bed is very comfortable, and the hot tub is a nice bonus! Columbia City is a charming little neighborhood with plenty of restaurant options. Access to the light rail is about a 10 minute walk away, and the #7 bus stop to downtown is a quick couple blocks away through a park. Beautiful cottage and a great neighborhood! Thank you, Julie, for your gracious hospitality.
48726	215882	10.0	9.0	12783751	This is a fantastic place!  It is beautifully designed and appointed.  It's also a very cozy place to be on a rainy day.  It had everything I wanted and I highly recommend it.
48727	215882	10.0	9.0	13186436	My friend and I had a lovely stay in Julie's cottage. It was our first visit to Seattle, and we found Julie to be very welcoming and helpful. The cottage was clean and bright, and the hot tub was a wonderful way to relax after a day out on the town. We enjoyed the Columbia City district, which is within walking distance of Julie's cottage, and has some super cute restaurants, and some great live music. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle, and I would stay with Julie again in a heartbeat.  
48728	215882	10.0	9.0	13431227	Julie was wonderful.  Her place is very nice.  Beautiful garden.  The cottage was perfect for our romantic getaway.  Wonderful location.  Just a really good choice all the way around.
48729	215882	10.0	9.0	13578829	Julie has a great place in an interesting part of Seattle.  Julie knows quite a bit about the history and makeup of the neighborhood.  Her garden cottage is well set up and is a great and convenient place from which you can explore and discover.  I'd like to stay there again.
48730	215882	10.0	9.0	13734168	"Such a lovely sanctuary with a helpful and generous hostess! We watched goldfinches flit in the birdbath and garden with Buddha peering through the leaves. We used the hot tub on sunny days and starry nights. The cute town with good restaurants (Geraldine's - great for breakfast!) was an easy walk and there was lots of convenient public transportation to different points in the city. There was a long city park a block away and Seward Park with its redwoods and water a short bus ride away.
The cottage was small but light-filled and pretty. We were writing in the mornings so spent quite a bit of time there."
48731	215882	10.0	9.0	14397136	"I am so glad I picked Julie's cottage for my trip, my first experience with Airbnb and first visit to Seattle. The space was so lovely--luxurious and yet back-to-basics at the same time. The bed was delicious, and the shower was plenty hot and tall. It was wonderful to come back to the hot tub after long days of gallivanting, and to wake up with light from the skylights and birds chirping in the garden. You can really tell how much care she's taken in creating the space; it's incredibly relaxing. 

I'm not sure it's pictured, but she has a Keurig in the kitchen, which meant I didn't have to hunt down caffeine each morning in a pre-coffee state (which I, and I'm sure the baristas nearby, appreciated). There's a toaster, microwave, electric kettle, and mini-fridge as well. The audio player was awesome--I plugged my iPod in and heard my favorite album in more detail than ever before. 

I rented a car for part of my trip to do a little more widespread-exploring, and I walked and took the Link to and from downtown the rest of the time, which was very easy. Julie is a public transit expert. Ask her about the Gandhi walk! 

Julie was very accommodating when I arrived late at night, and gave me a ride to the Link when I left. As a first-time young solo-traveler, I really appreciated that she checked in on me from time to time, and let me know that if I had an emergency I could call her. After I took a day to drive around Mount Rainier (I hugely recommend this if you have the time), she even called to make sure I hadn't had any trouble and had gotten back okay. 

It was way too easy to fall in love with Seattle and the Northwest from her place, and I'm already planning my next visit.  "
48732	215882	10.0	9.0	14680003	The Garden Cottage was great! My sister and I were able to leave our luggage there after an early flight in, and Julie was wonderful. The property is 1/2 block from a park and about 10 blocks from the light rail. There are great little townie restaurants only about 5 blocks away. We were in town for the Seattle Marathon, and it was wonderful to have a place to stretch out after the event. We walked the 1+mile to Seward Park with a picnic and books and it was well worth the walk! Thank you, Julie!
48733	215882	10.0	9.0	14834375	The cottage is absolutely perfect! The backyard is perfectly manicured and the hot tub is wonderful after a long day of walking around. We would certainly stay again.
48734	215882	10.0	9.0	15002550	"Julie was such a warm and gracious host. Everything in the cottage was clean and it was nicely appointed. Julie was able to inform us of places to visit, eating spots, and the best ways to get around the area. Such a knowledgeable and pleasant person.

The single cup Keuring machine and the yogurts and fruits Julie left for us was a pleasant surprise for breakfast!

I cant say more about our experience and visit to Seattle. We will most definitely be staying here again on our next trip to the gloom Northwest. 

Thanks again Julie!"
48735	215882	10.0	9.0	15380275	My stay couldn't have been more wonderful! Julie was so pleasant & down to earth. She really knew the ins and outs of Colombia city. It was a Staycation for me being a new mom and the hot tub, quiet atmosphere, walking up to the beautiful birds and we'll kept garden was exactly what I needed to work on music, relax, and pamper myself. I will for site be back! Julie was even so nice to invite me to a 4th of July party with her and some friends!  I had other plans arranged but she truly made me feel welcome. She also has a very nice and eclectic book and movie collection. I started reading 3 cups of tea on my down time and truly enjoyed it. Upon my arrival Julie had some breakfast snacks in the refrigerator that I enjoyed and offered me some fresh veggies from her garden. I can't say enough great things about my stay at the cottage! Julie has truly been thoughtful about all of the hard work she has put into the cottage to make it the most relaxing & unassuming getaway! I would go back any day vs. Getting an overrated hotel. Not to mention is located in the PERFECT spot in Seattle. I'll be keeping in touch as I'm local to pierce County, any time I need a little getaway! 
48736	215882	10.0	9.0	15542951	This wonderful retreat was just what we needed after the stress of looking for a house.  The place is exactly as advertised.  Julie was super helpful and a wonderful host.  We liked it so much we are moving to the neighborhood!  If you're around on Wednesdays, check out the Farmer's Market.  We also liked the restaurants and the ease of taking the light rail to downtown.
48737	215882	10.0	9.0	15819610	Julie's place will stay on my list of great experiences for years to come. Every element of her space is considered; you'll feel like you're in a spa or sanctuary. Also, public transportation makes getting to great sites and activities a breeze. However, the neighborhood is cool enough and close enough for great eats, all with a good variety for tastes and budget. Julie made every aspect of getting there, from approval to check-in, easy as well.  Best treat: watching hummingbirds feed when we opened the French doors that open out to the Zen patio and garden. 
48738	215882	10.0	9.0	15989211	This is a very nice little cottage, ideal for one person or a couple. It is well located, close enough to touristy areas by public transport, but far enough to be quiet. Julie was a great host, always ready to give suggestions; interaction with her was moderately high. 
48739	215882	10.0	9.0	16898966	The experience was perfect! We could not have asked for a better location and house. The cottage itself has everything that we needed and more. Its a very efficient use of space and has even inspired me with my future living space plans. The cottage is exactly as described with plenty of privacy! The neighborhood seemed really nice as well! All the houses had their own flavor and style. We were walking distance from the seafair which was the biggest plus! An Uber fare to Seattle was super reasonable and took little to no time at all! It was as if I lived there!
48740	215882	10.0	9.0	18059082	Julie was out of town but she had a friend meet me and make me welcome.  I thoroughly enjoyed my week's stay in this relaxing, quiet environment.  I was visiting my granddaughter and we were able to walk to the playground.  I agree with a previous reviewer that you do need a sleep mask because the cottage has skylights and lots of windows.
48741	215882	10.0	9.0	18397495	The cottage was just as described, clean, light, airy, very convenient to family and wedding we were attending. Julie was friendly, accessible, a great host, providing us with lots of information.
48742	215882	10.0	9.0	18789319	"Hands-down, this beat out any hotel I've stayed in as of late. The cottage Julie has set up is quiet, secluded, and is amazingly well furnished (it also gave me an idea or two to try when I renovate my house).

Julie herself was incredibly friendly, very open to offering information on local places to visit, and was flexible regarding the time-window allotted (I showed up a little early, due to my flight schedule, and she let me drop off my stuff). Adding on to this, she went out of town while I was staying, and she was still reachable via text-messaging throughout this period.

Definitely the best place to stay in the area, I'd say. I'll be putting her cottage at the top of my list for my future visits to Seattle!"
48743	215882	10.0	9.0	19303587	Julie was very helpful and the garden cottage is a beautiful and relaxing place to stay. Recommended!
48744	215882	10.0	9.0	19525519	A spotlessly clean, sunny, open-plan cottage set in a meditative Japanese style garden. The cottage is lovely and situated in the great neighbourhood of Columbia City, with easy access both to the downtown and the airport on the nearby light rail. Communication with Julie worked like clockwork. Julie was a pleasure to deal with. We would definitely stay here again.
48745	215882	10.0	9.0	19738964	Julie was great! She greeted us with some fresh fruit and coffee, and helped us figure out how to get around town. The room was tiny but charming and fit our needs well. You must eat at Columbia City Bakery or Geraldine's down the street!
48746	215882	10.0	9.0	20090655	Henry and I had an amazing time. We love the cottage, felt right at home. The area was very quiet and peaceful. It was close from the airport as well as down town Seattle. We are looking forward to our next visit and will look to book this location again.  
48747	215882	10.0	9.0	20754947	Julie was a great hostess (although she wasn't there much, which was fine with us).   It is a wonderful place to stay in a great part of Seattle.  My wife and I kept commenting on how glad we were that I discovered this place!
48748	215882	10.0	9.0	21048058	"What a wonderful bungalow Julie has set up for her guests. 
It was more than perfect for me as I could come and go without having to go through her home. 
So clean and nothing left undone and all the amenities you need and then some. Wonderful neighborhood with park just across the street. Julie was helpful as she gave me all the locations I had asked for and the area space around the bungalow was so private and quiet. I will be staying with Julie next time in Seattle. "
48749	215882	10.0	9.0	21167925	Julie's garden cottage was exactly as the pictures described! It was clean and cute. The jacuzzi was a big plus! Amazing after a tiring day! Julie was a very gracious host. She gave us recommendations on places and transportation, which was very much appreciated. The location was perfect! Just a short walk from the light rail which was amazing! Would definitely stay again!
48750	215882	10.0	9.0	21341545	We LOVED everything about staying in Julie's guest studio. It was just as she said it would be and even more. Julie was always available and her help in navigating the sights of Seattle was spot on!
48751	215882	10.0	9.0	21545984	Julie was very welcoming and the cottage was beautiful. It was as if the home sprang up organically from her beautiful garden. This was my first time using airbnb and Julie showed us how awesome it can be. Thank you. 
48752	215882	10.0	9.0	21879581	"This cottage is every bit as inviting, rejuvenating and peaceful as the pictures make it out to be - not to mention, the garden surrounding the property is beautiful! The neighborhood itself offers plenty of opportunities to experience life as a local and when you're ready to leave the cottage access to Downtown Seattle and the sights is easy and comfortable to navigate. 
Julie was a wealth of suggestions and they all lived up to the reviews.  She was so gracious and welcoming and has thought of every detail to make the cottage an exceptional get-away."
48753	215882	10.0	9.0	22529070	Julie was a wonderful host! We loved being able to come and go with no hassle. The landscaping on the property is so beautiful. She's really created such a comforting environment.The jacuzzi was so great to come home to after a long day of exploring. The covered patio is great for sipping coffee in the mornings. I can't say enough how perfect this location is. 10 minute drive to pikes market/space needle. 15 min drive to the airport. The downtown Columbia city district was so cute. AMAZING sushi restaurant ( wabi sabi ). Columbia city bakery was delicious as well ! Julie was always available if we needed anything at all or had any questions. I'd highly recommend this cottage for your stay in Seattle ! 
48754	215882	10.0	9.0	23106079	This is an adorable serene private cottage and the hot tub was a perfect addition to an amazing weekend! Julie is super sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. I was in Seattle for a concert and this was hands down a better choice than any hotel! Is very homey an extremely clean and well lit and I loved that there are white Christmas lights neatly hung near the ceiling, they were a great addition! Absolutely loved it.
48755	215882	10.0	9.0	23647167	Julie, was AWESOME!  She accommodated our very late arrival and was very friendly during our entire stay.  The Cottage is very cute. It sits behind her residence. The Cottage includes a wonderfully comfortable bed, a nicely designed bathroom, skylights throughout, a kitchen sink and counters. There was a microwave and refrigerator in the room, and a Keureg Coffee maker. The room was decorated well. The hot tub was a wonderful addition and was very private! 
48756	215882	10.0	9.0	23931942	Very nice stay. Cute cottage with beautiful landscaping and hottub as described. The hot tub alone made it for us. It is about a 15 minute walk to the lightrail and then another 15 minute or so ride into downtown as described... so not bad at all, but not REALLY central, if that's what you're after (it is much more relaxing than downtown though). The area around the house is cute, too - we did end up staying in the neighborhood for one of our nights. Julie was a charming host and she's done a great job with this property.
48757	215882	10.0	9.0	24490112	We didn't get a chance to meet Julie since we were staying over Christmas and she was (reasonably) away with family. Despite that, she did a great job of communicating with us and told us that she was available if needed and set us up with the contact information for her house sitter. This space was really, really pleasant. We LOVED the hot tub at night- perfect for relaxing after walking around the city and we did A LOT of walking. We liked that the place was in a quiet neighborhood but that we could easily access the city. The light rail was a short walk away and it was so easy and cheap from there to get to downtown. We didn't rent a car and were fine. There is a Safeway and a liquor store about a 15 minute walk from the cottage if you want to get some groceries. I would say if you don't plan on renting a car then you should plan on walking quite a bit. The bed really is so comfortable. We didn't really explore the neighborhood a lot because we went in the city everyday but it seemed like there were restaurants within walking distance from there. Overall a great stay at the garden cottage.
48758	215882	10.0	9.0	24682170	Julie was great all along the process - from initial engagement through check-out, she was available and attentive, but also gave us our space to make the place our own. Can't complain about anything except the price, but Seattle is an expensive market overall and this didn't seem to far out of line with the rest of the options on AirBnB.
48759	215882	10.0	9.0	25164637	My boyfriend Calisto and I stayed in the cottage for a couple of days to celebrate both of our birthdays and anniversary in Seattle. Julie was very warm and welcoming. And we were wowed by the cottage that is an oasis amidst the fog. It was nice to stay in a neighborhood that we may not have seen if we stayed in a conventional hotel downtown. Everyone in Columbia City was extremely welcoming. We especially liked the wine tasting and jazz at The Royal Room as well as the all day breakfast spot, Geraldine's Counter (for us late risers). When we wanted to venture to the city, either the number 7 bus or link brought us there in no time. Overall it was a lovely stay. Thanks, Julie!
48760	215882	10.0	9.0	25749473	"Lovely cottage beautifully maintained. Compact. Quiet. Peaceful. Near good restaurants, Empire Espresso, Columbia City Bakery and the link rail station. Easy to downtown and the airport. Excellent neighborhood. Julie's the perfect host. What's not to like?

Highly recommended. 
"
48761	215882	10.0	9.0	25857005	It was a clean beautiful bright quiet place to relax and unwind. Julie was very kind and gave me all the privacy I needed. 
48762	215882	10.0	9.0	26563883	"What a great experience. I asked my girlfriend to marry me at the edge of the bed. It was the perfect setting.

The place was so clean and smelled amazing! It was exactly what we were looking for. I can definitely see why she would use this space as a yoga studio. 

In LOVE! I will be coming back for sure!"
48763	215882	10.0	9.0	26951486	I am a return guest at Julie's cottage and plan to return again. It is bright, cozy and extremely clean, with all the amenities one could need. I highly recommend it. 
48764	215882	10.0	9.0	27567111	The amount of care and attention Julie put into building her garden cottage is apparent the minute you walk through the gate. Such a bright, warm, and comforting place to rest. Beyond the general aesthetic of the studio, Julie herself was an incredible host. She took extra care to introduce me to the city and, on my first night there, went out to dinner with me. It was an absolute treat to stay with Julie, couldn't recommend it more, really.
48765	215882	10.0	9.0	27703793	We loved our stay at the cottage. It was clean, private and comfortable. So bright and lovely. Great location. Julie was great at communicating, she made us feel right at home and gave us great recommendations for places to eat. Hot tub was wonderful after a day of exploring the city. We will definitely be back. 
48766	215882	10.0	9.0	27862559	My wife and I were looking to stay in a relaxed spot in an up-and-coming neighborhood and we hit the jackpot with Julie's cottage. Very clean, quiet, with peaceful vibes and a fantastic garden with several visiting bird species and a lovely view up the hill at night whilst sitting in the hot tub. Everything you need in the little kitchen, and a cute little porch overlooking the garden for breakfast! Walking distance to all the local-owned restaurants and pubs. Also walking distance to a lakeside trail and the old-growth forest in Seward Park which is perfect for a nice walk, hike, bird-watching, nature center. It's a quick drive right into downtown Seattle. Columbia City is a diverse and buzzing little community and Julie's cottage couldn't be in a better spot. We will definitely stay here again. 
48767	215882	10.0	9.0	28228558	Julie's space was a little oasis! It was just as described and the backyard was so peaceful, the perfect setting for a hot tub. Julie was a pleasure and offered wonderful suggestions for food around the city. It is a magical space I would love to stay in again.
48768	215882	10.0	9.0	28365952	Julie's cottage was simply wonderful! Everything was clean and lovely. Thank you for a wonderful stay in Columbia City. 
48769	215882	10.0	9.0	28807814	"I lived in Columbia City for 15 years until moving to Atlanta 2 years ago. Staying at the cottage felt like the sweetest, most comfortable and perfectly located little nest to welcome me back. Julie is a lovely and accommodating host. I didn't get to spend very much time with her with all of my running around, but she is the kind of person you would want to grab coffee with and hang out with at Columbia City Bakery (don't miss it!) Her kind-heartedness is reflected in the space she provides and I'm pretty sure she knows that she is offering a great deal. She could easily change more for the accommodations she is providing given the location and space. 

If you aren't familiar with the neighborhood, Columbia City is exactly where you want to stay in Seattle. It is one of the jewels of Seattle--a cute neighborhood with a lot of local flavor, great restaurants, great coffee, fun shops, and easy access via the bus and Lightrail that is within walking distance. You can take an easy walk to Lake Washington for views of the water and Mt. Rainier, or you can take a walk in the other direction and be in the midst of a fun urban neighborhood. It is also close in to the downtown area, but feels like a peaceful get-away in a quiet neighborhood. 

I plan to come home to Seattle fairly often and the cottage will be my first choice when I return. Thanks Julie! You made my first trip home so comfortable.
"
48770	215882	10.0	9.0	29317443	Julie and her space were both fantastic. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. She warmed up the hot tub when she knew we were heading back, offered an extra key, and was very responsive whenever we had a question. Thanks, Julie!
48771	215882	10.0	9.0	29760795	"Julie's cottage is exactly as advertised--full of warmth and character, comfortable and quiet, and very, very Zen. Julie herself is a fantastic host; she made sure to say hello and chat with us about her favorite things to do in the city. The cottage is well located, and extremely walkable. The exceedingly charming main drag of Columbia City is a short 5 minute walk away, and there you can enjoy great food (Island Soul and Geraldine's Counter are must tries), fantastic art and even live music. Further, the light rail which goes right into Downtown Seattle is a quick 10 minute walk, and even better, it connects to Seattle-Tacoma airport. Our favorite thing was the quiet of the neighborhood. It was great to come home to after long days exploring bustling neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and Fremont. The next time we're in the area, we'll check Julie's house for availability first. We recommend you do the same. 
"
48772	215882	10.0	9.0	30572938	We recently spent two nights at Julie's cottage. It was fantastic, and exactly as advertised -- actually, probably even better. It was very clean, had everything we could have needed, and was very close to public transportation stops. Julie greeted us when we arrived, showed us around, and provided some dining recommendations which were also spot-on. It is also very close to many restaurants and little shops in Columbia City, as well. Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Would definitely recommend to others, and hope to utilize this space again on future trips to Seattle! 
48773	215882	10.0	9.0	31128869	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Julie's cottage. It was a nice little private place close to many Seattle hot spots. I definitely recommend staying at the cottage. Communicating with Julie was also easy, and she was very responsive.
48774	215882	10.0	9.0	31488306	Julie was an incredible host. First time airbnb and I'm hooked! The place was exactly what we wanted... friendly, helpful host, private, and in a great location! If you're looking for a relaxing and comfortable location in seattle, this is it!
48775	215882	10.0	9.0	31702128	I really enjoyed Julie cottage. It was very beautiful, peaceful and she was very warm and welcoming. Julie did everything to make sure we settle into the place. Her garden cottage is perfect for a vacation due to it location and proximity to downtown. Also if you are a early morning jogger, there are great parks around where you can go jog. I will highly recommend Julie place for a stay in Seattle and will definitely be coming back!!! 
48776	215882	10.0	9.0	31964730	Julie's place was absolutely perfect. A little adorable place in her beautiful garden with everything we needed to be comfortable during our stay. It was clean, and private. The location was perfect, within walking distance of all kinds of things. Julie was a great host. I highly recommend this for two people exploring Seattle. 
48777	215882	10.0	9.0	32246044	Julie's abode is truly lovely. The accommodations are very comfortable and relaxing. Julie keeps the space immaculately clean and the layout is well thought-out. There is even a small porch area where one can sit and enjoy the garden area (read: pretty wonderful). As well, we fell in love with the Columbia City area surrounding the cottage. There is no shortage of fun places to eat, shop, and stroll. Would highly recommend!
48778	215882	10.0	9.0	32879933	This was my second time staying at Julie's Cottage.  As before, it was cute and comfortable.  The location is great for enjoying the tranquility of Seward Park or walking to the light rail for a quick trip into the downtown.  Julie is a wonderful host and offered excellent suggestions of areas to visit, places to see, and current performances or events to attend.  The cottage was comfortable and clean, and offered a calm place to relax in her garden and hot tub.  Overall, a very positive experience.
48779	215882	10.0	9.0	33636801	Excellent host. Beautiful place. Accessible and accommodating. Hope to return soon!
48780	215882	10.0	9.0	34244087	Absolutely amazing! We had such a wonderful time in the cottage! It was cute, clean and had the most beautiful garden to enjoy! We will highly recommend to others and hopefully get to stay again ourselves! Julie was such a sweetheart and so helpful! 
48781	215882	10.0	9.0	34534911	The Garden Cottage was excellent! Great location (easy walk to shops/restaurants in Columbia City), comfy bed, and Julie was friendly and accommodating. It was a wonderful experience.
48782	215882	10.0	9.0	34710910	Julie is very friendly and accommodating! She's always willing to help you with anything and also giving an introduction to the neighborhood. Her cottage is just gorgeous and cosy!! My sister and I enjoyed our stay a lot. The cottage is in Columbia City where you'll be able to try some great tasting local food (Empire Espresso and Salted Sea are highly recommended). Also, you can easily get to Seattle downtown from Columbia City by taking 7 bus. Julie's cottage is highly recommended and for sure that we'll be back! :)
48783	215882	10.0	9.0	35074133	This was only our second Airbnb experience, and we are hooked! Julie was a great host – available if we needed her, but gave us complete privacy, too. She responded very quickly if we needed directions or info. Her place is so peaceful, clean, and airy. We loved having the french doors open to the garden and listening to/watching the birds. It was hot when we visited, and appreciated that we could have used the A/C if we wanted, but it was enough to open up the doors for air flow. We also didn't need to use the hot tub or little fireplace heater, but could see that it would be very cozy in inclement weather. We had a very full, long weekend of family reunions, graduation, and other events to attend, and it was so nice to come back to our little oasis at the end of a busy day. It was pretty easy to zoom into downtown Seattle (and elsewhere) from there, and the Columbia City neighborhood is delightful! We had breakfast one morning at Geraldine's Counter (excellent, crowded, and very popular), but picked up croissants and coffee to go at Columbia City Bakery for the days when we had to be somewhere. Have to say, those were the BEST croissants this side of Paris. We'll be dreaming of those... Had a great dinner at La Medusa (Italian/Sicilian). The arancini starter was fabulous... pastas were really good, and garlicky (!). Also loved dinner at Salted Sea - don't miss that one. They have a great oyster selection and the crab cakes were out of this world. Fast forward to the most amazing banana wet-cake with caramel dessert ever. Ever. My husband wanted chocolate mousse, so we ordered that and the banana dish (normally we'd share one), and ended up practically fighting over the banana. He was ready to do a face plant into the dish... Anyway, great stay, fun neighborhood, lovely accommodations – we can't wait to come back!
48784	215882	10.0	9.0	35403083	Julie's place is wonderful!  We felt right at home the moment we arrived, and Julie was a kind, understanding and accommodating host.    Having the hot tub available was a huge treat for us, and I wouldn't hesitate recommending Julie's Garden Cottage to anyone!
48785	215882	10.0	9.0	36062202	Cottage was super cute! We enjoyed our brief stay. We did not get to meet Julie while we were there but she was easily reached by airbnb message. Would definitely stay here again!
48786	215882	10.0	9.0	36655041	My wife and I were in Seattle for work. We turned it into a vacation and stayed at Julie's garden cottage. The accommodations were excellent and we enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub in the cool evenings. Julie was a wonderful host and has a wealth of knowledge of the area. Definitely would stay there again. 
48787	215882	10.0	9.0	36970162	Julie's garden cottage was wonderful for our stay. It's very easy to get to from the airport and we really enjoyed wandering around Columbia City. Julie was friendly and helpful, even installing a larger AC unit in the cottage during the very unusual Seattle heatwave to make our stay more comfortable.
48788	215882	10.0	9.0	37741047	Julie's little cottage was perfect for our two nights in Seattle! The hot tub was so relaxing after a day touring the city. Julie was so gracious and had lots of great tips for us!
48789	215882	10.0	9.0	37986112	A lovely little getaway space.  Came for a Seattle weekend adventure and though this is away from downtown and a bit off the beaten path we had no problem getting where we wanted to go by using public transit or uber.  In fact it was nice at the end of the day to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city and have a quiet space to go to relax.  Will without doubt stay again on future trips to Seattle.
48790	215882	10.0	9.0	38371154	I had a good experience in this cottage for my honeymoon! It is enoough to feel the common house style in U.S. We hope to visit again someday!
48791	215882	10.0	9.0	39372794	Absolutely loved staying here! The cottage was bright and airy. The location was close to several bus stops and the train station, which made getting around via public transportation super easy. It was really nice coming home and relaxing in the hot tub after exploring the city all day.
48792	215882	10.0	9.0	39734476	Great experience! Easy booking, Fabius host and lovely, private stay. Thank you Julie for helping us have a great trip.
48793	215882	10.0	9.0	40892732	The Garden Cottage is comfortable for people who simply desire to relax and spend lots of time exploring Seattle. It is only a few minutes walk away from a street full of restaurants, and a 15 minute drive from the downtown area and several other fun neighborhoods worth visiting. The cottage is clean, with a refrigerator, wifi, and great air conditioning. The bed is comfortable, and the deck is a perfect spot to relax. The week we stayed there was a festival in town, and Julie ensured that we had a saved parking spot and even free passes to the festival. We loved our stay! 
48794	215882	10.0	9.0	41355743	The cottage is great, has everything you need and julie was helpful even though she was out of town. We had no problems communicating with her. The hot tub was perfect after a long day in the city center. It was clean and as you would excprect it. Columbia city is a great neighborhood easy to reach from the airport and the city. I defenetly woud go there again!
48795	215882	10.0	9.0	42116745	Such a great place! looks just like the pictures! Julie was such a sweet host, and had such an elegant little place for us to stay. We are grateful for the opportunity to stay in a relaxed neighborhood rather than a hotel!
48796	215882	10.0	9.0	42587902	Our stay with Julie was wonderful!  We were elated to have air conditioning at this property, due to the unseasonable heat wave.  The Garden Cottage has so much wonderful natural light, with windows and skylights everywhere.  We had the most restful nights and were able to relax for half of a day when we were exhausted after hiking.  The location of the Garden Cottage is perfect for those who want to explore Seattle, without having to stay in the downtown area.  Columbia City was also wonderful to explore, with a lot of great restaurants, parks, and stores nearby.   We felt very welcome here and Julie did a wonderful job providing suggestions of what to see/do and where to dine.    Also, Hot tub!  Who wouldn't be happy to use a hot tub after a long day of hiking... perfect for my aching muscles or just to relax!    Lastly, Julie's yard is amazing!!  You can tell she has put a lot of heart into her landscaping and it was much appreciated.  
48797	215882	10.0	9.0	43034192	Julie was an excellent host and her garden cottage was in a great location within walking distance to Lake Washington, a grocery store and a street with shops/restaurants.  The Light Rail train stop is nearby and easy to get to downtown Seattle.  The garden was beautiful and the hot tub was great to relax in.
48798	215882	10.0	9.0	43662959	Our stay was an excellent experience, Julie was warm and inviting. The cottage was cozy and well appointed with amazing sun light pouring in. and a few blocks away from the light rail station. Columbia City has a great bakery called Columbia City Bakery off of Rainier Street walking distance from the cottage. We would definitely want to stay at her cottage when we visit Seattle again. Thank you Julie hope to see you again in the near future.
48799	215882	10.0	9.0	45065376	Great host & location! Stayed at the cottage two years in a row now, no regrets!
48800	215882	10.0	9.0	45505882	We really enjoyed our time at the cottage! It was close to downtown, reasonably priced, and very quiet and peaceful. The wind chimes were especially lovely and we enjoyed a quick dip in the hot tub after a long day walking around. The town the cottage is in is also very neat to explore! Thank you for a great stay.  
48801	215882	10.0	9.0	45802747	"Julie and her garden cottage were absolutely amazing. The cottage was wonderfully decorated with lots of natural light and extremely clean. Julie was available through phone with anything that you needed and was extremely flexible and accommodating.

Julie was so thoughtful and uber helpful. She alerted us of traffic the morning on our departure. :)

The location is also wonderful! So close to Rainier shops and restaurants. We'll definitely be staying at the cottage should we visit Seattle again!

Thank you Julie!"
48807	215882	10.0	9.0	49219941	We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle and Julie's cottage was perfect — very close to every place we wanted to visit but far enough away that we could get some quiet R&R. Loved coming back to the cottage after hiking or exploring the city. Thanks Julie!
48808	215882	10.0	9.0	50451078	Julie's Garden Cottage was great.  It's located in a nice, quiet neighborhood, and it's a short drive downtown.  We enjoyed our stay.  Julie was pleasant and quick to respond to questions.  
48809	215882	10.0	9.0	52780490	nice host  .had a good time 
48810	215882	10.0	9.0	53118247	Excellent stay, loved the place. Didn't get to spend anytime in the hot tub, but will definitely see if Julie's place is available again on a future stay. 
48811	215882	10.0	9.0	53596187	Julie was fantastic, easy to get ahold of and very respectful. The cottage was absolutely adorable and was everything I expected and more. I took my partner who I proposed to on this trip and had a blast in the city. This location makes getting anywhere in the Seattle metro area a breeze and the atmosphere Julie set up is perfect for a cute romantic get away. The weather was not the best but we did mange to get a little hot tub time in the rain which was a lot of fun. Also want to note, my partner and I are pretty big guys, both 6'4 and around 280lbs, and this place was super comfortable. Overall I highly recommend this listing and plan on booking again come the time. 
48812	215882	10.0	9.0	54361237	Julie was a great communicator and friendly host.  The property is exactly as described.  She made sure I found my way and that I had everything I needed for the duration of my stay.  Nothing but positive things to say... 
48813	215882	10.0	9.0	56369139	Julie’s cottage is a nice, clean, peaceful, well-appointed place to stay.  At first we thought it would be small, but it is so well thought out that it fit us perfectly.  It was bright and airy, even on a weekend that lived up to Seattle’s reputation for rainy weather.  It’s well built and cozy on chilly nights, and the hot tub is only a few steps outside the door.  The neighborhood has some funky, fun restaurants and a small-town feel, even though it’s only a short drive from downtown.  We really enjoyed our time at Julie’s place, and would not hesitate to recommend it to couples traveling to the area.  
49728	8902887	10.0	9.0	52664462	"We had a great stay with Julie and George in Seattle!  Julie responded back within an hour to our request to book, and it was a very easy experience.  

The booking is a mother-in-law apartment on the bottom level of the house.  We were able to enter privately from around the side.  The apartment consisted of one bedroom (with a comfy bed!), one bathroom, a kitchen (with refrigerator and stove), and a living room area.  It was plenty of space for the two of us. The apartment was clean and we had everything we needed for our stay.  

The nicest part was the ease with which we could get into downtown Seattle.  There are two light rail stations within a mile or so from the house.  The closest one is a half a mile away, and it is very easy to get there.  The Westlake stop (downtown) is 8 stops away, and it takes less than 20 minutes on the rail.  We didn't travel on it to the airport, but Sea-Tac was 4 stops away in the opposite direction.  The location made it really easy to be in the city if we wanted to be.  There were also lots of other little restaurants/shops/etc within walking distance from the house.  We ate at a few great brunch places that were very easy to get to.  

Overall, we had a great experience.  We would definitely stay there again.  "
49729	8902887	10.0	9.0	53414118	This was a lovely place to stay! I had the best night's sleep as the bed was unbelievably comfortable and the bedroom was dark and quiet. The whole apartment is cosy and sweet, and Julie was lovely to correspond with. We definitely recommend this place!
49730	8902887	10.0	9.0	54040823	This apartment was very comfy and cozy with lots of privacy and easy street parking. Julie and George had extra blankets, a space heater, tea and coffee for the cold rainy Seattle nights. Cute restaurants close by too!
49731	8902887	10.0	9.0	54663853	Lovely homey experience!
49732	8902887	10.0	9.0	55146214	Julie and George communicated very clearly about how to access the apartment, where to park and answered all the questions I had before we arrived. The location was very central to where we were going and there were a lot of great stores and shops around. The apartment was everything we needed for a weekend. I would recommend Julie & George's space to anyone because the apartment was the perfect size and very comfortable. 
49733	8902887	10.0	9.0	58184958	Julie & George's place was fantastic! Really clean and had everything we needed for a great New Year's in Seattle. Close to the freeway and decent street parking right out front. The tenants upstairs were super nice and respectful. Also the bed was really comfortable. Would definitely stay again. 
49966	788146	10.0	9.0	3067285	"We had a great time in Seattle, and Sedora and the Art House were a big part of our great experience. Sedora was beyond accommodating helping us navigating the transportation system, getting to know the city and even giving us a ride in a pinch. 
It was also fun to be in the Columbia City area of the city. It is a very cool part of Seattle with great restaurants (that Sedora had good recommendations for) a fun destination.
The Art house was creative and fun, as well as warm and welcoming.
We enthusiastically give Sedora and the Art House the highest recommendations.
"
49967	788146	10.0	9.0	4332327	I really enjoyed staying with Sedora!  She was super kind and welcoming.  She is also a world traveller!   Her house is comfortable and spacious.  The room was well-lit and clean, as was the bathroom.  In short, I highly recommend staying with Sedora for your stay in Seattle.  
49968	788146	10.0	9.0	4921137	The Art house and its host, Sedora, are wonderful!  I stayed for 28 days while relocating back to Seattle, the space is great.  Very conveniently located to light rail (a bit of a hike) and the great restaurants / community of Columbia City, this is a great location.  In addition to the location, the room is very spacious and comfortable.  Sedora is a wonderful hostess and made me feel extremely welcome.  Highly recommend staying here if/when you're visiting Seattle.
49969	788146	10.0	9.0	5120361	Sedora was an excellent hostess and I'm really looking forward to going back to Seattle to see her.  I love her area and her house location is easy to find. I highly recommend her house as a fun Seattle stop-over. The room is spacious and the house is clean and cozy.  Her garden is thriving, welcoming and perfect for a personal retreat.
49970	788146	10.0	9.0	5166433	I have nothing but great things to say about Sedora! She is the perfect host and just a great person to be around. Her place is a really cute and neat unit that makes you feel at home. She clearly has an eye for creativity and this comes through beautifully in her house through eclectic artwork, decorations, etc. I could go on forever but I will simply say that I almost cancelled my train to Portland to stay and hang out longer. My time in Seattle couldn't have been any better!
49971	788146	10.0	9.0	5216185	Sedora's room was very comfortable and everything we needed was provided. We had had use of a lovely sitting room downstairs and her kitchen. Sedora is a very interesting and gracious host. We had a lovely time staying with her.
49972	788146	10.0	9.0	5333308	I had a fantastic stay with Sedora and her cat Bijou! The house is lovely, clean, and welcoming. I enjoyed siting in the back garden so much. Sedora was a lovely host and I am so thankful to have met her! She was a perfect, unobtrusive host, but as I was traveling alone I enjoyed her company very much on a hike through Seward Park followed by yummy ice cream. Columbia City is a really fun and diverse neighborhood; I hope to return to explore it more! Thank you Sedora!
49973	788146	10.0	9.0	5514718	Sedora was a fabulous host. She is thoughtful, fun, and flexible. She let me check in early even though I arrived at 8:30am, and showed me around the area. We chatted a lot since we had a lot in common. Also, her cat is adorable. I really enjoyed staying at her house.
49974	788146	10.0	9.0	5819294	Sedona was a wonderful host. From the time I arrived Sedora made me feel completely at home. I had a fantastic time and extended my stay as there was so much to see and enjoy in Seattle and in the district where Sedora lives. Its a short busntrip into downtown, and its on the light rail link so its easy to get to from Seatac airport. there are lovely walks or bike ride down to Seward Park. i could not recommend Sedoras place highly enough and I am definitely going back!
49975	788146	10.0	9.0	5875082	Sedora was a wonderful host and is a lovely person. Her home is a reflection of her hospitality and generosity. It's also a clean, tidy, and comfortable place. I felt welcomed. Couldn't have asked for more. I'm looking forward to my next stay with Sedora; I believe you will, too.
49976	788146	10.0	9.0	5905659	Sedora was a lovely host - friendly, warm, and flexible to our arrival/departure times. Though we were only there for one night, she made us feel welcome and we felt at home, rather than strangers in someone else's house.  Her home was clean, cozy, and comfortable and just a short walk from restaurants, cafes, and delicious ice cream. Thanks again!
49977	788146	10.0	9.0	6053514	"Sedora is a warm and welcoming and generous host...like visiting with an old friend!

The rom is large and light and airy and quiet with a shared bathroom which posed no problem.

5 minute walk to small neighborrhood with amazing bakery and good restaurants.

Very centrally located"
49978	788146	10.0	9.0	6255065	Sedora was a kind and thoughtful host. Can hold a conversation but can also give space.  Her home is warm and colorful - lots of art - and the room was very spacious, comfortable and quiet.  The backyard, which I only ventured into and lounged once because I was usually out and about, was relaxing and reminded me of a book cover of a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel.  It's a 5-minute walk to shops and cafes and Seward Park, which is about a 2 3/4 mile perimeter peninsula jutting out into Lake Washington, is an absolutely awesome place to run along the shore or hike.  Thanks Sedora!
49979	788146	10.0	9.0	6492348	"This was my first AirBnB experience.  It was GREAT because of Sedora.  Really cool house and garden.  The tomatoes are SWEET and Sedora shares!.   

The room is upstairs and the bathroom is (theoretically) shared but we were the only ones to use it while we were in the house.
Both the room and bed were comfortable.

Sedora went out of her way to get local info for us - she even researched bike availability for us before we got there.  (Think twice before biking in Seattle - you will know what I mean when you see the hills.)    

The location was perfect and Seward Park is just a short distance away (1 mile).  Swimming, hiking, picnicing  nature walks etc.

Sedora gets 5 stars from us!"
49980	788146	10.0	9.0	6690633	Sedora was a lovely host and a was very easy to be around. The city was easily accessible through the nearby mass transit systems. Columbia City is a really neat neighborhood with a cute strip of stores and eateries that display the diversity of the area. I'd definitely stay here again.
49981	788146	10.0	9.0	6773730	Sedora was a wonderful host.  The house was amazing.  It was an extremely positive experience and we loved the neighborhood!  I would highly recommend this place to everyone.
49982	788146	10.0	9.0	6849687	I booked Sedora's place for my brother, who was coming in to town from Japan to attend my wedding.  when I sent the inquiry, Sedora responded very quickly, and the booking experience was very smooth.  Sedora is very friendly, and her house is gorgeous!  I was jealous of my brother who gets to stay in such a beautiful home full of arts.  Sedora also shared vegetables from her garden.  She was very flexible with my brother accessing her kitchen and bathrooms etc.  My brother had a wonderful and relaxing stay!  Thank you Sedora.
49983	788146	10.0	9.0	7039996	We had a great stay off the beaten path.  Very economical stay even though had several wedding functions downtown.  The bus stop is a short few blocks away and cost $2.25 to ride to downtown, but does take about 30 minutes for the ride. Very accessible from SeaTac via the light rail-stop is .9 miles away (we walked even though Sedora offered to pick us up)  Don't miss Seward Park and pizza at Tutta Bella in Columbus City, both an easy walk away.  Very quiet and private. We had use of the kitchen and enjoyed preparing dinner from the Farmer's Market.
49984	788146	10.0	9.0	7318726	Sedora was a great host, when all experiences end up like this i will proberbly never go back home :-)
49985	788146	10.0	9.0	7426798	"Sedora's lovely house is exactly as pictured. The bed room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable. Sendora is hospitable and very easy and interesting to talk. And made me feel very much at home...We had also dinner together, great walk and I really loved talking about the differences between our countries in front of her fire place.

Downtown and airport are easy to arrive by public transport.

Easygoing & highly recommendable. Thanks for making my stay so comfortable."
49986	788146	10.0	9.0	7549646	"It was a real pleasure to stay at Sedora's even for just 2 nights. She is a very sweet and accommodating host. 
The house is warm and cosy with a beautiful garden. The room is large and clean.
I felt very much at home and would like to thank Sedora for her genuine hospitality."
49987	788146	10.0	9.0	8177055	Staying with Sedora is a great example of Airbnb at it’s best -- making social connections that lead to incredible travel experiences.  I felt so welcome in her beautiful home, so comfortable and relaxed.  The location of her home is excellent -- close to the light rail and bus stops, an excellent natural foods market, and to the amazing Seward Park.  Very clean, very quiet, and a welcome respite from any amount of dark clouds and rain that Seattle may present to you.  Her cat, Bijou, was also delightfully well mannered and allowed me to brush her and give her kitty treats as well :-)  I am thankful to Sedora for all of her kindness and generosity, and for the wonderful environment she created that made my stay in Seattle so memorable...
49988	788146	10.0	9.0	13692529	Sedora made my stay in Seattle seamless. She responded promptly to emails, went above and beyond to provide assistance with getting around and where to go for anything I needed. Her home is super welcoming and comfortable, and she has the best cat in the world. 
49989	788146	10.0	9.0	21826944	Sedora is a wonderful Host. Her house has an never-ending plethora of eye treats. Her kitty Bijou was fun to pet and cuddle. My room and bed was very comfy. Lovely view. I especially loved that I could use her kitchen and store my food. My daughter was only .6 mile away on the same street and there was plenty of room to park my borrowed car. Thanks again Sedora for sharing your lovely and interesting space with a fellow traveler.
50475	5559063	10.0	9.0	31183563	Apryl was a wonderful host and the location was as awesome as described. Thanks!
50476	5559063	10.0	9.0	34874460	Apryl's townhouse was easy to find and very spacious. I really appreciated Apryl taking the time to meet us in person when we first arrived.
51357	3258213	10.0	9.0	15775255	"Donna was kind and considerate. Our long vacation got to be too much and we just wanted to move in a day early. She was quick to accommodate. Thank you! 

About the house... The photos are a great representation of the home. It was warm and inviting. It was also very clean. The beds were comfortable and Donna left us plenty of information to enjoy the kayaks at the very close lake! Also, there are a lot of great places to eat nearby with full kitchen facilities.

The washer and dryer were a great addition to our vacation. We did bring quite a bit of clothes and other things with us, but it was great to have the w/d close to leave with all of our clothes clean.

I highly recommend this home if you are looking for a centrally located place to call home for a little while. We stayed here for 15 days and we were very sad to leave.

Parking was never a problem. There was plenty just read the signs because there is a school bus area with earlier hours.

We just can't thank Donna enough for making us feel welcome during our first days of living in Seattle!"
51358	3258213	10.0	9.0	16140438	"We spent a marvelous 3 days in Donna's house in Seattle.
The location is perfect for ""the museum of flight"" or an incredible helicopter tour with Pacific Northwest Helicopter or for kayaking on the lake.
Access to downtown Seattle is easy with the I-5.

The house is nestled on top of a hill with a nice garden in the back (we saw hummingbirds and a Jeller's jay).
We specially enjoyed the wide terrace in the back in the house.
The rooms are big and welcoming.

Of course the kayaks are a major bonus, we went on the nearby lake and had a wonderful time (the waters are very quiet).

Donna went out of her way to make our stay memorable (kudos for the fresh raspberries from the garden when we arrived).

We will definitely try to stay there next time we are in the area and recommend the house to our friends ."
51359	3258213	10.0	9.0	17973051	"Donna is such an awesome lady who made our 5 days trip in Seattle. Donna's house is just like a house in fairytales, which is so adorable and so nice. You don'y need to worry about the transportation even if you don'd drive. Because it's so convenient to take bus number 7 to go out. You just need to walk 5 mins to go to the bus station from her house. Nothing is better than have such a great staying experience with this reasonable price. What is more important is you will get to know this awesome lady---Donna!!!
By the way, Cassie is totally recovered now. Thank you again for your care and help, and don't need to worry about her. We miss you so much!!!! We love you! Hope your life will treat you well just like how well you treat it. Have great days. "
51360	3258213	10.0	9.0	18495145	Donna, our host was excellent. From my very first interactions with her, she was more then willing to share information and helpful tips with me about the area of Seattle in relation to her home. She picked us up from the airport and even let us stop on the way to her home, at the grocery. All this was a tremendous help to us and made our travel  much easier. She gave us helpful directions to different places we wanted to go and informed us on bus routes, areas to visit and good restaurants. 
51361	3258213	10.0	9.0	18746937	Staying with Donna was great! She was welcoming and helpful from the moment that we booked with her. She also had great recommendations to help us make the most of our vacation! The room was very comfortable and Donna made sure we felt at home.
51362	3258213	10.0	9.0	19108417	"Donna's warmth and kindness make you feel at the right place from the beginning. She'll do her best to make you feel comfortable.
We especially appreciated to spent some time with her, talking about travelling, cultures and so many different subjects.
Her house is peaceful, you can enjoy the sun on her deck. We could easily have stayed there forever."
51363	3258213	10.0	9.0	19252747	"ホストの方がとても素敵な方でした。日本人学生の1人旅、しかも初めての街だったので不安も沢山ありましたが、オーナーの方が紙に地図を書いてくれたりととても親切にして下さったので楽しく過ごすことが出来ました。

"
51365	3258213	10.0	9.0	19641522	Staying at Donna's place is AWESOME!  She accommodated us last minute and was extremely helpful.  She also extended the bed so that my very tall husband was able to sleep comfortably.  We were not able to use the Kayaks this time, but will definitely do so when we stay with her the next time.  I recommend staying with Donna as this was a positive experience using airbnb.  Thanks again Donna for all your helpful tips and if I am in the Seattle area I will send you a message.
51366	3258213	10.0	9.0	20104256	Donna is not only a host, but also a care giver and a wonderful friend. My mom and I were in a speedy vocation and Donna went out of her way to make sure our stay was comfortable. She have great recommendations for places to visit and eat, but the kayaks at Lake Washington was definitely a highlight of our trip. I have had some bad experiences with my airbnb host previous to this trip and I was honestly expecting the worst. But Donna made our visit in Seattle so wonderful I fell in love with the city as soon as I met her at the airport. I would give Donna a six star out of five, stay with her! You won't regret it!
51367	3258213	10.0	9.0	21088945	I had a great time while my stay at Donna's place. I loved the peaceful atmosphere, the most beautiful patio and the backyard. Donna is truly a great human being, she is kind, generous and very helpful. I felt absolutely at home. Donna's place would me my first choice to stay next time I visit seattle. Also do go kayaking if u are staying here the kayaks are the icing on the cake. 
51368	3258213	10.0	9.0	21243677	Donna was lovely!  She totally made me feel at home.  I had the best time sitting over tea and chatting about our families, life, travels.  She was ready to help me navigate the streets of Seattle, so I could find what I was looking for!  The room is bigger than the pictures and I melted at the view and how comfortable the bed is.  Thank you for a wonderful, quiet time.
51369	3258213	10.0	9.0	21561799	Staying with Donna is like staying with a good friend. We had a great stay at her lovely house in a quiet and safe neighbourhood of Seattle. The room was above and beyond our expectations, with everything we could possibly need, and an incredibly comfortable bed. We didn't see much of Donna but when we did she was very hospitable, helpful and kind. She went out of her way twice to drop us off at the station. And her knowledge and suggestions of things to do in the area were very much appreciated. I thoroughly recommend staying with Donna!
51370	3258213	10.0	9.0	21985575	"Donna was a wonderful host.  She made us feel so at home.  We did not see much of her (her busy schedule) or her of us (our busy schedule).  We had a key and came and went as needed.  
Her home is very comfortable and clean.  Could not have asked for more.  
Thanks for everything.  We will be back!"
51371	3258213	10.0	9.0	27365333	"We stayed over a weekend.  The room is very clean and spacious

"
51373	3258213	10.0	9.0	33391940	Donna was an amazing hostess! Our only regret is that we couldn't spend more time with her. She and her home are incredibly warm and inviting and we couldn't be happier with our stay. The space is very comfortable, private and has everything you might need. Donna has great recommendations for what to do and how to get around the city like a local and great places off the beaten path. The neighborhood is awesome, diverse and filled with beautiful gardens, cool little houses and great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. It was also a great location for us since it's close to the highway and allows easy access to hiking outside the city and to gorgeous parks nearby. We didn't have time for the kayaks but we are making it a priority for our next visit! Thank you so much, Donna, for opening your home to us and the opportunity to share stories. Hope to see you again soon!
51374	3258213	10.0	9.0	33630971	Donna is such a great host, warm and very attentive to our confort. The house is so cosy, clean, with a beautiful terrace (perfect for taking your breakfast). We had a big light room with a private bathroom and breakfast. Easy access to public transportation and free parking in the street. We didn't have time for kayaking but it is a good thing to do. Thank you Donna.
51375	3258213	10.0	9.0	34159350	"She is a super super host.
She helps me a lot in all the situations (food, travel, tourism ...)
She is an amazing person"
51376	3258213	10.0	9.0	34683792	Do not think twice, book it right away if it is available! Everything was great, if not better! Donna is really welcoming, sweet and accomodating. The place itself is way better than the photos & description; the room is very spacious, comfy and cozy! Great location & awesome experience! Thank you!
51377	3258213	10.0	9.0	35810379	Donna was the perfect host. She left the keys easy to find and the room ready to be used. She lives about 10-15 mins from Downtown, depending on traffic. She was really nice in recommending places to go around Seattle. We even met her sister who is as fun as her.  The room is big and comfortable, it was clean and with lost of homey feeling.  Donna found out it was my birthday and help my sister have a mini celebration. My sister and I felt at home and would recommend Donna any time. I would definitely go to Donna's again if I visit Seattle in the near future. 
51378	3258213	10.0	9.0	36133794	"Just like Iwona (a couple reviews back) said: ""Do not think twice, book it right away if it is available!"". And I'm glad I did. The room was perfectly sized, with 2 tables (one on each side of the room), and accompany chairs for you to do some work. Everything is clean and set aside for you. Donna even had bath towels, hand towels, and bathrobes with slippers for me to use. Donna even allowed us to check into the house earlier than usual (9 am) to make sure we won't have to wait around after landing in Seattle. 

In short, staying with Donna was the best decision we made on this trip. She was sweet, kind, wonderful, and a thoughtful host. She made sure we were able to get to our Zipcar by taking us there and stayed up past her bedtime to offer to drive us back home from that location. 

Like many things in life, it's the little things that matters and Donna got it covered. I won't be staying with anyone else when I'm in Seattle. Thank you Donna!"
51379	3258213	10.0	9.0	37002299	I had an incredibly enjoyable stay with Donna. I found that the room and space exceeded my expectations. She even has AC! She is lovely to chat with in addition to being very welcoming and friendly. I would love to stay here again and I am sure I will! 
51380	3258213	10.0	9.0	37462695	"We had a great time in Donna's place. Donna is very welcoming and kind person. 
The room is very spacious and has all that's needed for a comfortable stay. 
The location is very convenient, very close to lake Washington's beaches and parks and short drive to Seattle downtown area.
We would definitely recommend on staying at Donna's. "
51381	3258213	10.0	9.0	37811521	"Whenever I'll be able hosting myself Donna would be my ideal example. Not only that she offers a big room and a comfortable huge bed in a wonderful house close to Lake Washington and a bus which takes you downtown day and night,  but also she's a warm and helpful person who is just delightful to have around and talk to. She gave us a lot of good advices how to make the best out of our short stay in Seattle. We're very very thankful for her great hospitality and hope to manage coming back one day, also to try the kajaks after all. :) 
All the best to you, Donna! 
T&M"
51382	3258213	10.0	9.0	38400062	We loved staying at Donna's house. Our room was spacious and comfortable, with big windows overlooking a leafy backyard. Every morning, we had fresh fruit, cereal and yogurt before beginning our day. Although we were very busy, we finally did get some time to sit and enjoy talking with Donna. She had many good suggestions on what to do in Seattle. The neighborhood was convenient, with a bus stop just down the hill that took us downtown quickly. I would stay here again when in Seattle.
51383	3258213	10.0	9.0	38629902	Donna is the nicest and friendliest host we ever had. Our journey through the country started at her home and it was the best decision we made. She gave us so many useful advices for our trip and borrowed us camping staff we forgot to bring with us. Her house is easy to find with car and the bedroom is quiet huge for two persons. Everything was clean and she also had breakfast for us. All in all we enjoyed our stay very much and were so thankful for her hospitality. 
51384	3258213	10.0	9.0	40125530	Donna was a dream host! Her home is comfortable and clean, exactly as represented in the photos with gorgeous porch and gardens off the kitchen. From the moment that she greeted me on the porch, Donna made me feel at home. She continued to make my visit fabulous by providing everything that I could need - tea on the porch after a long flight, robe & slippers, lots of information on places to see and suggestions of restaurants to enjoy. Donna was kind and went out of her way to ensure that I was able to get everywhere I wanted to go. The neighbourhood is not in the centre of Seattle but it is close to a nice big park which was great for getting to see the lake and going for walks.  It didn't take long to go downtown when I wanted to explore, and the evenings were nice and quiet when I returned. I highly recommend Donna and her lovely room. I couldn't have wished for a better first Airbnb experience!
51385	3258213	10.0	9.0	40733214	"My boyfriend and I had the most amazing time staying at Donna's.  She is friendly, generous, and gave us amazing restaurant recommendations.  She let us borrow her kayaks, along with her van!  My favorite part of the vacation was kayaking on Lake Washington.  She also instructed us to feel free to anything in her cabinets/fridge.  This was very generous and convenient for us in the mornings.  
    Donna has a gorgeous house surrounded by large trees.  We loved sitting on the large balcony and having coffee/breakfast while bird watching.  The house is near several convenient bus lines and a 20 min walk to the light rail station. If public transit isn't your thing, you can get downtown with an Uber for under $15.
   This was our first airbnb experience but, after staying with Donna, not our last. As gracious as a host as we could have hoped for!"
51386	3258213	10.0	9.0	41221980	Donna was a fantastic host! Her home was cozy and adorable and she was very accommodating and friendly.  She left us plenty of snacks and provided us with plenty of information.  I would definitely stay with her again!
51387	3258213	10.0	9.0	41896176	"Donna is so kind and friendly.
She was always caring me. 
"
51388	3258213	10.0	9.0	42275998	"Excellent host and accommodation:)
I don't think you will find many hosts more kind and accommodating than Donna.  The pictures were accurate; the room delightful and the street tree lined.  It felt like a home away from home.  She also has interesting art throughout her lovely home.
She was quite willing to give accurate advice on museums, transportation and secrets of Seattle.
Hope she has room in the future.  Finding her airbnb ad was lucky!  Thanks, Donna for everything!
Victoria"
51389	3258213	10.0	9.0	43229149	My fiancé and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Donna! She made us feel right at home and was very accommodating. She gave us great food and activity recommendations. The room was clean with a very peaceful view. We were very comfortable staying at Donna's and we would love to stay again if/when we come back to Seattle!
51390	3258213	10.0	9.0	44115599	We had a very comfortable and relaxing stay at Donna's.  She was away when we arrived, but left us a handwritten note that made us feel welcome.  The room is pleasant and the bed comfortable.  The house is in a quiet residential area just a few blocks from the light rail stop, providing easy access to downtown and the airport.  
51391	3258213	10.0	9.0	44973479	We had a wonderful experience at Donna's place! She lent us her Kayaks and even drove us down to the lake. Highly recommend!
51392	3258213	10.0	9.0	45397088	Donna's place was the first time we've tried AirBnB and we enjoyed staying in her peaceful home. The room is pleasant & light & comfortable with everything we needed. We'd definitely recommend this for anyone who likes a homey atmosphere. She exceeded our expectations!
51393	3258213	10.0	9.0	45855661	Donna made us feel very welcome from day one. The room and the neighborhood was exactly as described on the listing. We had nice conversations in the mornings during breakfast, fresh fruits, cereal and coffee :) Donna is a very caring and welcoming person and if we had any questions she would reply very promptly. There is also a nice patio/deck with a nice view. This would be a place I would definitely recommend my friends to stay in the future. Thanks Donna for everything. Hugs :)
51394	3258213	10.0	9.0	46229020	"The place and the host are perfect.

Privacy, freedom, good breakfast, warm welcome, help at any moment needed... I can't say any bad thing about the place or Donna. I'm very grateful for staying at this place. It makes my long weekend trip to Seatlle much more enjoyable.

A big advantage about this place, kayaks, was exactly as Donna explain. We took the van, we did kayaking for a few hours and come back. Being so close to the lake and having a great Van makes everything a great experience. I won't forget.

Thanks Donna."
51395	3258213	10.0	9.0	46707542	"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely wonderful experience staying at this home. Our host, Donna, made us feel so welcome even though she had to be away for the duration of our stay. From the moment I requested to reserve a date, the communication with Donna had been warm and welcoming. She was so helpful with the planning of our trip! In her messages she also included detailed advice on how to get around by public transit and restaurant recommendations. We also appreciated that she would occasionally check in on us to see how we were doing since she was not there.
When we got there, we pretty much had the whole first floor to ourselves (minus the study). She has family renting out the basement but we never had an encounter with them and they were mostly quiet. The decor was lovely! It felt like home away from home. Donna left us fresh picked plums, which were delicious, and an assortment of goodies laid out in our bedrooms. Maps of Seattle, things to do, and periodicals are provided to aide your trip. She also has a washer and dryer, slippers and bathrobe, Netflix and basic cable, and a backyard patio you could eat your breakfast on. 
The entire home was clean, the bed was comfortable, the neighborhood was quiet, and our overall experience was excellent. Thank you so much for hosting us, Donna! We'll be back :)"
51396	3258213	10.0	9.0	47254903	"Once again, we had a great stay for a couple of days.  Besides the 
room (very clean and spacious), the view (windows overlook a
pleasant backyard area), and the comfortable bed, Donna responded
quickly to our e-mail and made us feel welcome when we arrived.
We would definitely stay here again!"
51397	3258213	10.0	9.0	48276847	"Once again, we had a great stay.  Donna continues to make
us feel most welcome;  we would definitely stay here again!
"
51398	3258213	10.0	9.0	48720635	It was my first time of using airbnb, which made me feel at home. I hope I could stay in Danna's  house longer. I had a great chat with Donna, shared our thoughts between two different cultures. Donna treat us really well, and even drove us to Boeing Factory when the traffic was bad. 
51399	3258213	10.0	9.0	49104681	"Once again, we had a great stay.  Donna continues to make

51400	3258213	10.0	9.0	49975996	Once again, we had a great stay. Donna continues to make us feel most welcome; we would definitely stay here again!
51401	7809455	10.0	9.0	43002411	Bryan welcomed me on arrival and was a great host. My schedule was crazy so I was really just in to crash and out after a shower in the morning. The bathroom was large and clean with plenty of hot water and great towels. The room had a nice comfortable chair and a desk that I hadn't noticed from the add. The neighborhood was quiet and convenient. I had a car and there was plenty of on street parking.
51402	7809455	10.0	9.0	44225226	Nice neighborhood, convenient to the bus (we had no car). Very pleasant place for my son and I to stay. Loved the cats--and the family was nice and helpful! When Bryan realized the listing said a queen bed and it was actually a double, he made a separate bed available so my son and I wouldn't be crowded. A coffee maker in the room was thoughtfully provided. He also picked up both my son and I from the train station. I would definitely recommend this place and will stay here again when I return to Seattle.
51403	7809455	10.0	9.0	44477297	"Bryan had coffee in the room, which was a nice touch; I'm not a coffee drinker but I can appreciate that extra little bit of attention.  Towels and plenty of pillows were laid out and ample power allowed me to plug in laptop, iPad and a couple other things.  

Great room and attention to detail!"
51404	7809455	10.0	9.0	44981337	"Bryan is a very good host, he ' s very reactive and welcoming .
His family too .
we were comfortable in this private room and the bathroom was just next the door .
Rather practice ^^

thanks"
51405	7809455	10.0	9.0	45877110	Bryan and his family was gracious to host our stay for 4 night at their home located in a very multi-cultural yet extremely quiet neighborhood.  There are ample parking with easy access to major road leading into downtown.  It was great to enjoy soccer match on their big screen projector and you can totally feel the passion they have for the game!  We also had access to a great range and stove to prepare our meal when we didn't feel like venturing out for food.  The room is clean and spacious for petite Asian couple like our self.  
51406	7809455	10.0	9.0	46089749	We got there late and Bryan was there to greet us.  Nice historic neighborhood.  Street parking.  The room is clean, the bed is comfy, the bathroom is huge and big living room area.  I would definitely stay here again 
51407	7809455	10.0	9.0	46360387	We only stayed for a night, but Bryan was very helpful. The house is great and you can feel his passion for football. We had a good time at his place 
51408	7809455	10.0	9.0	46435420	Thanks for being really flexible with our schedule and hosting us. You guys did a great job with having a very clear set of instructions on how to get in and use the room. Thanks again!! Bedroom was very cozy and comfortable. 
51409	7809455	10.0	9.0	46554446	Bryan is a great  host.  when we arrived, he gave us a warm welcomed and also he gave us a pretty helpful list with closest place we could go in the neighborhood.  The room  and the bathroom were very clean,  and the bed was really comfy. Besides he allowed us to use one his bikes, it was very helpful.  we felt very luck y to have found nice room.Thank you so much for your help and letting us to stay in your house, we had a really great time. Definitely we recommended this place. 
51410	7809455	10.0	9.0	47181546	Great host and a great house! I stayed in the room for five nights with my girlfriend, and the room was well furnished and comfortable. Bryan and his family were nice and welcoming to both of us!
51411	7809455	10.0	9.0	48946632	Had a great stay with Bryan and family. They are very easy-going and helpful and my stay was pleasant and uncomplicated, just the way I like it. Also enjoyed watching the weekend soccer highlights with the family and learning about some teams and players I had not been following or a while.
51412	7809455	10.0	9.0	50022915	As described. We really liked the neighborhood and Bryan and his family were very respectful and friendly. Thanks a lot.
51413	7809455	10.0	9.0	51438754	Bryan is a really nice guy! He picked us up on our way from the airport and drove us to the place. He was really informative, kind, and helpful throughout our entire trip. 
51414	7809455	10.0	9.0	52202384	We had a short but pleasant stay with Bryan.  We arrived rather late but Bryan was able to meet us and help us settle in.  The room was cozy and comfortable, easy access to the bathroom and backyard.  We had to catch an early flight and didn't get to spend much time around the house but it seemed very homey.
51415	7809455	10.0	9.0	52469031	Bryan was very commutative and made it easy for me to arrive very, very late.  I got caught up in informal business discussions and arrived long past my curfew.  The room was very nice.  I highly recommend staying with Bryan.
51416	7809455	10.0	9.0	52945839	This time I arrived early enough to actually meet Bryan!  As before, he was very accommodating and the room nice / comfortable.  Highly recommended. 
51417	7809455	10.0	9.0	53539854	Alyson was there to meet me when I arrived at her doorstep and showed me around her home; acquainted me with her kitchen and she had cleared 2 shelves in the fridge for my use. She also brought down to my room a coffee maker with coffee, cream and sugar. Bryan and Alyson were amazing open, friendly, trusting hosts with 2 beautiful children. The location of their home was perfect for my workshop and still close to nature; Lake Washington and Seward Park. I really liked having a backdoor to use coming and going from this home.
51418	7809455	10.0	9.0	55075562	Both my husband and I enjoyed our stay. We felt very welcomed and rested well in the space. I think we slept 10 hours both nights we stayed in Bryan's home. That was so great. Thank you!
51419	7809455	10.0	9.0	55626454	Again, as always, a very easy visit.  It seems that I have the entire lower floor to myself.  Very easy access and comfortable room.
51420	7809455	10.0	9.0	56918782	Bryan was a great host, providing us with the information we needed prior to our arrival and making sure we had all that we needed. Our stay was for only two nights and we were sightseeing a lot, so we didn't see the family much. Bryan gave us a ride to the light rail station when we left, which was really nice. The bathroom is shared, but it was always free and the bed is comfortable.
51789	8409969	10.0	9.0	47922896	"I had an excellent stay at Dario's. I booked last minute and was happy to find everything was ready when I arrived. 
The accommodation was clean with modern facilities and in a quiet location. 
The breakfast was excellent, there were eggs, bacon, cereal, yoghurt, fruit and orange juice. 
Dario's place is approximately a $3 bus ride or a $15 uber ride to town."
51790	8409969	10.0	9.0	48849698	Huge number of amenities for a low rental rate! Would love to stay there again. The place was very clean and peaceful, in a great neighborhood, walking distance from Seward Park. Breakfast was a nice bonus.
51791	8409969	10.0	9.0	49077131	very accurate description, all the amenities you could ask for really, great experience. 
51792	8409969	10.0	9.0	49946779	I was not able to meet Dario but the place is really nice, neat and comfortable, it's also walking distance to a really nice lake. Good experience!
51793	8409969	10.0	9.0	50150395	My stay at Dario's home was fantastic. I had my car, so I didn't have to worry much about public transportation. Although, the other guests said they had no problems getting around. The location was quiet and quaint, and the breakfast was yummy! I would stay here over and over. Unbeatable value!
51794	8409969	10.0	9.0	50589600	We were really comfortable in that house... We never saw Dario and there were other guests at the same time but the house was really clean, calm and there were a lot of things for the breakfast. The downtown is just 15-20 minutes by car. :) 
51795	8409969	10.0	9.0	50969804	Wow!  Great place to rest my head!  Nice kitchen stocked with breakfast items...thanks so much!
51796	8409969	10.0	9.0	51489826	The house is located near a very beautiful lake. It looks far away from downtown seattle but it is not, you only take about 30 minutes by transportation. The house is very clean, warm and beautiful, and the host is really, really friendly and nice. When living in the house, we really feel like at home. This is the best choice if you want to visit Seattle.
51797	8409969	10.0	9.0	51672874	We enjoyed our stay very much. The environment felt comforting and warming. We also enjoyed the breakfast that was offered. It was great to wake up and be able to make breakfast without having to go out every morning. 
51798	8409969	10.0	9.0	51962461	It was in a nice and quiet neighborhood.  The room was very nice and cozy.  It had a heater in there that you could adjust to which was really nice for me since I wasn't used to the cold.  The host was very responsive when we had questions.  Although we didn't eat any of the breakfast that was provided, it was a very nice gesture!
51799	8409969	10.0	9.0	52280202	Great bargain in an impressively well-managed operation. Efficiently welcoming at any hour. Easy access to home and room. Clear instructions make it possible to manage everything without bothering a host. Individual room thermostat. Very clean. Separate kitchens on each floor are super handy. Convenient parking. Quiet neighborhood. Easy to drive to from freeway,  airport or downtown.
51800	8409969	10.0	9.0	52728364	"We enjoyed our stay here very much. The room was comfortable and clean, although the carpet was slightly dirty when we checked in. There was a heater in the room which was perfect because it was so cold outside. Breakfast was provided and we could also use the washer & dryer which makes things very convenient for us. Getting around was also easy as there is a bus stop near the house serviced by bus 50 that brings us to & from the nearest light rail starion and the train basically brings us anywhere we want to go, including the SeaTac airport.

Some downsides were the house being far away from downtown Seattle (on average we need at least 45 mins to get to places that we want to go) and to get to the house from the nearest bus stop, we need to walk up a slope and it was a hassle to do so with luggage, although it was just a short distance. We also didn't get the keys to our room, which for us is necessary as it enables us to lock the door and things in the room will be more secure when we aren't around, even though the doors can be locked from the inside.

Overall, it was a great stay and I highly recommend!"
51801	8409969	10.0	9.0	53272285	This was a clean, comfortable place to stay the night.  The listing was very accurate and was easy to find.  Plenty of street parking available as well.  The common areas were also clean and well stocked for guests.  I would not hesitate to stay here again if we return to Seattle.
51802	8409969	10.0	9.0	53622810	"The space is basic and that's what worked for me! I was very surprised at the offerings of breakfast items during my stay. I did not partake in much of it, but that's always a bonus in my book!

The rest of the house is spacious and inviting. I was fortunate to meet another guest staying at the same time and they kindly offered me to join em for dinner in the dining room. That was simply awesome of them as we were essentially strangers.
Dario sure knows how to pick em ;-).

For the price point for my room, i could not think of anything bad at all. One small thing to be aware of is if you're a super light sleeper, you are downstairs so some minor noises from upstairs can be heard. 

You may hear the floorboards creak every now and then, especially if the other guests are Jumpy Jumpersons. You might hear the random leaf blower from a next door neighbor too in the morning. Which happened during my stay. Just a friendly heads up for light sleepers. :-)

These things are quite minor for the most part. As I'm a pretty no frills, easy going traveler. The house was clean and again, food for guests = bonus!!!!

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
51803	8409969	10.0	9.0	54996634	Super nice experience staying at Dario's house. The location is nice that you can go to downtown and other area easily. The room is comfy, clean and the neighbourhood is simply amazing. Housemates living in the house are all very nice and I really enjoy chatting with them. This is my first Airb&b experience and it was highly impressive. Must stay in Dario's house if I visit Seattle again ;) 
51804	8409969	10.0	9.0	55513768	The room was set exactly as pictured on Air BnB, beautiful! The neighborhood is quiet and safe with ample parking. The space was set up very well throughout the downstairs of the house, complete with kitchen and common living room area. Although it was fairly cold at night, the heater in the room kept it a very comfortable temperature. I will definitely be looking up this house next time I'm in Seattle!
51805	8409969	10.0	9.0	55880774	This was my first experience with Airbnb, I really enjoyed it. It was a lot easier and less stressful than finding a hotel. Dario's house was great and the room I stayed in was exactly like the pictures. I would definitely stay here again.
51806	8409969	10.0	9.0	56292240	I didn't get to meet Dario in person, but everything in the house was well organized, fully documented, and nicely stocked.  I had no problem with street parking, door entry (a code to get in) or finding things I needed.  The downstairs kitchen was very well stocked with breakfast makings.  I wish I could have lingered there longer.  It's a nice home to stay in.
51807	8409969	10.0	9.0	56632440	Dario was very accomadating and helpful. had a very relaxing stay. would love to come back. 
51808	8409969	10.0	9.0	56996004	"The room that was offered was really welcoming. There were other guests as well and we were offered breakfast food, towels and amenities. 

I did have a little trouble finding the bathroom light because it was outside the door. Just a heads up for future guests. "
51809	8409969	10.0	9.0	57137028	Dario's place was warm, friendly, clean, and quaint. His mother Olga welcomed us to the house upon arrival. There is plenty of bacon, vegetables, eggs, orange juice, and tea for breakfast. It's self-serviced as advertised. The location is a bit far from downtown Seattle (about 20-30 minutes via taxi) but there is public transportation available. There are guests in other rooms but they were quiet and kept to themselves. Overall very much of a hostel feel and very comfortable.
52504	3115801	10.0	9.0	14745322	I absolutely loved staying with Linda and Mike. First of all, their place is gorgeous. I was looking for a place for a one-month stay of my parents who visited me from India. The 1 BHK apartment is completely separate and private. This was perfect for my parents as they never felt that they were living at someone's else house. The house is very well furnished and the outside view makes you feel like you are living in mountains - it's very green, fresh air, and just beautiful. Linda and Mike are great host too - they arranged for extra mattress when I stayed with my parents for few nights. In addition, my parents wanted some Indian channels on T.V. - Linda surprised me when she visited the office of the cable company and got me the channels. My experience was just great.   
52505	3115801	10.0	9.0	15583997	This is a fantastic space to stay in Seattle -- Serene is the perfect word! Linda had all of the promised accommodations, and then some. My husband and I had a rental car, thus there was no need to navigate the public transportation system so I can't speak to that. But it never took us too long to get anywhere we wanted to go. The bed was SO comfortable, and it was nice to have reliable WiFi and some great TV/Movie selections. It was the perfect hybrid of home and hotel, and we loved it!
52506	3115801	10.0	9.0	16013577	"We've stayed in quite a few Airbnb listings around Seattle and this was by far the best. The apartment was very clean, nicely furnished and has the convenience of a full size kitchen. The house is nestled up to nature for early morning cups of coffee on the porch, or you can walk across the street to the Duwamish Greenbelt for a walk. We didn't have a rental car so route 125 straight to downtown being right down the street was extremely convenient. There's nature when you want it, a very short trip to central West Seattle or Downtown Seattle when you don't.

I was also surprised to see the place was surprisingly stocked with snacks, fruit, juice, etc. which is a very pleasant surprise. This is good because the only downside (and it certainly wouldn't be for most) is that there's not a whole lot within convenient walking distance.

Overall our stay was fantastic and we had nary a complaint. We were even graciously offered a ride to the nearest light rail station so we could get to the airport. Definitely above and beyond! Wish we could have stayed longer."
52507	3115801	10.0	9.0	16552070	Staying with Linda and Michael was serene, to say the least! What a lovely place they envisioned - we are so thankful they opened their home to share through AirBnB. Located in West Seattle, the space was quiet and calm, a great retreat after a long day of adventuring around Seattle. The bed was so comfy, and we loved using the TV w/ Roku set up for a date night-in watching documentaries! Our hosts were fantastic -  so thoughtful and responsive to any needs that arose. Meeting Linda was a true pleasure, and we were so thankful for her amazing hospitality. Thank you, again!! :)

The quiet, peaceful balcony overlooking masses of trees, was a lovely place to have breakfast and evening drinks. We highly recommend staying here.

53314	2071305	10.0	9.0	14568233	Cheryl was an excellent host for a wonderful visit to Seattle. The condo is clean, convenient, cozy and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again.
53315	2071305	10.0	9.0	15911981	Cheryl is an excellent host and a terrific cook.  She knows many tips about Seattle and is very helpful (These characteristics are essential for foreigners that are not fluent in English like me). We did many things together, such as going to restaurants, hiking in parks in Seattle, and buying food from regional producers in fairs. Additionally, the apartment is very clean and matches exactly with the description. The condo is in a friendly neighborhood, which is very close to a shopping mall and close to a bus terminal. It is very easy to catch buses for different parts of the city, including the University of Washington. I spent 30 great days in her home and I strongly recommend the place.
53316	2071305	10.0	9.0	16844252	Cheryl is a great host. She is kind, well-travelled, and knowledeable about Seattle and surrounding areas. We had some fun / interesting conversation whenever our paths crossed, although it was sparse as we were both pretty busy. My room was very quiet, clean and comfortable. I had restful sleeps on the single bed with enough breeze from the window to keep me cool at night. There was a convenient desk in the room where  I accessed wi-fi and used my computer.  The kitchen was well -organised with labels that helped to navigate, plus it was immaculate which made it easy to clean up after yourself. The bathroom was also well - maintained. The living room was small but super quaint and cozy,  and I spent one night flipping through netflix and watching a movie with Babette the adorable cat, on my lap. I was tempted to work out on the row machine, but found other things to do! I was also able to take a dip in the pool on a very hot evening, which was calm and cooling - a delightful perk! There are a handful of tasty restaurants within walking distance as well as a convenient grocery store, drug store and giant shopping mall. The transit is simple and easy to use to get from the condo to downtown, or to and from the airport for that matter. I was really happy and  relieved to have found this place, as I was taking an intensive workshop for two weeks about a 20 minute bicycle from the condo, and needed a restful haven to come home to every night. It's a gem. 
53317	2071305	10.0	9.0	18258648	Having never been to Seattle and moving to Seattle,  staying with Cheryl really helped. Great location ( near bus terminal and highway), great apartment complex, and great host.  Cheryl knows Seattle, has many guides and lots of advice, and invites you to join her on hikes to Mt Rainier.   
53318	2071305	10.0	9.0	21040922	This is my first time been to America and lived in an American family. Cheryl,her son and the cat gave me a really tidy, quiet and cozy home.Just like living in my own home.Cheryl is kind and offers me lots of help. This flat has a perfect location which is quite near a mall and bus transit center. I'm glad to share her home during these 20 days in Seattle. I will come here next time!
53319	2071305	10.0	9.0	27207868	"Cheryl and her son were extremely welcoming and helpful, and their cat was very friendly. Their condo was very clean and comfortable, and the kitchen was well labeled. The location was also exceptional with very short walking distance to the grocery store and the library (and attached bus stop), as well as various restaurants and the mall.

My stay with them was extremely pleasant, despite my early schedule, and I had no issues while I was there for a month."
53320	2071305	10.0	9.0	41324353	Wow, what an amazing stay in Northgate! Cheryl went above and beyond her hosting duties and made me feel welcomed throughout my stay. I lived here for more than two months and am without any complaints. It was a great way to experience everything Seattle has to offer. Thanks for everything Cheryl!
53321	2071305	10.0	9.0	45273418	"I am so happy to have found this place beautiful room to stay in during my transition to Seattle. I was traveling by myself and would be in Seattle for 3 weeks before my family arrived and we moved into our new home. Cheryl was incredibly accommodating, straight forward and a wonderful host. I was happy to spend most of my evenings alone in my room or out, but it was nice to have a dinner companion or someone to chat with every once in awhile! 

The room was very nice. There was a closet which surprisingly fit all of my clothing from 3 suitcases(!), plus a desk, a chair in the corner and a twin size bed. It was a little warm a few nights, but there was a fan for me to use and I found with an open window the temperature was perfect. 

I wasn't much of a cook, but Cheryl had a wonderful kitchen with nearly every appliance and utensil you could need. There were many restaurants and a grocery store within walking distance. I did have a car there and I never had trouble finding street parking right out front. I also experimented taking the bus downtown for work. It was a quick walk and then a smooth 10 minute bus ride to get downtown. Nice and Easy! I would definitely recommend Cheryl and staying at her condo for anyone in need of a nice, quiet space! "
53322	2071305	10.0	9.0	48511856	I enjoyed staying in Cheryl's home during my first month in Seattle.  Cheryl, Evan, and Babette were very welcoming and made me feel right at home. The location of her home is so convenient and is in a safe neighborhood' It is within walking distance to Northgate Mall, Target, QFC, and Thornton Place movie theater. It is also about a 5-10 minute walk to the bus stops and the Northgate Transit Center. Cheryl also had a spare bike to use, which I took advantage of and took it to to the bike trails by the lakes.  If you need a place to stay for a couple weeks in Seattle, I highly recommend staying here!
53323	2071305	10.0	9.0	55711445	"I loved my first month in Seattle and I'm sure that staying here and having Cheryl as host was the main responsible for that.
The condo unit is great and the bedroom is really nice. Cheryl and Evan are very welcoming, I felt right at home. They both are great in making you feel confortable in whatever you want to do, if you want to stay on your own or chat/share a meal with.  Cheryl is also very helpful and always has great tips for things to do, places to eat, etc.
Their condo is on a perfect location, close to everything - grocery store, mall, restaurants - and you can have easy access to everywhere with bus stops around the corner and the Transit Center (5-10 min walk).
I feel really lucky that I have found this beautiful place and met such nice people. 
I definitely recommend staying here and having Cheryl as a host. She takes care of everything to guarantee the traveling experience that every airbnb could ask for."
53667	7638282	10.0	9.0	41174386	This is a retreat in a true sense of the word.  Manghild was a welcoming host who provided not only a beautiful space, but a relaxing one.  I wished there wasn't so much to do and see in Seattle because I would have loved to be in the living room and just put my feet up and observe the passing clouds in the skylights.  It was quiet in the neighborhood, close to the bus line and I was lucky to be her first guest.
53668	7638282	10.0	9.0	41539502	"As I write this review I keep thinking ""I can't write what I really want to cause then everyone will know how amazing this place was!!!""
But none the less... I will.  Besides the host being utterly lovely and caring (she offered to get my son something for his bell at the store after he was car sick!), her sweet dog Loki and friendly kitty, and the sweet secret garden that is her backyard... The space was everything we hoped for and more.
We arrived to fresh fruit and yogurt in the fridge along with a lovely carafe of chilled water.  She also had set out containers with toys for our son and special children's dishware for him to feel comfortable too.

The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and has some great area restaurants that we walked to.  We ate at a lovely Italian restaurant that was quint and VERY child friendly while still feeling intimate.

My only hope is that the next time we are in Seattle... It will be available!! But I have a sinking suspicion it will be booked solid!!! 

Thank you again for a marvelous stay!"
53669	7638282	10.0	9.0	42051571	Couldn't have asked for a better stay in Seattle! Magnhild was there to greet us when we arrived, checking to make sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. The house and yard are both beautiful and made the perfect scene for a weekend getaway. The adjacency to downtown both by car and bus also made it the optimum location for a quiet night and quick access to our planned events. Shortly after we departed, she even contacted us immediately to inform us of a left behind item. Very thankful for that! I would suggest Magnhild's backyard retreat hands down, and will be planning to visit again when next in town.
53670	7638282	10.0	9.0	42464313	Magnhild was a great host, very friendly and welcoming. She pays great attention to details, and has put a lot of work into  her cottage to make it feel like home. The cottage also has a beautiful back yard which Magnhild shares with her guests. We had a great time and highly recommend it!
53671	7638282	10.0	9.0	42796906	Magnhild is the best; she is a fantastic host. We absolutely loved staying with her. She's got the sweetest personality and her retreat is just that, a lovely oasis in Seattle. I can't say enough kind things. I look forward to staying with her again on my next trip to Seattle.
53672	7638282	10.0	9.0	43138221	Staying with Magnhild at Tall Trees was wonderful! The private house was beautiful and Magnhild was a prefect hostess. We will definitely be frequent guests when we visit our  daughter who/ lives near by in Seattle 
53673	7638282	10.0	9.0	44000806	"If you are looking to visit Seattle then we cannot recommend a stop at the Tall Trees Backyard Retreat highly enough. A charming, self-contained cottage that we didn't want to leave. It is wonderfully decorated and kitted out, it was a home away from home for a week.

Located in a quiet area of North Seattle it gave us some space but also was perfectly situated for a half-hour bus into the city itself and equally expeditions to the North and Whidbey Island.

Our host Magnhild was supremely welcoming. She greeted us warmly and offered us a lot of advice for local eateries, shops, and things to do."
53674	7638282	10.0	9.0	44348032	Magnhild made our stay wonderful from the very beginning. She having learned our trip was an anniversary had a special something waiting for us. She walked us through the cottage and the attention to detail was perfect. Not so bare, nor cluttered. That perfect blend of homey yet clean and peaceful. It was very accessible to downtown Seattle, and the garden smelled wonderful. We had a lovely conversation with Magnhild on our last day and were sad we were leaving. We now having stayed at a less than desirable place on our last day, are so sad we left. I would in a moment, come back. This would be a great place to stay coming back for UW football games or Seahawk games in the winter. It's not just a summer listing. This cottage was perfect!
53675	7638282	10.0	9.0	45292523	My wife and I couldn't have been happier with Magnhild or her lovely cottage and garden retreat. Aside from the great design and quiet neighborhood, we found every little detail covered inside and out. It's very convenient to my son and his family to boot. No doubt we'll be back. Five stars!
53676	7638282	10.0	9.0	46923695	Magnhild is a wonderful host.  She went the extra mile for us when our rental car died in her driveway.  Not only did she arrange for a Lyft driver to come pick us up, but she subsequently returned with a wego charger to help us start our car.  Thank you, Magnhild!   Her guest cottage is exactly as advertised--lovely and comfortable--and it overlooks a delightful little garden complete with Adirondack chairs.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat!
53677	7638282	10.0	9.0	48004158	"We had a wonderful trip & the property was perfect! Our host made us feel right at home and even provided some toys for our daughter. Every morning our daughter would wake up & wave or say ""HI"" to the lady in the garden. It was just the most perfect family time and we can't wait to be back."
53678	7638282	10.0	9.0	49907263	"I stayed at Tall Trees for almost 2 weeks, with my husband.  We really enjoyed the stay.  Magnhild was kind enough to make us fresh orange juice for our arrival.  The kitchen was fully equipped and we had a selection of teas to choose from every morning. We were able to enjoy our tea and lunches sitting in the backyard. The washroom was well laid out and the washer and dryer made it convenient during a long stay. 
The backyard was very relaxing and we were visited by hummingbirds each afternoon. Magnhild is very easy going and lovely to chat with. She made us feel so comfortable.  The location was excellent. There is a bus station just down the street, cafe's within an easy walking distance and Green Lake is a 5 minute drive. 
I wouldn't hesitate to book a stay here again. 
Thanks for the relaxing stay Magnhild!!!"
53679	7638282	10.0	9.0	50754610	We came to Seattle from 10/7 to 10/13 and we stayed in the most wonderful place. It was so clean and cozy that it was hard to decided if we wanted to hang out there or go into Seattle. There is a fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, great shower, wonderful living area and the bedroom was very nice. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet and you can get anywhere you need to go with no hassle. You look out on a beautiful garden and though Magnhild is in the house next to the cottage you feel like you have all the privacy you need. She is a wonderful hostess who makes you feel like you are home. She has some things that she stocks in the fridge like yougart, coffee, fruit and is available for any questions. Has the friendliest dog and sweet kitty. This place is a winner. We loved staying here and will be back.
53680	7638282	10.0	9.0	51308538	We had a nice conversation with Magnhild. 
53681	7638282	10.0	9.0	52094125	"Our stay with Magnhild was wonderful,maybe one of the best in our long hisory of Airbnb !!!
The space was SUPER clean(which is #1 one our list of desires in a location)with everything you would need to feel at home,i.e.,full kitchen,comfy living room,beautiful garden to relax in,as I said everything you'd need.
On top of that Magnhild was a prefect host,even going out of her way to purchase a fireplace screen to guard against our toddler from touching the glass front.
We would highly recommend to all her home,and THANK YOU Magnhild for the gerat stay !!
We hope to visit again.
"
53682	7638282	10.0	9.0	54877704	We just stayed recently at the Tall Trees Backyard Retreat. Magnhild was very helpful and friendly. The place is clean and quiet and has all the amenities we needed. We were close to our daughters house and we found a restaurant just up the street called Piccolo Cafe that is fabulous. Great food and ambiance. We hope to stay there again soon.Thanks to the owner--Liz and Bill
53683	7638282	10.0	9.0	57769715	Magnhild was very welcoming and informative. We found the cottage to be everything as described.  Very tasteful and peaceful. We loved the shower, but found the handle that adjusts the temperature to be very stiff/hard to do fine adjustments. We definitely recommend this place!  Thank you, Magnhild!
54549	6629278	9.0	9.0	34587647	Kathleen is a very good host, very helpfully. I really liked to stay there. 
54550	6629278	9.0	9.0	35151489	"Thank you for Kathy's warm treat and careness. Living here is just like home and you can feel safe even I am single woman travel by myself. She gave very clear guidance of transportation and sometimes she was going out, she would take you a ride to downtown. Lovely morning coffee is served, you also do laundry. We do share good times together.

Regarding the transportation, you could take only obe bus #72 eady to go the Washington university around 15mins or downtown, Pike matket place by 30~40mins, Fremont by 25~30 mins as well. If you like walking, you can also walk to Green Lake, my favorite sightsering. 
You could get a bus transit reciept to transfer any metro bus you need. 
It's also convenient of airport transportation by bus #72 to International district and Link light reil to SEA.

The room is with a small bed indeed. That would more suitable for a single woman. I also spent one night to be used to the air bed which is the first time expetience for me. Everything is settled by Kathy, you have private bathroom with towel, hair dryer, washing gel, etc. and WiFi, Cable TV. It's just like you live at hotel comfortablely.

Note on the dogs live in this house. Kathy keeps them from my room and she keeps house cleaness without the dog hair.

Welcome to come Kathy's house"
54551	6629278	9.0	9.0	36308449	Kathy is very attentive and nice. Always willing to help and share, from car trips to local tips, and clear about requests/rules. Two smaller dogs with the larger one very well behaved and trained. The location is quiet, and complete TV, entertainment center in your room. 
54552	6629278	9.0	9.0	38045959	"Kathleen was an absolute dream of a host! We felt completely welcomed from the moment that we arrived and were so glad to have had such a wonderful experience in Seattle. Kathleen was incredibly accommodating and helpful; she even offered to help with anything since we were so busy during our visit. She is also very well-read and knowledgable and I wish we had had more time to get to know her and hear more about her travels!

The room we stayed in was small, but the perfect size for two people. The air mattresses were incredibly comfortable and we slept remarkably well each night. The bathroom we were provided was clean and the shower did not take too long to warm up! Kathleen has two adorable dogs who were very friendly, but did not enter our space without invitation. She kindly provided breakfast options that were both delicious and organic, which was much appreciated!

This location was absolutely ideal for the two of us and we were glad it was in such an excellent location to access the many neighborhoods of Seattle. We plan to stay here again on future trips to the area and cannot recommend it enough to anyone looking for a place to stay. "
54553	6629278	9.0	9.0	38906532	Kathleen was a very gracious host.  The space was very nice and clean.  Kathleen welcomed my friend and I and made us feel at home as neither of us were familiar with the Seattle area.  She was very kind and even offered to drive us to various places.  She knows so much about the area and had good recommendations for things we could do.  Her dogs were wonderful, they love to hang out but are very well trained and will give you space if you need it.  The neighborhood was also great and it was easy to get to the UW area or downtown via bus.  A very positive experience!! Thanks again Kathleen!
54554	6629278	9.0	9.0	39665819	"Great host! The room and the entire home was clean and
very comfortable ( even aTV in your own room ). Had a very pleasant stay. Kathleen was also very knowledgeable in providing information of getting around the Seattle area( bus routes...etc). Thanks Kathleen!


"
54555	6629278	9.0	9.0	41236814	"Kathy is one of those super hosts you hope you meet in your journeys on AirBnB. She is a phenomenally intelligent and well read lady who has great experiences to share about he life. It truly is great spending time with her.

The room is private and clean. Has its own bathroom and is in a nice quiet part of town. Very accessible to the entire city.

I have nothing but gloqiny commendations. Stay here for a Greta hospitality experience"
54556	6629278	9.0	9.0	45286138	"Miss Kathy is a wonderfull host ... she makes you feel home .. listing description accurate.
she has two lovely dogs that makes you feel safe."
54952	7245586	4.0	9.0	42340312	The stay was good even if the host seem quite new on Airbnb. Some routines like how to check out could be good and also there is a need for shaping up the place, some cleaning could be good, especially the shower. On the other hand the host really tried to make it a good stay for us, the location is good in a nice neighbor and the prices is really good if you compare similar locations. Also the separate entre is really nice! The place really have potential! 
54953	7245586	4.0	9.0	48540689	I stayed at this location for a month. I never met Tania but I did meet her father twice. They rent out all the rooms in the house. There were only a couple of people there when I was there. I stayed in a basement room. There was a bathroom on the same floor but the kitchen was upstairs. There was a minifridge by the room. The basement has a private side entrance that they recently added a keycode deadbolt in. The door to the room itself wasn't that great, it didn't feel very secure but I had the only key and nothing was taken. The neighborhood is nice, it was a short bus ride away from the university and hospital so it was what I needed. The room itself was unremarkable, it is as pictured with a full size bed. The room had a peculiar odor that reminded me of cat litter and felt damp at times. I asked for air freshener and was told to buy some at the local store. My stay had ups and downs and I can't say that I would do it again given the choice. The bathroom shower was short and cramped and the smell was off putting. However given the location it suited my needs. 
55101	3812725	10.0	9.0	19278090	"Meisha's house in Ravenna was such a pleasant experience, I would highly recommend it for any family looking to relax and explore in Seattle.  I stayed with my brothers and a niece and nephew from Nebraska.  Miesha was very kind to provide an airbed for the kids to sleep just outside the master bedroom.  

The house was very well furnished and beautifully remodled, so it feels like a luxury vacation rental at the same time it feels like home.  That's one of the best compliments I could give!

The kitchen and dining areas are spacious so we relaxed every morning with a newspaper, excellent Seattle coffee provided by Miesha, and lots of sun (if you are lucky enough to enjoy Seattle in September).  In the evenings, we enjoyed a glass of wine on the back deck, very quiet and peaceful looking south and west.  
Easy access to all other parts of Seattle.  We spent a lot of time in Ballard, but were also a very short drive from Greenlake, Ravenna Park, the University, and the Woodland Park Zoo (which the kids LOVED.)
"
55102	3812725	10.0	9.0	23496016	My family was in town for Thanksgiving. We rented Miesha's house for the week and it was a wonderful experience. We had kids with us so the fact that it's a kid-friendly house was nice. The rooms were spacious, beds were comfortable, and all the essentials were available in the kitchen for cooking. We really liked the location, too. Miesha was extremely responsive when I had questions and even sent us a pie! And finally, the heated bathroom floors and tub with jets were quite a nice luxury!
55103	3812725	10.0	9.0	24667893	My family was coming to visit, and we have a very small house. The home in Ravenna was a wonderful solution. Miesha was very friendly and responsive. The house was even decorated for the holidays, and Miesha left us a little gift under the tree. The house was clean and comfortable, and my family felt spoiled by the newly remodeled spa bath (and heated floors in all bathrooms!). Plenty of space, and comfy beds. The family took many walks around the neighborhood, for fun and exercise, and also for nearby coffee and Top Pot doughnuts. A great experience, and we wouldn't hesitate to book the house again. WAY better (and less expensive) than the hotel we have used in the past.
55300	3404700	10.0	9.0	15595816	It was our first time booking through Air BnB! We had a wonderful experience staying at Adin and Lynda's Studio Apartment which provided great accommodations. Adin, along with their dogs Chip and Salsa, greeted us upon check-in.  Their location was very convenient to downtown Seattle and room amenities were top notch.   A stocked fridge with yogurts, orange juices, and waters was well appreciated. During our stay, Seattle's weather was very warm and they went out of their way to provide us with an extra fan to stay cool. We enjoyed our stay at their studio apartment and will definitely come back when we stay in Seattle again!
55301	3404700	10.0	9.0	15941113	The stay was great. It had many ameneties such as coffee maker, microwave, tv, toaster, and such. The place was peace and quite. The dogs, Chip and Salsa, were friendly and playful.  Thanks for stay, I'll do it again.
55302	3404700	10.0	9.0	16134736	"This studio is immaculate and has everything you need for a quiet, private visit. There's a common outdoor patio with a firepit, but the studio itself is  separated from the main house and feels like a private, cozy hotel. Our hosts were very responsive to questions, and provided a helpful binder with FAQs. We didn't have a chance to make use of the in-house massage service listed in the binder, but maybe next time we're back in Seattle :) Thanks again Adin & Lynda, your studio really made the trip!

They provided coffee, and other snacks which I thought it was really nice.  An overall great experience!!!"
55304	3404700	10.0	9.0	16926273	"Adin and Lynda were awesome and their space was perfect and comfortable.  A clean and comfortable suite and a nicely stocked cupboard and fridge...especially the GINGER SNAPS!  Lots of privacy and great outdoor area to chill and relax and enjoy our morning coffee.  Quiet neighbourhood and not too far from beaches or downtown.  

Thanks from Guy and Mel"
55305	3404700	10.0	9.0	17229929	The garage-top living unit was meticulously clean and had all the necessary components. I liked the fact that the hosts left a few items to eat and drink in the refrigerator, as it is often difficult to bring food with you on a long flight. I was also very pleasantly surprised by the ease of transit from the unit into downtown Seattle. The bus stop is a 1-minute walk from the unit and takes you into the downtown area of Seattle in about 25 minutes. The general neighborhood is completely residential and quiet. I knew the Seattle area well from previous trips and did not need to ask for assistance from my hosts. So I had very little face-to-face contact with Adin or Lynda. I did run into Adin several times during my stay and he was pleasant and encouraged me to use the shared patio area that separates the main house from the garage. The Google street photos of this location are seriously out of date, and the house and garage have been thoroughly renovated.
55306	3404700	10.0	9.0	17642923	Beautiful neighborhood! Very nice & clean studio apartment! Super close to downtown. As advertised. This was our first experience with airbnb and we really enjoyed our stay! Great value compared to hotels! Appreciated the handbook Adin and Lynda prepared and all the fruit, snacks and coffee provided. Great stay, would definitely be interested in a return trip! 
55307	3404700	10.0	9.0	17877542	Adin & Lynda were so very awesome in letting us stay here for our 2 year Anniversary! They gave us some wine, delicious fresh strawberries, bagels, yummy mint chocolates, and scrumptious ginger snaps. It was so very sweet of them! They were so generous in letting us take home a bag of freshly-caught and cooked crab! So delicious! The space is perfect for a romantic get-away! So cute and cozy! We will most definitely stay here again! Thank you guys so much for everything! :) Your dogs are also adorable! Loved having them greet us all the time!

The apartment is very well appointed. It was extremely clean and extremely comfortable. The neighborhood is really convenient and quiet, and I'm now a big believer in West Seattle. It's so much easier to take the 10 minute ferry across to downtown and avoid the insane parking. Big thanks to Adin and Lynda...looking forward to staying with them again soon.
55310	3404700	10.0	9.0	18946531	Very unique space....very, very close to a bus line.  The space is clean, convenient and safe. Nice residential area, would stay again.
55311	3404700	10.0	9.0	19397670	Adin and Lynda have prepared thoughtfully for their guests - - evident in the landscape of the yard, the breakfast items in the fridge, the toiletries stocked, and the excellent upkeep of their Studio-17. Tucked away in a quiet neighborhood I slept well and felt safe. Everything worked as promised; instructions were clear and reasonable. My stay very pleasant.
55312	3404700	10.0	9.0	21210317	Adin and Lynda were fantastic hosts.  I couldn't of been more pleased with the place and with my stay in Seattle.  Although I was working the majority of the time, I saw enough of the area (West Seattle) to be pleasantly surprised and wouldn't hesitate coming back in the future. 
55313	3404700	10.0	9.0	21498400	"Lynda and Adin are so awesome!
The house is just adorable, all nicely clean and so inviting... Plus all the  treats - bagels, cream cheese, ginger snaps, yogurt, fruits, tea and coffee made it even extra special.
They are really respectful with their guests having their privacy yet very prompt to help or answer any questions you might have.
Thank you so much guys, you made my Seattle stay so amazing, it was everything I needed.
I hope to get back there soon and stay at your place again!"
55314	3404700	10.0	9.0	21857853	For our first Airbnb experience, Adin and Lynda' studio apartment could not have been any better.  Their place is conveniently located for exploring in and around Seattle.  The unit was extremely cozy and private.  Everything was very comfortable and well kept.  In additional to having the convenience of the kitchenette, we were provided extras like bagels, chocolate, and fruit.  The place was presented as if Adin and Lynda were hosting friends or family.  We looked forward to returning after a long day of sightseeing.  If we get the chance to go back to Seattle, we hope to stay in Adin and Lynda's apartment again.  
55315	3404700	10.0	9.0	22628444	There were clean towels waiting for us! The snacks they had prepared for us were excellent! They had a little manual for us to see what was near by, parks, food, transportation. It was a great first air BnB experience. 
55316	3404700	10.0	9.0	23247132	Check was easy, upon arrival I was delighted to find the fridge stocked with a few essentials for getting each day started right!  
55317	3404700	10.0	9.0	26655632	Hosts were great, very hands off but available if we needed them. The unit was perfect, very convenient, super clean, and it has everything you might need. The neighborhood is safe, quiet, and an easy drive to the Junction and to get to other parts of Seattle. We had a great stay and would stay here again!
55318	3404700	10.0	9.0	28435040	Wonderful studio! Clean, warm, comfortable. Couldn't have asked for anything more! Great location in quiet West Seattle. Thanks Adin & Lynda!
55319	3404700	10.0	9.0	28752407	Adin was a great host!  He accommodated my late arrival and was very easy to get ahold of.  I had issues with the internet and he immediately dropped off a hotspot for me to use during my stay.  He was very attentive and made sure I had everything I needed.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable.  I would def recommend!
55320	3404700	10.0	9.0	29524257	Great private studio with all aminities to create a wonderful experience. Adin & Lynda are very respectful of their guests' privacy and amazingly helpful if you need something.
55321	3404700	10.0	9.0	30729643	This was a great place. It was clean and cozy and just what I needed. They were very accommodating, even on short notice.
55322	3404700	10.0	9.0	31272204	Another great stay thanks for the last min accommodation!
55323	3404700	10.0	9.0	31742170	Adin and Lynda kindly credited cancelation fees I incurred when I booked, canceled and rebooked later. The apartment was just as advertised. It was clean, nicely decorated and very tidy. Due to my height and the low ceilings over the bed and kitchenette sink - I'm 6 ft tall and it's a remodeled attic space - I found the space to be not very comfortable for me, but I knew that might be the case and I decided to take the chance as it met all of my other needs. The bed is a futon, and very firm. It wasn't comfortable for me, but many people would be fine with it. I would recommend this site if you are not tall and don't mind a firm futon bed.
55324	3404700	10.0	9.0	32191668	I had a great stay at the studio! I only met Lynda is passing but everything ran like a well oiled machine. The place was super clean and had what I needed. The description and pics are 100% accurate. 
55325	3404700	10.0	9.0	32437963	Adin & Lynda's studio apartment was fantastic!  It was a cozy place in a beautiful green setting.  They laid everything out for our stay.  The location was close to a lot of great spots to eat!  We very much enjoyed our stay.

55327	3404700	10.0	9.0	33872667	Adin and Lynda were absolutely wonderful hosts. There home was very well organized and clean. The notebook of information detailing what we needed to know about the home as well as the city was informative as well as an awesome tool for the exploration of the trip. There home is lovely and welcoming. Great location for being out of the madness of traffic with lots of little shops close by. Close drive to the city. Would definitely stay there again.
55328	3404700	10.0	9.0	34331264	We loved this studio! When we walked in, the place looked and smelled clean and welcoming. It is cozy, private, well-stocked and so cute. The neighborhood is great - close to the city while still being in a quiet, residential area. We felt very safe. While I did not meet either host, they were both there for any questions and were quick to help us with an internet connection issue. They had snacks for us which was greatly appreciated. They even had a manual with tips about the place and location. You can tell they really put a lot of thought into the studio to make it comfortable for their guests. I would love to stay again. Thank you Lynda and Adin!
55329	3404700	10.0	9.0	34983838	I got this place for my mom while I was graduating with my Master's from the UW, so needless to say, there was a lot going on at once. Adin and Lynda's place was just as the listing said it would be, very quiet and accommodating, centrally located and perfect for her needs. 
55330	3404700	10.0	9.0	35803322	Linda and Adin met us, we had checked in a little earlier, all had proceeded well. Dogs were just great, we had no worries at all. We received lots of information as to bus routes and travel information. Goodies left for us for breakfast, fruit, a lovely touch. Appartment was clean and there were plenty of towels etc. this location is in West Seattle. However bus routes are very good and drivers always so helpful. 
55331	3404700	10.0	9.0	36292112	Adin and Lynda were great hosts!! The place is very clean, nice bedroom, and kitchen has everything you need. It is very private with a separate entrance and designated parking spot. Adin and Lynda are both available by phone/text anytime as needed with great communication. The dogs are very friendly and the location is quiet. I loved the breakfast essentials that were provided (fruit, coffee, tea, bagels). I highly recommend and would definitely stay again!
55332	3404700	10.0	9.0	36775193	Adin and Lynda was very welcoming and with good advices about visiting seattle. It was great place to stay in a nice neighborhood with good bus connections to seattle and the beautiful Alki beach. We enjoyed our stay in the comfortable accomendation. Thank you!
55333	3404700	10.0	9.0	37317703	Adin and Lynda were very responsive, and made checking in and out so easy.  The bed was very comfortable, the linens luxurious, and the kitchen was well-supplied.  The neighborhood was nice, and Chip and Salsa (the dogs) were friendly and welcoming.  
55334	3404700	10.0	9.0	37699940	I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while in the area house hunting with my son. The studio is just as pictured--clean, bright, and stocked with everything needed. Adin and Lynda were wonderful hosts and although we didn't need anything additional while we were there, they made sure I knew they were only a phone call away. This was my first experience using AirBnB, and I certainly plan to use the service again. I will definitely let friends and family know about this little gem when they come to visit my family in the area now!
55335	3404700	10.0	9.0	38269322	We had the best time staying at Adin and Lynda's studio apartment. It felt like a home away from home. The studio was clean and neat, and had everything we needed for our short stay. Adin and Lynda even had some fruit and cookies available for us to snack on. Such a nice touch! The neighborhood is very quiet, and it was a pleasure to return to the studio daily after sightseeing for hours. Adin and Lynda provided a list of local restaurants as well as all the schedules and info necessary to ride public transportation. The studio was centrally located and very close to Sea-Tac airport. We would definitely book the studio again if we ever return to Seattle. 
55336	3404700	10.0	9.0	39021050	The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Of course, as a studio, it's a bit small, but Adin and Lynda have made good use of the space and thought of everything a guest might need. Thank you!
55337	3404700	10.0	9.0	39599820	The neighborhood was very nice and quiet. The studio was very cute and super clean. Adin and Lynda were very thoughtful and even checked on us to make sure we were happy with everything.
55338	3404700	10.0	9.0	40347587	We really enjoyed our stay at Adin & Lynda's. The suite was comfortable, clean and pretty. It had everything we needed. We really appreciated the snacks, city guides/maps and Lynda's food places suggestions. 
55339	3404700	10.0	9.0	41432739	This was my second visit to this apartment because I really enjoyed my first visit. The apartment is very convenient for visits to Seattle because it's just approx. 300 feet away from a No. 125 bus line stop. Travel by bus into downtown Seattle takes only about 20 to 25 mins. The apartment is kept very clean and has all the necessary amenities. Bed is large and comfortable. On this second trip I just waved a greeting to Adin  and did not have any need to consult with either host. But on my first trip the hosts were very helpful in providing directions, etc. Probably the most attractive feature of this rental is its price -- a bargain by Seattle standards.    
55340	3404700	10.0	9.0	41766140	Adin and Lynda's place is a fantastic and well appointed bungalow. Private and relatively quiet, the skylight and homey touches like a bowl of fruit make it very liveable. We wanted to stay a week!
55341	3404700	10.0	9.0	42284840	It was a very quaint and lovely studio. Although we didn't meet, all the amenities were awesome and the bus guide was a life saver....would stay again :)
55342	3404700	10.0	9.0	42701646	The apartment matched the listing description exactly! The owners made us feel welcome by providing a welcome sign on their patio table and providing a detailed binder for our stay including suggestions for things to do in the area. The neighborhood was nice and quiet with easy access to the downtown area and airport. 
55343	3404700	10.0	9.0	43786097	This was a wonderful place to stay and the dogs, Chip and Salsa are very friendly
55344	3404700	10.0	9.0	44351037	Delightful little place - clean, quiet with snacks! When visiting grandkids I'll be sure to make this place my sanctuary.
55345	3404700	10.0	9.0	44815160	Theirs is the most thoughtful and well designed space. While small, every inch was devoted to function. From the hooks to the breakfast nook to the bedside tables. We really admired how adin and Lynda thought of everything for a comfortable visit. The key exchange was also very convenient. We came in late at night and they left a light on for us. 
55346	3404700	10.0	9.0	45372195	The accommodations were exactly as we expected!  Clean, well stocked, and the perfect size for a couple visiting Seattle for the first time.  Adin and Lynda answered all my questions in a timely manner and gave great advice on things to do around the city and how to get there.  Definitely recommend for 1-2 people 
55347	3404700	10.0	9.0	46759841	Quiet neighborhood, 15 minutes away from Downtown. Very cozy and perfect for just a few nights in Seattle.
55348	3404700	10.0	9.0	48583283	Adin & Lynda were great!  I really liked having a separate space that I could have to myself.  The studio was located above the garage, which was separate from the house.  The location was fantastic, in that it was very quiet  and private.  The hosts were available for my questions and they made me feel very welcome.  The space was very clean, and it was perfect for my trip to the Seattle area.  I'm hoping to stay with them again in the near future.  
55349	3404700	10.0	9.0	49770225	Adin & Lynda made our stay very comfortable. They addressed our needs and questions in a timely manner. The studio was very clean, cozy, cute and everything described in the listing. The location of the studio was perfect for our visit. We were only 15 short minutes away from downtown Seattle. The highway was easily accessible which made our visit great! Seattle is a great place and when we visit again, we would stay try to stay at this studio again!
55350	3404700	10.0	9.0	52710345	We stayed at Adin and Lynda'place for almost three weeks, and we had a wonderful time. The place is very new and clean. Well equipped. Adin and Lynda were always there when we need anything. We would definitely recommend this place! 
55351	3404700	10.0	9.0	53440293	It was my second time staying here and it's been by far my favourite experience. So cozy 
55352	3404700	10.0	9.0	54292422	Very cute place in West Seattle! Would definitely stay here again. Adin and Lynda were great hosts! 
55353	3404700	10.0	9.0	54936409	My husband and I just moved to Seattle and needed time to find an apartment. This cozy above garage place was perfect for what we needed in our in between time. The owners were very friendly but not as friendly as their two dogs. To be greeted every morning by loving dogs was an added bonus for us. I would recommend his place to anyone wanting to stay in the West Seattle area. 
59048	6349598	9.0	9.0	39706590	A simple Seattle weekend trip without any problems.  Thanks!
59049	6349598	9.0	9.0	40669269	Turnkey operation.  Haley showed up timely to let me in an give a tour.  Fresh towel hot shower internet connection, everything I needed. Clean. 
59050	6349598	9.0	9.0	41830259	Haley was responsive and accommodating. Check in and check out were simple and straightforward. She left detailed information about the property and the surrounding area. The place was lovely; clean, comfortable, and well furnished. The location was very convenient. The neighborhood is trendy, and there are a lot of bars and restaurants within walking distance. I'd definitely stay there again.
59051	6349598	9.0	9.0	42971616	Great location and beautiful space for a fun weekend in Seattle.  Hayley was very attentive during the checkin process and provided a great experience overall.  Would highly recommend.

66894	2298775	9.0	9.0	11839081	What an amazing place to stay in Seattle: a rural farm in the city! It's such a joy to walk into this oasis and to leave the hustle and bustle behind you. It is like going back to another, more peaceful era. And the home itself is full of wonderful family history, comfort and simple joy. Lee and Steve are generous and goodnatured hosts, warmhearted and progressively working towards a sustainable future for themselves and their local community. A great source of information about what is truly good about Seattle and Seattlelites. 
66895	2298775	9.0	9.0	13610728	"Lee and Steve are nice family.
They respect my privacy so much, they check me daily if i need any thing,
Am talkibg about month not days or week.
I extend my stay one month more."
66896	2298775	9.0	9.0	15592687	I really enjoyed staying with Lee and Steve. They were very welcoming but also gave me as much personal space as I needed. My room was very clean, spacious and comfortable. I loved walking through the surrounding garden and seeing all of the delicious food and beautiful flowers they are growing. The house is in a quiet neighborhood with a very short walk to the bus stop. Lee and Steve are kind and authentic people and I really appreciated their hospitality. 
66897	2298775	9.0	9.0	16228492	We had a great stay here, it's nice to be so close to the city - a 20/30 min bus ride away - whilst feeling like you're in the country. The house is very comfy and Lee and Steve are incredibly hospitable, also the fresh veg from the garden was delicious. 
66898	2298775	9.0	9.0	16811851	The house is in a really cool location - it feels like you are on a private farm far out of the city but it's actually just at the very end of long driveway on a dead-end street. Steve was easy to communicate with and very welcoming. Our room was comfortable and we had everything we needed.
66899	2298775	9.0	9.0	18261930	Lee and Steve were amazing hosts. Their house was exactly as described and it was just as charming as you would expect. Their place felt like a home away from home. Were I not moving to Seattle permanently I would check availability here before any other place. Both the place and the hosts were unforgettable.
66900	2298775	9.0	9.0	19105732	I really loved staying here. The garden is amazing, Lee and Steve are funny, warm, wonderful people, and the house is beautiful and peaceful. There are bus stops nearby and it's not too far from the university or downtown. I felt completely at home here, and would come back in a heartbeat. Thank you so much!
66901	2298775	9.0	9.0	21279498	We stayed with Lee and Steve for a month and had a wonderful time. They're both incredibly friendly and warm and made sure we had everything we needed and gave us great neighborhood and city recommendations. The location is perfect- you feel like you're on a farm in the country, but you're actually a quick drive from the city and have access to bus lines and restaurants nearby. The house and room are very cozy, and as a bonus, they have the world's sweetest dog. We would recommend this place to anyone, especially travelers doing long stays. 
66902	2298775	9.0	9.0	21684818	It was a cozy and safe place to stay. Off on a nice secluded road, but still close enough to everything. Lee and Steve were very nice down to earth people.
66903	2298775	9.0	9.0	25682171	What a wonderful place!  Thank you, Lee and Steve, for making me so welcome and offering your home as a friendly refuge. I loved being in this beautiful, country-like setting but accessible to everything by bus and nearby a friend's house.  Lee and Steve were gracious and generous, helping me get oriented, allowing me privacy, and sharing their homemade bread, jams, tea, and affectionate dog with me.  I look forward to staying there again when I return to Seattle in the summer.    
66904	2298775	9.0	9.0	27314729	"We loved staying with Lee and Steve! While the house is in the heart of the Maple Leaf neighborhood, it is also tranquil and quiet. The double room is as described with a dresser and desk, which was great to work at. 
The house is easy biking distance from the U-district and walking distance from the ""center"" of Maple Leaf. We loved nearby Reckless Video store. The kitchen provides a nice communal space for everyone, including Toby, the lovable border collie. 
Lee and Steve gave us a ton of great recommendations on places to explore with our bikes, from Redhook Brewery to Ballard.
They are caring and attentive to their guests and also make sure guests have their own space.
We highly recommend this lovely place!
"
66905	2298775	9.0	9.0	28940929	"Lee and Steve made us feel right at home! They are super friendly and really nice to be around, always fun to talk to. They always offered recommendations on places to visit and restaurants to eat at. And their doggy, Toby, is the friendliest dog! It's a lot of fun to play Toby, he's got so much energy!
The room we stayed at is really clean and spacious. The house is really comfortable and feels nicely secluded, with lots of trees and space, specially when playing with Toby. The neighborhood is nice and quiet, with grocery stores within biking distance. The house is also really close to quiet streets and biking routes, so it's easy to come and go with a bike or a car. 
Really great hosts and wonderful place to stay at!"
66906	2298775	9.0	9.0	33541573	Very welcoming home with an amazing organic garden.  Lee, Steve and Toby (the dog) create a wonderful community atmosphere!
66907	2298775	9.0	9.0	37215536	Wonderful place and nice people, I would highly recommend it if you like peace and quiet.
66908	2298775	9.0	9.0	37973765	Lee and Steve made us feel very welcome, and Toby too! We enjoyed wandering around the property after a busy day and relaxing among the gardens. They were very helpful when we needed it, and respected our privacy when we needed it. We will definitely stay again. 
66909	2298775	9.0	9.0	38240944	Lee and Steve were so warm and friendly!  We even got to meet some of their friends, family, and pets, who were equally welcoming.  Their place is cozy and quirky – truly a one-of-a-kind experience!
66910	2298775	9.0	9.0	39063384	Lee and Steve were extraordinary hosts. We were very pleased to stay in their lovely home and to get to know them. Their dog Toby is the most gentle and loving border collie with an unforgettable personality. The house is located near a bus stop which is where we started our travels around town. The room was spacious with charming furnishings and a very, very comfy bed. The land where they grow various fruits and vegetables (which Lee kindly offers to the guests) is lush and picturesque. We almost didn't want to go anywhere because it was so cozy to hang around the house. Lee and Steve were kind and thoughtful, and gave us our privacy when needed/great advice for sights to see/and lovely conversations. Lee even drove us to the airport which we really appreciated. We loved their place and would recommend it to everyone we know. Thank you for everything!
66911	2298775	9.0	9.0	47382969	Lee & Steve were very kind hosts. They have a beautiful garden and it was a lot like being on a farm rather than the city. Very peaceful and laid back. They also have a lot of valuable information on the area. I will certainly being staying again next time im in the area
66912	2298775	9.0	9.0	47706498	Staying with Lee and Steve feels like being in the country, even though their home is in the midst of Seattle. Their home in its setting is quiet, peaceful, rural and lush, a refuge in the city. They are open, warm and welcoming, and I had full use of the facilities of the house. Looking forward to returning, when the opportunity arises.
66913	2298775	9.0	9.0	48039504	What a little paradise and peaceful place. Our stay was just too short. Definitely recommended.
66914	2298775	9.0	9.0	48719813	Lee and Steve are very sweet. They shared their supper with me, and gave me a ride in the morning. It was a was a very peaceful place to be, and the surroundings are beautiful.
66915	2298775	9.0	9.0	52316875	"I stayed with them for a month. Overall, I think they are nice people doing the best they can. However, I experienced them not being comfortable with me using the kitchen on a daily basis. I was surprised to hear from them that other long term guests did not cook regularly. I tried my best to cook every 5-6 days; cook before Lee would start her kitchen. These methods were helpful, but not a lot. I always felt not welcome in the kitchen space and would always walk on egg shells.
Perhaps they have been hosts for a long time, and I feel they are burned out. I say so as I am going to share some of the instances. 
There was an issue with the bath towel. I changed my towel position in the bathroom from a hook to a place I could spread it out (it was damp). Many evenings when Lee came from work; she would be overwhelmed, and I would try to stay clear. I mentioned it to her next morning. She screamed, had a very angry look, snatched my and other neighboring towels, and accused me of using other towels. I had to defend myself saying that I only used my towel. She apologized later; but clearly I did not expect such behavior from a host.
The utensils to heat food for guests were 2 steel pots only. And we were two guests staying there. Last weekend, she had invited guests, and used both the pots in the afternoon. I had no pot to heat my food. I asked when would be an appropriate time to heat my dinner (I was considerate as she had guests that night), and she said 5:00 pm, to which I disagreed. If I had two Airbnb guests, and limited kitchen space; I would either not invite additional guests, or not take in two long term Airbnb guests, but that is me. That night I requested I close the kitchen door after dinner, as I had to get up early next day. The air was clearly filled with tension; I could see they did not like my request. Surprisingly, the laughter and noise got louder after the request. I wondered why I had requested in the first place.
Additionally, there was no dishwasher or microwave. Heating in the microwave would be helpful, as it would reduce the time and energy washing the pots. The bus stops were up and down the steep hill. So if one does not drive, getting groceries by bus and walk is not an easy task. 
I cannot speak for short term. But if one decides to stay long term and walk to get the groceries, and use the kitchen on a daily basis, this may not be the best place. 
Finally, Toby was a wonderful dog. Outside issues around the kitchen, towel etc., I think they are basically good people, but are too overwhelmed. They could perhaps not include kitchen in amenities for long-term guests.

66916	2298775	9.0	9.0	54545978	This was my second stay with Lee & Steve. Though brief this time, it was just as good as the first, and I'm looking forward to staying with them again in their beautiful and quiet oasis in the midst of Seattle.
69097	8340819	9.0	9.0	47019609	"We had a really wonderful time at Suzanne’s and Dennis’s home. Suzanne and Dennis are very welcoming hosts. They made us feel right like at home (but better!) from the moment we arrived. The house is very zen, full of light and cozy. The bedroom was very nice, with an amazing spacious shower that make you feel in a natural cascade! All was perfectly clean, we had everything needed (coffee in week-end's mornings, the room has a desk, organic shower products were there too). 
The kitchen had all we needed to cook, and a space in the fridge to keep our food.
Their two dogs are adorable, very quiet. We spent 3 days in Suzanne's home during our house's hunting (we just moved from Fairbanks to Seattle) and it was the best of the four airbnb we booked in Seattle! We (a French couple in their 28-29) highly recommend this airbnb!"
69098	8340819	9.0	9.0	55253811	Suzanne's place is cozy and nice, best part is the rain shower! We stayed in the winter and it was quite warm and comfy. It is kind of near the street, the noise didn't bug me but in case you are a light sleeper.
70409	6783394	10.0	9.0	36912945	"Mack was very kind. We were the first guests to stay at the apartment, and unfortunately the host didn't have time to set it up as advertised. One example: when he met us at the apt, He let us know that he'd moved in the day before, and that the wireless wouldn't be hooked for a couple of days. He kindly provided a hotspot password as a temporary solution, but the speeds were inadequate to accomplish what we needed. 

As I said, Mack was very kind as a host. But our stay as the ""guinea pigs"" at this property was not perfect. Location was convenient, but parking complicated. Best not to have a car here. "
70410	6783394	10.0	9.0	37793049	"My son and I stayed at Mack's loft for just a quick overnight trip to Seattle. The place is clean and well care for. Parking isn't available within the garage. And super limited at best, on the street. However , the loft sits right off the main street of Elliot so public transportation is easily accessible. (Once you're inside the apartment the sound of traffic is minimal. )
Located up the hill a few block is N Queen Anne with plenty of shops , coffee & restaurants. Be prepared to walk up some steep hills! The waterfront is across the street and easily accessed as well. 
All in all the space served us well for our purpose and Mack was very accommodating. "
70411	6783394	10.0	9.0	38550317	"The place was wonderful; a cool loft right across from the water.  I used the kitchen and laundry as well which all worked great.  They even had a few fresh snacks in the fridge.  I left some as well following my stay.

Mack had his contact meet me and walked me through the place.  It's right next to downtown ($5 uber ride away) and perfectly located.

Only thing I would mention is that you are on a fairly busy street.  There's also no a/c which sounds pretty normal for Seattle however it was unusually warm.  Plenty of fans through the unit and the windows allow lots of air in.

Lastly, it's right across the street from an AWESOME running path.  I did 4 miles 2x across a ped bridge and directly against the water - an absolutely awesome run and lots of active people there.

I would totally recommend this place."
70412	6783394	10.0	9.0	38897020	Mack is a very helpful and friendly host . His apartment was very clean and cosy. Location is good too. We had a great stay in Seattle! Thank you Mack!
70413	6783394	10.0	9.0	39135478	"It was my first time using AirBNB and I was hesitant at first but Mack made us feel welcome. He was there waiting for us and directions were straight forward. It is a nice, clean, modern loft and exactly as in the description. Having 2 washrooms (1.5 to be exact) was a plus when getting ready in the morning or getting ready to go out. The only downside was that there was no A/C and it was one of the hottest days of the year but to counter that Mack supplied us with 3 fans which did help a lot. I would stay here again as I do visit Seattle often. 
   "
70414	6783394	10.0	9.0	39796092	Mack was a very attentive host.  Seattle was in the middle of a heat wave and the apartment was pretty warm (facing West) so he went out and bought a portable A/C to help cool the place down. Kudos to Mack.  He really tried his best to make us feel comfortable and at home. Public transport across the street was very handy to Downtown.
70415	6783394	10.0	9.0	40386777	"Mack is an amazing host! I can't say enough good things about the place and his hospitality. Not only were the details thought out, but he went above and beyond to coordinate check-in and check-out while being incredibly responsive. 

It's evident he cares very much about his guest's experience. He respects the Airbnb vision and provided a very accurate description. 

The location is perfect and so is the place. I highly recommend booking. "
70416	6783394	10.0	9.0	40927700	First, Mack is an amazing host! From our first interaction after confirming, he went above and beyond by sharing his home, city details, restaurants, grocery store, attractions and was available by phone or email should something needed. Nothing needed!! The location could not be any better for downtown and waterfront (Pike's) and the loft has everything you need and then some! My husband and I loved the bed, awesome sleep! It was unusually hot, he had a portable air conditioner installed!! What hasn't he thought of? Even topped it off with some very nice ear plugs!! We had a great visit, our first in Seattle, and, I have to say, having such a great interaction with Mack pretty much foreshadowed a great time!  It is 1.5 miles from Pike's market, walkable if not time constrained, or 8 minutes by Uber or Taxi. 
70417	6783394	10.0	9.0	41373851	"First time in Seattle and loved the experience. Great Unit, it was clean but unusually hot during our stay. Portable ac is available as well as portable fan both downstairs and upstairs. Make sure u lock windows while away,  portable ac is hooked up to window  and needs to be cracked open to let air out, since unit is on 1st floor be careful cuz a person can squeeze thru the window. Also the window next to door needs to be LOCKED if u leave it cracked open someone can stick their hand thru the window and unlock your door, please beware! Besides that unit is close to pikes market and nice eatery spots up the steep hill. If u decide to cook whole foods and Safeway is close by. If u decide to get a parking spot in garage make sure u have small car, parking stall are tight fitting. I had a Ford Mustang my girl 5""2  had to park car and she had tough time getting out of car. The stall that was provided to us had a wall to the right and to the left was car that didn't move during our entire stay. "
70418	6783394	10.0	9.0	41667557	Great location, near downtown and waterfront. A little noisy since its by busy street
70419	6783394	10.0	9.0	42279916	Mack is easy to reach for checkin and questions, and he was awesome giving tips for dining, shopping, and neighborhoods to see. 
70420	6783394	10.0	9.0	42912752	This loft is in a great central location, close to Belltown, Downtown, Fremont, and Queen Anne neighborhoods.  There is also a convenience store less than a block away for those last minute supplies.  The space was well stocked with essentials like cookware, bathroom supplies, and had very nice appliances (TV, dishwasher, washer/dryer) perfect for a longer stay.  Mack and Diane were also very gracious hosts, making me feel at home from the very beginning and answering my questions promptly throughout our stay!
70421	6783394	10.0	9.0	43430461	Everything was perfect. Perfect location in my opinion, everything was within a 2 minute drive or a $5 Uber ride. I would highly recommend getting the parking permit from Diane & Mack. The place looked really nice and provided us a great home base. The place was perfectly described and I knew exactly what to expect when I arrived to to their excellent communications skills
70422	6783394	10.0	9.0	44013960	"This place was awesome! Super cool loft, had everything I needed and was in an area where everything was a quick Uber ride away. Mack was super helpful when I needed him, responded to text messages and even offered to come by and reset the wireless router when it was running slow! I would totally recommend this loft to anyone I know! Thank for the great place to stay, Mack!

"
70423	6783394	10.0	9.0	45488102	"A great apartment in a good location of Seattle. Plenty of space and amenities, good welcome and I had everything I needed here.

There is a beautiful area to go running nearby.. ask Diane or Mack!

Thank you guys for making your apartment available and for making me feel so welcome."
70424	6783394	10.0	9.0	45848827	"Having never been to Seattle before, I was initially wary of the loft's location on a busy street, in a seemingly remote location. However, I quickly realized that everything was accessible within a 5-7 minute drive. The loft also came with a parking spot, a rare gem in Seattle.

The loft itself is clean, comfortable and cozy. As others have mentioned, there is some noise from the street; however it's barely audible in the sleeping loft. The furniture was also very comfortable; and I thoroughly enjoyed the free Roku subscription, with Netflix, HBOGo and other favorites.

Lastly, you couldn't have asked for a better host with Mack; he was quick and attentive and made my husband and I feel welcomed. 

Overall, I started out wary but ended up very delighted with my choice. This is a hidden gem!"
70425	6783394	10.0	9.0	46157043	The loft was clean and everything was accurate as it appears on the listing.  Rooftop was amazing and location is perfect for jogging/running by the beach.
70426	6783394	10.0	9.0	46528847	"Had a great visit here and would recommend to others. Apartment is in a great location accessible to many cool spots. Accommodations are very comfortable and everything in excellent working order. 

Only downside as others have mentioned is the window situation - tough to leave them open for better circulation when weather is warmer because they increase noise from busy street and also could make apartment less secure.  The fans help a lot to alleviate this issue  "
70427	6783394	10.0	9.0	46643574	"We had a great stay at Mack and Diane's place--it was very clean, centrally located and nicely appointed. 

Appreciated the easy communication and early check-in!"
70428	6783394	10.0	9.0	47120980	The stay I had with Mack and Diane was amazing! They were very nice and quick to respond. The home was a very nice loft located on the north side of DT Seattle. We walked to the Space Needle in 20 minutes. 
70429	6783394	10.0	9.0	47235548	It was a beautiful loft.  Clean, modern and accommodating. They were punctual in handing over the keys and there was a parking space for our vehicle.  Thanks for letting us stay in your wonderful home!!
70430	6783394	10.0	9.0	47543604	"The loft is gorgeous, and exactly as pictured. We were too introverted to seek out the communal balcony, so we never caught the view, but the location's just a stone's throw from the water. We were able to walk to the EMP and Space Needle, and everything else was a $10 Uber.

The apartment is meticulously clean, and the furniture all comfy and new, and Mack and Diane were friendly, helpful, and fantastic about communication. We had a great stay overall, but if you're a light sleeper be aware that the front door is frosted glass, so diffused streetlight glows through at night. Because it's a loft, there's no blocking this out from the bedroom, so if you need total darkness grab an eyemask. "
70431	6783394	10.0	9.0	47874437	"Listing was exactly as described - very clean with everything we needed for our one night stay in Seattle. Minor downsides were that the upper floor got a bit stuffy when the windows were closed and the place is located on a higher traffic street. Closing the windows took out most of the noise from traffic though :). 

The location is close to the water and a healthy walk away from the main tourist spots (took us about 20 minutes to walk to Pike Place area). The walk to Pike Place was gorgeous since we passed through Olympic Sculpture Park.

Mack & Diane were able to accommodate a slightly earlier check in which was fantastic. There was a slight hiccup in communication around check in and check out but we were still able to check in and out without issue, though we didn't get to meet Mack in person."
70432	6783394	10.0	9.0	48152951	"Amazing apartment! Stayed 2 nights with my girlfriend. 
When we arrived Mack kindly greeted us and showed the place and parking. 
Apartment had everything we needed and more! We felt right at home.
The rooftop of the building has a very cool place to hang out.
We walked to pike place market and downtown, took us about 20 minutes. Uber back cost us 6$.
Mack is truly the best host. We accidentally forgot the apartment's umbrella in our bag when we left but when I told Mack what happened he just said ""no worries :) it's cool that you have it."""
70433	6783394	10.0	9.0	48340395	Diane and Mack were excellent hosts and their loft was gorgeous. Perfect location to walk around and enjoy great food and drink. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle!
70434	6783394	10.0	9.0	48760995	Good location, nice apartment with easy & prompt communications and straightforward check-in with Dianne and Mack. 
70435	6783394	10.0	9.0	49064102	Wonderful location and within walking distance to most anything you want to see in Seattle. We like to walk so it was just perfect. Very clean and all necessary amenities were available. Thanks Mack and Diane!
70436	6783394	10.0	9.0	49237165	first off the place was great! we did not get to meet Diane but we did get to meet Mack and he was courteous enough to meet us at 1130 at night to show us the apartment. He also left us a lil map and places to eat. over all the place was exactly what we were looking for. if I had to leave something negative to say it would only be the fact that we were on ground floor but we actually liked that but I know others wouldn't. so all in all 5 STARS goes too this lil loft 
70437	6783394	10.0	9.0	49812099	The stay was fantastic.  Our host greeted us and showed us how everything operated and where everything was and stayed long enough to fill us in on some of the attractions around town.  I can't wait till I need to go up there again.  I will definitely give them a shout.
70438	6783394	10.0	9.0	50219041	The apartment is awesome. We had a really great time there. 
70439	6783394	10.0	9.0	50413756	Diane and Mack were amazing hosts. They were very welcoming and helpful. The place is very clean, cozy, private and in a great location. 
70440	6783394	10.0	9.0	50716050	The loft is warm and clean. The bed and pillow are very soft. The TV connected to Chromecast so that you could watch movie in your iPhone (even Youtube and bilibili) conveniently. The location is not very far from Pike market, you can call a uber to visit downtown Seattle and it would cost around 8 dollars. Btw, although we didn't meet Diane & Mack, they still give us some suggestions by messages. It's a good choice to settle down, would consider it next time. 
70441	6783394	10.0	9.0	50755794	"This apartment was easy to get to, spotless, comfortable and affordable.  It is modern and has all the amenities you could want.  
Mack and Diane responded immediately to my questions and texts.
They thought ahead by providing ear plugs since the street traffic can be significant at rush hours.  
Thank you Mack and Diane!  "
70442	6783394	10.0	9.0	51833740	We enjoyed staying at Diane and Mack's apartment in Seattle. It was spacious and in a great neighborhood. It was a little noisy (it's located on a busy street) so if you are one of those people who need absolute quiet it would be something to take into consideration. 
70443	6783394	10.0	9.0	52022659	Diane and smacks place was great. They were very accommodating and everything was clean and well appointed.  
70444	6783394	10.0	9.0	52523933	We loved staying at Diane & Mack's loft! It was exactly as advertised & very close to downtown attractions!
70445	6783394	10.0	9.0	52934296	"This loft is beautiful, very clean and tidy. There was a coffee maker and a few granola bars provided. We walked everywhere and there's a nice running path nearby. Only downside is that it's a little noisy but they provide earplugs and it didn't disturb our sleep at all.
One thing to note - parking is $25 a day for a secure spot and our spot was taken when we arrived, an unpleasant surprise on a rainy Seattle evening! Diane and Mack suggested that we talk with the property manager about it which didn't sound fun during vacation (particularly because they had mentioned on the listing that we should be careful what we say to them, so just seemed confusing and stressful), so instead we parked outside for the weekend and were afraid to take our car anywhere in case we couldn't find one of the few free 24 hour spots nearby. Additionally Diane and Mack didn't offer to refund us for parking until we brought it up. "
70446	6783394	10.0	9.0	53284721	We had a great stay in Seattle! The loft was clean and perfectly located- only a short Uber to Pike Market Place, Capitol Hill, and lots of killer coffee shops. Parking was easy as well.
70447	6783394	10.0	9.0	53631131	Mack made us feel welcomed by providing suggestions for restaurants/breweries and by being extremely responsive in the preliminary booking stages.  He was more than accommodating in all aspects.  I originally booked another of Mack's locations which turned out to be unavailable during our trip dates.  He offered the 600 Elliott Ave location and honored the original pricing; I appreciated the accountability and fairness.  The listing was accurate and the place was perfect for our stay.  The loft complex was safe but the loft was on a busy street and not really walking distance from downtown.  I enjoyed my stay at Mack's listing and would stay here again. 
70448	6783394	10.0	9.0	54026875	"The loft was perfect, exactly like the pictures! My friend and I thorougly enjoyed the space. I'm very picky when it comes to lodging & this did not feel as if you were ""staying at someone's"" house - meaning it was hotel-like yet with a wonderful cozy and warm atmosphere. Very close to downtown, extremely clean, well-appointed amenities including ear plugs for the street traffic which didn't bother me - that coming from a light sleeper that actually slept downstairs on the comfy couch. It took a while and some back-n-forth msgs to figure out how to use Chromecast. But Mack and Sophia were great & fast with responses. Street parking has limited hours but still great if you don't mind moving it before the morning traffic rush. Can't wait to return for another stay!"
70449	6783394	10.0	9.0	54614352	"The loft is gorgeous and spacious, with all the necessary amenities. It is about 30 mins to Pikes Place as mention through a very scenic walk through Olympia Sculpture park. The roof top looks awesome though it was too cold during our stay to properly enjoy. The kitchen was well equipped as well if you are looking for some cooking from ingredients from Pikes Place market. 

Mack and Sophia was responsive throughout and would recommend for your stay in  Seattle. 

As per some who mentioned, the unit is along the main street with windows which we left shut during the stay. As it was cold, we did not had any issues. "
70450	6783394	10.0	9.0	54895132	We had a great stay at this beautiful loft!  We loved that it was centrally located to downtown Seattle, and really enjoyed the rooftop deck overlooking the water.  The loft was really clean and exactly as described, however it was a bit noisy at times, being located on a major street.  Overall, we would highly recommend this listing!
70451	6783394	10.0	9.0	55036820	Mack and Sophia were excellent hosts and both my girlfriend and I felt very comfortable in their home trying airbnb for only our second time. They not only responded quickly to any of our questions about the location and check in/out instructions but were also cool by providing us a list of places to check out in the city. The bed was very comfortable and their home provided more than enough space for two.  All I can say further is that the easy check in instructions sent to us through email helped us to quickly drop off our stuff and get back to the downtown area and enjoy such an eclectic city as Seattle. Great vacation, thanks you two.
70452	6783394	10.0	9.0	55332004	We had a very nice stay . Apartment was nice , clean and  hosts were excellent with communication . 
70453	6783394	10.0	9.0	55622511	"Hypercritical host, but nice apartment, may be a little bit noisy, cause located near the road.
"
70454	6783394	10.0	9.0	55919858	"Nice and easy stay at Mack's place.  Very clean, smooth check-in process and conveniently located.  We easily walked to Queen Ann, Belltown and Seattle Center, even in the pouring rain:). 

There is street noise, but that can be remedied by the ear plugs they provide, or, like we did, by simply climbing into the uber comfortable bed.  Seriously, the bed was awesome - great night's sleep!"
70455	6783394	10.0	9.0	56049916	"The hosts and place were great! I didn't meet them in person, but received detailed information prior to arrival and had no trouble getting into the unit or checking out. 

The place was spacious and had everything we needed in a great, accessible location. The linens and bed were nice. There were a few nice touches like leaving earplugs on the nightstands in case guests needed further insulation from any street noise (though it wasn't a problem for us). We didn't have time during our stay to make use of the kitchen or living area, but they appeared well-equipped and comfortable, making this a good option for a short or longer stay. 

I'll definitely check it out if I'm in Seattle again and will encourage my friends to do the same."
70456	6783394	10.0	9.0	56577599	I had to make a rushed reservation and Mack was very accommodating and communicated quickly. Their posting was very accurate and a comfortable home base. My Uber trips to downtown were about 5 minutes, it can add up so I would plan on being efficient with commuting downtown.
70457	6783394	10.0	9.0	56928342	This was the best airbnb experience I ever had. Mack and Sophia were really responsive and carried a caring mentality since day 1. The loft is beautiful and was perfect for me and my girlfriend. Everything you need from laundry detergent to cups to a laundry basket is there for you to use. The chromecast was also set up already so you can enjoy a movie or tv shows with no lag on the streaming at any of my usage. Although Seattle is known for rain and it did rain pretty bad sometime during our stay, having a loft like this to stay warm and cosy isn't too bad at all! My girlfriend and I gave this loft a 5/5!
70458	6783394	10.0	9.0	57310716	My first impression is noble, I really like the style of the house. Bluetooth speakers, wireless television, this is a very relaxed environment. Outdoor is the sea. Comfortable and cozy loft bed so I spent three wonderful evening. Mack is a great and thoughtful, he very quickly done all my requirements. And on the kitchen wall have some suggestions and helping that he leave. Clean, comfortable, and convenient transportation. This is for you most satisfied with the choice.
70459	6783394	10.0	9.0	58164015	Mack & Sophia were awesome hosts and their loft was perfect. It was clean and spacious, and they provided clear instructions. Their place is in a central location to all of Seattle's Must-See areas. We definitely enjoyed our stay. 
70763	8150145	10.0	9.0	47323459	Great place ~ comfortable, clean and relaxing.  We would stay again.
70764	8150145	10.0	9.0	48456309	"We had a great stay here!  There was a welcome note, and everything was clean and well prepared.  All our questions were answered within minutes.  We walked two blocks to see everything at the Seattle Center (Space Needle, museums, playground, and lots of other stuff).  There is also a ""Whole Foods""-style market two blocks away.

There is about as much common area as you can expect this close to downtown, and three bed/three bath was plenty.  You can see the Space Needle up close from both upstairs bedroom windows.  The kitchen had everything, the WIFI was good, and the beds were comfortable.  I don't know what else to say.  It was like a home away from home.

This place was sooo much better than getting a hotel!"
70765	8150145	10.0	9.0	49066788	Place was great. Very clean and in a good location. Lots of space, was able to accommodate six of us comfortably. 
70766	8150145	10.0	9.0	50210469	Great location. Clean and comfortable home. Generous supply of amenities. Highly recommended!
70767	8150145	10.0	9.0	51559509	This place is great! So close to the Seattle Center and good restaurants. Very clean and fully furnished with everything you need. Parking included is a huge plus as well.
70768	8150145	10.0	9.0	54061981	Had a very good experience.  The town home was great and comfortably fit all 6 of us.  Lots of privacy between the rooms.  Neighbors were very nice.  The home is centrally located and next to dining,  theaters,  and downtown.  Perfect stay for cheaper than many hotels in the area. 
70769	8150145	10.0	9.0	57244738	"The house was great! Clean, spacious, and well laid out. Great for both adults and kids alike. The entire house felt very modern and came with all the amenities you would need. Excellent location, convenient to local restaurants, bars, grocery and drug stores. Walking distance to Seattle Center made it even better. 

Communication was also great throughout the entire process, leading up to and during our stay. Highly recommended home!"
71518	5325809	9.0	9.0	27372678	We had a very amazing stay in this amazing place. It is a great fit for a family to stay. Quiet rooms and nice kitchen are really suit for family to live with. We enjoyed our stay!
71519	5325809	9.0	9.0	28610766	A BIG thank you to Michelle for providing an awesome place to stay in while my family of four visited Seattle for the week! We are first time Airbnbers (is that a word?) and were nervous booking for the first time. I have to say that even before our arrival my nerves were calmed because of the excellent communication with Michelle. She was quick to respond to my questions and eager to help in any way she could. Once we arrived to the townhouse the butterflies were completely gone after opening the door. Clean, cute, cozy and comfortable! You felt like you were in a home, but not in a place that you had to see much of the other persons stuff. It was great!The parking space was a bonus for our car rental too. There is a bus stop down a lil hill that you can easily find and the neighborhood is a nice one to walk around in. No worries at all. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to all to book. Very happy visitors! Oh, and we left a flower vase for you to fill! Make sure you buy at least a small bouquet of flowers that are available all over the city. Beatutiful…enjoy your stay!
71520	5325809	9.0	9.0	29783835	Michelle was very kind and organized. The apartment was in perfect conditions and she answered everything question on time. I would highly recommend this choice! It's not so close to town but it's ok if you have a car!
71521	5325809	9.0	9.0	32606120	We're very pleased with our stay at Michele's. It is exactly as stated in the description. Location is great, close to some local attractions. Great food around the area as well. Michele has been quite prompt in responding to any questions that we had. All in all, we're quite satisfied with our stay there. 
71522	5325809	9.0	9.0	34023779	I loved staying at Michele's townhome! It was adorable, comfortable, and had everything we needed. My friends and I loved using the Bluetooth speaker and watching Netflix in the living room. The neighborhood is cute and very conveniently located. Michele was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend and would love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle! 
71523	5325809	9.0	9.0	34937952	We truly enjoyed our stay at Michele's townhouse.  It was so comfortable for a group of five and very close to the University of Washington, so we had a quick trip to the graduation ceremonies.  The directions were very clear and the townhouse was as adorable as it looked in the pictures.  My father who does not like to stay in hotels, was thrilled to have such a nice place.  We really enjoyed our first experience with booking a place on AirBnB and couldn't have picked a better place to start.  Thank you Michele.
71524	5325809	9.0	9.0	35500501	The blinds and windows were open so it made us feel welcomed. The place was bright and airy. The house was exactly was described and meet our expectation.
71525	5325809	9.0	9.0	36205785	Thanks Michele! Great directions and info on how to check in ourselves.The  townhouse was fabulous  very clean great space. Kitchen had everything we needed for cooking. The area is close to all the downtown attractions it made it very easy to get around the city. Nice restaurants close by also. The beds were comfortable and area is quiet. It made our trip much more enjoyable than staying at a hotel we would definitely stay here again on our next trip to seattle. Thanks again !
71526	5325809	9.0	9.0	36671223	"It is adorable, inside is neat and clean, we can find everything we expect to find at home. Its located on quiet neighborhood but very close to bus stop (200 mtrs)

Me and wife happy with kitchen, microwave, oven, coffe maker, even coffe grinder all works and at our disposal. My boys (8 and 17) are happy with netflix (well, they fight over remote).

Check-in was easy, michele give clear guide how to get there. We arrive very late at night, michele has all light on and everything ready for our arrival."
71527	5325809	9.0	9.0	37780900	Michele is a fantastic hostess, great communication and the property was wonderful, perfect  for our needs. I would recommend it highly.
71528	5325809	9.0	9.0	38049856	Michele was great! She is super flexible and makes her home very welcoming. The location is awesome as well and not far from all the attractions, the best of all is Seattle is super easy to navigate making getting to her location simple. Definitely would recommend this stop. 
71529	5325809	9.0	9.0	39732234	Adorable is an appropriate description, and the neighborhood is very quiet.  Plenty of room for four adults, even though the 2nd bedroom has just a twin bed.  Initially surprised there was no air conditioning, but soon realized it's really not needed!  Coming from the very hot/humid Midwest, the Seattle summer weather was refreshing.  We used Uber drivers all week, and every single one of them was punctual, polite, and helpful.  A plus when you have elderly parents with you.  Michele was great from the very beginning, and stayed in touch as needed.  The keyless lock on the door was a feature that was really helpful.  Seattle is beautiful, vibrant, and has something for everyone.
71530	5325809	9.0	9.0	40851720	Michele was wonderful and friendly to work with! She made us feel absolutely at home with this gorgeous townhouse. We had a slight miscommunication and Michele refunded 1 nights stay immediately, and without hesitation. I would definitely stay here again.
71531	5325809	9.0	9.0	44680984	Had a great stay, house is just as described - clean, comfortable and in a good location. Enjoyed our stay very much.
71532	5325809	9.0	9.0	45098734	We didn't meet Michele in person but she was extremely responsive when we needed to get in touch and were arriving to the area.  There was a power-outage in the area due to wind storms, and she sent us the information without hesitation and fortunately it was back on that evening.  We were comfortable, and enjoyed our stay.  There was some dog or cat hair around the apartment, but otherwise it was clean. The dishes were accessible and the appliances all worked! Happy with this stay.
71533	5325809	9.0	9.0	47047901	Michele’s townhouse was every bit as nice as promised and beyond. It was very inviting and spotlessly clean with plenty of room to relax. We found the location, in a very nice, quiet residential area, to be great and appreciated the assigned parking spot in back. The spaces are exactly as pictured and everything works. Having the laundry inside the house was especially handy. We had a great vacation and hope to stay here again when we return to Seattle!
71534	5325809	9.0	9.0	47669338	"I had an enjoyable stay at Michelle's house and would recommend her house to anyone looking for a clean house with all amenities in perfect working order. 
Thank you! "
71535	5325809	9.0	9.0	48694947	Amazing house. Great neighborhood. A short drive to great nightlife and University of Washington. House was clean and included plenty of utensils. The host will e-mail you with all the info you'd need. 
71536	5325809	9.0	9.0	49320100	We enjoyed our stay at Michele's place had a couple problems with the water in the tub backing up and when we ran the dishwasher the water backed up into the sink I let Michele know about this and she said she would have someone look at it other than that we basically just used the place to sleep at as we were in town to visit our kids.
71537	5325809	9.0	9.0	50704473	"Charming townhouse in a great neighborhood. Location is nearby majority of Seattle’s local attractions, shops, restaurants, night life entertainment and major freeways.  The house was clean and provided all the needed amenities as well as a designated parking space.  

Michelle was a great host and was highly responsive to all inquiries and questions that we had about the property.

I would definitely stay again and highly recommend this property to those looking to visit Seattle. We enjoyed our stay very much.
"
71538	5325809	9.0	9.0	55438797	We really enjoyed staying here. It's quite comfortable! We cook a lot, and the range & oven is brand new & gas, which makes me happy. It's winter here, and the apartment is warm & well insulated. The apartment comes with a parking spot & cable, so it's very nice.

71828	3613516	8.0	9.0	41651744	"""House Sitting for Darlene and Don"" kinda sums up our AirBnB experience in North Seattle - a well lived in and warm home greeted us on arrival as did a gift basket of wine, crackers and goodies!  The house was spacious and the kitchen waiting to be used - which we did readily.  The bedrooms are small but functional and while the single bathroom had not been updated, everything worked and was clean.  

The sun/yoga deck is the true highlight of the property and Darlene was easily available to answer questions both in advance and during our stay.  Overall a nice property and positive experience.  

One item to note for prospective AirBnB users... this is not a classical rental property - it is a well lived in and neighborhood home.  Part of the experience is watering the plants and feeding the cat.  We enjoyed the comforts of home while still on vacation - enter this property with this mindset and all will be good; if you are looking for a pristine condo feel, this is not your cup of tea."
71829	3613516	8.0	9.0	45142040	The view is certainly amazing. Darlene left towels and some snacks out along with a thoughtful note. We very much enjoyed our stay here.
71898	2303981	10.0	9.0	15257353	We had such a great time at this house! It could not have been more perfect. There was plenty of room for all six adults and one baby. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook. I would give this house a better then perfect review.
71899	2303981	10.0	9.0	15616872	"We had a wonderful stay at Kim and Steve’s house.  Overall we give it a very positive recommendation and we thank them for their hospitality.  The 3 bedrooms worked very well for us.  The apartment is comfortable and very well equipped.  The washer and dryer were a big plus!  Arriving hungry and tired, it was very nice that they had provided some starter foods (coffee, yogurts, Coke and beer).  The location is perfect for those who want to explore the woods and beach of Carkeek Park.  Keep in mind that the trails through the woods to the beach are hilly, not flat.  
 
Seattle can be rather hilly, so we found that a car was pretty necessary.  The taxi ride from the airport cost us $72, but we think we could have used the Seatac van for more like $50.  

If you walk or bike one way from their house there is quite a steep hill.  There is shopping within biking distance the other direction and not such a bad hill that way.  The nearby bus was a farther walk than we liked, so we did end up renting a car.  Once we had the car, we enjoyed the area and Seattle very much.
"
71900	2303981	10.0	9.0	16883093	Kim and Steve are very kind and warm people.  The home is just as described and a wonderful place to say. It is perfect for a family of 6. The location is fantastic for easy access to downtown Seattle, yet you don't feel like you are in the city.  Parks are close, accessible, and wonderful.

72116	3263722	8.0	9.0	16358922	"The house was great for our group of 4 people. It was convenient to have QFC for groceries and some restaurants nearby. It was also pretty quick to get downtown in the morning - I think it took about 20 minutes on average during morning rush hour. 

While the general items provided are minimal (meaning for a group larger than 4 you might have a hard time making dinner with the provided cookware and bedding will be sparse) we were able to make it work well."
72117	3263722	8.0	9.0	17282549	The house is great and the host is warm and considerate. We have a very nice stay there. 
72118	3263722	8.0	9.0	18680498	We had a pleasant stay and it suited our needs. Thank you.

73042	6103108	10.0	9.0	41161469	This was our first Airbnb experience, and I cannot imagine a better one! Tonia made us feel very welcome in her lovely home. The home is beautifully remodeled and clean clean clean. The photos do not do it justice. The queen size bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom had everything we needed. Would we stay with Tonia again? Absolutely. 
73043	6103108	10.0	9.0	41520382	Easy to arrange/communicate and Tonia was very responsive. The room was clean and comfortable and fit for what we needed. 
73044	6103108	10.0	9.0	41556584	"Tonia's place is great.
she rescued us on a last minute booking after another air bnb flaked on us.
she has an adorable house, it work great for us in terms of parking and general accommodation.

she is very friendly and was eager to help us without being intrusive."
73045	6103108	10.0	9.0	43735248	Quiet, easy and comfortable space for my quick visit. Tonia was flexible, personable and a great person. 
73830	1133329	9.0	9.0	4695051	"We are so happy we found this amazing place to stay in Seattle!!

I met my parents in Seattle for the weekend so we needed a 2 bedroom place, pet friendly with flexible check in-out hours... 

Not easy to find... but going through Airbnb I realized it was worth to try a new place in the website, and I wasn't wrong.

Laurie and Gary's 2 bedroom is a GREAT place to stay! They are extremely helpful, friendly and nice couple.

The place is big, nice, clean, comfortable and you literally have everything you need!! Just pack your toothbrush (and underwear) because this place has everything you need and everything is brand new! The kitchen is fully stocked, there is coffee and teas, fridge for your left over food, the bedrooms have extra blankets if you need any, the bathroom has everything as well. Parking on the street was always easy to find just outside the house, its a beautiful neighbourhood. We took a long an pleasant walk along the sea-walk (3 blocks away), there are restaurants, bars, boutiques very close (walking distance) and the drive to Downtown Seattle is about 10 minutes. There is public transit if you are not driving.

We will try to stay in this place again every time we go to Seattle, it was a great find and we were so happy all weekend.

We found a home away from home and we enjoyed it very much!

We are very thankful to Laurie and Gary, they helped my parents a lot when they arrived (I arrived later), they also helped us with directions, suggestions for restaurants and shops around the area, they even helped my dad and fixed a seat belt in his car. 

The communication was very efficient, I was sending messages through the website (I didnt have roaming/calls/texts, but they do have Wi-Fi) and getting responses within minutes.

Long story short it is a GREAT place to stay with AMAZING hosts!"
73831	1133329	9.0	9.0	4843504	"We moved from Chicago to Seattle, and stayed at Laurie & Gary's place while we looked for an apartment for the total of 7 days.  The location is awesome for any family with little ones. This B&B is in the beautiful, safe & quiet neighborhood, and there's a Zoo and the lake nearby.  

Inside the B&B- We were very pleased that they provided nice variety of toys for our 2-year-old. They also had changing tables & other amenities for baby/toddlers.  The kitchen was great.  all the appliances looked new & clean.  We totally enjoyed the fresh coffee every morning!  

Thank you Laurie & Gray, you guys were very friendly & helpful host! "
73832	1133329	9.0	9.0	5063946	2B or not 2B was cute, clean and well stocked. The beds were comfortable...and there was plenty of room for me and my three travel companions. Laurie and Gary had great suggestions for local attractions. They were helpful, but not intrusive. The suite is in a great neighborhood, close to the park, zoo and restaurants. Had we stayed in a hotel, we never would have gotten to know the neighborhood like we did; it was very homey, and more private than a hotel. And plenty of street parking was an extra bonus! 
73833	1133329	9.0	9.0	5184720	We had a wonderful weekend stay at the Milligans house. 3BR as advertised with a great little kitchen and back yard for our dog. The neighborhood is awesome with easy access to Green Lake and Phinney Ridge restaurants. Would definitely come again!
73834	1133329	9.0	9.0	5262429	Laurie and Gary were great hosts! They helped us out in very short notice and tried to help us in any possible ways. The appartment was clean and nice.They answered all our questions and provided good advice when we needed it. Thank you! 
73835	1133329	9.0	9.0	5297465	We enjoyed our stay at your place.  It was clean, quite and very roomy. Thanks
73836	1133329	9.0	9.0	5380649	My trip to Seattle would not have been as great if not for Laurie and Gary's suite. My boyfriend and I are absolute homebodies and this was the perfect place for us. The space was spotless, welcoming, sleek and comfortable. The beds were great and we both had full nights of sleep without any discomfort. While the bedrooms and living room were comfy and everything they needed to be, the bathroom and kitchen/laundry area were probably my favorite. Both were laid out in a very smart way and utilized the space. The water pressure in the shower was awesome. We also loved having the kitchen area and made great use of the tea kettle. It was also unbelievably nice to be able to wash clothes halfway through our visit to the PNW. The place was very convenient to two different bus stops, awesome food, and some sightseeing. We even took a short walk to the zoo one day!  Laurie and Gary had so many suggestions for the area and were very kind and accommodating. Pay attention to all of their food recommendations. Laurie and Gary-and their space-are great! We would stay here again without hesitation. 
73837	1133329	9.0	9.0	5493386	Would recommend for poor college students but not much more.  Pluses for college kids you don't care if its clean as long as it has a bed and a fridge for beer you're set.  Plus you could wash a couple loads of clothes if you were on a road trip or something.    You can't party here but its good enough to crash for a few nights.  We stayed with my parents and it was too hodgepodge for what we paid in my opinion - the 4 person rate was quite high.  First its very odd to enter through the garage.  Its full of clutter and you walk through this clutter to get to the entrance.  It feels very odd to essentially see a storage unit full of randomness.  The other issue was that it wasn't cleaned to a standard that I keep my own home.  A few surfaces were dirty or dusty, wet dirty wash clothes in the shower upon arrival, floors not freshly cleaned so as a whole it was off putting.  It wasn't filthy it just wasn't cleaned thoroughly and it showed.  I also let the owners know and didn't get a response which just seemed odd to me - unless the response was to come make nice with my parents - which didn't resolve the cleanliness issue.  The bathroom rug was really gross we covered it with another towel.  The kitchen is pieces wedged into a small space from Ikea and the bathroom was optimized in a small space.  It was creative with a few nice details like the moon light in the kitchen but in general not on par with some of the other places we have rented for a short vacation.  I probably wouldn't stay again or recommend to anyone since I've stayed at a nicer home for similar price in the University district before.  Sadly they were booked this trip.  Be ware also that these is no air conditioning so the summer months be prepared to get hot.  In general disappointed but we didn't check out early so it was disappointing but not awful.
73838	1133329	9.0	9.0	5734370	We loved our stay at Gary and Laurie's. The house was easy to find and in an excellent location. The apartment is decorated beautifully and has anything you could need for a short-term stay. We were able to hear the conversations of the people in the apartment below and the walls in our apartment were pretty thin. We felt bad because we had a baby with us and thought that maybe other's were bothered by us. Just something to keep in mind.  
73839	1133329	9.0	9.0	5863027	Laurie was a fabulous host!  The apartment was efficient, comfortable and the location was fabulous!  Backyard was a surprising bonus. 
73840	1133329	9.0	9.0	5910090	Laurie went out of her way to return a left behind item and was helpful and attentive upon arrival. The place was perfect, quiet, cozy and well appointed. Great location. Thank you!
73841	1133329	9.0	9.0	6070687	"Our quick trip to Seattle for a wedding was made less stressful by Laurie.  We have a 9 month old and Laurie had everything set up for us by the time we got there.  Great toys, crib, high chair etc.  It was very thoughtful!  The location is really ideal for almost everything in North Seattle and downtown is maybe 10 minutes.
All in all we would definately stay here again, thanks Laurie!"
73842	1133329	9.0	9.0	6139525	"We had a great stay at Laurie's fantastic home, Instantly we felt relaxed and 'moved in'!
It was the perfect size for the tree of us and I love they way the place was put together! 
We even got to meet the dogs!

I will recommend this place to my friends that are Seattle bound and I hope to use it again on our next trip!

Cheers
Mark"
73843	1133329	9.0	9.0	6199431	Apartment was as we expected from the website. It worked well for 4 adults. Well-located and had everything we needed - including lots of info on things to do/see in Seattle. We spent most of our time out and did lots of walking in the area. The lake walk is a real plus!  
73844	1133329	9.0	9.0	6321272	"We rented the 3-bed unit and private bedroom for 3 days as a family group of 4 people in early August.  Laurie and Gary were friendly hosts, and we were grateful for a surprise breakfast and late check-out on our last day, when we were due to catch an o/n flight to London.

The house is well-situated in a pretty, old neighborhood with views down to nearby Green Lake.  No breakfast is provided but we were pleased that it was just a 5 minute walk to local shops and restaurants, and about a 15 minute drive to other areas of interest in Seattle.  The house is nicely decorated, with comfy beds and well appointed bathrooms, and a fully stocked kitchenette/washroom in the 3 bed unit.

On the whole it is very nice accommodation but we feel that we should point out aspects that might be of concern to some potential renters:

(1)	To get to the bathroom from the private bedroom you have to walk through the host's open plan living/kitchen area, where coffee/tea-making facilities are also provided.  The hosts did not use this area much however.
(2)	The 3-bed unit has no door between the hallway and the shared stairway; instead there is a dog gate and curtain.   The bedrooms do have doors, but family members using the unit felt uncomfortable with what they perceived to be a lack of privacy and security when moving around the unit.
(3)	The rooms can get hot during summer and one of our group had a problem with mosquitoes when the windows were opened for ventilation, along with an early awakening by the sun which might not appeal to late risers. 
(4)	One other reviewer has mentioned a bit of dust here and there – we did notice this in the private bedroom.  The living areas and bathroom were very clean however.

Having said all that, we appreciated being in such a lovely neighbourhood and the hosts’ hospitality.  We wish them all the best in their venture.
"
73845	1133329	9.0	9.0	6542945	Great location, nice hosts!  House was only 30 minutes by bus in rush hour to Pikes Market and very close to beautiful Green Lake.  Wifi was a pleasant surprise for us!   Had some take out from Mai Thaiku on Phinney Ave. and would definitely recommend. Wish we had more time in Seattle. We'd stay with Laurie again!
73846	1133329	9.0	9.0	6656696	If you want to know what it's like to live in Seattle, stay here.  It's right in the middle of a cool neighborhood -- narrow streets, crazy parking and all.  (I lived in SEA for 20 years, so I should know)  One night, someone was playing the tuba across the street!  (not late or loud -- it's a family nabe, just a nice bit of music floating across).  But close to everything,   The accommodations are very comfortable -- the host has thought of everything for your comfort (thick towels, good bedding, things for children, a well-equipped little kitchen, comfortable places to put your feet up, a good TV, wireless, etc.)  You can walk to Greenlake, and nice restaurants, bakeries, hole-in-the-wall stores on Phinney and Greenwood.  The apartment is the middle level of a house, and overlooks a lovely, classic-Seattle overgrown backyard courtyard.  i.e. pretty quiet.  Homey.  If you want a luxury hotel, this is not it, but a business traveler or small family could stay here very happily for a while.  Loved it, and would book again. 
73847	1133329	9.0	9.0	7362687	"This location was a serious disappointment.  It was advertised as a 3 bedroom/bath whole house/apt.  Very misleading.  It was 2 very small bedrooms with an uncomfortable futon in the small tv area.  If the futon was used as a ""bedroom"", there was no place to sit and watch tv or eat, since the tiny kitchen only held 2 people. There were cobwebs in every room and a ""gym-like"" smell in the bathroom that didn't go away even after I cleaned it.  All of the towels had to be re-washed since they smelled musty and rancid.  We discovered why when we opened the washer.  The rubber seal on the inside was completely black with mold, long term mold. The owner had a nasty attitude when we approached her about the issues but did refund our money and we left 3 days into our 8 day stay.  There were no doors between us and the 2 other floors where the owners lived, and another guest was staying.  Just curtains hung as ""dividers"".  Both of the beds were double size mattresses right on the bed frame, not even a box spring under them.  This was an after-thought for the owners to try to make some quick money.  Very unpleasant experience.  However, AirBnB handled the mess beautifully and promptly! "
73848	1133329	9.0	9.0	7768416	Everything went sooo smoothly. I was very pleased w/ my stay.
73849	1133329	9.0	9.0	8019749	The place was clean and quiet and easily accessible by bus. Everything ran smoothly and Laurie was available to answer my questions.
73850	1133329	9.0	9.0	8188780	Went with four college friends recently, and stayed here while vacationing in Seattle. We absolutely enjoyed the stay! This place is pretty much in the middle of most of the places we went to! Very nice and quiet at night too, if you're worried about safety and/or noise level. This place has a washer+dryer (with detergent) if you are traveling light and need to do laundry during your stay. Kitchen was very useful too; dishes, utensils, stove, fridge were all very useful. Bathroom towels were provided for us to use, too! Comet and Darwin were awesome too; thanks Laurie for letting us play with them! We'll definitely come back here next time we're in town!
73851	1133329	9.0	9.0	8377758	"We had a very nice stay at Laurie's! The bedrooms are a good size, and the kitchen is cozy and funky. This is a great place to stay with kids and well-behaved dogs, as both the apartment and the neighborhood are small-creature friendly. Phinney Ridge is quiet and mellow, yet has some great restaurants, parks, the lake and zoo, and it's so easy to hop on the bus/99 to get downtown. 

Some reviewers have mentioned a lack of privacy: although a curtain and gate rather than a door separates the apartment from the main house, I felt very comfortable and in no way exposed. The curtain/gate leads to the staircase, and I was greeted once by a friendly, quiet dog, but saw no traffic otherwise.

I also found the entrance through the garage to be fine, private, and easy for coming and going at will. We took a lot of walks in the quiet, pleasant residential streets and enjoyed a true Seattle vibe. Thank you Laurie!"
73852	1133329	9.0	9.0	8943481	"Laurie's apartment was fantastic for us -- we've lived in Seattle before and also have a toddler, and this apartment perfectly accommodated our situation.  I think it's best meant for those who are a little familiar with the city, as it's in a residential area a bit removed from the major sights except for Green Lake.  But you're definitely in walking distance of a cute neighborhood, and easy driving distance to anything you'd want to see in the city.

Laurie obviously has made the extra effort to be child-friendly, and it was SO appreciated by us. One of the bedrooms is down a hallway, a bit removed from the rest of the apartment, so it was perfect for our daughter to nap/sleep there without us worrying about our noise keeping her awake. They provided a pack-and-play, changing pad, infant bathtub, baby shampoo, high chair, and lots of baby/toddler toys. Basically, they've pulled out all the stops to allow you easy, relatively fun travel with a kid!

In conclusion, this apartment's definitely one of the best arguments for going with an Airbnb over a hotel when traveling with kids, and a terrific place to stay when you're in Seattle."
73853	1133329	9.0	9.0	9018439	This was our first opportunity to use airbnb and it was a wonderful experience for our family. The location was perfect for what we like to do, it was a neighborhood not a sterile hotel where everything is alike. We could and did walk the neighborhood, we enjoyed being so close to the Woodland Park Zoo and we could hop on a bus to go anywhere we wanted to without the hassle of driving. We gave thanks for our hosts since we were fortunate to stay there over Thanksgiving. The place was clean and comfortable, perhaps an extra chair would have been nice, but when we were asked if there was enough chairs we said yes, so that is really on us. Laurie was right on top of a concern that we had and told her about. All in all this was a great way to experience a great neighborhood in Seattle. We would gladly do this again at this same site.
73854	1133329	9.0	9.0	9135343	My two sons and I really enjoyed our stay in Laurie's apartment. It was very cozy and had all the comforts of home. It is in a quiet neighborhood, close to nearby attractions and bus lines. There are local eateries within walking distance. Laurie provides lots of helpful information for getting around and for things to do. My family would highly recommend this suite to others, particularly those with children.
73855	1133329	9.0	9.0	9428394	We visited Laurie's home over the Christmas holiday. We were extremely happy with all aspects of our stay. Laurie was an excellent hostess. The three bedroom, one bath, and full kitchen was immaculate equipped with every amenity imaginable. The private entrance code allowed for complete privacy. The unit was also quite tastefully designed in a beautiful neighborhood (just 5 blocks from my brother's house). I took morning walks to the lake a few blocks. I would rather stay in Laurie's place than a 5-star hotel. Thanks Laurie!
73856	1133329	9.0	9.0	9509398	"Laurie's home was the perfect, cozy (heated floors - yippeee) setting for our Christmas break.  We had the entire floor of her home - with a private entrance - and it was equipped with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  This home is just a few short blocks away from shops, restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, etc.  And, there are great choices for lots of outdoor activities nearby.  We highly recommend Laurie's home.
Cheers!"
73857	1133329	9.0	9.0	9629689	"The spouse and I needed a last-minute place to stay for a few days in Seattle.  We sent a request to Laurie, and heard back immediately (which was DAYS better than others...).  Every time we needed to contact her, she was friendly and immediately available, which is awesome and takes a lot of stress out.  The apartment we stayed in was on the middle floor, and surprisingly large and nicely done.  Two comfy full-size beds and a futon.  One room is private, the others are separated by a thick curtain.  Bath is small but nicely outfitted.  The kitchen is cafe-cute and stocked with the usual dishes/pans and sink, and also a washer/dryer, dishwasher, coffeemaker.  The floors are radiant heated with its own control.  We walked two blocks to the main drag with lots of restaurants and pubs, YUM.  And did I mention Laurie was great?  Recommended!
~Linda  "
73858	1133329	9.0	9.0	9919939	It was a great place to stay! Within walking distance to restaurants,  etc. The heated floors were nice but a bit too warm at times. Other than the beds being quite small (full size) we have no complaints. Laurie was very helpful and responsive. We will definetly stay here again
73859	1133329	9.0	9.0	10254403	The place was nice and it is very convenient. only problem that I had was the host did not answer my cell phone so I did not know where to go what to do etc. but well, I had good stays. 
73860	1133329	9.0	9.0	10495821	Laurie was amazing! The house was lovely, vibrant, and impeccably clean. We had everything we needed and more. I couldn't have asked for a better spot to stay on vacation in Seattle. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!
73861	1133329	9.0	9.0	10857504	Laurie's place was great! I especially liked the well-stocked kitchen area. An easy walk to the shops & restaurants on Phinney Ave.
73862	1133329	9.0	9.0	11826701	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Laurie's place.  It was clean, cute, well-stocked, and in a great neighborhood.  Her street is charming!  We especially appreciated the book of information she has compiled.  It was very comprehensive with her personal recommendations for restaurants, activities, etc. Laurie was very quick to respond to any of our questions (though we did not have many, since her book was so thorough!)  We would stay here again!
73863	1133329	9.0	9.0	14947778	"We stayed for a full month and were overall very satisfied with our stay. The location couldn't have been better for our family as we could walk to many things and easily drive/catch a bus to everything else. The Phinney Ridge neighborhood has many restaurants and shops, some within two blocks of the house. 

We were also training for runs and were able to go right down the hill to Green Lake and utilize the path... very cool!

Laurie always replied very quickly to any requests which were typically just for flaky internet connection :)

The only thing not observable in the photos is that this apartment is open to the main part of the house. When we arrived we noticed that the hallway led to a staircase that opens directly to the other living areas. There were gates and curtains to provide some privacy, but we were expecting a full locking door.

One last note, the third/middle room lacked seating for the four of us. There was one very uncomfortable futon/couch but no other seating options. For a short stay it would have been a very minor issue, but for a full month it became a fairly significant annoyance.

All in all, we would stay here again. The value for the location is unbeatable compared to other options in the area.

Thanks Laurie!"
73864	1133329	9.0	9.0	16538170	"We spent about three weeks in the guest suite in Laurie's home as a family of 5 (with 3 teenage children) on our family summer vacation from Germany. We had a fantastic time! The suite was just as described by Laurie. Our children shared the one queen size bed and used the sofa in the living room as additional bed. We had the separate bedroom for us parents. The kitchen is fully  equipped and functional (including washer and dryer that we used quite frequently), however, too small for sitting together as a group of 5. We had our meals in the living room and positioned ourselves around the smaller living room table and used the sofa as well as the kitchen seats.
We used this suite as our basis for our vacation to the Pacific Northwest. From here we took trips (inculding overnight stays) to the Olympic National Park, the Mt. Rainier National, Park, the San Juan Islands as well as Vancouver, BC. 
Laurie's home is located in the very nice Phinney Ridge neighborhood.  Beautiful Greenlake is just a few blocks away and helped me during very early morning walks to get over my jet lag within the first days. This is one of the neighborhoods that you can only really appreciate when living in one of the residential homes (as there are simply no hotels in this neighborhood).
Laurie provides and shares all the relevant local information (next grocery stores, local neighborhood restaurants).  Our favorite restaurants were the Phinney Market Pub (ask for the mixed garlic french and sweet potato fries) and Bongo's Cuban restaurant both within easy walking distance.
We have experienced Laurie as a very warm and caring host. Our children loved the dogs and even ""invited"" Darwin once to spent an hour in our appartment. On the other hand if you do not want to have any contact with the dogs you will hardly realize that there are dogs living in this house. During this very warm summer period Laurie provided us with two extra aircondition fans. A late check-out was no problem and helped us a lot to get even more relaxed to our evening flight."
73865	1133329	9.0	9.0	17437338	"We had a very good experience with Laurie's place. It's on a quiet street with easy parking, the separate entrance is very convenient and the whole setup is very well put together. The house is right by Green Lake and the zoo, within a 5-10 minute drive to a lot of nice north Seattle neighborhoods and maybe a 20 minute drive to downtown.

The 2 beds and the futon are comfortable, there is a fully functional kitchen, a washer and dryer (very handy if you're going to explore the gorgeous nature in the area), and all the rooms were stocked with everything we needed. The stand-up shower could be a little bigger, but that's a very minor complaint.

Laurie was very responsive and pleasant the two times I called, but if you want complete privacy, everything is set up for you to arrive and check out quickly and easily without having to arrange anything or wait for anyone.

Overall, this was a great experience."
73866	1133329	9.0	9.0	17925648	"Laurie was a great host and the neighborhood was perfect for exploring, yet close enough do get downtown in a matter of 10 minutes.

The unit we stayed in was cozy and had access to the backyard as well, which was a nice little escape.

Great size for a couple and maybe a little one as well.

"
73867	1133329	9.0	9.0	18402661	Laurie's place near Green Lake was excellent! It would be hard to find a better location to see the Seattle area. The living space is a short walk to Green Lake, the zoo, and good restaurants. It is a short drive/ride to Fremont and Ballard (our favorites) and only a slightly longer drive/ride to the Pike Place Public Market. The three rooms and small kitchen provided everything our family of four needed for a wonderful stay. Thanks Laurie!
73868	1133329	9.0	9.0	18980783	Accommodation was PERFECT for two friends travelling together.  We stayed for 7 days on first leg of trip to USA & Canada.   Clean, spacious and had everything we required.  Just like staying in a self contained unit.  Quality bathroom with walk-in shower.  Washing machine and dryer most welcome. Access to full cooking facilities allowed us to stroll to the nearby organic supermarkets and cook our own meals when we wished.  Loved nearby Ken's Market and your recommended dining opportunities in Phinney's Ridge.  Peaceful walks through leafy neighbourhood and Green Lake allowed us to get a feel for the vibe of this beautiful city suburb.  Weekly Farmers Market was a great experience. Close to the city too.  Heaps of useful local information and tourist info provided by owner.  Extremely pleased with first airbnb experience.   All our planning was easy with very prompt replies from Laurie to any queries and requests we had while planning the accommodation.  Thank you, thank you.  Highly recommend this accommodation.   
73869	1133329	9.0	9.0	19138983	Nice stay in a scenic neighborhood! Host was very helpful, responsive and accommodating.
73870	1133329	9.0	9.0	19314088	The accommodation was as listed. Ver clear instructions were given on how to access and when we arrived it was very clean and tidy. I thought the facilities were good and certainly as described. It was quiet and cosy and we felt very safe within the neighbourhood and were close to local restuarants and town etc. 
73871	1133329	9.0	9.0	20747824	The listing description is accurate. We were very impressed with this rental because it was clean, and very well equipped. It is a good place to stay for a while (e.g. 5-7 days or longer) because she has thought of a lot of important details. W/D, fullly equipped kitchen, bathroom with amenities, many towels. It is very comfortable and also quiet. The neighborhood is probably one of the most desireable in Seattle, and the rental is within walking distance of the Seattle Zoo, several bars and restaurants and on a bus line. There is very little to complain about (really, nothing). Street parking was always available, no matter what time we arrived. 
73872	1133329	9.0	9.0	21055130	"The neighborhood was great, and the kitchen was functional for basic cooking. 

The host made us feel welcome by providing a small child bath and a high chair – both of which were awesome. Other than that, we didn't interact with them except through email. 

The apartment itself had some quirks that weren't super. Entry was through the garage, which was fine, but it was, well, through a garage. There was no door closing off the ""Entire home/apt"" from the main living area, though there were curtains and a dog gate. The big downside of this was that when there was noise in the main house, it sounded like it was directly in the apartment. So, we frequently heard dogs, kids crying, and some late-night socializing. 

The layout was good for us (there was a separate room for our son to sleep in), but the furniture definitely felt a little worn and ""left over.""

None of it really disturbed us, but it was not exactly what we expected from the space. "
73873	1133329	9.0	9.0	21279488	We had a great stay and the neighborhood was so well-located for us! This was our first time traveling with our baby and it was so easy to use the Pack & Play, infant tub, and changing pad. It made everything very easy for us. We visit family in Seattle often so would certainly consider returning! Thanks for everything.
73874	1133329	9.0	9.0	21804265	Laurie was a great host. She was very helpful. The flat is very well decorated. We enjoyed very much our stay there. I highly recommend this place. 
73875	1133329	9.0	9.0	22500066	"This was a great experience! The residence was better than described! The accommodations were well appointed, very comfortable, cozy - felt more like being welcomed to a friend's home than staying in a ""strange"" place. Lots of little touches - coffee was great, available laundry detergent & reusable grocery bag, umbrella, comfy beds, sheets & towels. All in a great neighborhood! Plus easy to follow & use codes to enter & lock up."
73876	1133329	9.0	9.0	22664133	We didn't get a chance to meet Laurie nevertheless, we had a great time in this lovely home right outside central Seattle.  Since the house was so close to downtown Seattle, we got most of our touristy Seattle to-dos crossed off right away. Our favorite part was actually walking around Lake Green in the morning.  The lake is only a few blocks from the house and it was a great way to start the day!
73877	1133329	9.0	9.0	23289078	Great place... just as advertised.  Clean and nicely equipped and a super location.   Since we were flying with little kids and arrived in Seattle around noon, Laurie was kind enough to let us in early.   Phinney Ridge is my favorite neighborhood in Seattle... restaurants, shops, bars, coffee houses.  It's all charming.
73878	1133329	9.0	9.0	23467844	Laurie responded very quickly to my enquiry about renting her place. The place was as described in the listing.  It is in a very nice neighbourhood, close to downtown Seattle, so worked very well for us. It is well appointed, with lots of amenities included, such as coffee, laundry detergent, etc., making it very convenient.  The keypad/code locking system is great, nice to not need keys.
73879	1133329	9.0	9.0	23728394	"It would be hard to think of a better place to experience Seattle than Laurie's apartment.  A stone's throw from the beautiful Green Lake loop, the space is located very close to two major through roads, making it easy to buzz in to city center while staying out in a quiet neighborhood.

We came to Seattle for a theatre weekend, and it was so easy to get from city center back to Green Lake that we came home for dinner in between shows at Seattle Center.  Meanwhile you are also close to Ballard and Fremont.

My friend and I both commented on how comfortable and welcoming the apartment is.  It made our weekend experience there.  I will definitely be back.

It's an authentic Seattle neighborhood experience and infinitely superior to any we could have had at even the nicest hotel in town."
73880	1133329	9.0	9.0	24824117	"Laurie made us feel very welcome by providing an excellent booklet on the apartment and the neighborhood, including many details on shops and restaurants. We followed her advice -- even ordering her favorite at the Chinese restaurant -- and weren't disappointed!

Phinney Ridge is a quiet, charming, older neighborhood with lots of character. We enjoyed checking out the restaurants and walking around the local lake.

The listing was more or less accurate except some of the furniture shown in the photos was not there when we stayed. Instead of the big chest in front of the futon, there was a very rickety coffee table that we were scared to move when we unfolded the futon because we thought it might break. Also, the futon looked different from the photo -- perhaps just the cushions were different.

The apartment appears a lot more bright in the photos than it really is -- especially in January. We found all the rooms to be too dark, even with the overhead lighting turned on. It made reading in bed difficult. On our last day we had to leave at 4 am and could barely see in the TV Room to pack up our things. I finally moved in a lamp from the back bedroom so we could pack!

Finally, there is only one large mirror for three bedrooms -- inadequate under any conditions but really inconvenient for three women trying to get dressed up to go out on New Year's Eve. Between the bad lighting and lack of mirrors, we struggled!

But the apartment was clean, well-heated, had a good bathroom with plenty of towels and a nice little kitchen. There was a strange smell (cat litter? mold?) when you first walked in but after you were inside a few minutes you didn't notice it anymore."
73881	1133329	9.0	9.0	25476120	This is my first time using airbnb. I was excited but also worried about the recidency. Fortunately, it was a wonderful experience and Laurie's house is awesome! It is just 5 minutes walking to bus station and all the restaurants and convenient stores. I love the location that we can see the view of the green lake and snow mountains. The rooms are cozy and comfortable and the bathroom is really neat and clean and I love the smell of the shampoo 
73882	1133329	9.0	9.0	25682569	It was a great place to stay in Seattle. The host is very nice. Location perfect. Everything feels like a home! Recommended!
73883	1133329	9.0	9.0	26620502	Cozy place that is convenient to the bus line and Green Lake. Place accommodated our three teenage girls and ourselves. Laurie was responsive and easy to work with over our stay. 
73884	1133329	9.0	9.0	27326296	"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful.  My friends and I felt very cozy and comfortable in this guest suite.  It truly felt like a home away from home.  The apartment was clean and quiet and the kitchen had all that we needed to make our own food.  

The location was great as well.  We were able to walk to nearby restaurants and grocery stores easily.  Plus, it was very easy to walk to the nearby scenic Green Lake.

Laurie was a friendly host and I would definitely recommend this place for people who are staying in this area of Seattle."
73885	1133329	9.0	9.0	28090061	"Great neighborhood, convenient location, and quiet accommodations. Note that this is a lower level apartment in a large home. Access is from the side of the house through the garage with its own secure entry. However the only thing separating you from the owners house is a french door with opaque acrylic insert with clear glass transom over it. This is the last photo in the gallery. The door is not lockable from the rental/apartment side, so it is basically open to the owner's side. We presume this is for fire code to provide a secondary egress from the lower level. Not as ""private"" as we had expected but know that for the price you are getting a great deal! Note there is also a garden apartment below this apartment (the house is on a slope, so there are two levels of rentals). Very comfortable otherwise and really nice household supplies for the eat-in kitchen. The only real issue we encountered was a the IKEA futon/couch that does not appear to be assembled correctly in the living room but since it was only used for watching TV no big deal. Easy in, easy out, really great! Happy to have had the chance to stay. "
73886	1133329	9.0	9.0	28423555	Laurie's place was on the first floor of her lovely home.  Everything was clean, new, and in excellent condition.  Lovely apartment located in a great neighborhood.  We traveled by public transportation and everything we needed was easy to reach.  Laurie was very helpful and easy to reach.  Will return.
73887	1133329	9.0	9.0	28567388	Loved this place, cozy and close to downtown. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Laurie 
73888	1133329	9.0	9.0	28784632	I rented this suite for my friends from out of state. They loved this suite. This place was well stocked with everything we needed. The location was perfect. It was very close to everything we needed including a coffee shop and a local organic market. It is in walking distance of Green Lake as well. In addition, Parking was never an issue. I definitely recommend this place and this neighborhood for a great Seattle experience. 
73889	1133329	9.0	9.0	29664491	"Laurie's place was in a wonderful neighborhood, quiet, with some interesting eating places, and close to the bus stop with easy connections to downtown, Puget Sound and other places. 
We value privacy, so we liked the fact that Laurie left detailed instructions for everything, but did  not impose herself. We did get the sense though that if we needed her she would be right there.
The place was exactly as described. 
We had a great experience.
"
73890	1133329	9.0	9.0	31698749	We stayed here for three weeks in between moves and it was fantastic. The apartment had everything we needed and Laurie was very helpful. Great location! 
73891	1133329	9.0	9.0	32037561	"Excellent,  clean, bright, comfortable with lots of charm and privacy. Everything worked just as described. Lots of little additions that made it even more welcoming, from coffee to dryer sheets, everything had been thought of. My stay couldn't have been easier. 
"
73892	1133329	9.0	9.0	36547316	There were so many thoughtful touches in this home. I loved all the extras in case you forgot things (in the closet) as well as the toys for children, kids cups/plates/utensils, and the baby crib/blankets. The neighborhood was great and we loved walking to shops and the lovely park a few blocks away. Perfect place to stay for a family (we have a 1 yr old and a 4 yr old).
73893	1133329	9.0	9.0	55180056	Laurie was a great host! She was able to provide and pac n play and high chair for our visit which was very helpful. The apartment was perfect for us and our 1yo daughter and in a great location. We would recommend staying here and plan to again. 
75627	6888107	10.0	9.0	36727603	"In short, an A++++ listing, would stay here again in a heartbeat. 

If you're considering staying here, reserve it now before it's too late!  You won't find a cuter, more clean place in West Seattle, or nicer more considerate hosts.

My wife and I arrived in Seattle late, and Hamlin and his wife Amy were gracious enough to stay up and welcome us when we arrived at midnight.  There is plenty of street parting, and their condo is nestled between other condos across a grassy well groomed walkway.   

The house itself is so charming and immaculately decorated and clean.  We were there for our 1 year wedding anniversary, and they had even gotten us a bottle of wine!  So thoughtful! 

The room is downstairs, and again is very clean and welcoming.  We had access to a washroom on the main floor, and a full bathroom upstairs which has to be the absolutely cleanest bathroom I have ever seen in a house ever.  

Depending on the day, you may be woken up by the padding feet of their two adorable kids, who were so cute and well-behaved, (at least when we were around =).  

Hamlin and his wife Amy were so considerate, and we had no trouble at all coming in and our of the house at different times of the day, and they respected our privacy to the utmost. 

All in all, an great experience.

75628	6888107	10.0	9.0	39225364	The place was nice and clean. Hamlin and his wife were very helpful and they would text back right away.
75629	6888107	10.0	9.0	39967788	"Hamlin and his wife Amy offer a very comfortable home with clean accommodations and a welcoming environment. Although we were on the go 90% of our trip, they were eager and willing to provide us with amazing suggestions, travel tips and even took time out to research bus information for us. The little things that can make city traveling a little tricky, were a breeze thanks to their assistance and advice.  Their home is conveniently located near a bus stop that makes it easy to get to and from the city, and neighborhood is close to the beach, and in a quiet safe setting.  We also had the need for street parking and found a close by spot for our van/trailer rig everyday when we returned. 

Their kids made the stay especially enjoyable and fun. They are full of energy and life, but they were also very respectful of our space and we never felt like our privacy was compromised. The bedroom where we stayed was downstairs providing us a quiet nook to rest in after our long city days. Hamlin and Amy even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy while we were there and made us feel like friends, not just passing through! 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay with the Ham Fam again! "
75630	6888107	10.0	9.0	41419145	Great stay!! My family and I stayed with the Ham Family and we had a super experience. It was a clean and welcoming home in a super location. Hamlin and Amy are amiable, terrific hosts and their 2 young children are very well behaved. They were always ready and able to happily assist with anything we needed and had great recommendations. We loved our stay! 
75631	6888107	10.0	9.0	41987934	Amy and Hamlin were extremely gracious hosts. Upon arrival, Amy gave us a tour of their home and made us feel very welcome. The couple provided us with everything we needed, from a shelf of fridge space to two super comfortable beds. The family was respectful of our privacy yet readily available when we had questions. Overall we had a great stay in a great neighborhood.

We were pretty much out and about the bulk of our trip, but Amy and Hamlin were both happy to assist us and respected our privacy—they even lent us an umbrella on the stormiest day of our vacation!

Their home was beautiful, clean, and definitely cozy! The neighborhood was quiet, welcoming, and very cute. The area is nestled right behind a library with the most convenient bus stop that takes you straight downtown.

Our trip in Seattle was extremely enjoyable and we could attribute a good slice of that to having such awesome hosts and a beautiful, convenient place to stay at."

They provide us a place in the refrigerator, towels and you can use the laundry machine.

Thank you Hamlin and Amy for making our stay in Seattle wonderful and memorable :)"

We would definitely come back if we are back in Seattle again!
75635	6888107	10.0	9.0	48105640	My girlfriend and I had a great experience staying with the Ham Fam in Seattle. We came to Seattle seriously considering a move to the city and our stay with Hamlin and his family confirmed it for us. We enjoyed talking and getting to know them. They were very helpful and knowledgeable about Seattle. Their house is beautiful and very well kept with a very comfortable room for guests. Getting around with public transportation, Uber, and water taxi were all easy from their location in West Seattle as well. Definitely recommend this listing!
75636	6888107	10.0	9.0	49706992	Very sweet welcoming family in an interesting part of town. It's the right balance between sharing, nice conversation and living independence as we both went about our daily routine. Cute house with lots of interesting art, color and intellect. Great french pressed coffee.

For most of the time we had the pleasure to deal with Amy. She is wonderful with kids. As we were travelling with our one year old daughter, staying at tha HamFam was perfekt for us. They even could provide us with a ""baby-bed"".
Even before our arrival they've been very helpful giving us some different options of how to get to their place.
The room and the entire house were very clean and located in a good neighborhood. Just a 20 Minute busride to downtown. The bus stop is close by.
Thanks Amy, Hamlin, Annabeth and Hami - you made Seattle worth a trip

75638	6888107	10.0	9.0	52346550	The place was nice and comfortable to stay. Amy and Hamlin are great hosts and my friends and I felt very welcome. Amy helped us a lot when we were staying. I'd to stay again.
75639	6888107	10.0	9.0	53347989	We love Hamlin's family house. The house was very clean and nice, and the family was great. They made us comfortable, and we felt it was our own house. The neighborhood was also very quite and safe. We found it relaxing walking around the neighborhood every morning. I would recommend this house!
76228	7256122	10.0	9.0	40865771	Perfect location, clean house and friendly people, what more can you ask for? Highly recommend staying here when in Seattle. 
76229	7256122	10.0	9.0	41656109	We had a fantastic stay at this great home. The private downstairs area was a nice relaxing space. Johan and Maria were both welcoming and very informative about the Seattle area. Downtown and the airport are easily accessible by bus from the Georgetown area. We definitely recommend this home for anyone staying in the Seattle area.
76230	7256122	10.0	9.0	42204883	"I was greeted immediately upon arriving at the home.  I was welcomed.  Met both Maria & Johannes upon arrival.  The entire basement was my setting.  It was quiet.  It was comfortable.  It was accessible.  Wifi, coffee, music player or television or peace and quiet.      I dined at a nearby gourmet pizzeria.  Nearby = 4 minute walk.
Breakfast the next morning was a nearby sole proprietor as well.  The access of this Georgetown location is tops. The hosts were Engaging, Personable, Patient, and Helpful.     "
76231	7256122	10.0	9.0	42366871	We loved to stay in Johannes and Maria's house. They are a nice couple. The place is very comfy and you can have your own privacy. The location which closes to highway is very convenient for us as car drivers. We would definitely stay there again if we visit Seattle.
76232	7256122	10.0	9.0	42633897	"what should I say? Luxury! Johannes and Maria are realy lovely hosts!
So don't change something :-)"
76233	7256122	10.0	9.0	42928293	We enjoyed our stay at Maria & Johannes's place. The house was very cozy n comfy. However, we couldn't meet our hosts. We were so looking forward to meet them. But we did enjoy our stay at Maria & Johannes's. 
76234	7256122	10.0	9.0	44202114	We loved our stay here! You pretty much have the floor all to yourself, with the exception that the bathroom has the washer and dryer in it. The dryer was just running once when we got back at night, but we actually never met Johannes or Maria in person. The space was very private. The bed was so comfy, we had a hard time getting up each morning. The living room area is great with surround sound, and Netflix and Hulu on the tv. Everything was clean and as expected from pictures and description. Great location to get to downtown in just a short drive. Would stay here again and recommend it!
76235	7256122	10.0	9.0	44959749	Johannes and Maria are wonderful hosts. The room is down stairs, private and nice bed. I have never seen such good dogs! Thank you so much for the stay. I would recommend it to everyone. We had a car but there is a bus very near and so much places to eat around their house. 
76236	7256122	10.0	9.0	45424885	Thank you for everything!
76237	7256122	10.0	9.0	45833313	We had a great experience staying here!  The home is great and we enjoyed having the basement space to ourselves.  Johannes and Maria provide a great binder with suggestions of places to eat around the area and things to do in Seattle.  Johannes helped us out with any questions we had and was very welcoming.  It is very easy to get to downtown by bus from their home and it is only about a 15 minute ride!  We would recommend to anyone staying in the area! 
76238	7256122	10.0	9.0	46543735	Johannes and Maria were very hospitable and kind. We were so impressed with their home and how much they were willing to let us share it with them for a few days. Their location is a great jumping off point to explore Seattle proper and the surrounding area. Would recommend for sure!
76239	7256122	10.0	9.0	46796482	Johannes and Maria's house was so cute and welcoming. Having the entire basement to ourselves was great and we were able to stretch out after a long road trip. The TV, wifi and Keurig were a great plus, and the bed was super comfy. We'd definitely come back!
76240	7256122	10.0	9.0	47320369	Thank you Maria and Johannes for letting me stay in your cozy place.  You guys are great.  You will definitely be first on my list when I return to Seattle.  
76241	7256122	10.0	9.0	47426894	I had to add one day which made a turn around more difficult for the owners but was still made to feel welcome.  The place was perfect. 
76242	7256122	10.0	9.0	47839880	Johannes and Maria communicated well and made it easy to check in.  The space was comfortable and perfect for our needs (a one night stay after a wedding and before an early morning flight out of Seatac).  
76243	7256122	10.0	9.0	48250258	Johannas and Maria have a nicely remodeled bungalow. We had a vey pleasant stay with good food within walking distance.  We highly recommend them!
76244	7256122	10.0	9.0	49016056	"Such a nice home! Super clean and we felt very welcome. 
Maria was so nice-- recommended restaurants, things to see, etc. They also have a binder with a lot of information and pamphlets in it.
It was an awesome experience! Thanks so much!"
76245	7256122	10.0	9.0	49140063	it is the best house i've ever met. the house is colourful both inside and outside. you will understand this when you meet johannes and maria this young modern fashion couple. we stayed in basement floor, but you have totally private modern basement, including audio visual room ,private bath room and cute bed room. jahannes and maria totally leave us enjoying our own space. i definitely will come back if i go to seattle again. otherwise, i really love the locaton that easily spot airplane landing
76246	7256122	10.0	9.0	49500974	Great place to stay!  Convenient location to Elysian brewery where we went to the pumpkin beer festival.  Wish we could have stayed longer! 
76247	7256122	10.0	9.0	50260913	"we stay here one night ,Johannes and Maria is very friendly and helpful to us. we didn't meet them when we arrived here,because they were at a wedding....The house not far from airport ,we will leave very early next morning ,so is easy for us.
They are Outdoor enthusiasts, the downstairs is large space where we stay.
Thank you very much give us such a comfortable room


"
76248	7256122	10.0	9.0	51052121	This beautifully remodeled house was a great location for my boyfriend and I to explore the city and still have some peace and quiet. The bed was very nice and comfortable. Having the  bedroom, bathroom, and small living room made it feel more like a temporary home than just a room. Johanne and Maria were great to chat with and get ideas for food and exploring. My only tip to future travelers who stay here is be sure to bring socks or slippers because it is a finished basement but there is only full carpeting in the bedroom and the floors can get pretty cold at night. 
76249	7256122	10.0	9.0	51853608	Great little room with a comfortable bed. The hosts were quick to respond to any questions and made my stay easy to coordinate.
76250	7256122	10.0	9.0	52254397	Maria and Johannes place in Georgetown was PERFECT for our long weekend.  We were in town for a wedding and the attached apartment was clean, quiet and just as advertised.  We were too busy to see them much, but they were great hosts and left us everything we needed for our stay.  I can't wait to come back in a few months when their new listing is completed!  The ADU looks like a fantastic space!
76251	7256122	10.0	9.0	52811971	Johannes and Maria were fabulous hosts! They welcomed us in after a last minute booking and were very friendly and accommodating. The space was clean and cozy and had everything we needed and more, including Fleetwood Mac records!  
76252	7256122	10.0	9.0	53373561	I was so fortunate to stay at this super quaint cottage nestled in quiet Georgetown. The host were not there when I arrived in the early afternoon but Johannes appeared when I was busy adoring the space and wonderful record collection. I was mostly in and out the few short days I was in town but I'm so glad I was able to meet both hosts before time was up! Super clean, inviting,great ambiance, wonderful host who make sure you're satisfied even on their own time; you have complete private time for yourself. Nothing is better than starting off your day drinking a nice cup of hot coffee and watching Point Break (one of my favorite movies) I am definitely coming to visit again. A million times referring this cute spot! Thank you Joannes and Maria! 
76253	7256122	10.0	9.0	54019325	The space was large and comfortably appointed:  it included a rec room area with a large screened TV and other amenities such as Wi-Fi.  I hate cheap hotels and this was the opposite of the experience I would expect at Motel 6.  It was homey and it met all of our needs for an excellent price.  
76254	7256122	10.0	9.0	55235505	"Johannes and Maria were really awesome hosts! Very friendly and accomodating with any of our needs, although not at all intrusive and we almost felt like we had our own apartment for our stay. We were showed the house and our room as soon as they got home. They were really just the nicest people when welcoming us to their home. They had made it very easy with instructions for the (huge) TV and the fireplace and so on. there was even a handmade guidebook to the neighborhood filled with restaurants and shops and other useful stuff.
   
the living space was as described. You get the downstairs as pretty much for yourself with toilet, livingroom and bedroom. The bed was the most comfortable ever and Franzie was really friendly and cute!

would absolutely recommend Johannes and Maria for your stay in Seattle. 10/10

"
76255	7256122	10.0	9.0	56724456	"Johannes and Maria could not have been more gracious or accommodating.  Their basement bedroom was clean, neat, well appointed and made it as much like ""home"" as they could for our two week stay.  Added to the experience were daily welcomed visits by their very friendly and sweet dog, Franzi, who sat by the fireplace.  "
76256	6765354	9.0	9.0	37500815	"La Dele and her husband Allan were very welcoming and great hosts. Being that this was their first experience hosting with Airbnb, they did a very splendid job. I have lived in the Seattle area my whole life, but was visiting with my boyfriend who never visited Seattle. We really enjoyed the privacy that they offered. 

When we arrived, Allan and La Dele had given us a loaf of fresh bread and blueberries which were delightful. They also provide you with free access to Netflix and YouTube for you to use during your stay. You do however need to ask La Dele and Allan for the password for the internet. They also do not have stoves or a kitchen sink so you may have to order food around the area. Otherwise they are very nice and welcoming. 

"
76257	6765354	9.0	9.0	39647935	"Alan and La Dele were great.
The place was located very close to the center of Georgetown and has lots of places close by to eat and drink. 
The place itself, worked out well. It's a simple set up, but all that we needed. If you are a light sleeper you should know there is a low noise from the store in front. Would be happy to recommend this.     "
76258	6765354	9.0	9.0	41118196	The Host made us feel very welcome and told us a lot about the history of Georgetown and the place where we stayed.  It was lovely, comfortable and totally boho.  Orange juice in the fridge, fresh fruit, popcorn and bottled water was there for us.  She also told us all the new and interesting places locally for food, wine and giant cowboy boots.  We had a wonderful time and would definitely rebook again.  The adjoining store had a wonderful selection of wine, craft beer and cider.  Couldn't ask for nicer hosts.  Thanks for a great time!
76259	6765354	9.0	9.0	41515795	This was such a cute, lovely little home. The hosts were both very welcoming and showed amazing hospitality. They also own the small store in front which was so convenient when we wanted to buy a few things. 
76260	6765354	9.0	9.0	41964289	"La Dele and Allan (and little Ernesto!) were very friendly. Their home was good for a weekend trip; the bus stop on the same block was a definite plus! The bus went right downtown Seattle, and we felt safe on urban transportation. There are restaurants within walking distance, and the weekend nightlife in Georgetown was alive and funky. 

The house has a private entrance in the back, and has a yard with an extra lock on the gate. Street parking was free and plentiful. 

The house is old! Built in 1904! It comes with all of the charm that old houses have: creaks, smells, and classic fixtures. We also have an older house and were expecting its charms. The service area had orange juice, popcorn, and sparkling water. Take advantage of local fare, as the space does not have a sink or stovetop. Though our hosts provided dishes and cutlery- very thoughtful!

We slept well. Other reviewers mentioned the industrial noises. There were planes overhead, cars on the road, and train whistles about a mile away, but we slept like rocks all through the night. "
76261	6765354	9.0	9.0	42447516	We had a great experience staying here. It was convenient to be able to walk into the grocery store in the front to ask questions or get recommendations about where to eat inthe neighborhood. The unit was clean, homey, and comfortable. Our hosts were especially accomodating to our travel schedules, which we greatly appreciated.
76262	6765354	9.0	9.0	43398842	La Dele and Allan were wonderful hosts! We had limited interaction; mostly at check-in & check out, but it was all positive. The apartment was very nice and in a really cool neighborhood.
76263	6765354	9.0	9.0	44124132	Le Dele met us at the grocery store and gave us a tour with Ernesto (the pug)! We appreciate the small touches of coffee, sparkling water, teas, and snacks that they had provided. Alan popped in later and introduced himself. They gave us suggestions and understood we were both a bit tired. We stayed for more than a few days so we accumulated dishes and trash. Alan said he will take care of it. Not only did he take care of it, he also changed our towels! We felt completely floored by their kindness. As for noises, we are from NYC so we were used to it. We recommend their home! It is about 30 mins from downtown Seattle on the bus or 15 minutes if you drive.
76264	6765354	9.0	9.0	44792937	La Dele and Allan were lovely hosts- friendly, helpful, and available when we needed them. The apartment was just as advertised and we enjoyed our time there immensely. 
76265	6765354	9.0	9.0	46210807	"La Dele and Alan are both wonderful people. We were married and wanted a place to get away (since we had guests at our apartment). Apart from being easy to talk to and work with, my bride and I were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and a card. They're kind without expecting anything and we will be letting all our friends coming to Seattle know this is a great place. 
"
76266	6765354	9.0	9.0	54205262	We had a wonderful experience staying at La Dele and Alan's place it was perfect for the two of us. We met with La Dele and she was so friendly & easy to talk to, we chatted about the event we were in town for and she helped us out getting to know the area. Both her and Alan were so accommodating with anything we needed. We couldn't have found a better host or place to stay. We will definately stay with them again!
76267	6765354	9.0	9.0	56501420	La Dele and Allen's cute store was perfect. Fantastic location in hip and historic Georgetown. We walked everywhere. No need to drive once you've made it to their place! The space was clean, comfortable and quiet. We would definitely recommend and/or go back again. 
78716	3773784	8.0	9.0	17192975	Booking with Seth was stress-free and easy. He responded quickly to our rental request and we were able to make arrangements in a timely manner. My husband and I were welcomed by Seth when it was most convenient for us, and he was gracious with his space and time upon our arrival. He gave us pointers to the neighborhood (great walkability for fabulous food and bars in Capitol Hill) and showed us around a bit. His apartment is located within a block from a city bus line to downtown and the navigation is simple (even for those unaccustomed to using public transportation). We were comfortable throughout our stay and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. 
78717	3773784	8.0	9.0	17411580	Cool apartment with lots of interesting art on the walls. We also enjoyed having musical instruments to play. Good location. Enjoyed walks around the neighborhood and there are some excellent cafés within walking distance. 
78718	3773784	8.0	9.0	17594772	It was so easy to communicate with Seth! He responded quickly and efficiently in the booking process, and made sure to check in with me over text. I had no trouble getting into the apartment even though he was on vacation, and everything was laid out and ready for me - he is the sort of host who places chocolates on the fresh towels. The apartment had a wonderful feel about it, and Seth has done a great job decorating the space. Shower was one of the best I've ever had. :) He's also so generous - he encouraged me to use his art supplies, instruments, candles, and anything in the fridge - I didn't take him up on most of that, but I appreciated the sentiment! My only complaints were that the building is a bit old/musty/dorm-like, and further away from the main Capitol Hill drag than I'd realized (over a mile walk) with nothing particularly close by. 
78719	3773784	8.0	9.0	17662356	While Seth was easy to communicate with and friendly, his apartment really did not work for us.  The foldout couch in the living room was badly stained, very old, and had some kind of debris on it, and was unsuitable for sleeping (our stay was prior to his warning about the couch on his listing).  The building that the apartment is in was very musty and in bad repair, and the apartment was two floors down, which is rather inconvenient if you have luggage.  The apartment itself has personality, but could really use modernizing, and the location is not really walking distance to many restaurants, cafes, or shops.  All in all, I felt that the apartment did not live up to the price, which is quite high.
78720	3773784	8.0	9.0	17899102	I enjoyed my stay in Seth's apartment. It's close to restaurants in capitol hill and has a lot of public transportation possibilities nearby. Seth is very easy to contact and is there when you need him.  
78721	3773784	8.0	9.0	18741909	We had a lovely stay at Seth's apartment.  We had a bit of trouble gaining initial entry to the block but once we'd got hold of Seth he was able to sort it quickly.  Seth also gave us a long list of great places to eat in Seattle which was much appreciated and we went to an amazing Vietnamese restaurant called Monsoon which is within walking distance.  The apartment is also well situated for public transport and we used the buses to travel downtown on a few occasions.  Seth was a friendly, helpful host and i would recommend others staying here.
78722	3773784	8.0	9.0	19282722	Great little place with clean towels and amazing water pressure in the shower!  Seth was great at communicating and I would stay again!
78723	3773784	8.0	9.0	22556806	Great little place. Easy to find, easy to access, and Seth was easy to contact.
78724	3773784	8.0	9.0	25534528	Great place! Clean, well laid out and easy to figure out. Good location and simple to uber/lyft back to. Definitely pay attention to all parts of the listing title..
78725	3773784	8.0	9.0	28451726	"Seth's place in a great location, very cute neighborhood and walkable.  The bed was very comfortable and clean.  Seth was easy to reach and very helpful.

From the outside the apartment building is really cute, however, when we walked inside we were a little disappointed.  The building does not seem like it's well taken care of and it smells pretty musty.  We were only in the apartment late at night and early morning, so it worked for us, but I don't know that I'd suggest booking it if you plan on spending a lot of time in it."
78726	3773784	8.0	9.0	28750486	Seth was easy to work with, apartment was nice and clean and in a great location. 
78727	3773784	8.0	9.0	32603180	Seth's place was quiet and comfortable. Easy check in and out. Great location!
78728	3773784	8.0	9.0	32995612	Seth's place is a cozy apartment conveniently located in Capitol Hill. There is a bus just across the street that takes you all the way down town. Very close to bars and good restaurants. 
78729	3773784	8.0	9.0	34495346	We had a wonderful experience at Seth's fabulous place. The apartment looked just like the pictures. Comfortable bed and furniture, lovely little touches everywhere - even fresh flowers! The location was perfect - easy to find, lots of great coffee places, restaurants, etc. Seth was so helpful with restaurant and entertainment recommendations, too. Checking in and out went completely smoothly. Would highly recommend Seth and his place to anyone looking for a delightful Seattle getaway!
78730	3773784	8.0	9.0	34713435	"Getting into the building initially was difficult, but once we got a hold of Seth, things were fine!  He is extremely nice- I felt like I had to ""ask"" to use parts of his apartment, but he was welcoming!
His place is indeed cozy and the apartment is well kept.  
It is very obvious he is an artist!  He also has a stack of board games for guests.  If I didn't have family in Seattle, I definitely would opt to stay here again!"
78731	3773784	8.0	9.0	34949392	We had a wonderful experience in all respects with the Cozy Getaway. Seth was prompt and courteous in all correspondence leading to our arrival. He was flexible on arrival day. He provided info about the area--what to see, where to eat, public transportation, parking, etc. The Getaway itself is a charming apartment with big windows, lots of light, hardwood floors, and great art on the walls. It is clean and airy. We were within minutes of everything we wanted to do. 
78732	3773784	8.0	9.0	35689781	A warm, comfortable apt.  Quiet, great art, Seth left some beautiful bouquets of flowers.  Getting in and out was very easy.
78733	3773784	8.0	9.0	36061364	"Seth was on top of staying in contact and left clear instructions on how to get into the apartment which happened easily. Listing was as described and the neighborhood is an ideal place to explore all Seattle has to offer. It is in a residential neighborhood for the most part with a supermarket within close walking distance. It is on several very convenient bus lines that can take you anywhere you need to go. Walking around the Capitol district and to great restaurants is hilly like the rest of Seattle, but safe and interesting and accessible if you are a good walker. Apartment is quiet, light, and restful.

78734	3773784	8.0	9.0	37182488	Great place and location..! Seth was very easy to work with.. 
78735	3773784	8.0	9.0	39633505	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Seth's apartment! It was clean, comfortable and cozy, just as advertised!
78736	3773784	8.0	9.0	39767646	The apartment is exactly how Seth described it. A Charming artist's apartment on a quiet hilltop. Also, pretty clean. Even though we arrived later than expected, Seth was very easy to work with. 
78737	3773784	8.0	9.0	40372666	"The apartment is cosy and surprisingly quiet. We were really glad of how cool it stayed despite the heat outside. 

There are plenty of grocery stores nearby and good bus connections into downtown. Walking in takes a while but is really nice. Parking is on the street but we had no trouble finding a spot."
78738	3773784	8.0	9.0	40540535	"Had a great stay at Seth's place. I was in town on business for one night. 

Seth was immediately available when I needed anything and very hospitable and friendly. 

Neighborhood is quiet but great. Easy walking distance to food / coffee / etc. 

The apartment was not immaculate, but generally clean. My only feedback would be to make sure it's cleaned between guests. 

Overall great though, thank you Seth! "
78739	3773784	8.0	9.0	41185373	The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
78740	3773784	8.0	9.0	41633750	we were informed that Seth was on vacation a few days prior to our arrival, but he got someone else to communicate with us as to entry procedures, which went exceedingly smoothly.  we also got our question about how to log onto the internet answered very quickly.  we did not spend much time in the immediate neighborhood, but went to a few places a short drive from Seth's.   The place was as described, cozy, neat, clean, comfortable bed and couch.  we would stay there again.
78741	3773784	8.0	9.0	42857057	Communication was easy and quick, apartment very comfortable and livable. If you like to walk, good stores/snacks/coffee/bakeries within walking distance.
78742	3773784	8.0	9.0	43723167	Although I didn't have the opportunity to meet Seth in person, he seemed like a friendly guy that really cares that you enjoy your stay—I appreciated this. The apartment is situated a bit off the main drag, but still walkable to many shops and restaurants. The interior was artsy and quirky, a real creative type's kind of place. I can be a bit allergic to dust and did have some sneezes here. The one recommendation I'd make is that the unit be deep cleaned as there's hair, dust and debris in some of the nooks and crannies of the place. That said, overall still had a nice and quiet stay at Seth's. 
78743	3773784	8.0	9.0	44643709	This was a really cozy apartment which has some really interesting art and quite a unique place. It is in a really great area and the more we explored Seattle, the more we realised this was a good spot! Seth was really easy to deal with and very friendly and welcoming!
78744	3773784	8.0	9.0	44746019	The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
78745	3773784	8.0	9.0	51774581	A terrific corner apartment! Spacious and well-decorated. Not only that, but close to major bus lines and a Zipcar spot, and walkable to downtown, the international district, Queen Anne, and the U-District. Cafes, bars, and coffee shops are short walk up the hill, with a Trader Joe's a few short blocks away. Seth's a fantastic host who went out of his way to make me feel welcome. 
79507	1594313	9.0	9.0	7085612	Trish was very kind to take us in last minute after an extremely bad experience with our original Air BnB host left our family in a tough situation.  She went out of her way to accommodate our needs and her place is very comfortable and well appointed (extremely clean, nice furnishings, comfy beds and linens).  We had a wonderful stay and recommend these accommodations without any hesitation.  
79508	1594313	9.0	9.0	12210672	Really enjoyed our stay here. Bedroom and en suite were great and Trish was the perfect host. We had complete privacy on the top floor but there was no problem at all using her kitchen downstairs for breakfast and she was always on hand for advice and couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. Recommended.
79509	1594313	9.0	9.0	18785305	We lived one of the best summers in Seattle, living in the Trishann's house for 3 months. The town-house has all the services and the location is great, with a bus stop right in the front of the place. Trishann help us and was pretty kind, specially with our baby. 
79510	1594313	9.0	9.0	18908162	"Trishann was very accommodating on our late evening arrival. She took the time to coordinate with us on our arrival and to provide us with arrival information for access and property location.  When we arrived to our destination we had questions about parking. We messaged Trishann and she responded immediately. Trishann provided us with fresh towels and linens.  We were able to utilize the washer machine the day before we left which was nice because we had a lot of smelly clothes from our workouts at the gym. Trishann provided us with lots of good food options and input on downtown Seattle. We felt like we had the perfect amount of personal space during our stay. The property worked perfect for us as we were out and about most of the time. 
 "
79511	1594313	9.0	9.0	20195691	NIce explaining messages everywhere, although we met her only at the last day, she was always accessible over email. Room is a little smaller than it apears at the picture but very comfortable
79512	1594313	9.0	9.0	23431334	"Trishann is an amazing host and her home was extremely lovely! This was my first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been any better. I was new to Seattle and in transition to getting settled in the city and stayed here for two months. Trishann was nothing but accommodating, super helpful, and always offering so much valuable Seattle advice. 

The room was very comfortable, the bathroom was huge, and everything was always kept very clean! The kitchen was always available for cooking, and something I appreciated very much was the access to the amazing laundry machines upstairs, Trishann even supplied the detergent which was wonderful! I never took the bus which had a stop literally feet from her front door, but parking was never an issue and always easy to find a spot nearby.

Trishann is very warm, welcoming, and easy to talk to. We watched a couple of Seahawks games and she even showed me the Ballard market one Sunday afternoon! She's a super host for a reason and I couldn't have asked for a better airbnb experience!!"
79513	1594313	9.0	9.0	24593291	My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent one week stay at Trishann's townhouse while visiting our son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren during the Christmas holidays. Her townhouse was exactly as shown, immaculately clean, and she was a wonderful host. We will definitely try to stay at her place on future trips to Seattle and I would recommend her to anybody that wants a quiet enjoyable experience. Harry
79514	1594313	9.0	9.0	26416686	Trishann was a phenomenal host. My experience in her home was better than anything I could have hoped for. I am a new, young professional to Seattle and she helped me make myself at home here during the transition of finding my own place. She recommended places to live, contacts to help with my search, good restaurants, best ways to avoid traffic. She loves Seattle and it has made her an amazing resource for visitors and new residents. Her rooms are very comfortable and clean. She is welcome to you making her place home during your stay. If you're looking for an in depth introduction to Seattle, you cannot go wrong staying with Trishann. Happy travels!
79515	1594313	9.0	9.0	30730236	Quite, private comfort. A very nice place to stay.
79516	1594313	9.0	9.0	40567254	I like Trishann's home so much:) she was very nice and kind, also very helpful. We were enjoy staying her place for 3 months. If I ever be back to Seattle, I would prefer to stay at her place again!
79517	1594313	9.0	9.0	41948382	The experience in total was good. The house is nice and the location is great and it was very convenient stay in total.
79518	1594313	9.0	9.0	44178507	We loved our stay with Trish in Seattle. Her house is lovely, spacious and welcoming. She didn't hesitate to give us tips for our stay and made us feel at home within minutes of arising. Her house has a great location, close to downtown and on the bus route. The room was large and comfortable with an amazing Bathroom next door. There is no better place you could stay in Seattle!! 
79519	1594313	9.0	9.0	45435783	"My wife and I spent 6 days with Trish and those turned out to be better than any of our original plans in Seattle. She was thoughtful and kind and unbelievably helpful! There isn't much more we could have hoped from a host. 
Thanks for helping us salvage our trip and making it an amazing experience."
79520	1594313	9.0	9.0	46311215	Trishann was very welcoming. I booked a late flight and she left very clear instructions on how to find her place and get in. She was very responsive to all my questions before my arrival and during my stay. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. The room/house was as advertised. Very clean house and a lot of light enters the bedroom but the black out shade helped for the mornings we slept in. If I'm ever in Seattle again I would love to stay here.
79521	1594313	9.0	9.0	47220839	Trishann was very accommodating with our late evening arrival and early morning departure. The master bed was very comfortable and the fan helped keep the temperature down when it got warm (uncommon for Seattle)! Towels were laid out nicely and parking was easy to find. We liked the Greenwood Ave location and found it convenient to Seattle.
79522	1594313	9.0	9.0	47570896	Trish was great with the three of us, she's such a nice person, and very helpful! The place is very clean and a very relax area! I will definitely choose this place on my next trip to Seattle! 
81516	219532	9.0	9.0	1303186	A fantastic little home in a fantastic location!  The Fun Home turned out to be ideal for 3 of us travelling on business. With it's fantastic outdoor spaces - deck, grill, sink, fridge, and HOT TUB - it was a marvelous place to unwind after a day of business meetings. Very convenient, the home is easy walking distance to Hales Ales, Brouwers, and all of the great little spots Fremont has to offer. Right on bus lines, very easy to get to Seattle Center, Lake Union, and even downtown, while still offering a cozy haven at the end of the day. Can't wait to go back!
81517	219532	9.0	9.0	1615709	Beautiful home and wonderful hosts. :D a pleasure to have stayed in Seattle.
81518	219532	9.0	9.0	1678292	"Dear Rose and Glen,
we really enjoyed staying in your nice house in Fremont/Seattle. After two and a half weeks ""roadshow"" from California to Seatte, we loved to relax the last six days of our trip in your ""fun home"". On 4th of July we just walked to the beautiful firework around the corner from your home. We loved to sit in the the hot tub watching the stars. And we enjoyed using your barbecue equipment.
We will come back...
Philine and family (Germany)"
81519	219532	9.0	9.0	1910476	We had a greattime. house is located in a great area, and was clean. The only complaint is that the bath tub up stairs is hard to get in and out of, and hard to bath kids in. Over all the house is great. The outside area is wonderful. thanks for a great trip.
81520	219532	9.0	9.0	1970067	This house was delightful with tasteful decor inside and lush gardens outside.  The location was great, especially accessing restaurants and shopping in both Freemont and Ballard.  We really enjoyed dinners on the back deck.  We would gladly stay here again.
81521	219532	9.0	9.0	5292834	Rose & Glen's home was clean, well-equipped and served as a home away from home for us. The outdoor BBQ was great for dinner cooking and the kitchen had everything we needed. Rose and Glen were speedy in their responses and very helpful - they got us a cot for our baby, and also accommodated our earlier check-in time. Great hosts and home! 
81522	219532	9.0	9.0	5523819	"This home is indeed a fun home in the outskirts of Funky Fremont.  It's actually centrally located between Fremont and Ballard.  Easy walking to both through the neighborhoods. The walks provide great  exercise and spectacular views.  The house provides a relaxing atmosphere with multiple sitting spots (i.e. front porch glider, back deck, and two hidden adirondack chairs drenched in morning's light).  Basically two bedrooms and full bath upstairs and bedroom and 1/2 bath downstairs.  Plenty of storage and two shelves by front door to stow shoes.  If there had to be a complaint, the only one would be the traffic noise since the house is right off of Leary Way.  But you don't really notice too much unless you are sleeping on the back deck - which I did and loved and did not mind the early morning wake-up call since on vacation and plenty to do.  The house is ""hidden"" so lots of privacy and no noise from two neighbors in close proximity.  I would definitely recommend this house and hope to visit again.  It is a casual and comfortable accommodation.  Walkable location to restaurants and stores and bus line 40 on Leary Way will get you to/from Link for airport travel.  A bike would be a plus for getting around but there are a couple of Zip Car pick-up spots within walking distance if you want to venture to Rainier or take other excursions.  Enjoy!"
81523	219532	9.0	9.0	5570030	"We had a lovely stay in this property. We were five adults and one toddler and there was plenty of space for all of us. The deck was excellent for us to gather on in the evening and wind down from our day of sightseeing. I stayed on the fold-out futon which was quite comfortable. 

Rose and Glen also gave us lots of local knowledge including how to get in & out of the city and where to go. Highly recommended! "
81524	219532	9.0	9.0	6177092	Excellent accommodation. We were totally comfortable and Glen and Rose were great hosts. The neighborhood has plenty to do, see, and eat. Easy bus service to downtown, Seatle center etc kept the car in the driveway all week. Will stay here next time.  
81525	219532	9.0	9.0	6344278	"Although we never actually met Rose and Glen, our late night arrival and five day stay went very smoothly. They were always available by phone, but the place was set up some well that their assistance was not needed in anyway. They did leave a message the first morning of our stay recommending that we visit the Fremont Market which we did.

Along with being a cozy house in funky Fremont, it is quite private. You enter up a long driveway and the back deck is surrounded by bamboo and a side garden. 

The house is nicely decorated and has all that you need. My wife and I and our ten-month old stayed upstairs and my dad stayed in the basement bedroom. We all had plenty of space.

Oh, and the water pressure in the shower easily worked out all the travel kinks. And any lingering tension he jacuzzi on the deck pretty much melted.

The house is walking distance to many restaurants and the Burke Gilman Trail along the canal.

Good place. Good hosts. We'd stay there again. Recommended.
"
81526	219532	9.0	9.0	6825505	"Had a great time at Rose and Glen's house in Fremont - it was exactly where we needed to be and had all the comforts of home!  The hot tub was exactly what the doctor ordered after some hiking at Mt. Rainier and the outdoor space couldn't beat!

We never got to meet Rose and Glen in person, but they were excellent hosts - responsive to any questions we had!"
81527	219532	9.0	9.0	7201100	"We loved the place! The home was in spectacular condition and had everything we needed. We found it to be much larger than we thought it would be too!

The hot tub is a fantastic plus and we spend almost all our time on that huge deck. We will try to go again soon. "
81528	219532	9.0	9.0	13329642	A great little home. It worked out perfectly. The house was comfortable, clean, and well equipped. The hosts have clearly taken the time to set the place up for a great airbnb experience. Nothing left to be desired. I just wish I'd had more time to enjoy the deck and grounds.
81529	219532	9.0	9.0	13975551	"This was our first experience with AirBnB, and it was a very positive one. Glenn was very accommodating of us, and was kind enough to come by a couple if hours before the check-in time to meet us.

We travelled with two kids, aged two and six, and the place worked out very well. Enough space to use as a base camp and for everyone to have their own room. We were also an easy walk to a playground and also close to a number of restaurants without being in the thick of the Fremont nightlife.

We travelled without a cat, and this place worked out well for us. It is one block away from two frequent service bus lines and a short walk from a grocery store. There is also a very convenient biking/walking path, for those who bring their bikes.

In summary, great place, great host, highly recommended."
81530	219532	9.0	9.0	14387064	Rose and Glen were excellent hosts and have a wonderful house.  The house is just as described.  We had 6 adults on our trip and fit perfectly.  This Fremont house is in a perfect area for sight-seeing around Seattle.  It was easily within walking distance to many major sights or within a quick cab ride to the downtown/Capitol Hill area.  Fremont itself is a great neighborhood...so much to see and do there!
81531	219532	9.0	9.0	14684528	"Our family quite enjoyed Glen and Rose's Fun Funky Home in Fremont Seattle!  When we arrived the house was in excellent order, the beds made, and the overall home had a welcoming, lived-in-but-well-cared-for feel to it.  I was travelling with my wife, my two daughters, and my wife's mother.  There was plenty of room for all of us, between the two bedrooms and the fold out hide-a-bed in the office area.

The house is a little hard to find, in that its behind another house, which was not evident from the picture.  Trust your map application though, you can find it!  It is on the edge of Fremont, but an easy 5 minuter walk to downtown.  We came for the Fremont Fair, and this house was the perfect launch point to enjoy the festivities.

Overall, I would whole heartedly recommend Glen and Rose's hospitality to anyone without reservation.  Glen personally came and welcomed us to the house, walking through things with us and giving us a little history of the neighborhood and what not.  I found him to be a very engaging, fun host."
81532	219532	9.0	9.0	15047505	We loved the house. Flowers were beautiful. Rose and Glenn were very responsive when there was a problem with dishwasher. The hot tub was super fantastic. Our only concern was not realizing the height for getting into bathtub as one of our group had some disabilities and could not use the tub. Other than that, it was a great home away from home. 
81533	219532	9.0	9.0	15531215	"Our experience with the host was efficient.  The home was just as described, met our needs, and was quite conveniently located.  I'm used to a little more details being provided by the host like how to operate various things around the house, house rules, etc. so as a guest we don't screw anything up unintentionally.
Other than that we had a great time in Fremont and I would request Rose & Glen's home again but probably for a smaller number of people :)
Thanks!!"
81534	219532	9.0	9.0	15686247	We wanted a place that was near Ballard, but easy enough to get downtown without too much hassle... and we found it. Glen and Rose were great. Easy to communicate with, flexible with timing (our arrival time was dependent on rush-hour traffic), and available just in case we needed them. We had a great stay! 
81535	219532	9.0	9.0	15925159	The house was very clean and nicely updated.  It was the perfect size for our family of two adults and two teens.  We enjoyed dining and hanging out on the deck and used the hot tub every day.  The neighborhood has lots of great restaurants (loved Cafe Turko), breweries (Fremont Brewing), and coffeehouses.  The famous Burke-Gilman bike trail is only two blocks away, and downtown Seattle is easily accessible by bus.   The only unhappy surprise was considerable traffic noise from Leary Street.  You can't hear it inside but will definitely notice on the deck and in the backyard. However we would gladly stay here again- the traffic noise was minor compared with all the other aspects of our enjoyable stay.  
81536	219532	9.0	9.0	16771608	"Rose & Glen were great hosts.  Thanks for letting us stay in your home!

Great location, comfortable home.  Altogether a great experience and would stay at their home again next time in Seattle.

"
81537	219532	9.0	9.0	16980366	Rose and Glenn are helpful responsive and terrific hosts. 
81538	219532	9.0	9.0	17259515	We arrived after about sixteen hours in transit and Glen was at the property to greet and show us around which was much appreciated. This old house has a lot of character and has clearly been a labour of love for Glen and Rose. It would rate as  'well loved' in UK parlance.The property is well equipped. There is a large deck at the back and a hot tub, which we made full use of. In terms of location, the Burke-Gilman trail is a few minutes walk and you can use this as an alternative route into Fremont, the main route being Leary Way, a busy four lane road which the deck partly overlooks. Consequently there is road noise during working hours but inside the house you don't hear it at all. Fremont is only ten minutes walk and buses 28 or 40 stop on Leary Way taking you downtown in 20-25 minutes. Probably the only change we would make is a visitor information pack about basic domestic appliances and local travel/restaurants but most people will work things out pretty easily. A tip for UK families with teens, the USA licensing laws prevent sale of alcohol to under 21s and this rules out meals at many establishments. Norm's Diner along Leary is an option. If you visit the Locks we liked Bitteroot a small bar in Ballard where again under 21s can dine with parents enjoying a beer. Overall we enjoyed our four days stay. Thanks again.
81539	219532	9.0	9.0	17707150	We really enjoyed this place.  It was nice, clean, and private.  Rose and Glen were very welcoming and informative.  It is really convenient to have recycling at the house.  The hot tub worked just fine.  We liked the coffee shop across the way that we could walk to.  We would stay here again if we had the chance and would recommend to our friends.  
81540	219532	9.0	9.0	18398150	Rose & Glen's house is wonderful.  It was exactly as advertised - charming and fun.  Our five adults were very comfortable and happy there for 10 days.  The large and secluded deck is the perfect hang-out spot.  The location is prime:  walking distance to all the cool stuff Fremont has to offer and with easy access to downtown, UW, and highways that take you to beautiful hiking and other outdoor activities all around the area.  I'm really glad we chose Rose and Glen's house.
81541	219532	9.0	9.0	20157596	The place was everything we hoped for, great location  near Fremont and Ballard, the hosts were great very helpful came to meet us a little early as we needed to get to an appointment soon after arriving.  
81542	219532	9.0	9.0	20436148	Great house, everything we had hoped for.  Rose and Glen were very helpful and responsive. Neighborhood is excellent and shops and restaurants are walking distance from the house.   I would definitely stay in one of their properties again. 
81543	219532	9.0	9.0	22144248	We rented this house for a month while we were looking for a house to buy.  The hosts are super friendly and met with us on our first day to show us how to use all of the appliances and stuff.  The house itself is cute with a big queen bedroom in the basement, a queen bedroom on the first floor, and an office / full bedroom on the first floor.  The kitchen is super well stocked with equipment.  They even had a cupcake pan so we could make cupcakes for my sons birthday!  The outdoor grill area and deck is awesome when it is not raining.  It is a very close walk to lots of restaurants, bars, and shops.  The only annoying thing is that the house is located off of a steep driveway.  It takes some practice to back down it confidently.  But if you are totally freaked out by that there is a lot of street parking.  And being off of the street makes the house quieter, so we really didn't mind.  One of our favorite things about the house is that they have a great picture of the house from the early 1900s when it was sitting all by itself.  It makes you feel like you are tied into Seattle history.  We would definitely recommend this house to our friends or rent it again ourselves!
81544	219532	9.0	9.0	26636458	"Great location. Walking distance to the heart of Fremont. (Runners/Walkers be sure and check out the Burke Gillman trail.) 

The house is comfy with a nice covered deck and an outdoor kitchen. And we really enjoyed having the hot tub to soak in each day after exploring Seattle. "
81545	219532	9.0	9.0	34552449	It was a great location near downtown Seattle and our family who live in the Fremont district. The host greeted us upon arrival and was very friendly.
81546	219532	9.0	9.0	35066579	The hosts, Rose and Glen were very responsive.  The neighborhood was great.  It was nice to be able to park our car in the driveway.  Loved sitting out on the patio best of all.  Beds were comfortable.  Easy walk to downtown Fremont.  We would stay there again.
81547	219532	9.0	9.0	35990613	wonderful! the house was beautiful and relaxing, and the location was perfect. Glen & Rose was accommodating and friendly. Highly recommended place to stay! We really enjoyed it.
81548	219532	9.0	9.0	37318011	I stayed in Rose and Glen's house for a week with my husband, 2 young children and my parents. The house was plenty big enough for us all and the outside deck was perfect for BBQs and relaxing evenings. Rose and Glen were very welcoming and quick to respond to our questions. They gave us helpful advice on the area and how best to enjoy the 4th July fireworks. It was a short walk to shops and restaurants of Fremont and there was a handy bus stop to take us downtown. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it.
81549	219532	9.0	9.0	38260601	This was my first airbnb experience, and it was wonderful. The house was adorable, and the location was great. Lots of great restaurants in walking distance. I didn't want to leave!
81550	219532	9.0	9.0	38524776	Rose and glen were the perfect hosts. They were easy to reach and very helpful. The neighborhood was great and the listing was described perfectly! 
81551	219532	9.0	9.0	39007424	My family and I stayed at Rose & Glen's Fremont home, and we had a wonderful experience. The home looked exactly as shown online. It was clean, roomy for 5 adults, and well equipped. It's in a great, safe  location with many restaurants nearby. The drive to the city was about 10 min. We would definitely stay in their home again!
81552	219532	9.0	9.0	39925495	We loved our stay in Rose and Glen's beautiful home! The location is perfect and we spent lots of evenings on the patio. Our hosts were very easy to reach whenever we had questions. We hope to be back!
81553	219532	9.0	9.0	42516297	Glen and Rose were awesome! They knew all about the Fremont and Seattle area (and its history) and gave us some good tips on places to visit. The home was nice and clean when we arrived. The back porch was a great place to relax!
81554	219532	9.0	9.0	44916515	rose and glen were incredible hosts. we absolutely loved their charming home in Fremont. the beds were cozy and the neighborhood had a lot of fun spots for coffee, food, etc. 
81555	219532	9.0	9.0	45938155	Rose & Glen's house in Fremont was great! The house was just what me and my five friends needed while travelling. It was centrally located and had plenty of space for our short stay. The patio was also great for relaxing in our down time!
81556	219532	9.0	9.0	48733616	"Great spot in one of the funkiest and fun neighborhoods in Seattle!  Glen and Rose were very easy to deal with and everything was ""as advertised"".  All restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops were a very close walking distance away, and would recommend Roxy's for breakfast.  We'd definitely stay here again, it was much more fun than a boring old hotel!  Thanks again Rose & Glen, hopefully we can make it down to one of your places in Costa Rica sometime...  "
