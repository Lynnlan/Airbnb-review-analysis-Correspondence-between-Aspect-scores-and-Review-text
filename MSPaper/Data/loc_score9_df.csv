Located in the lovely Ballard neighborhood, Lauren's B&B is only a 10 minute drive from popular downtown locations including the Space Needle, is next to a 7-11 convenience store for quick restock, and is within walking distance of awesome Ballard shops. Lauren and Gabriel are also super friendly too! 

Highly recommended especially if you are planning to explore Seattle with a car"

1854	4258515	8.0	9.0	34231248	"Lauren, Gabe, and their children were great hosts during our stay in Seattle. I had previously used an airbnb location in Magnolia which I loved, but it was booked this time around so I hoped Lauren and Gabe's place in Ballard would be as wonderful and it did not disappoint.

Extremely safe neighborhood, extremely close to many big bus lines including 2 direct lines to downtown, and there is even a downtown area a few blocks down from the apartment with major nightlife of its own. 

I didn't spend much time in the apartment during the day but it was a quiet place to sleep which looked exactly like the pictures and I slept more soundly than I ever do at home.

Thank you Lauren and family! :)"
1855	4258515	8.0	9.0	34615698	I appreciate Lauren accommodating us (party of 4) in such short notice. Lauren is pleasant, hospitable, flexible, and unobtrusive. Her home is located in the heart of Ballard near area amenities and attractions. The rooftop deck offers a relaxing oasis above the city streets. Overall, a prime spot with a fantastic host.

1857	4258515	8.0	9.0	36700705	"Lauren and her family were the perfect hosts! Their place in Ballard is comfy, clean and modern and her family were very welcoming and very lovely! 

The location is fantastic, close to so many bars and restaurants, perfectly safe and minutes away from the downtown bus. 

We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle! "
1858	4258515	8.0	9.0	37209196	Good
1859	4258515	8.0	9.0	37707338	Lauren was very kind and accommodating. My friends and I loved the neighbourhood! 
1860	4258515	8.0	9.0	38134616	This is the worst experience with Airbnb, we shared a two bedrooms with Lauren's faimillies with 3 kids and a dog, they go out of their bedroom then we are out of the apartment and go back to the bedroom when we come back, which makes us feel not friendly and uneasy, well we still smell the unpleasant smell of the dog. They didn't wash their dishes and damp the gabage bin  in time as well in the kitchen. The most unfriendly thing is that we can not even leave our heavy bags at her home after 11:00 in the morning of the day we leave back home, which she has mentioned when I check in and let us feel very not friendly, and that is not imaginalble that we hadn't access to the WIFI in such a modern day! I will never come back and live in any Airbnb apartments!
1861	4258515	8.0	9.0	39073563	"La habitaci칩n estaba muy limpia y tranquilo. La ubicaci칩n es perfecta. Algo fuera del centro de  Seattle, pero uno llega muy r치pido y f치cil con el transporte al centro. Y en la tarde se puede disfrutar la tranquilidad de Ballard.  

Muy recomendable."
1862	4258515	8.0	9.0	39660914	Lauren's kids are adorable and the free parking was great and it was also great to be able to walk to old Ballard neighborhood and all the seaside parts on Puget Sound. What a fun city!
1863	4258515	8.0	9.0	39950203	Lauren was very kind during our stay. The room is clean and the location is close to lots of fun restaurants and shops in the Ballard area. 
1864	4258515	8.0	9.0	40460705	Lauren and her husband were very welcoming and helpful! I was admittedly a little wary as this was our first time using Airbnb but everything went smoothly. We had 4 adults packed into the room so it was a little tight but we made due. The 3 kids were all very well behaved and quiet.
1865	4258515	8.0	9.0	40858427	Lauren and Gabe's place was in a great location. It was safe and secure and both of them were very kind and friendly. Having a parking space available was a huge bonus!
1866	4258515	8.0	9.0	40974304	Thank Gabe and Lauren for waiting us until midnight. The apartment is very nice. The room was very clean. It was a nice experience!
1867	4258515	8.0	9.0	41630323	Overall, we had a great experience! We were only looking for a place to sleep for a cheap price in a clean place - this is exactly what we found! The place is right next to a RapidRide bus stop, which was perfect for getting downtown. There were a ton of shops, cafes, and restaurants a walk down the street. Lauren and her family were very sweet and helpful. They pretty much just let us do our own thing and gave us plenty of privacy, which was fine! Our room was clean and quaint. The fans in the room kept it at the perfect temperature. The only thing that was kind of a hassle was when my friend went back to the condo during the day to use the restroom and the dogs were in there. He didn't want to mess with them, so he had to go somewhere else - but obviously this is not a big deal, just something to communicate! Like I said, we had a great experience!
1868	4258515	8.0	9.0	41939678	Lauren and her family went out of their way to make our experience comfortable and convenient. The space was small, but nice. Thank you!
1869	4258515	8.0	9.0	43508721	Lauren's place was perfect for where we wanted to be in Ballard.. Easy walk to stores, restaurants and bars.  Easy access to buses for a quick trip downtown .. Very nice host with all of the accommodations we needed
1870	4258515	8.0	9.0	43734942	Lauren and Gabe are excellent hosts. The whole place was beautiful and very clean, laundry access was a big plus, dinner on the rooftop was fun. The family was real quiet and accommodating. Highly recommend staying here if you're willing to share a space with the hosts. 
1871	4258515	8.0	9.0	48478264	"This place is in a great location in Ballard! The rooftop area with bbq is quite nice and if you have time to use the small gym, it also looked nice! 
The apartment itself was, however, a bit of a disappointment. Just very awkward... Basically this is their 3 small children's bedroom complete  with bunk beds and hard mattresses that becomes your room.  I am not opposed to bunk beds. The hard mattress, however,  was not great nor was I sure the blankets on the shelves were clean. The first one I pulled out did not smell at all good.  There was nothing but a fitted sheet on the bed. No pillow. Nothing. I didn't think there was a door at all when I arrived because it slides along the wall with no way to lock it. 
While Gabe was friendly and took me on a little tour when I got there, I didn't find Lauren particularly nice. 
You have to walk across the kitchen and living area to get to your room. (All five of them and the two dogs retreat to the other bedroom.) 
There is a hamster or gerbil with a squeaky wheel that I listened to for a while that night. At some point he was also brought into their room. I was grateful for that but, again, just awkward... Quite easy to feel like you are inconveniencing them. 
The bathroom is over next to their room. The thought of taking up the bathroom with five other people waiting was a bit off putting. I did not shower. 
In addition, while I think it's a great thing to homeschool, knowing all three kids were home all the time and I was occupying their room did not leave me feeling secure or that my things would be left untouched by little hands, even if the kids were all very sweet. (They're still small curious children.) 
I did not complete my stay. In fact I only stayed one night of the three I'd booked. It was all just too awkward... Thank you, Gabe, for trying. 
I really hesitated in leaving a review but I got numerous reminders to please do so from airbnb and I guess I feel other people should know my experience. I texted Lauren twice upon my departure to talk to her about my experience. She did get back to me. Kind of the attitude I found from her while I was there as well. I'm sorry it couldn't be a more positive review."
1872	4258515	8.0	9.0	49708595	The perfect spot to stay in if you're looking to explore the Ballard area. We really enjoyed our stay here, and would definitely stay here again. Very clean and easy to get to. No Wi-Fi in the house though, but easy to find at local cafes and bars and breweries. And there are a lot of breweries nearby!
1873	4258515	8.0	9.0	50052961	Awful experience! I was looking forward to staying at Lauren's; however, she was unresponsive, and after several hours, I let her know that if I didn't hear from her I'd have to make a reservation with a different host. She did not reply to that message until after I had made another reservation. I requested she cancel the reservation as it was the fair thing to do. Only THEN did I get a reply that basically stated she has a strict cancelation policy, refusing to work with me. Note she has a mere 40% response rate. I feel absolutely cheated by her and airbnb.  Avoid. 
4841	1407502	9.0	9.0	14125924	"My stay at Nicole's surpassed all my expectations. Her home is beautiful, super comfortable, and conveniently located in a very safe, fun neighborhood. The guest space comes with an open outdoor patio with a garden. She provides very nice bedding and a Keurig coffeemaker in the guest room with organic coffee (or alternatives if you prefer tea, decaf or hot chocolate). Nicole herself is great: funny, kind, down to earth, and extremely helpful. Nicole was good at commuting before and during the trip. She made me feel welcome and helped me to find great places to go around Seattle. She's a chef and is well connected to the ""foodie"" scene, so has a lot to say if you're interested in finding great spots to eat -- everything from food trucks to french bakeries. This was the perfect traveling experience for me. I highly recommend Nicole's place to anyone!"
4842	1407502	9.0	9.0	15142567	"My experience with Nicole was excellent because although she is super busy working in her home she displayed a real sense of calm.  I think what makes her unique is that she's worked with many many people in a multitude of situations.
We did get to have a few moments to talk about some shared interests which  given both our schedules was nice. The neighborhood is a quiet residential one so getting a quiet night of sleep is easy.  Nicole does have a small dog, Louis who is an ambassador  par excellence.  He makes anyone feel welcomed and accepted into the household.  "
4843	1407502	9.0	9.0	16259441	My experience with Nicole was excellent.  The room is private with a private bathroom and is on a beautiful patio.  I understand that future guests will have an even nicer arrangement since Nicole is planning to renovate the bathroom.  The property itself is situated on a super pleasant and quiet street within walking distance of shops and restaurants.  Nicole herself is a highly accomplished and experienced person who is very friendly, easy to talk to and extremely forthcoming with advice on where to eat and what to do in Seattle.  She'll even advise you on other stuff like real estate and how the area compares to other places.  I hope to go back soon!
4844	1407502	9.0	9.0	18269122	Nicole was a gracious host. She had put a bottle of sparkling water in the little kitchenette fridge as well as a bar of chocolate and some fruit in the room.  The room and bathroom were private, clean, and comfortable.  The patio was a nice place to relax after a busy day.  Nicole has a very sweet dog who will come and visit you if you let him.  I found the neighborhood to be pleasant and safe.  For those using public transport there is a bus stop about two blocks away where you can catch a bus to downtown.  Overall, I had a very positive experience.
4845	1407502	9.0	9.0	18723906	"I had a GREAT stay. My room was REALLY nice. I enjoyed my visits with Nicole and Louie. Will do it again next year. 
Thank you for helping to make my stay a GREAT ONE. Sharon"
4846	1407502	9.0	9.0	19273700	"This 6 night visit was my first experience with this sort of accommodation - AirBnb or any other - and I learned a few things: photos don't necessarily represent a part of the house that is available to the visitor; prior to booking ask more questions about amenities; book a room that has its own heat controls and thermostat; try to find out the details of the accommodations before booking.  I say this because though I was provided with a ceramic bowl, I was disappointed that the utensils and the 4"" plates were plastic. I had to ask for a mug which was promptly delivered with a glass as well.  I provided my own flatware.  The food area was dusty but the bedroom and bath felt clean.

Nicole was easy to communicate with by email during the online booking and in answering a few questions prior to my arrival.  I was out of the townhouse from about 9-9 every day.  Other than the initial brief introduction our paths did not cross.  I had a problem with the heat coming on too often during the first night.  I texted Nicole about it but she didn't respond for 3 days.  Perhaps I should have telephoned though it wasn't as bad after the first night.  The room is on the bottom of 3 floors of a townhouse and is next to the garage.  The heat all goes up of course.  If I kept the bedroom door (which opens to the hallway) closed the room was comfortable.  The hallway has the microwave and the apartment refrigerator, the front door, the stairs that lead up, and the door to the garage.  It was always very chilly.  The room is small but the twin bed was very comfortable.  The attached private bath was very nice.  I didn't spend time in the patio area.  Street parking after 9 pm almost filled up.  It's a nicely quiet location for sleeping.  "
4847	1407502	9.0	9.0	19698617	This was my first experience with Airbnb so I was a bit apprehensive. But my stay at Nicole's was great. Even though it was late when I arrived Nicole was there to greet me. The space is perfect for one person with a bedroom, bath and a patio out the back. Everything was neat and clean with no surprises!  The neighborhood is safe and  quiet. It was a convenient place for me as my daughter lives in Ballard. Much easier than being downtown.  I will certainly stay at Nicole's during my next visit to Seattle! Thanks, Nicole!
4848	1407502	9.0	9.0	20723549	"I had a great time staying in Nicole's downstairs bedroom. It was very private and a small desk allowed me to work and make phone calls. The house is a quick walk to a couple of neighborhood bars and a brunch place with great crepes. An extended walk would get you to downtown Ballard with a much wider selection of dining and amusement venues. 
Oh, the microwave, fridge and coffeemaker were great to have on hand!"
4849	1407502	9.0	9.0	23490533	My stay was wonderful. My room was nice and warm. Love the visits from Louie every morning and when I got home. Nicki is a wonderful hostess. 
5725	5620928	9.0	9.0	34615704	"Paul and Rachel were extremely friendly and hospitable. Their private apartment is beautiful, clean, and cozy. We enjoyed the comfortable king size bed, their little patio and having a private bathroom. We felt very safe while staying there because the apartment complex is gated and the neighborhood is fairly quiet.
The location is great! We could easily walk to Lake Union and sit by the water and watch all the beautiful sailboats go by. Fremont was also easy to walk to and we had a lot of good food there including chocolate at the Theo factory (heaven). If we wanted to go down town we could easily take a short bus ride to Pikes Place. 
I recommend staying with Paul and Rachel if you're in Seattle! They are extremely helpful with anything you need. The apartment is charming and a great location."
5726	5620928	9.0	9.0	34903632	"Rachel was very welcoming, and gave us great directions, and was there to show us around when we arrived.

The suite was extremely comfortable and clean. Convenient to the Fremont area and the lake with ample free parking on the street.

We would absolutely book here again."
5727	5620928	9.0	9.0	35042295	"Nice location in a safe and quiet neighbourhood (quick drive to Capitol Hill, Downtown, Ballard), with separate access to the apartment block and the suite. The room and attached bath/shower were clean and tidy.

Rachel and Paul were very thoughtful hosts - fridge with two jugs of water, microwave, desk etc. were all provided. We had a very limited amount of time in Seattle so didn't really chat with Paul, but he was very helpful with local advice on traffic and neighbourhoods.

We'd be happy returning to stay with them!"
5728	5620928	9.0	9.0	35591199	"We had a very good stay in Rachel and Paul 's Master Suite for 6 days. Rachel is very nice. Very thoughtful, helpful though we are not native English language. 
We are very comfortable in the king size bed. The room is clean and space is large. Private entrance is awesome, though we back late (there is long day in summer). Private bathroom is very clean almost has everything we need. There are many books in room for your reading.
The location is prefect. Near downtown. Walking to Lake Union is beautiful ! It took us about 40 minutes to walk to downtown, we enjoy walking! We went to Washington Park Arboretum by bicycle!

We are very happy for staying. Will definitely come back next time!


"
5729	5620928	9.0	9.0	37226127	"Rachel made me feel at home. The accommodations were as described and very comfortable. The only minor issue was the parking on the street...it was a holiday weekend so it may have added to the challenge.
But all in all would recommend staying here"
5730	5620928	9.0	9.0	37423029	Nice and very comfortable place. The host was really kind in allowing us the use of their bikes, and providing us ideas for restaurants to try out.
5731	5620928	9.0	9.0	38042264	Clean, comfy, and convenient!  Accommodations were very nice and located close to many places worth visiting like the Space Needle and Pike's Place.  There was also ample free street parking nearby, which was a major plus.  Highly recommended. 
5732	5620928	9.0	9.0	38550331	"Rachel & Paul were very welcoming.  The accomodation was exactly as described and photographed.  It's close ( a short walk) to local shopping and dining.  (Lot's of yummy Thai resturants) and the Queen Anne District.  

I would definitely book again."
5733	5620928	9.0	9.0	39394421	Fantastic, large bedroom/private bath, in a great location. Easy access to downtown as well as interstates and other neighborhoods, on a bus line.
5734	5620928	9.0	9.0	40191472	The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5735	5620928	9.0	9.0	40378407	Had another great stay at Rachel & Paul's.  They are very accomodating and I look forward to staying with them again in the future.
5736	5620928	9.0	9.0	41137677	"Although we didn't meet Paul, Rachel was extremely accommodating. Right from the start, our communication was excellent, with everything from directions to things to do and see in the area. Rachel very kindly offered to pick us up from the train station after our journey from Vancouver to Seattle. She was immediately very friendly and told us so much about the area.
We had a large room in the basement of a block. The bed was huge and wifi reception was not an issue. There was no kettle or plates in the room, but I suspect this was simply an oversight and only mention it as an observation - not a complaint or criticism - as there was a microwave with some cutlery too.
The location is very good also. There is no huge supermarket nearby but there are plenty places to eat and buy food. It is a 15 bus ride to Downtown Seattle and is in Fremont, a small town with some very individual shops. It is also a short bus ride from Ballard , another lovely but more vibrant town. Check both of these places on Google for more information.
The whole area is also extremely bike friendly. Rachel went out her way to ensure we had bikes available to us throughout our stay.
This was one of our best experiences from a very kind and knowledgeable host and I would definitely recommend staying here on your visit to Seattle. 
"
5737	5620928	9.0	9.0	51225854	This is a great downstairs unit with a huge bed, a nice washer and dryer, and a great / clean bathroom. I really enjoyed my stay and Rachel was beyond accommodating. Much more comfortable than a hotel - although I would mention there isn't a TV which didn't bother me, but might be something someone else would want. 
8042	1264287	9.0	9.0	5328811	Spacious, great location, quiet street.
8043	1264287	9.0	9.0	5471473	"Absolutely wonderful--no complaints. Our family of 4 (with two young children under the age of 4) stayed for 4 nights for business and pleasure. Katharine is very responsive--we communicated by airbnb email, phone and text. 

The house is very spacious, clean and comfortable--it surpassed any hotel. It could easily accommodate a bigger group than ours. Our kids shared the main floor bunk room (one in the bottom bed and the other in the provided pack-and-play) while my husband and I slept in the room next to it; we didn't even need the two beds upstairs or the basement bathroom/bedroom. Great little backyard for airing out the kids. The only caveat is for very sound-sensitive people: because it's conveniently close to I-5, there's a muffled thrum of traffic.

Fantastic location. Near I-5 and UW, Wallingford is walkable and family-friendly. Michael had to work downtown, and it was an easy drive and bus ride from the house. The house is a block away from an elementary school playground, 10 blocks away from a city park with lovely play structure and wading pool. Also, an easy walk or very short drive to a grocery store, many restaurants, etc. Close to Gasworks, the Zoo, Green Lake, and so much more. 

We highly recommend this house, and we'll definitely be back!"
8044	1264287	9.0	9.0	5586670	Very nice, clean, comfortable house in a good location.   Having 4 bedrooms was great, but was a bit of a challenge for us with 1 bathroom.   Somewhat limited kitchen cooking pots and pans. 
8045	1264287	9.0	9.0	5735887	Katharine's house was very clean, spacious, and in a great location.  Our family of four (including two small children) enjoyed our stay. 
8046	1264287	9.0	9.0	5867050	"This house is in a great location, in a great walking neighborhood as well as near the Burke Gilman trail. The house is well equipped and comfortable. Our only complaint is the proximity to the freeway and the resulting ""white"" noise. Overall, I think the house is appropriately priced due to the location and lack of usable backyard and is a great value for the price. "
8047	1264287	9.0	9.0	6131311	Nice house with lots of character. We were well looked after whilst there. 
8048	1264287	9.0	9.0	6708777	Katharine's house in Wallingford, Seattle was perfect for us.  Clean and comfortable, convenient and surprisingly quiet, it has easy access to the freeway and is minutes from downtown.  Just a few blocks walk to Lake Union, it held everything we needed for our family gathering from North and South America. Katharine was so easy to communicate with, we would definitely stay here again!   Roy
8049	1264287	9.0	9.0	6868685	My family and I stayed for 6 nights.   We had a wonderful stay.  The house was clean and well kept.  The house is very large and great for large groups (we had 10 stay for 3 of nights because of a wedding).  Katharine was very responsive to anything we needed.  The neighborhood is very nice and close to downtown.  I would definitely recommend this house to anyone staying in Seattle, especially anyone with a large group.  Oh and the fact that there were plenty of baby items, made the stay that much better (we have an 8 month old). 
8050	1264287	9.0	9.0	7035981	I stayed in Katharine's house as part of a group of 6 while exhibiting at the PAX conference.  The house worked out great for us, with a good amount of space and a very convenient location.
8051	1264287	9.0	9.0	7241840	Had a GREAT stay at Katharine's  - The house was clean and very comfortable - we had 8 of us staying there.  It was conveniently located for us - I-5 is nearby which will take you almost anywhere in the city - Wallingford is a cozy little community and there are parks and places to walk all around.  Stores and restaurants are not far either. There is only 1 bathroom, which isn't ideal but it was no problem making it work.  The only thing I would say is there is not much in the way of cooking implements when cooking for a large group.  There are some pots and pans - but a larger skillet and sauce pan would have been helpful to us. Katharine was easy to get in touch with when we needed her and she responded quickly.  I HIGHLY recommend these accommodations.  Mahalo!
8052	1264287	9.0	9.0	9598747	We enjoyed the house during our stay in Seattle. Good location, close to downtown, University District, etc. No negatives to relate.
8053	1264287	9.0	9.0	9818080	Katharine's house was a perfect place for my colleagues and I to stay while collaborating with people at UW. The house was clean and comfortable (especially my bed, which seemed to have some sort of extra pad on top of mattress), minimally decorated, and quite convenient to the university (about a 20-min walk). The highway was a little noisy outside the house and when standing near the leaded windows (which have a single pane), but the neighborhood is otherwise very quiet and pleasant. 
8054	1264287	9.0	9.0	10675919	A group of us were visiting Seattle from Baltimore for a writers' conference, and this Wallingford 4 bedroom provided the perfect home base for us. The house was really nicely located relative to our conference site (the downtown convention center), and it was also near lots of other great stuff we were able to enjoy during our stay (restaurants, coffee shops, parks, etc.). Katharine was very gracious and accommodating in opening her home to us. We had a great visit, and a large part of that was thanks to where we were staying.
8055	1264287	9.0	9.0	17737289	"The neighborhood and house is excellent. It is quiet, and right next to the highway so it is easy to get anywhere in Seattle pretty quickly. There are also plenty city-central bus stops located nearby. There are enough places to eat within walking distance too. The backyard is big and nice for grilling and hanging out, but could use some cleaning up.
Overall, the house is great. I would recommend it."
8056	1264287	9.0	9.0	18563025	Our host was prompt on responding; important to our group.The house had a spacious feel in the main room and huge bedrooms, with good lighting and a well-stocked kitchen for our big group. Nice walking neighborhood.  We were very pleased on  seeing the house was actually as nice as represented by site photos.
8057	1264287	9.0	9.0	18781964	The house was as advertised in a great location for us. One mile to Gas Works Park, quiet and quaint. The rooms were spacious and it was a nice space for children (twin bed, pack-n-play). One bathroom isn't ideal, but we made it work ok. Host was responsive- fixed light that was out in the kitchen on the 2nd day. Only issue was that I would make sure you understand Seattle's recycling policy regarding compostable items, etc, because it seems to be more strict than other cities. Also, there is only one mirror in the entire house (in the bathroom), which wasn't ideal when we were a family getting ready to be in a wedding.
8058	1264287	9.0	9.0	19884763	I stayed at Katharine's place with 3 collaborators when we were visiting UW for a conference. The place was perfect! It's in a great location and it's just as spotless and spacious as the photos make it seem. Katharine was a great host and she responded quickly to all of our questions. Highly recommended!

8060	1264287	9.0	9.0	24535127	Our family stayed here over Christmas 2014 and had a great time!  The house easily accommodates a group of 7 (we chose to pay for the second bathroom).  We were pleasantly surprised to find large pans available to cook a large meal and plenty of plates.  The location is excellent with all services (dry cleaning, drug store, market, shoe repair) and fun shops in easy walking distance.  Close to Burke Gilman trail for exercise and strolling and wonderful view of downtown Seattle.  Katharine met us upon arrival and was very warm and welcoming.
8061	1264287	9.0	9.0	43893997	Katharine was awesome. She made sure that we had everything that we needed and checked in with us during our stay. The house is great and we loved using the kitchen. The living space is perfect for hosting guests and the kitchen is fully stocked. Katharine Rocks!
8062	1264287	9.0	9.0	45242560	Great neightborhood, shops and resturaunts were walking distance from the house. Close enough to down town that Uber's were at times less than $12.  The house was exactly as described. My group agreed that we would love to stay in this home again.
8063	1264287	9.0	9.0	46118981	Fantastic location. You can quickly drive to just about everything Seattle has to offer very quickly. Tons of restaurants nearby by car, and some on foot, and you can get to the water on foot pretty quickly. We had plenty of privacy and we didn't lack for anything. 
8064	1264287	9.0	9.0	47060544	We had a great stay in Katharine's house.  The house was clean, well appointed, and provided ample space that was well separated for different groups sharing the home.  The neighborhood is great  -  very good restaurants and easy access to the lake and all Seattle has to offer.  Katharine responded quickly to inquiries and was very easy to work with.  Recommended! 
8065	1264287	9.0	9.0	47967537	"Katharine was a great host, she went above-and-beyond in helping us get situated and comfortable. The neighborhood is great - safe and very close to major highway access. While that does mean a little road noise (not loud, just ""white noise""), it was worth the trade-off for us. 
It's not a brand new house with perfect finishes, but the price is great, and it includes all the basic amenities - washer/dryer, parking, fast internet, dishwasher, etc. If you have small kids, the house has most of what you'd need - high chair, pack'n'play, baby gate, toys, etc - a big bonus."
8066	1264287	9.0	9.0	50460188	We had a wonderful time at Katharine's house!! The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were spacious and lovely. The kitchen was well stocked and we loved having breakfast in the little nook. There was plenty of space for 2 cars to park, and the house is within walking distance of several really cool areas. We had no problems with the cable, internet, or any appliances. Overall it was one of the most enjoyable Air BNB experiences! 
8067	1264287	9.0	9.0	52603479	Katharine's home was perfect for our trip.  It is in a great location and had everything we needed to be comfortable.  There were clean towels available in both bathrooms, and the kitchen was stocked with all of the utensils that we needed.  The grocery store is very close and convenient.  The entrance to I5 is just a couple of blocks away to get anywhere we needed to go in the city.  Highly recommended.
8068	1264287	9.0	9.0	55374323	This home is warm and cozy. All furniture and beds are very comfortable. Host went out of her way to answer questions. Proximity to Wallingford shops and restaurants is a definite plus. We enjoyed our stay!
8069	1264287	9.0	9.0	56249873	"Katharine was an excellent host; we enjoyed staying at her house very much! House was clean, well-stocked, and has a great location in Seattle.  We would recommend it and stay again!
"
8070	1264287	9.0	9.0	57439194	My family and I had a wonderful time! The house was exactly as described.  It was a great location close to many grocery stores and restaurants, there was plenty of room to spread out for the six of us, and the kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed.  It was easy to work with Katharine on the logistics and details.  
8792	3732103	8.0	9.0	17317244	This place was great. Andrew and his team are still ramping up, but already, the place has some great amenities and an energetic atmosphere. I'm going to call out the comfortable beds (high thread counts, mmm) and the two huge kitchens.
8793	3732103	8.0	9.0	17655281	"I arrived early in Seattle and they were able to check me in well before the check in time which I really appreciated. The room had 2 bunk beds of which only had one person living on top of me so it wasn't crowded at all. The house is well maintained and clean and they provided with a towel, free laundry, wifi and a nice couch to sit while not doing anything.
The location was also great within walking distance to bus and gas works park. 
I enjoyed staying there."
8794	3732103	8.0	9.0	38048202	I loved my time in the house. It was an interesting mix of young people who are motivated and friendly. I would recommend this place highly if you're in your 20's and want to be around a group of smart people. I loved it so much that I came back to the house after I moved out just to hang out! Also- it is an amazing location walking distance to gas works park, easy to get onto I5, and you can see the lake from the house.
8795	3732103	8.0	9.0	40485476	For the two weeks I was here, the house as a whole was a fun place to be. It's filled with people working in various parts of the tech industry, who mostly seem to be there for at least a couple weeks, if not months, so they try to keep up the house and the community. I was sharing a room with three other women, which I knew when I booked it, but you should definitely be aware of - my roommates were all very nice, but you have to be ready to be sharing a room closely. The common areas of the house were well maintained, and I had a good time hanging out and interacting with other residents. I'd recommend this house to anyone looking for a community while they're in Seattle.
8796	3732103	8.0	9.0	42964749	"Great house captain and owner of house (Paul and Andy, respectively). Super sweet, helpful, open, and willing to work with me. House is full of loving souls who are working hard on their projects. 

What I especially appreciated was the heterogeneous quality of this particular ""startup home."" It's not a hacker home, thank god, so there are more than just IT/web/software/coder dudes there. When I was there, there were Amazon, Google and Microsoft interns, employees from established startups, people starting their own companies, accelerator (Tech Stars) residents, hardware folks, and even a physicist. There was a room for girls/women (occupancy: 4). There were techies and then people like me who are in marketing/business development. The mixed environment lent itself to some very interesting discussions and a free flow of thought, which we all leveraged in our newfound friendships and career connections. Andy even gave me some great VC names to run after who may back my invention.

Some caveats: if living in tight spaces isn't for you, this might not be your best bet. Also tough if you don't own a car, as the nearest grocery store (and attendant bars, restaurants, cafes, etc.) is a one mile hike uphill (carrying groceries over this distance or walking in the rain may prove onerous). Finally, realize that every resident's definition of ""clean"" will vary...and with two bathrooms (soon to be four) and three kitchens used by about 20 people (at capacity), that can be a bit challenging. At present, the house is cleaned once every three weeks. I suggested it be cleaned once a week for so many residents (especially as people keep rotating through and don't feel responsible to keep the place neat, as they know they are leaving shortly)...both Paul and Andy patiently heard my feedback and seemed amenable to improving the cleanliness situation.

Overall, I highly, highly recommend this place to earnest startup folks who want to get involved in the tight-knit upstart community in Seattle. Andy has created a very interesting concept here, which will no doubt keep growing, as it's backbone is a highly-democratized environment conducive to legendary brainstorming sessions, debates and conversations -- not to mention connections."
8797	3732103	8.0	9.0	45425279	I felt welcomed. Everyone was pretty friendly. I stayed for less than a week and was able to get work done as the house is pretty quiet and there is rarely anyone in common areas during the day. My roommate was pretty cool, had good conversations with her. Overall, it was a convenient for my time being. 
9446	3889050	6.0	9.0	18845093	"I had a very pleasant stay at Andrew's place (c/o Aaron/Math&Co) ... The Hostel-like setting offers a very relaxed and creative atmosphere. One that you can only get from a slowly but constantly fluctuating flat-share allowing for short spikes of 4-night-visitors like me.
Fremont being a very nice neighborhood is situated in walking distance to UW which came in very handy for me as I had to visit a lab over there. That I happened to visit at the weekend of Bumbershoot was good luck with Bootsy Collins rocking the stage! Make sure to visit the Troll under Fremont Bridge and the Fremont Sunday Market is a good place to grab a little snack and take a stroll... What I appreciated a lot was the possibility to use a bike to get around - this came in really handy.
Somehow I really hope to see some of the people again - same place, other place - I would go for it again!"
9447	3889050	6.0	9.0	45179652	This is a great house. The atmosphere is welcoming and fun, while also professional. The place is clean and amenities are accessible. Everyone is very friendly, and Paul was a great house captain. He really helped me out by letting me extend for a night when my other plans fell through. Connecting with the other housemates was also valuable.
9448	3889050	6.0	9.0	46514608	"I'll start with the good: the atmosphere was really nice. People were friendly and welcoming, and there was a genuine feeling of community amongst the residents.

Now for the bad:

First of all I must state that it seems I stayed at the place when lots of renovation was happening. I'm hoping this is not the norm, so your mileage may vary...
I was in a 2 person room on the bottom floor. The shower was being renovated (thus non-existing), so the closest shower was one floor up, shared by the residents of both floors. The renovations were not stated in the listing.
My room was adjacent to the work, thus it was impossible to sleep in, since noisy construction started early in the morning. The construction noise also meant that most people preferred to leave the house in order to get some work done. In the room there was an exposed water pipe, and very loud dripping noise started every time that pipe was used. The room had no ""luxuries"" like a hook to hang my wet towel on.

During my stay the entire house lost water for two days. Walking 20 minutes in the morning (to my workplace) just to brush my teeth and take a shower was not a pleasant experience. I can see how this sort of thing can happen, and the host was very gracious about it, trying to find solutions for the residents. Normally I would not comment about such an unforeseen event, but along with the rest of the renovation, this was a bit too much. We were promised a refund for the 2 days, I'm still waiting for mine.

I can see how this place can be great if no renovation is taking place. I think the host should have either shut-down during the renovation, or at least make it explicit in the listing.

Giving it 3 starts, as an average between my 1 star experience and the 5 starts it could have been.

When I left, they just started tearing apart the upstairs kitchen..."
11299	4583161	9.0	9.0	23764097	Great experience! Our hosts were accommodating to our schedule & provided us with a beautiful, clean and private space. 
11300	4583161	9.0	9.0	27155296	The reservation was canceled 176 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11301	4583161	9.0	9.0	27556060	This space is exactly as pictured and described.  Mike was out of town during my stay, so our sole contact was via text  It was Mike's mother that I interacted with in person; and she was unbelievably gracious, thoughtful, and accommodating.  I would love to stay here again.
11302	4583161	9.0	9.0	27844714	Mike and his family were very hospitable, and the check-in/out was super easy.  The bedroom comfortably fit 2 people, and it had a great mattress.  Great location, great hosts.
11303	4583161	9.0	9.0	28365982	"We had a really good time at Mike's place. It's a great location, the bed is really comfortable, and the room/bathroom is perfect for 2. Mike was super communicative and answered all of our crazy questions. He was laid back about us leaving and coming in late. He even gave us recommendations to awesome restaurants and bars that made our trip to Seattle worthwhile. If we had more time we would've loved to hang out with him and his friends. 

Overall, we're glad we stayed here. Thanks again for extending your home to us! :)"
11304	4583161	9.0	9.0	28687304	Absolutely wonderful. Lovely room, reasonable rates, privacy, great location. We'll be back, we hope!
11305	4583161	9.0	9.0	28847729	Awesome location and room, bed was super comfortable and the room had all the necessary commodities. Mike's super nice and checking in and out was fast and easy.
11306	4583161	9.0	9.0	29677249	What a great experience. Mike and Marianne were such gracious hosts. The space was very private and accommodating! I most certainly would stay again if they have it available when I visit the area.
11307	4583161	9.0	9.0	29878425	This unit offered a clean and comfortable room and an excellent bed and TV with a range of viewing options. Bathroom facilities were quite good, and the host was accessible, informative and helpful. All in all, a fine stay on an excellent weekend.
11308	4583161	9.0	9.0	30010951	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11309	4583161	9.0	9.0	33019452	Clean and inviting. Mike was very friendly and gave us great advice on what to do and see and where to eat while in Seattle. Would definitely stay here again. 
11310	4583161	9.0	9.0	33314609	Stayed over Memorial Day weekend. Great location in Queen Ann central to downtown, Freemont, and Ballard. A walk away from a great overlook of the city at Kerry Park. Parking wasn't a problem. The bedroom and bathroom are very clean and nice. Great bed, very comfortable. The host Mike is friendly and knowledgeable of the city.  I would stay again when in Seattle. 
11311	4583161	9.0	9.0	33751273	"

Great location for our needs.  Mike was a super host.  Communicated quickly, gave good advice for eating and public transportation, answered all our questions.  Nice neighbourhood.  Quiet and private room.  He went above and beyond to accommodate our needs.
"
11312	4583161	9.0	9.0	34679168	"Had a very comfortable and convenient stay in Seattle with Mike. His home is in a very clean and safe area, with convenient access to all parts of Seattle. Room and restroom are very clean, private, and comfortable. Located on the lowest floor of the home where the home entrance is. Loved being able to come in and out without disturbing Mike and his family. 

Overall, very welcoming and hospitable experience. Highly recommend. "
11313	4583161	9.0	9.0	34746125	"This was the perfect spot for my quick trip to Seattle. Mike was very communicative and straight forward about what times worked for him, and he was even flexible to help fit my schedule once I arrived in town. The set up was perfect, a beautiful, clean bedroom and bathroom downstairs right by the front door, while Mike was upstairs for anything I should need. 
The neighborhood was quiet and close enough for me to walk around and find a good pizza spot and a cool place to grab a beer.
I cannot write a review without mentioning how clean and comfortable the bed was. I slept great.
AWESOME SPOT. 10/10 would stay again."
11314	4583161	9.0	9.0	35133137	"Mike was friendly and good to communicate with and the listing accurately described the accommodations. The room was clean and in good condition, the bed was comfy and the location was really convenient for us.

The only thing that was a bit of a surprise was the degree of privacy.  The listing says ""private floor"" and ""Guests have the entire first floor"". This is technically true but the first floor consists of the entry/foyer for the house and the bed and bathrooms are both accessed via the foyer. So if you're moving between the bedroom and bathroom you're out in the entryway for their home. This was not an issue but did come as a surprise.

I recommend dealing with Mike and this listing met our needs well for our recent stay in Seattle."
11315	4583161	9.0	9.0	35320738	"Our host family could not have been more friendly or welcoming.  They offered us a breakfast of fruit, yogurt, cereal and coffee in their beautiful kitchen, as well as helpful suggestions on nearby places to walk and dine.

We had exclusive use of a bathroom on the bottom floor of the 3-floor condo.  The room itself is just big enough for the bed and a TV; there is no chair or desk,so TV watching would be from bed or standing.  The closet was full of clothes; not a problem for our one-night stay."
11316	4583161	9.0	9.0	35820239	It was nice meeting you Mike. Your place worked perfectly for my wife and I, it was very clean and comfortable and exactly as described and the location was great. It was nice to enjoy a beer on your balcony and take in the view as well. We shall return!
11317	4583161	9.0	9.0	36629123	The neighborhood and location was perfect. Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown. We ordered an Uber from the house and there was no issue finding the place. Although Mike was not there, his sister let us in and we dropped our stuff and left. Although our stay was quick and easy, the bathroom toiletries (soap, towels, etc) were limited. We had one towel and the soap was almost completely gone. The nightstand was pretty dusty and the room a little small. Perfect size for a couple though, especially since we were just there to sleep. Mike was easy to communicate with and happy to answer any of our questions. 
11318	4583161	9.0	9.0	38159052	This was my first experience renting an Airbnb and it was great! My friend and I had a wonderful time! Mike was quick to get back to us and answer all our questions.  He was out of town during our visit but his mom, Marianne was a lovely host and made us coffee and tea in the morning and recommended some fantastic restaurants for us to try. The room and bathroom were nicely tucked away from the rest of the house. Overall, a great experience! 
11319	4583161	9.0	9.0	38921808	I got this room for my dad and sister as they visited me in Seattle. Mike was very easy to communicate to and very willing to help and make the stay the best it could be. The room is just as listed, a small room with a bed for 2, perfect if you are out and about all day and need a place to sleep at night. Also Queen Anne (the neighborhood) is gorgeous and very walkable. Lots of parks and coffee shops to enjoy. 
11320	4583161	9.0	9.0	39256660	Quick and easy
11321	4583161	9.0	9.0	39459919	The room was perfect for our 24 hour visit to Seattle. The neighborhood was extremely quiet but so close to everything. Mike was very welcoming and accommodated our arrival time. He was always very quick to respond to any questions. Thanks and would stay here again!! 
11322	4583161	9.0	9.0	40124700	"Mike was great responding to my question before our arrival, and was able to meet and let us drop off our luggage and pick up the key much earlier than the original check in time.
Room and all the amenities were great. Having a private floor, and entrance made it perfect for us. If there ever was any questions the answer was just a text away!
Location was good, about 10 minutes (via Uber of Lyft) to downtown and another cool area called Ballard. There isn't that much within short walk like breakfast places etc. But if you're like us and once you leave the house you're out for the day, it doesn't really matter.
There was a bus stop within walking distance, but we're not bus takers so we used Uber and Lyft for our rides.
Perfect place if you want to go in and out with privacy and spend most of your time out and about exploring Seattle!"
11323	4583161	9.0	9.0	40378663	Mike was great and so is the room. Clean house and lots of privacy in the lower level.
11324	4583161	9.0	9.0	40873022	My boyfriend and I had our lodging plans fall through at the last minute, and Mike was able to help us out in a pinch. His quick response saved us a lot of stress! The room was exactly as expected, in fact it almost looked nicer in person than in the photos. Mike and his mother (who lives upstairs) were very welcoming and pleasant, and they have a very comfortable home. Great area and perfect for a one-night stay. 
11325	4583161	9.0	9.0	43167100	This was our first airbnb experience and we booked with short notice. Everything was easy and seemless.
11769	15108	8.0	9.0	358030	Bob was a great host. His house was very well located for our needs and we really enjoyed his private, tranquil backyard. He was even nice enough to post some clothing home we had mistakenly left behind.
11770	15108	8.0	9.0	396968	Bob was a great host. He was very accommodating, his home and the room were as described, and he was gracious enough to wait up and show me around when I said I would be arriving late. 
11771	15108	8.0	9.0	456716	What a neat place with a lovely backyard - great location, great host, great pets!
11772	15108	8.0	9.0	919284	A friendly place.  Thanks, Bob.
11773	15108	8.0	9.0	2693792	The place was comfortable and it was not difficult to go to the city by a car.  My best things in there is a lovely dog and cats. Super cute.Thanks for making us feel at home.  귂꺾뻒庸
11774	15108	8.0	9.0	3962261	Quiet, cozy home in a neighborhood.  Just 1/2 mile from my grandchildren.  On the bus line, easy walk to Green Lake.  Sweet pets, very clean and nice.  
11775	15108	8.0	9.0	4324698	"I am absolutely satisfied with Bob's pla혜햣. First, it is the best location in Seattle. Green lake- it is something amazing!! Its a perfect place for walking, jogging, bicycling , kayaking, taking pictures and every thing!!  There are a lot of cafes , restorans , but at the same time it's very picefull, not crowded place, very  convenient to get downtown and university district. Second, Bob-is great! Hi is  friendly, helpfull and welcoming like host  and  interesting like a person! And his lovely pets are so cute! 
Thank you, Bob! "
11776	15108	8.0	9.0	5155676	Bob's room was just what I needed. A quiet place to rest and work for a bit before heading to climb Rainier. Bob was welcoming and fun to talk to. He has a lovely backyard with so many cozy places to curl up and read. It was a treat to stay with him! 
11777	15108	8.0	9.0	5201006	We had a quick overnight stay and we had a great time.  Bob was wonderful and we loved the sweet cats! The location to Greenlake was convenient for a morning run and the backyard is fantastic! 
11778	15108	8.0	9.0	5352889	Bob is a great host. Comfortable house with nice downstairs bedroom, comfortable bed. Shared bathroom but not a problem to access. Very close to downtown Green Lake restaurants,  Thanks Bob!
11779	15108	8.0	9.0	5518324	"Real estate agents say, ""Location location location."" This charming home is, ""Location location location location location location."" Oh, did I mention it is in one of the best, hippest neighborhoods in the Seattle area? Green Lake is a scenic country oasis within the city of Seattle. 

I treated a 19 year-old German student, Jasper, to three nights at Bob's house because my place, and the timing, was impractical. Bob was enjoyable to do business with, albeit by phone, and it felt as though we were old pals. I look forward to meeting him in person. The accommodations were delightful as promised, according to Jasper. I did see the inside, and the yard, and agree. Although I am unfamiliar with the German language, I believe Jasper's ear-to-ear grin at Bob's house spoke volumes. "
11780	15108	8.0	9.0	5537121	Nice location. You're sharing the bathroom and house with college students. Bed is ultra firm.
11781	15108	8.0	9.0	5878538	We had a great time in Seattle at Bob's place. The room is nice and cozy, it was great to meet Bob and he gave us some excellent tips on what to do and see in Seattle. Definitely recommended.
11782	15108	8.0	9.0	5993299	I stayed at Bob's five nights and had a pleasant visit. Bob was friendly and helpful, very easygoing. The house is a bit outside Seattle's center but well connected by buses.The neighborhood is nice with a beautiful lake and park, and restaurants, close by. The room was comfortable enough and I had no problems with the other guests or using the bathroom. It's next to the kitchen and you can hear the conversations, but people were respectful and it was not an issue for me. The hot tub in the yard was wonderful in the evenings. It was a good experience and I would definetely stay at Bob's when I am in Seattle again. 
11783	15108	8.0	9.0	6281261	"Wir waren 12 Tage bei Bob und ,wurden sehr herzlich aufgenommen.
Es war alles so wie beschrieben.Der Garten ist eine Oase der Ruhe,
und man konnte den Wirlpool benutzen oder einfach nur entspannen
Dass wir das Bad teilen mussten war auch kein Problem.Die Katzen genossen ihre Streicheleinheiten,und wenn unsere Zimmert칲r offen war ,schwupps,lagen sie im Bett! (wenn nicht,kratzten sie an der T칲r ),Bob ist ein ausergew칬hlicher hilfsbereiter und lieber Gastgeber.Ich habe ihm so gerne zugeh칬rt wenn er auf  seinem  Klavier spielte oder singend das Geschirr sp칲lte.Dieses Haus lebt und hat eine positive Energie.Leider spreche ich nur ein wenig Englisch,und doch klappte die Verst칛ndigung weil Bob sich sehr gro른 M칲he gab.
Bob ,wenn es wirklich klappt dass wir uns sehen wenn du in Italien bist werde ich bis dahin mein Englisch aufbessern!!!! 
Danke f칲r alles, Es war  sch칬n dich kennenzulernen.

11784	15108	8.0	9.0	6337875	The house was comfortable, and the cats were lovely, but the garden was definitely the highlight. Thanks for being such a nice host, Bob, we'll definitely come down another time soon. :)
11785	15108	8.0	9.0	6377834	bob was wonderful. its extremely close to the lake and an easy taxi ride from most things.  def recommend staying with him and his two lovable cats
11786	15108	8.0	9.0	6440029	This was my first airbnb experience and i'm a fan.  Big thanks to Bob and for him sharing his nice room in Seattle.  He was very helpful in providing quick advice to local eateries and coffee shops as well as make my stay as comfortable and easy as possible.  If you stay here I advise you to check out Green Lake sunsets- stunning views only a few blocks away!
11787	15108	8.0	9.0	6481865	This room was in a great location and the room was clean and comfortable. A surprise bonus was the host Bob, who with his friendliness.generosity and openness made me feel instantly at home. Bob rents out more than one room in the house and I got the impression that it is always buzzing with activity and socializing!  This might not be a first choice for someone looking for quiet, alone time free of pets, but for me, it was a fun experience and I would definitely return! Thanks Bob!

We joined in on one of his many game nights and had a blast while there. He was very helpful, and also let us his kitchen pretty much every day, as well as his collection of spices and seasoning! 

I highly recommend staying at Bob's place if your passing through Seattle, or staying there longer term for school, etc. "
11789	15108	8.0	9.0	6782583	Bob was a gracious host whose location was ideal for me.  His other house members equally nice and sharing.  This was a fine entree back into Seattle after 7 years away.
11790	15108	8.0	9.0	8109789	Bob's place is a true community.  Besides the others rooming in the house, many of Bob's friends stop by for an evening  of pleasant talk and board games.  One can join in around the kitchen table or retreat to one's room without feeling pressured to participate.  Bob is an extraordinary raconteur as well as working actor, songster and piano player.  He is full of energy and skill.  The house is situated just a block from Green Lake which I am told is the busiest park in Washington.  Walking, jogging, or wheeling around the lake is a favorite form of exercise for what seems like the majority of north Seattle.  I stayed at Bob's for a month and a half.  I used the city transit for nearly all my travel and found it to be convenient.  Two major routes stop just a short block away and several others are nearby.  Restaurants, pubs,  Ben and Jerry's ice cream, coffee shops and a couple grocery stores are within walking distance.  Bottom line is I loved my stay and next time I'm in Seattle Bob will be first on my list for lodging.
11791	15108	8.0	9.0	8748809	Staying with Bob was wonderfull! Exceeded all my expectations. Thoroughly enjoyable and very relaxed. The cats are a treat and the hot tub is a dream and Bob will provide great entertainment and conversation. The bed was very comfortable, I didn't want to leave!!! I recommend staying with Bob highly. A home away from home.Thank you Bob, I can't wait to return!!
11792	15108	8.0	9.0	11300173	"The five weeks I spent at Bobs in Seattle passed way to fast! When I arrived I had a warm welcome with homemade soup and waffles. The kitchen was well equipped and it was fun to cook there. It was always fun to meet up for chats in the nice common areas with Bob, the other housemates, friends or the two lovely cats. Also the neighbourhood, Greenlake, is a good place if you are motivated to discover places that are not on every tourists schedule, such as Ballard, Wallingford, Ravenna or the University District - all easy accesible by bus.
Go ahead - if you wanna have a good time in Seattle, book a place at Bobs! :-)"
11793	15108	8.0	9.0	12414291	Very warm and welcoming place. No false advertisements  !!  
11794	15108	8.0	9.0	17264265	All in all it was an exceptional living experience with Bob! It was a friendly, quaint and welcome atmosphere with an awesome back yard to boot.
11795	15108	8.0	9.0	17399370	Bob met me at the door, very friendly and welcoming. The room was exactly as the pictures showed, the house was very charming and eclectic. I really want to know how he got that gorgeous grand piano in there!  He had towels laid out, fresh flowers on the nightstand, and played some great piano music I could hear while I was in the shower. :). His cats were so friendly one tried to stow away in my backpack. 
11796	15108	8.0	9.0	17606809	Bob was very welcoming and really helped us out by approving our stay at the last minute. We were only in the house for one night, so we spent very little time there. House is in a great location...walking distance to a couple bus stops and Green Lake. A little disappointed with the cleanliness of the house and room (the room smelled like cats and mildew). Also did not realize the house was shared with several other AirBnB guests, giving it a hostel feel. 
11797	15108	8.0	9.0	17868554	Bob was a gracious host, very friendly. We felt welcomed in his home and our needs for quiet time were considered. The house is in a great neighborhood in Seattle and has an awesome back yard. It is a little bit of a funky house and I would recommend coming prepared for that experience. Like most older houses, sound travels well. Any comers here should love cats, because there are two very present male kitties living here. 
11798	15108	8.0	9.0	17984735	Bob is friendly and welcoming. The neighborhood is cool. Before booking this place make sure your not annoyed by cat smell. 
11799	15108	8.0	9.0	18685637	Bobs place was in a great location. Close to Green Lake on a quite beautiful street!
11800	15108	8.0	9.0	19766648	We had a lovely time at Bob's house met his two nice cats! Bob is a fantastic nice host en we like to come back next year.
11801	15108	8.0	9.0	20660427	The house is great. Good location, near the beautiful Green Lake Park and close to bus stops. Bob is an amazing host, very friendly and willing to go out of his way to help you. The bed is very nice, the bathroom clean, the kitchen fully equipped. I honestly wish I could have stayed more time.
11802	15108	8.0	9.0	21189557	Bob was very kind and accommodating in letting me stay at his home on last minute's notice, though we really didn't get the chance to meet.  The bed was comfy, and the neighborhood was very quiet for being so close to the bustle of Green Lake--walking distance to shops, restaurants and the local health food store.  Lovely kitties, too!
11803	15108	8.0	9.0	29287529	Very pleasant stay. He respected the fact that I was there for school and therefore didn't have much social time, but always invited me to join him and others in playing board games, etc. He was also very helpful in suggesting directions to places where I needed to go as well as having a genuine interest in what I was studying.
11804	15108	8.0	9.0	33379182	Bob is amazing host, he is very friendly and made us feel at home. The room is cozy and we love it! And Bob is a wonderful singer !! I hope we can watch him in another concert.
11805	15108	8.0	9.0	42658046	The room/ house was everything that it promised to be. A block away from buses to downtown, the supermarket, etc. A block away from Green Lake where I spent many memorable evenings. Bob is very friendly and welcoming. I cooked quite a bit in the kitchen and he very graciously let me use spices/pots/containers etc. The hot tub in the backyard and Pollux, Bob's cat, were a bonus! I grew up scared of cats but I got quite attached to Pollux by the end of my stay. I had a lot of fun conversations with Bob whenever we overlapped in the kitchen. I'd highly recommend the house to anyone looking to stay in a picturesque neighborhood while being close to downtown.
11806	15108	8.0	9.0	45144156	"I stayed in one of the upstairs bedrooms for 6 months, and have visited twice since moving out of the state.  Overall, I had a great experience living here.  Bob is a wonderful host and friend.  Will stay in touch for a long time, I'm sure.  He was very reasonable and understanding with everyone living in his home.  

The house is only 2 blocks from Green Lake and I always felt safe walking nearby.  It's a quiet area with no real noise pollution, like police sirens or thumping bass.  The jacuzzi and garden were great to relax in.  On-street parking was never, ever an issue, and there was plenty to do and see within walking distance.  The nearest bus lines run on Wallingford Ave, only a block away. You can go to U District or  or downtown without having to transfer.  I commuted to Redmond every day by bus and never felt like it was an epic journey.  

Would definitely recommend and will probably return if I come back to town again.
"
11807	15108	8.0	9.0	48715283	"Bob is absolutely fantastic.  With late night conversations in the kitchen, boisterous game nights, morning singing and songwriting sessions, and an overall 'what's mine is yours attitude', he makes you feel as if you belonged at his house all along.

Pollox the cat is reserved, but loves rough attention when he's looking for it.  The house is incredibly eclectic and lived-in, and Bob has a habit of collecting memorabilia.

You'll be missing out terribly if all you're looking for is a clean and tidy place to crash."
11808	15108	8.0	9.0	52845073	Bob's house in Green Lake makes for a great home in Seattle.  The room was exactly as described and Bob went out of his way to make me feel at home.  Highly recommend.
11809	15108	8.0	9.0	53566511	Bob was a friendly and gracious host who communicates efficiently and effectively - he is mature and strikes an excellent balance between giving you your space but also being there if you need him. He is also an excellent source of information about the city's transportation system and anything different, from a tourists perspective, about Seattle. Don't hesitate to book his clean, quaint and well maintained (and sign posted) private room! Pollux the cat is a wonderful companion too! Highly recommended.....
11810	15108	8.0	9.0	54716158	We chose Bob's house because of its excellent location near Green Lake. We decided not to stay when we saw that the room was small and dark, next to the shared kitchen and bathroom. There were more people staying in the house than we expected, making the small, over-furnished space claustrophobic. Handwritten signs everywhere and odor of cat box contributed to the unpleasant feel of the house. The advertised hot tub was without water and clearly hadn't been used in a while.
13143	1063855	10.0	9.0	5581451	"Our family of five had a really nice stay in Molly and her family's green house! Everything was spotlessly clean and wine, homemade (!) granolas and jam was there for us. But what we liked most about it was the garden filled with vegetables and berries (and we were allowed to eat from it:-) as well as getting the oportunity to live in a house where everything is made or planned with so much concern for design, natural materials and our ecological footprint.We are inspired to do some changes in our own home in Norway. 
The bus is right outside, so easy access to citycentre. We could park our car outside. 
Thank you again!"
13144	1063855	10.0	9.0	15073689	We loved staying at Molly's place in the Central District. Their home is very beautiful with tons of great, natural toys for my children to play with. The beds were very comfortable too. And, we love the coffee shop just a block away. It was the perfect place for us to stay while in Seattle with two little children. I would definitely stay here again!
13145	1063855	10.0	9.0	15544734	Lovely house and a very helpful host!
13146	1063855	10.0	9.0	16903104	"House was like a little cabin! We really liked it.  Host Molly was so friendly and answered all my questions. Parking on the street was no problem at all!! We really enjoyed staying at Molly's house.  House had one queen bed and one bunk bed- beds were really comfortable.  If you open the window's you get a nice breeze! We felt really comfortable and safe in the house. We were out most of the day - just slept in the house! Any time I could call Molly and she answered right away! I really enjoyed spending morning ours in the porch with my kids.

Thank you Molly:)"
13147	1063855	10.0	9.0	17498330	Great family house with vegetables garden, nice neighbourhood equally close to the lake and to downtown, very inspiring books and vibes.
13148	1063855	10.0	9.0	33390661	It was amazing to stay at Molly뗩 house! She was an amazing host and the house was fantastic. They were super helpful with everything! There was a lot of toys for the kids and the garden was also beautiful. It was the best place for us to stay in Seattle and we wouldn't hesitate for a second with coming back.  Thank you for making our holiday even better with your house and your fantastic host skills! 
13149	1063855	10.0	9.0	36701243	My in-laws had a wonderful stay at Molly's home.  It is a lovely house that is thoughtfully decorated and full of character, and they were quite comfortable.  We would definitely rent it again!
13150	1063855	10.0	9.0	38306431	"Molly's house is charming. Perfectly located at a walking distance from shops, restaurants, bars, and Capitol Hill.
Molly provided detailed directions via email, which was perfect for me. I would strongly recommend staying at her place."
13151	1063855	10.0	9.0	40353064	Molly and her family went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. They left beer in the fridge and even offered us their perishable food items. Their home is comfortable, cozy and relaxing. 
13152	1063855	10.0	9.0	41950335	Molly made us feel welcome. She was away when we arrived and left yet had contacted us to make sure all was set for us to get in the house. The location was good; we liked the neighborhood and felt safe  and the place clean. 
13153	1063855	10.0	9.0	44566764	We loved our stay at Molly's and felt right at home!  The neighborhood was perfect - within a few minutes walk to coffee, farmers market, and a wide variety of restaurants.  Molly was pleasant and easy to communicate with as well.  We had no trouble at all with parking and we were very happy to enjoy some delicious heirloom tomatoes from the garden.
15035	7561272	9.0	9.0	41032813	We had a great stay in Dario's French Country Room.  We arrived late due to our late flight from Texas, but Dario and his roommate were very accommodating and kind.  Dario's home is beautiful, quiet, clean, and very convenient to everything in the University District. 
15036	7561272	9.0	9.0	41500422	"The ""French Country Room w/ Breakfast"" was a pleasant place to stay in Seattle. It matches the description of the room and the house. The house was clean and comfortable. It is close to the University, with easy access to restaurants and public transportation. My interactions with other guests were minimal as I was out of the house for work until the late evening. However, people were considerate and respectful. It was a great place to come and go and feel at home."
15037	7561272	9.0	9.0	41894784	We had a great stay in the French Country Room. It's clean and comfy. The common areas are well maintained. Great location in the University District 
15038	7561272	9.0	9.0	43593661	great.
15039	7561272	9.0	9.0	43730510	The house and room was pretty much exactly as advertised. We never actually met Dario, but the house was easy to access and comfortable. Would gladly recommend this room to anyone looking for an easy place to stay by the University. 
15040	7561272	9.0	9.0	44254036	Very comfortable, clean and inviting home!
15041	7561272	9.0	9.0	45715202	Excellent stay all around! The other airbnb guests, Dario, and Ethan were great, very friendly. The house and room were clean and super comfortable. I will absolutely recommend this place to any friends visiting Seattle in the future.
15042	7561272	9.0	9.0	45915986	The listing was accurate, Dario and Ethan were very welcoming - although we only communicated over text and didn't meet - and it was quite easy to get into their home, find my room, and feel at home.  Great spot to stay for  an overnight in Seattle!
15043	7561272	9.0	9.0	46219779	My traveling partner and I had an overall great experience at Dario's the keypad entry to the house made it very easy to arrive and depart as needed, especially on our first day when we didn't know when we would arrive. The house was very clean and cozy. Everything was well labeled and welcoming. Our second night there were a few loud noises from other guests which was disruptive. No key to the room or option to lock it when we left the house was not very nice. 
15044	7561272	9.0	9.0	47006882	I had a great experience. The room was beautiful with all the amenities I needed. Loved it. I never knew my first experience of a Airbnb accomodation would be this great! Thank you Dario!
15045	7561272	9.0	9.0	49553691	The room is very nice, clean and well-decorated. The location is very convenient to visit the campus of UW. It is easy to find restaurants and markets around.  My first airbnb experience is great! 
15046	7561272	9.0	9.0	51504266	My stay was very pleasant. The house is well appointed, quiet, clean, and a nice walk to campus. Fantastic breakfast and warm reception. Thanks Dario and Ethan.
15047	7561272	9.0	9.0	51661227	"I was very comfortable in Dario's home. The breakfast was superb, the kitchen is well appointed, the location is perfect for walking to campus. It was quiet, spacious, and well appointed.

Although I was grunging to a class every day for a week, I felt well cared for when I got ""home"".  

Thank you!"
15048	7561272	9.0	9.0	52177117	I came in late and everything was as I had been told in my intinerary. The room was ready and inviting and I had a wonderful stay! There was food aplenty for breakfast in the kitchen and plenty of space to just relax.
15049	7561272	9.0	9.0	52902877	The room was comfy and the house was in a great spot of town. Easy and convenient way to get to see Seattle :)
15050	7561272	9.0	9.0	53158518	We enjoyed our stay here, the location was great, the whole of the house clean with clear instructions to find what we needed, and a generous  choice of food for breakfast. Ethan was very speedy in replying to our queries and we enjoyed meeting him, as we did the other guests.
15051	7561272	9.0	9.0	53416121	So welcome! Wonderful host!
15052	7561272	9.0	9.0	54172200	Dario's room is cozy and pretty. I had a great time there. Although the house is close to the campus, I didn't hear any noise at night. There are many restaurants and shops on campus, and it is very convenient to take bus71/72/73 to go to downtown. I strongly recommend Dario' rooms to all the tourists!:)
15053	7561272	9.0	9.0	54656052	My stay was a great experience! The room and house were very comfortable and it was great to have breakfast food, tea, coffee, etc. The location is also great, and easy walk to the UW campus and nearby stores and restaurants.
15054	7561272	9.0	9.0	54801367	Nice decoration, cozy room and great location. Highly recommended.
15055	7561272	9.0	9.0	55041071	I unfortunately didn't get the chance to meet the hosts, however, everything was as listed and great! Everything was clean and the breakfast was great. Nothing bad to say at all, highly recommend!
15056	7561272	9.0	9.0	55274777	Nice decoration, cozy room and great location. We'd like to stay again.
15057	7561272	9.0	9.0	55336060	Great location, Clean environment 
15058	7561272	9.0	9.0	55435546	I didn't get the chance to meet Dario since I was out most of the day, but the place itself is wonderful! Very clean and very pristine. Check-in was the easiest out of any place I've been to. The house is in a quiet neighborhood near UW and within walking distance of bus stops and restaurants. Breakfast was included with this stay and there were more options than most of the hotels I've stayed at! A+ all around.
15059	7561272	9.0	9.0	56056899	"I didn't meet Dario but I did feel welcome from his rep, Ethan. I loved the room (red is my favorite color). Everything was clean and open. Other guests were quiet. There was plenty of food available to us in the kitchen. The location was EXACTLy what I wanted, near U of Washington and walking distance from a cool park, Ravenna, and good restaurants. Also I called Dario for info about using the computer/printer there, and he was quite willing to help. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and recommend it especially for anyone interested in exploring the U of W area.
"
15060	7561272	9.0	9.0	56282624	"The setup was great--key code to get in the house, everything in the kitchen is well-labeled, so I could check myself in and out without any issue.

The room was clean and spacious, a really nice closet to store things as well. Bed was super-comfortable. Wifi was fast! 

And best of all, when I left behind a valued item, I was able to retrieve it with no issues 5 days later. Thanks so much guys!!

There were a few things not mentioned in the description that are worth mentioning, as they may trouble some guests (not me, I slept great!). 

The facilities were a bit messier than I've typically experienced, and may bother some guests (didn't bother me at all!). More than half the kitchen table was filled with towels, the kitchen wasn't the cleanest, and the common rooms weren't as organized or picked up as I've experienced at other places (~7 AirBNB experiences so far!), and remained that way during my stay.

In the room itself, the window above the bed was retracted by a rotating lever that was disconnected; with high winds it was really hard to lock the window closed to stop the clattering. And there were one or two small issues (burn marks?) with the rug that might bother some people. Didn't bother me at all.
"
15061	7561272	9.0	9.0	56561195	Excellent location close to numerous restaurants in the University of Washington area(5-15 min walk).  Also close to busses that go downtown(30 min bus ride).  The home itself is an older home in an older neighborhood.  Furnishings were perfectly pleasant.  Various breakfast foods were provided, which was quite nice.  Bread, bagels, cereal, eggs, juice, apples, oranges, etc.  Overall excellent for the price and my purposes!
15062	7561272	9.0	9.0	56754127	Convenient spot, walking distance to cafes, shops, pharmacy, etc. Only stayed for one night but this room was adequate for my needs. Tidy bedroom and bathroom, and Dario was kind enough to provide snacks for breakfast. Room located on second floor in a house with multiple AirBnB rooms sharing the bathroom and other guests coming and going, so that is a consideration for some. I met Dario on my way out, he seemed friendly. 
15131	3422894	10.0	9.0	15994151	Amy is a very accommodating host. She has a great energy and makes sure you have a comfortable stay in one of the most beautiful US cities. The apartment is just steps to the main strip in the University District and the university itself. One of the biggest draws of the studio is an outdoor patio area overlooking the city where you can lounge, read, do yoga, grill out or have a glass of wine. Thanks, Amy for the stay and being so welcoming!
15132	3422894	10.0	9.0	16179976	Amy is an amazing host, the communication with her is smooth and easy. The studio is awesome: top floor with a huge south-facing rooftop! It is clean and has everything you need. It looks exactly as on the pictures. Thank you!
15133	3422894	10.0	9.0	16185488	Amy's Studio was perfect for our needs.  We were looking for a place to crash for one night in the North East Seattle area.  Amy was able to accommodate us on short notice.  Amy was very responsive and helpful during the reservation and checkin process.  The pictures and description of the studio on the website is accurate.   As described on the website it is on the 4th floor of an apartment building with no elevator so keep that in mind.    
15134	3422894	10.0	9.0	16376817	What a fun place!  I especially liked all the light and air and quiet (rooftop apt with windows on three sides), the eclectic world-traveler decorations, the nicely stocked kitchen and bathroom (bean coffee and new toothbrushes) and the wine and cheese welcome.   The apt includes a private parking space off the street, which is a big plus.  Amy is a great host - made sure I was comfortable on arrival and gave some great tips on neighborhood.   It's a very engaging neighborhood - all walkable within a few blocks - lively international student life, and boucoup de coffee shops and ethnic restaurants - too many to sample on one trip.    I'll be back.
15135	3422894	10.0	9.0	16447210	The reservation was canceled 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15136	3422894	10.0	9.0	16634206	"My wife and I had a wedding to attend at the Botanic Gardens of the University Of Washington. And along with this being her first trip to Seattle, we were looking for accommodations that would offer the 'entire place' and us the chance at getting around at a minimal expense.  Amy's Sunny Rooftop U District Studio perfectly fit our needs. Her place is beautiful; with live plants, bird feeders, and a sustainability feel that inspires you. It comes furnished with a large refrigerator, a hot plate and essentials for cooking. The neighborhood couldn't have been more excellent with grocery stores, restaurants, and bars a short walk away. Being near campus the area is lively and well lit at night. And thanks to Seattle's amazingly efficient public transpiration system, getting around was worry free. There are bus stops in every direction leaving Amy's, able to truck you to Downtown or Mathews Beach within 20 minutes. Of course, our wonderful experience could not have been made possible if not for our very pleasant host Amy. Prior to and upon arrival she was in consistent communication with us. Updating us on early checkin availability, and helping us begin our public transit journey with directions on how to get from the airport to her place. We met Amy just after brunch and during our walk from the bus stop she filled us in on the things to know about our new neighborhood. The introduction to our digs for the next 5 days began with Amy encouraging us to make ourselves at home, enjoy the food and beverages inside the fridge, and if anything at all was needed not to hesitate in contacting her. After handing us the keys and saying ""cheers"" we did not see Amy again, though her words rang loud as we did enjoy everything her place had to offer, and contacted her several times with inquiries. And each time Amy was immediate in her responses. 

By not staying at Amy's Sunny Rooftop U District Studio for your next get away to Seattle you will be missing out on an opportunity to be inspired, feel at home, and truly enjoy Seattle as a local. 

The sincerest of appreciation and warmest of thanks, Amy :)

Cheers,
-Alissa and Denny"

15138	3422894	10.0	9.0	17011647	It was a pleasure to stay at at Amy's rooftop apartment near the university. Amy was very accommodating with my check-in time and communicating with her was easy. The place is as advertised, cozy and well situated for getting around  Seattle. I would most certainly stay here again. 
15139	3422894	10.0	9.0	17124410	Amy was a great host, very easy to get in touch with and quick to communicate. The place is very clean, comfy, and quiet, exactly as the pictures show. Seattle is an amazing city and I highly recommend staying at Amy's spot!
15140	3422894	10.0	9.0	17234257	Amy was very easy to work with, she was in touch before the trip and everything was great. The apartment was awesome, and in a great location for going out and walking campus bars and food spots. The place was very clean and had good wireless internet. Anyone looking to stay near campus in Seattle should consider staying here.
15141	3422894	10.0	9.0	17319086	Charming, light-filled studio apartment in U district.  Amy met us promptly and was a lovely host. It's worth noting that the neighborhood becomes very noisy on a Friday night. 
15142	3422894	10.0	9.0	17468367	such a cute place, loved staying at Amy's place.
15143	3422894	10.0	9.0	17790628	I had a really good experience in Amy's studio. It is just what the photos look like. Necessities for living are provided. 
15144	3422894	10.0	9.0	18075383	Great apartment in a fun neighborhood near UWashington campus. The apartment is sunny and relaxing, and has a great balcony area. Overall we couldn't think of a better experience staying in Seattle. Amy is very accommodating and kind, even when I didn't make it to check-in on time. She was very helpful in making sure our needs were met. Thanks!
15145	3422894	10.0	9.0	18187689	Amy was easy to coordinate our stay with.  The space is conveniently located near restaurants and coffee shops in U District.   
15146	3422894	10.0	9.0	18289593	"Lovely apartment, very comfortable, walking distance to Musashi's!
will definitely visit again."
15147	3422894	10.0	9.0	18486771	Amy was a great host. She was welcoming, flexible, and very communicative. Her place is very cozy and unique, which helped make my stay in the U District even better!
15148	3422894	10.0	9.0	18672357	I had a fantastic experience staying at Amy's place. It's adorably charming with fresh tomatoes on the vine and perfectly riped pears for her guests. She was flexibile and accommodating with us for pickup and departure. The place looks exactly like the pictures. Thanks Amy! 
17658	443580	9.0	9.0	1433950	Monika's a nice and friendly host and is always willing to help! Her place is peaceful and quiet, pretty near to the city as well. 
17659	443580	9.0	9.0	1440786	I didn't get to meet Monika, as we checked in late. That said our overall experience was great. She made checking in easy for us, even though we reserved last minute. The space was nice and artfully done. There was a shared kitchen, bathroom and laundry. Everything was clean and ready for us. With the other airbnb-ers there it almost felt more like a hostel experience, which was fun. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. There's no question that this was a great deal! 
17660	443580	9.0	9.0	1456647	"My stay at Monika's was absolutely lovely, and I highly recommend to anyone travelling to Seattle to stay here!
Monika is a super sweet host who made sure we were very well taken care of, and gave us lots of information on how to travel around the city.
The accomodations were great, the comfiest bed I've ever had with AirBnB (especially considering last time I slept on a communal floor), the room was incredibly clean and the amenities were too - claw foot tub, anyone?
A very quick and easy bus ride away from city, there's no reason why not to book this place :)"
17661	443580	9.0	9.0	1491834	This place is pretty great. The location is really good and the bed was really comfortable. There were other people staying there too and we became good friends. So if you want to mingle with other airbnbers then this is a good place. The host wasn't really there much because she lives upstairs but she was responsive with text messages if you need any help and she left lots of instructions and tips to make your stay easier. The buses were sometimes few and far between but that is my ONLY complaint. We probably just had bad timing though. I would recommend staying here!
17662	443580	9.0	9.0	1500319	Monika's place was just as advertised.  We never actually met, as I came in late from a Mariners game, but she was very prompt in communicating with me and I enjoyed the house.  The other guests in the house were very friendly.  Also, if you are staying on the weekend, there is a lot of parking that does NOT have a 2 hour limit, which is excellent!
17663	443580	9.0	9.0	1578726	Monica's little cabin was clean, quiet and private, and the linens provided were clean and comfortable (so was the bathroom). The area was mostly residential which was great for anyone who was looking to be just outside the city buzz, but it was close enough to Capital Hill's busier areas that you can have the best of both worlds(you're about a 10-15 minute walk away). As for Monica, she really knows how to handle things professionally, making the whole experience an easy one. If you're looking for an inexpensive private lodging in Seattle, I recommend her cabin. 
17664	443580	9.0	9.0	1598164	This was my first time booking through airbnb.com and I could not be happier with the outcome!! Monika's cabin was the perfect fit for me and my traveling companion. The neigborhood is quiet, conveniently located close to pubic transit and walking distance to Capitol Hill which is a big plus for me. The property itself is charming with fruit trees, flowers and a cute little garden. The cabin I stayed in was a wonderful place to relax. I found myself in the cabin a lot more often than I expected because it was so clean and comfortable. The main house is also very nice. It was great being able to have such a nice kitchen to use. It saved of food expenses for sure. Having a washer and dryer available to use was also very convenient. Monika is just a sweetheart, very welcoming and kind. Every time I saw her she had a smile on her face. This property has a lot more to offer than just a place to rest your head.
17665	443580	9.0	9.0	1618532	"My girlfriend and I were in a bind and had to unexpectedly stay an extra night in Seattle. We contacted Monika late in the afternoon to stay the night, Monika immediately responded and made all the arrangements, even with the very late notice we had given.

The one room cabin/barn house, was private, clean and quirky. We were given keys to the main house to access the kitchen and bathroom which was also tidy and clean. We loved our stay here and found Monika very easy to communicate with.  Just as an FYI there is a cat living in the main house, my girlfriend is allergic to cats but didn't have any problems as the house was kept clean and fur free. 

In terms of location, the place it located just a 15 minute walk to Capitol Hill, which has loads of great restaurants, bars and shops. On weekends the street parking is free, I believe that there is a 2 hour parking limit M-F. 

Thanks Monika for a great stay. "
17666	443580	9.0	9.0	1623413	"Monika was really nice but the place needs to advertised as it really is: a tuff shed turned into a bed space, not a cabin. The way the description is written makes it sound much nicer than it is! Also I should mention that the sheets were not clean---several hair clumps and smeared yuck on them were not conducive to a clean feeling---and the bed is a futon (also not mentioned in the ad). Finally, the ad said ""Sweet Capitol Hill Cabin"" and it was a long long walk (more like a drive) to Capital Hill so I do not think it is fair to advertise as part of this location, especially for someone that is not familiar with Seattle. "
17667	443580	9.0	9.0	1649112	"First off I must agree with the previous tenant, it's a shed (next to an aluminum shed) not a cabin. The sheets didn't smell or feel clean either, I didn't find any clumps of anything it just didn't feel clean. The ""communal gardens"" are just a few plants in a very unkept yard, with lumps of dirt every where. In the yard you'll find an old metal fire stove with lots of cigarette butts, and a porch littered with junk. In this case the pictures look better than what is actually there. Capital Hill is not very close and if you need something be prepared especially at night there are no close convenience stores. The one thing that made it most intolerable for me was that the wifi almost never worked every morning was spent at Starbucks, luckily I had brought a couple of movies with me. There is one very small window, I'm not sure what the summers are like, but there is no AC so you may bake. This was my first Airbnb experience, it didn't meet my expectations, I would probably not recommend nor stay here again in the near future.
Here's the upside, Monika is very friendly and approachable, the neighborhood is very quiet. The bus stop for those without cars is a block away. Reading Monikas bio she appears to be very entrepreneurial I think with time she can work out the bugs and make this a very ""sweet"" stay."
17668	443580	9.0	9.0	1719224	"This was my first time using Airbnb and I can't imagine having had a better experience! Monica was extremely organized and kept me up to date with my reservation details as my travel date approached. As for the cabin, it was absolutely lovely. Truly, the photos of the cabin and the house do not do them justice. The sheets were clean and soft, and Monica very thoughtfully made up the bed with some lighter coverlets that were more appropriate for the July temperatures. Even though it was a hot weekend, the cabin cooled off nicely in the evening and sleeping temperatures were comfortable even without needing the fan that Monica provided for us. Yes, the cabin is forged from the structure of a garden shed, but the finish of the interior with clean laminate flooring and the window over the bed made it an absolutely cozy, private little space. The hanging rack and dresser made it easy to settle into. Although a previous commenter was not impressed with the yard, I would definitely not say that it's junky, just eclectic. The bathroom was very clean (and nicer than some hotels, I'd say), and even with a few others in the house, I never had to wait for it. For the cost, the location was superb! My travel companion and I brought our own bikes and it was 5 minutes or less to morning coffee at Stumptown on 12th, and 10 to the shops and fun in Capitol Hill. Although we spent most of the day exploring all corners of the city, it was so incredibly nice to know that we could home back in on Capitol Hill, have a nightcap at Linda's or Sun Liquor, and then be home to our cozy cabin in a jiffy. I can't comment on the location from a transit perspective as I did not have to rely on public transportation. While some might prefer more centrality, I personally prefer to escape the noise of the city and this neighbourhood felt quiet and safe, yet was well positioned to get to most districts of interest. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Seattle!
P.S. The kitchen was also spotless and a joy to use. 
P.P.S. The wi-fi worked fine for us. No, you could probably not stream a video from it, but accessing the web and Google Maps for itinerary prep each day was no problem at all."
17669	443580	9.0	9.0	1736661	I just stayed one night at Seattle and it was my first time to use Airbnb to book places to stay. The location is convenient and easy access to downtown Seattle. I felt safe even though I stayed at the cabin. I didn't meet Monika but she was helpful and nice. Overall experience of my stay was good. :)
17670	443580	9.0	9.0	1790070	"Didn't actually meet Monika but she was very efficient in getting in touch when I needed anything. The cabin is actually a nice little shed in the front yard. Lots of people coming and going as the whole house seems to be air bnb. Very close to Capitol Hill, a ten minute walk to the bars etc there. Would visit again. 

"
17671	443580	9.0	9.0	1822629	Very nice place, as we expected, no luxury just simple room for very reasonable price. The only thing I would work on if I were an owner is a  cleanliness of bathroom.  For me, personally no big drama, for my girlfriend.... a little bit an issue.
17672	443580	9.0	9.0	1855161	"I was concerned by the price at first, but it was perfect.  Not a luxury accomodation, it's exactly only what you need.  A nice bed, clean detached room from the house, hanging space, mirror, and a bedside lamp.  At this price, you can't find anything remotely comparable in Seattle.  

I liked it so much I booked another stay already."
17673	443580	9.0	9.0	1900869	We stayed in the cabin for six nights and we were very happy with it, we didn't met Monika and although there were many people staying in the house everything was fine, the cabin was locked and we got to use the shared bathroom and kitchen with the other guests. since it was very hot in Seattle last week it was very nice to be able to hang out in the garden on evenings. I also loved the location, very close to Capitoll Hill were the bars and shops are and just a 10min ride by bus from downtown (some days we'd walk). Would I recommend it? Of course!
17674	443580	9.0	9.0	1934554	I did not meet monika when I visit her house, but I received sufficient and considerate information from her. The rooms is separated considerable and the guests has lots of privacy. The yard in the front of the house is a good place for have breakfast.  
17675	443580	9.0	9.0	2047664	The accommodations were great!  Simple, convenient, and comfortable - just what I was looking for.  It's really more like a detached room right next to the house.  It's very clean.  The wifi worked well, there's a Starbucks very close by with free wifi, and the bus routes to downtown are across the street.  There was a chest of drawers, a night light, couple of side tables, place to hang clothes, and an electric fan and heater.  There is one window behind the bed which let in enough light.
17676	443580	9.0	9.0	2206754	"Monika's space was clean, orderly, private and simple. Very conveniently situated to the downtown core on a bus route and about an 8 block walk to Trader Joes for grocery shopping. It was absolutely perfect for my requirements.

Monika was clear with her communication via email and welcoming towards this first time airbnb user. "
17677	443580	9.0	9.0	2282655	The cabin at the Cherry Hill House is a great alternative accommodation. Very affordable, clean, and safe. Monika was easy to correspond with and helpful during our stay. The house has many renters, making it feel a bit like a European-style hostel. I would stay there again! 
17678	443580	9.0	9.0	2362655	"I stayed at the cabin for 10 days, which was actually quite a long stay. I came from the Greyhound terminal, from which the place is easily accessible by bus. I didn't get to meet Monika for the first few days, but she really made sure I settled in well (by email and SMS). The place was perfectly arranged!

The cabin has plenty of room to put all your stuff in. Ventilation can be a problem, but good thing the room's equipped with a fan. Since I was staying for quite long I had to provide my own plastic lining for the trash bin. The bathroom was clean and cozy. You can place your toiletries on the shelf in front of the shower, which was awesome so there's no need to bring them in each time.

Some tips: (1) Beware of the yellow cat at night, not because they're fierce or whatever but because you might trip on them in the dark (in the main house). The white cat is very friendly and followed me around, but has a tendency to want to go inside the cabin. (2) Remember to pay $2 for laundry - there's a laundry jar next to the washing machine! (3) The lights in the main house are controlled by a remote control which is on the table (I didn't know this at first so I worked in a dark kitchen for the first few days!) (4) Check under the bed for dust especially if you're allergic - there might be a few dustballs missed out during cleaning.

All in all, it was an awesome stay. Thanks Monika!"
17679	443580	9.0	9.0	2412431	Didn't meet Monika, but she was great in terms of responding to emails/messages right away. The place was just fine for what you pay for, nothing fancy but very welcoming, clean and cheap. It's basically just like staying at a hostel, except it's house of beds/rooms and outside cabin. Everyone shares the same bathroom & kitchen and eveyone respects house rules. I wouldn't recommend to anyone that isn't down for hostel living. Very close to downtown and within minutes from bars and restaurants. Parking is available across the street, but there is a 2-hour limit from 8-6 except on Sundays. We were out and about pretty much those hours and had no issues with parking.
17680	443580	9.0	9.0	2453677	Monika is truly a beautiful, kind, giving soul.  Her little cabin reflects her love for travel and travelers. I only regret that I didn't stay longer.  The cabin was clean and quiet.  It made a perfect getaway.  I had full access to the kitchen and bathroom in the main house which was very convenient.  I was invited to use the wash and dryer and pick things from the garden.  I will definitely be back!
17681	443580	9.0	9.0	2471790	"This was my second time staying at the Cherry Hill House and I enjoyed it nearly as much as the first time. The Sweet Cabin is adorable, private, secure, and comfortable. The only draw back is that the bed is a mildly uncomfortable futon. Monika is insanely well organized and runs the house like a professional. Every room in the house is spotless and clear of clutter but comfortable. The location of the house is perfect for walking or taking the bus anywhere you feel like wandering to. 
Thanks again Monika, our stay was spectacular."
17682	443580	9.0	9.0	2492406	I took a spontaneous solo trip to Seattle and  had a great stay at Monika's cabin.  It was clean, cozy, and private.  There were 4 other guests sharing the common area but everybody was super nice and friendly!  I borrowed one of her bikes to check out the area and she was great about giving me suggestions and directions.  Monika takes a hands-off approach at the house but she's easy to reach by phone or email.  I would definitely stay with Monika again.  
17683	443580	9.0	9.0	2501101	This was fantastic value for money. The location provides good accessibility to downtown and the atmosphere is trust-based and collegial. Mine was a quick stay but a real pleasure. Many thanks to Monika!
17684	443580	9.0	9.0	2517502	"I stayed in the cabin for two nights and it was a very good experience. The cabin is nice and simple and very clean and has enough room to move around (the futon is a bit tired though but for a couple of nights it does the job).
I did not meet Monika during my short stay but I met the other airbnb guests in the house. Monika's instructions were very clear so I had no problems getting to the place and having my way around there.
The kitchen and bathroom are both very clean as well (which for me is very important).
The place is very well situated (just a few bus stops from downtown - 10 minutes).
I would definitely recommend this place. 
"
17685	443580	9.0	9.0	2576186	I had an easy time locating the house.  It was really close to the bus stop.  It was a comfortable stay and so close to where I needed to go the next morning.  I really enjoyed my stay. 
17686	443580	9.0	9.0	2594863	We stayed at Monika's place for two nights. Rates are cheap, the cabin was quiet and clean and even though we didn't see Monika she was really helpfull and answered our emails quickly. The only problems was that for two people, the bed wasn't very confortable (I had a backache so perhaps it didn't help), and the house is kind of crowded - no living room and really small kitchen. The cabin can be a little cold too, the heater is really small. 
17687	443580	9.0	9.0	2711328	Great cabin! You have the ambiance of the countryside in the heart of urbana. The gardens will greatly enhance your stay,with a patio in progress for the front yard. Monika's style is reflective throughout the premises. Great decor for a homelike hostel w iron,wood throughout. Excellent organization regarding house expectations, Seattle transport options. Location is excellent and within several blocks have ethnic restaurants(Ethiopian, Hatian) Close to Seattle Univer. I lived in Seattle and in the early 90's never would have envisioned the positive transformation Minor neighborhood has undergone. Did not meet Monika but had excellent communication w her.   Awesome front yard for barbeques and socilizing!
17688	443580	9.0	9.0	2738561	nice, clean, quite.beautiful neighbourhood.very convenient to downtown. a little bit cold on my first night stay, but realized in the morning that I didn't fully closed the window behind the curtain. Also the owner gave me more blanket later and the temperature hasn't been a problem.
17689	443580	9.0	9.0	2801570	"The idea behind this cabin is really great  however the bed is a futon and really hard, didn't work well for 40 something year olds.  Woke up stiff and sore both mornings. It also had ants in one corner.  The purpose of choosing this location was to save money on accomodations so we could enjoy more of Seattle, we accomplished this but learned a lesson that comfort is worth some extra pennies.

I don't really have anything to say about the people who run this as I never saw them.  Our only contact was with another person renting a room in the house."
17690	443580	9.0	9.0	2837031	Monika  was very flexible to let me stay for just one night on such short notice, which was very convenient.  The house is well managed and tidy, the location great for getting around the city.  I will say it took a long time for the tiny heater to get the cabin warm enough.  The bed was fine for just me, but for a couple you would be rolling into the middle.  I met her, she is warm and friendly and she commented that she would be getting a new bed.
17691	443580	9.0	9.0	2893530	Great stay again! New heater was on and the cabin was toasty when I arrived-thanks to Monika. If you stay here during the rainy months, it will be warm. The cabin is really unique and the setting helps create an rural ambiance in surrounding urban settings. I am a large man and found that the cabin is quite adequate for me. The wifi is excellent and inside the house-always accessible w keys is clean and well organized. Sweet Cabin is perfect respite after a busy day is Seattle.
17692	443580	9.0	9.0	2895931	"You get what you pay for! Being that my stay here was only $35, I wasn't expecing much. The cabin is very bare minimum but was extremely cold and had a funky smell. There is a small heater in the room, but it took a long time to warm up and never really got the room heated. 

The sheets were clean but there was a strange BO smell in the pillows, so I ended up  using my sweatshirt. I am very low maintenance, so overall the experience was OK, but it would have been nice to at least have a warm room and a smell free bed. 
I probably would not stay here again, and just shell out some extra bucks to have a comfortable place."
17693	443580	9.0	9.0	2994243	Great place to stay in the heart of Seattle. Everything was set up nicely and the people were enjoyable to spend an evening with. 
17694	443580	9.0	9.0	3032735	For the price this would probably be an adequate place to stay in the Summer, though would not recommend for the colder months. The location is great with a bus to the city just down the road, but the cabin itself is unbelievably cold and only supplied with a tiny hardly-functioning heater. There were 7 people staying whilst we were there, all sharing a single bathroom and kitchen - and the kitchen only had one chair so there wasn't really anywhere warm to chill out when it was raining outside unless you sat on the kitchen floor... though I only met Monika once she was friendly and left detailed instructions on how to get to the location etc. Overall, probably too many tenants for it to be a comfortable stay and was comparable to staying at a hostel without many amenities.
17695	443580	9.0	9.0	3038626	We unknowingly arrived a few hours before check in time but were welcomed nonetheless. The only problem with the room was that it was extremely cold. There was a small heater in the room (which with much appreciation was turned on to warm the room while we were out), but it seemed to have been broken. With the blankets it was warm enough for the two of us overnight, though getting up in the morning was difficult! Beyond that little mistake, great place.
17696	443580	9.0	9.0	3059770	"Great location on a quiet street, within easy walking distance of downtown and other areas, or just be lazy and take the bus stop a block away.
Monika wasn't around when I was there, but she provided detailed information and useful tips and links beforehand.
An excellent price for a friendly, shared house (although I went for the separate cabin in the garden)"
17697	443580	9.0	9.0	3316295	Super, la situation excellente, le quartier sympa, facile d'acc칟s au Downtown de Seattle, Monika tr칟s sympathique et marrante, la cabine et la maison tr칟s agr칠able, lieu propre et la colcatrice tr칟s sympa aussi. J'ai pass칠 un tr칟s bon s칠jour. Doc sur seattle  disposition, explication tr칟s claire quant au fonctionnement de la maison. J'y retournerai.
17698	443580	9.0	9.0	3330639	We had a nice stay at Cherry Tree house. The cabin is as described - the heater isn't great for the winter months but the room soon warmed up in the evenings. As mentioned in previous posts the property is similiar to a hostel in that there are a number of people sharing the one bathroom, so at times this was a bit tricky but overall not a huge problem for us given we only stayed for 3 nights. The location is fantastic the 3 and 4 buses take you right into downtown in no time at all and even to the Space Needle if this is on your list of places to visit in Seattle.
17699	443580	9.0	9.0	4754022	The property is charming and funky and seems like a very good deal for the convenience of the area.  It was a little cold when we were in Seattle and a slight inconvenience to have to go outside of the cabin, walk outside into the main house to use the bathroom there.  The people who live/stay in the main house were very friendly and welcoming.  Overall it was a very pleasant, easygoing experience.
17700	443580	9.0	9.0	5123529	Loved the set up, a great reprieve from the road. Didn't get to meet Monika but Erinn was very nice and helpful
17701	443580	9.0	9.0	5132362	We had a fantastic stay at the cabin, and a fun time exploring the local area.  The cabin was very clean and charming.  The location was great and very walkable.  This is a great option if you want a clean, comfortable room, with a great location and are on a budget.  
17702	443580	9.0	9.0	5460537	my son was the guest, and so I'm reporting his story.  the cabin was great, private, quiet, clean.  convenient to public transportation.
17703	443580	9.0	9.0	5520479	I needed a place in a pinch and Monika's space was ideal! It's the perfect no fuss room for a lone traveler.
17704	443580	9.0	9.0	5607781	Great location! We rode our bikes all around Seattle and didn't feel the need for a car at all. The only downside was there were quite a few people staying at the house and the bathroom seemed to be continually occupied especially late at night and in the morning.
17705	443580	9.0	9.0	5664046	We stayed in the cabin in July and had everything we needed to be comfortable. The cabin and bed were big enough for the two of us and sharing the bathroom with other house mates wasn't a problem. We never saw Monica, but she left detailed instructions about the house and gave us the opportunity to use the kitchen, dishes and fridge space. The house was right across the street from the bus stop and close enough to a Trader Joes to walk to. This was a great place for our first airbnb visit!
17706	443580	9.0	9.0	5709137	Great and cousy little cabin, pefect for a one night stay
17707	443580	9.0	9.0	6008335	"I enjoyed my stay at Monika's Cabin in Cherry Hill.  She made check-in very easy, and provided a lot of great instructions for getting there.  The bed in the cabin was comfortable, and I appreciated the good water pressure and very hot water in the shower.  I would definitely stay here again, and can recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle on a budget.

This is a great place to stay if you are looking for a value, but understand that there are tradeoffs that come with the low nightly rate.  There is only one bathroom in the main house, and I had to wait almost an hour one night just to brush my teeth and use the bathroom before going to bed.  The same thing happened before I left, and was not able to wait.  Not every guest respected the ""quick shower"" rule.  If there was just a room with a second toilet it would solve my only real issue with my stay."
17708	443580	9.0	9.0	6049452	This cute little shed was a good place to crash while visiting friends nearby in Seattle.  Wished the other guests had not been using the campfire outside while we were trying to sleep, but other than that we had a very nice stay and would recommend the place.
17709	443580	9.0	9.0	6178577	"All went smoothly, overall.  
Only difficulty was VERY spotty Internet.
Saw other guests more than any hosts, but the other guests were all very nice.  "
17710	443580	9.0	9.0	6320174	"The cabin was a nice and cute stay! Especially when uou're newly weds!
The neighboorhood is in between, when you're going downtown you're okay.
Monica and Erinn are nice and lovely girls, didn't saw them often but when we had the chance they were willing to tell and explain a lot."
17711	443580	9.0	9.0	6429258	My partner and I stayed in the Sweet Cabin at Monika's place. All facilities were great. There was not a lot of communication with Monika, however she provides you with a VERY detailed house manual prior to your arrival - which is sufficient. I would recommend this accommodation. 
17712	443580	9.0	9.0	6488905	"Great deal, but cabin is not as private as I hoped. It sits in front yard near the sidewalk & road, so it feels exposed. Also back small window near bed is not protected except for bushes around it, so didn't feel completely safe. Just know what you're paying for.

Also, place is entirely self-serve, so be aware. However, Monika & Erinn are very responsive and can give assistance if needed. Easy walk to Capitol Hill!"
17713	443580	9.0	9.0	6527290	"We had to find a place for 1 night stay in Seattle, and Monika was very nice to reply to our request early with complete, detailed instructions as in how to get to the house and how everything works. There are other people sharing the main house, so we see them all the time when using kitchen and bathroom. The cabin we stayed in was very hot in late afternoon in the summer, but there's a fan there to cool it down a little bit. It's hard to get wifi from the cabin after around 10 o'clock, but we only stayed there for 1 day so it was not a problem at all. 

There's a bus stop only 1 block away, and it takes around 15-20 mins to go downtown. China town is in walking distance (around 20 mins walking), which is very convenient if you need grocery and instant noodles. 

In general we had a good experience staying there this summer. :) "
17714	443580	9.0	9.0	6735895	"The garden cottage was very small but reasonably clean. The bathroom in the house was shared with quite many people, it's a busy house! Checkin went smooth, even though Monica herself was not present during our stay. 

The house is located at a ten/fifteen minute walk to bars and restaurants, which isn't so bad. The bikes were unfortunately not available at the time. "
17715	443580	9.0	9.0	6762134	The cabin suited our needs. We didn't have the opportunity to meet Monika but Erin was helpful and answered any questions we had.
17716	443580	9.0	9.0	7038860	Sweet cabin, close to down town and easy to get to/from airport. We enjoyed our stay! Be aware that when house is fully occupied you are sharing a bathroom with up to 5 other people.
17717	443580	9.0	9.0	7115260	"This Airbnb experience was more of a backpackers hostel than charming Airbnb. 
At one stage there was something like 8 people staying here, all sharing the one toilet and bathroom! There was a line to shower at 7am!!
The cabin we stayed in was private but beware of the room selection when choosing your accommodation. One room in particular is separated from the kitchen/ dining by a sheer curtain, open to all passing noise and light. 
The location itself is not that close to downtown either and it's a fair hike to get groceries, etc. 
Personally, I would spend my pennies on staying at an Airbnb where you are not just another number, as was the feeling we had here. On the plus side, the other guests were really lovely."
17718	443580	9.0	9.0	7181755	"This was my first AirBNB experience, an experience for which I had high hopes. After a very special night in Seattle for my brother's wedding, I came to Monika's ""Sweet Cabin"" where I was not greeted by key waiting for me as promised. After checking the door to see if it was unlocked as also instructed, an upset guest came out asking why I was trying to get in her room at 2AM. This was all very confusing considering I had made very specific arrangements with Monika a few days prior for my late night arrival. 

After contacting with Monika, she claimed that AirBNB double booked the room and that I needed to call them to sort it out. She claimed ""it has happened to several guests I've seen over the last 12-14 months."" 

It was very disappointing that she took zero responsibility for letting another guest stay in the room that I had booked a full week in advance, including having a number of correspondences with her as to when I would be arriving.

After 2 hours of trying to fix a giant mess of an issue that I had no responsibility of causing, I stayed at a Holiday Inn. AirBnB took charge for the mishap and refunded me fully. 

At the end of my correspondence with Monika, she told me to ""Go f**k yourself. You are banned from my house."" I was perfectly cordial throughout the ordeal leading up to this moment, so you would image I felt completely blind-sighted by this.

I would not support this person who claims to be a stellar host and small business owner. An ounce of remorse would have gone a long way during this entire situation, but instead I got a giant F U. Thanks Monika!"
17719	443580	9.0	9.0	7183478	Great place. Erinn was great and it was an easy process. Place was a little dirty but apart from that it was absolutely great. Downside was it double booked and we had strangers banging on the door and trying to barge into the place, almost gave us a heart attack.
17720	443580	9.0	9.0	7367021	My fianc칠 and I stayed the the cottage when we went to a NFL game at century link field. Staying in the cottage was perfect, only 2 miles from the stadium. The cottage was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Monica was very nice and helpful. I would stay there again:) 
17721	443580	9.0	9.0	7436101	Quiet, comfortable, and very easy!

17727	443580	9.0	9.0	7616665	La habitaci칩n es agradable y calentita con el radiador. Buena zona. Hay un manual para el cliente con demasiadas normas y reglas.  Ojo, te cobran por usar la lavadora.
17728	443580	9.0	9.0	7699526	This place is exactly what you would expect for the price. It's a great place to rest your head at night, but I would pretty much just leave it at that. If you will be spending the bulk of your time out and about and want to save on accommodations, this is a good option for you. If you want a cozy place to hang out, I would maybe consider shilling out some additional dubloons and upgrading to something swankier. 
17729	443580	9.0	9.0	7742144	Great location only a 10 min walk from the bars on capital hill/pike st. You can walk into town in half an hour if needed.  The neighbourhood is nice and safe.  The cabin was functional and tidy.  Not a fluffy airbnb experience but at the price it can't be beat.  
17730	443580	9.0	9.0	10233508	Cute little cabin - just a bedroom. Basic place to sleep, but nice to access kitchen/bathroom/etc in the main house. Had a little trouble with the wifi, so wasn't able to work ... glad that I brought a good book to read! Neighborhood is so very convenient to hospital and bus lines.
17731	443580	9.0	9.0	10517525	"The Sweet Cabin is a cute space with a bed and heater, perfect for visiting Seattle when you spend most of the day out. The area is great-- close to all the main bus stops and just a short ride away from downtown Seattle and University of Washington. 

My friend and I spent our three days in Pike Place Market (Great Wheel and Pike Place Chowder), University of Washington, and a student-friendly cafe called Ugly Mug Cafe (studying, of course-- what else would you do on vacation). The place was great for a chill getaway and had a home-y feel overall. "
17732	443580	9.0	9.0	10787868	Nice little warm comfortable cabin sleeping space on a cold rainy Seattle night! Main house just steps away, really nice people greeted me and chatted.  This place is just excellent
17733	443580	9.0	9.0	10934600	Great little room for an overnight stay, very conveniently located. Didn't have a chance to meet the host but she is so well organized and set-up it was a very smooth experience.
17734	443580	9.0	9.0	11029009	We had a great weekend in Seattle, that includes of course the Sweet Cabin, the place was warm, clean, and cozy, and we can definitely recommend this to others. The main house is right beside the cabin and the cat is wonderful. Thanks for all, Monika.
17735	443580	9.0	9.0	11275783	Thank youth!
17736	443580	9.0	9.0	11525757	The Cabin is very nice and the facilities are very accessible. Monika is a prompt and helpful host.
17737	443580	9.0	9.0	12083540	Second stay in the cabin, and still all good and clean. The place is very convenient for a weekend stay in Seattle when you spend most time going round town.
17738	443580	9.0	9.0	13620994	We stayed in the sweet cabin and it was lovely. Monika was out of town during our stay, but her roommate Erin was so nice and accommodating. Definitely getting your money's worth here. 
17739	443580	9.0	9.0	49692749	"The ""cabin"" is essentially one of those large sheds you can buy at home depot that a bed was tossed in. There was one lamp with no light bulb and two bulbs were burnt out in the ceiling. There is a space heater but when you turn it on it gets extremely stuffy and smells metallicy. So we opened the small window which doesn't have a screen which explains why we found a bug in the bed. The yard is super messy and the front gate is broken, so its wide open and you feel kind of exposed to the busy street when your sleeping in a shed. Also you dont get wifi out in the shed. Getting up to pee in the middle of the night was tricky. By 2 am, one of those huge northwest spiders built a web in our door frame that my girlfriend almost ran face first into (I understand this isnt the hosts fault and just bad luck) then you have to search around for the code to get into the house. In all honesty I felt like I was back in Thailand backpacking in a hostel. I never met the host as we got there late, but they were very friendly in the email they sent and made sure we were informed about places to go and public transportation options.  The house is very close to downtown which is great. The place could be a very nice stay if the host put just a little more effort in to making it more comfortable and clean. We felt it was way to expensive for what we received."
17740	443580	9.0	9.0	49863881	Everything was awesome, thanks 
17741	443580	9.0	9.0	50028540	My partner and I had a lovely stay at Monika's. The directions to the house and instructions for our stay were very thorough. This house has a few different air bnb rooms I believe and we stayed in the cute, little cabin in the front of the house. The bed was VERY comfortable and the shower in the maine house was great. Thanks for a nice stay!
17742	443580	9.0	9.0	50126271	Our stay was perfect.  It was nice to have our own private space in a nice, quaint cabin that was separate from the rest of the house. Monika and Ryan were super nice and helpful. They made our stay super easy and convenient. Plus the location was great.  We would definitely stay here again. 
17743	443580	9.0	9.0	51306533	"The listing was fairly accurate. The pictures made me feel like it would be a little nicer. All in all we were looking for the cheapest stay that was close to the city, and that is what we got. 
It would have been nice to meet the host and feel like there was a game plan. We kind of felt like strangers there. We weren't very aquainted with the set up for our stay. Fortunately the email to prepare brought up all the essentials. "
17744	443580	9.0	9.0	51465024	"We only stayed one night, so was quick to judge.
However, I can say that the location is good, in a quiet area, but not far from the busy downtown.
Near by a nice movie theatre is playing old movies while you take dinner, and the famous Public Market is at 10min bus ride...

The house is cute, but we stayed in the cabin, that is a bit humid during the night... for a short stay it was ok. Maybe in summer it's better and you can enjoy the garden.

Otherwise Monika gave us all the informations we needed and was easy and quick to answer if any questions!

Thanks Monika."
17745	443580	9.0	9.0	51594083	The cabin was very clean and comfortable. The location is ideal for walking to a lot of places in Capitol Hill. We got back to the cabin pretty late at night so I didn't get a chance to meet our hosts, but I would definitely stay here again.
17746	443580	9.0	9.0	51743349	Everything was just as described. It was simple and comfortable, which was all I needed. It is a single-room structure, furnished with a bed, bedside table, garment rack, set of drawers, and space heater. The cabin is about the size of a very large shed, but insulated and outfitted on the inside like a home. Pretty cool! The bathroom is in the main-house about 10 feet away, and easy access was provided with a code to that door. I actually arrive very late, 11pm and left at 10am the next morning. Monika made check-in and check-out so easy such that I actually didn't meet her. Everything was arranged for me and I had an easy and comfortable place to sleep for the night which was just what I needed.
17747	443580	9.0	9.0	51935936	"Great stay in the cabin. It took me a while to get used to the locks, but it wasn't too big of a deal. Very simplistic and had everything I needed.  I didn't get to meet Monika or Ryan, but my friend did, and said that he was really nice. We interacted with some of the guests, who were all really nice and interesting people. The only downside is that the bathtub was a little scary for me to get out of because it was so tall and high (I'm 5'1"") but still had a positive experience overall! They even have a space heater in the cabin, which is great since it gets chilly in there! "
17748	443580	9.0	9.0	52933835	The cabin was exactly what I expected and easier to access than I thought. Thanks for a quick and stress free stay Monika!
17749	443580	9.0	9.0	53021380	Perfect place for a quick overnighter!  Met with Ryan the House Manager, pleasant and helpful.  Plenty of hot water for a shower and the bed was quite comfy and the room cozy and warm.  Will return!
17750	443580	9.0	9.0	53251226	It's a lovely cabin, the neighborhood is nice, pretty close to anything you might need and extremely comfortable :)
17751	443580	9.0	9.0	53475188	Simple yet cozy cabin in a nice neighborhood within walking distance of a lot of what Seattle has to offer! Everything was nicely arranged and Ryan was home most of the time to answer any questions one might have. Only downside was that it was raining pretty much constantly (but I guess that's what Seattle is like in November). 
17752	443580	9.0	9.0	54582940	Definitely a cozy space to sleep after a long day of exploring Seattle.
17753	443580	9.0	9.0	54732729	"Barebones and basic (a bed in a shed), but clean and affordable.  A bit of a funky smell (tho I am hyper-sensitive).  I ran into Ryan a couple of times and he is super nice.  The ""sweet cabin"" served my purpose well for an overnighter for an event at The Town Hall, which is within walking distance.  Not a lot of charm but perfectly adequate and a good choice for the price."
17754	443580	9.0	9.0	55547866	The cabin was perfect for my needs. It was quiet and private and as an overnight guest I felt totally at home. When I arrived the cabin was heated and had fresh towels and extra warm blankets on the bed which kept me cozy. I also had a nice long 10 hour sleep because of the curtains which blocked off almost all the light and the bed was REALLY comfortable. Street parking was available right outside and you're pretty much near all the best shops and restaurants in the Capitol Hill area (my fave!). No other guests were staying at the big house so it was nice to have the kitchen and and bathroom to myself, and everything was super clean. As far as showering - the claw foot bathtub was a nice experience. Overall, would highly recommend. 
17755	443580	9.0	9.0	55813367	The cabin and bed were clean and toasty. We had a good night's sleep and the neighbourhood was quiet. Too bad there was heavy construction work on the way to the cabin from downtown core.  Unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to meet Monika. It's pretty much a self-serve BnB with all the amenities and written guide provided for independent travellers.
17756	443580	9.0	9.0	56903724	Perfect house!! Monika wasn't there when we arrived.But we met Ryan. Ryan is super nice!!!! He took good care of everything. The room is really cozy and clean. The location is good too. 2mins walk to bus stop. 3/4 take you to downtown in 20mins or so.  Perfect house, perfect host, perfect location, reasonable price. Really recommend!!!
21752	4061207	10.0	9.0	49026581	Lang extended our stay for a couple days and it was just as good as the first half. Definitely recommend this home. Very cozy, nice and large !
21753	4061207	10.0	9.0	49298548	"My wife and I just moved to Seattle and we needed a comfortable place to come home to after looking for homes. This place was incredible. Very warm, cozy and inviting. It's a HUGE house and the price is great for what you get. We enjoyed the backyard with the tables and the garden as well as coming home to some cool Bengal cats hanging out on the front porch ! The TV area is inviting, and the main living room was good for just relaxing. We walked to Capitol Hill almost every day (30 min walk) and the neighborhood is quite friendly. 

Lang was really receptive to any questions we had, and left no questions un answered in his house manual, he even extended our stay a couple days and removed the secondary cleaning fee for us. 

My only gripe with the place is that we didn't get to stay longer ! Seriously. Thanks Langdon and co. that was fun.

Michael"

21932	7664565	10.0	9.0	41301088	Nice apartment in a quiet area of town about a 30 minute walk to downtown. Brand new mattress and private bathroom. Host was accommodating, friendly and kind. Offered me juice and coffee. Great experience.
21933	7664565	10.0	9.0	41553401	Kumail was a great host. He was very flexible with our arrival/departure time--even met with us at his work to get us keys to the apartment. The apartment is very nice; the room is as pictured. The bed was very comfortable with nice sheets and a nice attached bathroom. We slept like babies and were very grateful for such a convenient and affordable place to stay. Would definitely book again!
21934	7664565	10.0	9.0	41558191	"I traveled to Seattle for a job interview and stayed with Kumail for one night. This was one of the best places I have stayed at on AIRBNB. From the outset Kumail was very helpful, allowing me to check in early and also storing my luggage in his office.

His apartment is new and it is quiet as well as clean. You get a room with a comfortable mattress and bathroom to yourself. Though he is in the process of acquiring furniture, I liked the simplicity of the place, and I didn't feel like the place was lacking. 

The apartment is only a couple miles from downtown Seattle and therefore easily accessible.

Kumail was an excellent host, he provided everything I needed. He is also very easygoing and amiable. Being relatively new to Seattle, Kumail was open to exploring the city. We had many interesting conversations and we even went to eat. I will definitely stay here again when I go back to Seattle. I would recommend Kumail's place to anyone who is looking for a comfortable place to stay in the city. "
21935	7664565	10.0	9.0	41884552	"The host was very welcoming, and extremely accommodating despite us changing arrival times throughout the day. A pleasant, safe and modern neighbourhood, allowing easy access to downtown Seattle. 

The room was comfortable and Kumail was very friendly while allowing us any privacy we needed. 

Excellent choice, would stay again."
21936	7664565	10.0	9.0	42102291	Great place 15 minutes from downtown. Kumail is a perfect host fun to talk to and has a nice clean apartment 
21937	7664565	10.0	9.0	42343672	The listing was spot on, the location was great with easy navigation by bus to downtown. There was lots of street parking available and the area was quiet in the evening. The rooftop gave great views of the cityscape at night/sunset. Kumail was a great host! Very accommodating and easy to talk to. 
21938	7664565	10.0	9.0	42502742	Kumail was kind enough to accommodate me last minute. He's a very welcoming host. The apartment is very clean and comfortable as described. You won't be disappointed! 
21939	7664565	10.0	9.0	42779947	Great flat, lovely owner!
21940	7664565	10.0	9.0	42984973	I had a really nice stay at Kumail's apartment. The place was very clean. Although Kumail could not be there he took care of all our arrangements before hand and provided very clear instructions on how to enter the building and where to find everything. 
21941	7664565	10.0	9.0	43838574	My stay with Kumail in a private room in his apartment was great. He was *very* communicative and also very flexible about making arrangements for my arrival. The room and bathroom were very clean. And Kumail is a really nice guy. Highly recommended!
21942	7664565	10.0	9.0	48628174	"I was in Seattle for a long weekend to join my partner on his business trip. We stayed at Kumail's apartment for a night and everything  could not have been more perfect and convenient. The location is a little more than a mile from downtown. You can easily walk if you want to get to know the international district and explore the city. We used the bus once to get there from the International District train, but used Uber and walked the rest of the time. 

Kumail was friendly and easy to work with from the second I submitted my interest in the apartment. He was communicative, sent a very thorough and helpful email the night before our stay, and was overall an incredibly warm and welcoming person. His place is immaculate, the bed is comfortable, and we were also allowed to use the kitchen as we needed. 

For the price and quality of our stay, I'd recommend this listing over and over again for anyone looking to enjoy Seattle. You're not in the middle of everything, but it's still really convenient and you don't have to spend an arm and a leg. 

Thank you so much for your hospitality and opening up your home to us. "
21943	7664565	10.0	9.0	48962538	New apartment with comfortable bed and very nice private bath.  Kumail was extremely flexible and responsive. Easy street parking. On the edge of the international district so might feel sketchy if alone very late at night, but no complaints for normal activities.
21944	7664565	10.0	9.0	49408694	Kumail was at work when I arrived at his apartment, but I was given very detailed and helpful instructions on how to get in. The room itself is spacious, tidy and clean, as is the bathroom - when I first walked in I felt a little bit like I was in a hotel! The bed was really comfortable and extra blankets were provided. Kumail was extremely communicative throughout the day, and when we finally met, we had a lovely conversation about life and family. The neighbourhood is quiet (but not in a bad way), the bus stop to downtown Seattle is a short walk from the doorstep, and once you're on one, it only takes about 20-25 minutes to get to the major tourist attractions. For Kumail's friendliness, the price, the location and the comfort, I would definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!
21945	7664565	10.0	9.0	49692626	It was my first experience with BnB and was great thanks to the great host. He did his best to make us feel comfortable and safe. The apartment was exactly the same as he posted and accomodated with all necessary items needed. We had a great time staying in his apartment. 
21946	7664565	10.0	9.0	49866973	Kumail was very pleasant and accommodating. It was very easy for us to get in to drop off our stuff and explore Seattle even though he was at work.
21947	7664565	10.0	9.0	50420966	Wonderful experience as a guest of Kumail's. The room and private bathroom is very spacious. Their apartment is a short drive or bus ride away from anywhere you'd want to go in the city. Kumail & his wife are very kind & easy to correspond with. I'll definitely look to see whether the apt is available when I return
21948	7664565	10.0	9.0	51384006	Kumail and his family were amazing hosts. They are really friendly and super helpful. The room is much nicer than what's shown in the picture online. Also. The apartment is super clean and organized.  I highly suggest that you check this place out. 
21949	7664565	10.0	9.0	51515994	"Kumail and his wife are so friendly and nice  :)
Even before I came to his apartment ,he concerned about how could I go there!And give me a useful information :)
The room is amazing and much better  than I thought. Also. The apartment is super clean and warmth. It's let me feel like a really house not just a living! If u r looking for a living in Seattle , just come to Kumail's apartment !! It would not be disappointed with you !"
21950	7664565	10.0	9.0	52773703	"Our stay at Kumail's place is very pleasant.  He and his wife are very nice to chat with and made us feel welcome. The room with ensuite bath was great! We were warm and cozy even though outside was stormy and cold. 
The location was super convenient as we just have to walk a little bit to yummy and inexpensive places to eat.  Getting to downtown was also very easy with various options for bus routes. "
21951	7664565	10.0	9.0	55704835	We had a great stay! The room was very clean and comfortable. Also, the location is an easy bus ride and short walk from Chinatown and Japantown, where we had an awesome meal. The couple had a cute daughter, and she was very sweet and never made a noise. 
21952	7664565	10.0	9.0	55864057	Was in town for a test
21953	7664565	10.0	9.0	56101770	Kumaiil was an inviting and respectful host. The room for rent was clean, simple, and quiet. Exactly what I needed. It's definitely a good place to stay!
21954	7664565	10.0	9.0	56419539	Kumail was the most wonderful host I can imagine. It was our first time using AirBnb and it was the best experience you could hope for. He was helpful and great to talk to (about sports, life, anything), and the room was large, clean, and beautiful. The private bathroom was great. His apartment was within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants (it's near the International District with lots of Asian food) and a quick bus ride to downtown. A million stars!
21955	7664565	10.0	9.0	56552398	Kumail was an excellent host.  Everything was clean and organized, and his home was very comfortable.  He made feel at home and provides excellent ideas for exploring seattle.  Everything I needed to enjoy my stay was provided.  I highly recommend Kumail for anyone staying in Seattle.
21956	7664565	10.0	9.0	56860295	I had an awesome time hanging out at Kumail's place. Kumail was responsive and friendly, and the apartment had everything we needed. The neighborhood was very safe and within walking distance to the International District. Strongly recommended!
21961	1856970	10.0	9.0	10057586	The room and bed are as comfortable as the photos look - very comfortable! Great coffee in the morning. Location is great for eating Vietnamese food and close to several buses that go downtown. True to description, the house has a very 1900's styling. Our host, Carol was very friendly, glad to share advice about getting around the city, where to go, what to see. 
21962	1856970	10.0	9.0	10249684	Carol was a great hostess, and her house is lovely. The room was very comfortable and she even provided breakfast! Her cat Mimi is very sweet (not allowed in the guest room) and the walk downtown from her place is pleasant. I had a great stay!
21963	1856970	10.0	9.0	10557476	"Carol was great, so nice gentle and welcoming. 

Her house is beautiful. The room that we had is so nice with a comfy bed. It is very well furnished and with a lot of taste. I loved the kitchen, and particularly the pretty bathroom. She also have a backyard that people can enjoy during the summer. 

Carol provided a fantastic breakfast with eggs toasts yogurt and French press for coffee. Her place is fantastic, my boyfriend and I really felt super well there: we enjoyed the atmosphere of her house, we will be back for sure! 

Also, her house is very well situated in downtown seattle, we were able to tour the city walking and never needed to take a transportation to her place. 

I recommend it!"
21964	1856970	10.0	9.0	10679966	A beautiful bedroom in a lovely historic house with a warm and welcoming host - what more could you ask for?  This was a great location - a 15 minute walk up from the light rail and through the International District (or a bus ride up Jackson St), accessible to the University District, to Pike's Place Market and downtown.  We walked to the convention center, easily.  For anyone on foot and bus-capable, this is a central location.  Appreciated Carol's flexibility and refund when we had to leave early.  Hope we will be back.
21965	1856970	10.0	9.0	10827778	Carol is a delightful host. After my long journey she greeted me warmly and made me feel so comfortable and at home. The room with a private bath is lovely and the bed super comfy. Carols place is very close to downtown Seattle and parking was easy to find on her street. I will definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle. 
21966	1856970	10.0	9.0	10867075	carol was very welcoming and I loved the quaint room. She also accommodated my bicycle!! great stay/great location.
21967	1856970	10.0	9.0	10933767	My second stay at Carol's was comfortable and enjoyable. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was close to the bedroom, clean and with a great shower and tub. We toured the downtown area on foot on a lovely warm afternoon. Parking was not a problem at all, as there is free (and available) parking all along her street. Carol went out of her way to make my stay comfortable, had wonderful hot coffee waiting for me each morning, and offered me breakfast as well. I highly recommend Carol's place for anyone visiting Seattle. 
21968	1856970	10.0	9.0	11025564	"The room was comfortable and private.  There is plenty of space to put your things.  The bed is more comfortable than my own.  Carol is awesome. She was extremely friendly and easy to chat with.  We spent each morning talking over breakfast.  She was also helpful and ready to hand out any information about the area I needed.  Her home provides easy access to downtown, either a short bus or comfortable walk.
10/10 Would stay again."
21969	1856970	10.0	9.0	11187075	"Carol is a thoughtful and wonderfully kind hostess who will make you comfortable in her home. I was at a week-long conference during my stay and really appreciated being able to come home to such a calm environment. Stepping through the door into Carol's home brought back memories of old New England-style houses that smelled sweet and had high beds and soft couches. That and waking up to the sound of seagulls made it almost-just almost-like being on vacation.

Location-wise, Carol's home is well-served by buses, and is within a ten minute walk of downtown (and light-rail stop from airport). While I was there this street was lined with blossoming cherry trees! "
21970	1856970	10.0	9.0	11270717	Carol was so kind and welcoming! We loved her cozy home and comfy bed. Her cat Mimi was so sweet. We only wished the weather was better, so we could've walked around her neighborhood more. Parking was easy and free! We also liked that she had maps and guides to help us plan our day. We would totally go back!
21971	1856970	10.0	9.0	11330511	What a lovely place! My wife and I spent two nights at Carol's. We were so happy with it we would definitely consider staying there again. The space is colorful, filled with books, and, better than all of that, Carol is there! She is such a friendly and generous person. This place would be hard to beat.
21972	1856970	10.0	9.0	11376836	My girlfriend and I wanted a quick trip to Seattle and found Carol뗩 place to be exactly what we needed. Carol was a great host. She was knowledgeable about the area and provided prompt replies to our emails. Her house was close enough to downtown that we chose to walk where we wanted to go. There are bus lines near her home too and Carol has schedules available if needed. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was clean. In the morning, Carol provided coffee and yogurt. I would recommend staying here as it was a comfortable and pleasant experience. As an added bonus Carol has a cute kitty cat.  
21973	1856970	10.0	9.0	11461700	"Staying in Carol's place might be my favorite part for my entire trip in Seattle. The room is really clean, cozy and the bed is probably the most comfortable bed ever! The location is great, walking distance to the international district light rail station. Carol is extremely nice and warm. She prepared some travel maps and traveling size shampoo for the visitors which is so sweet and thoughtful! I had a great time hanging out with her , her family and friend. They gave me a tour in Seattle! I will highly recommend this place!
"
21974	1856970	10.0	9.0	11554164	"This was not only our first time using Airbnb, but also our first trip to Seattle. Carol was quite a warm welcome for us. She was very friendly and hospitable, offering us food, coffee, and conversation every morning. Being new to the area, she was also super helpful with recommendations for restaurants and locations. The room was perfect for my boyfriend and I.  Plenty of room and closet space for the 2 of us. It was very clean and comfortable with fresh sheets and towels there upon on our arrival. The location was great for us as well, being only a $12 Uber ride from the heart of downtown. Carol also recommended using the light rail which is within walking distance from her place!  
All in all, my boyfriend and I had a great experience and LOVED staying with Carol. Next time we visit Seattle, we will stay there again. :-)"
21975	1856970	10.0	9.0	11608540	This is a beautifully decorated, homy, comfortable, clean home. It is a nice neighborhood, and we enjoyed walking to a Vietnamese restaurant nearby. Carol was super accommodating and patient with us, as our plans were changing and we didn't know if or when we would be arriving until the last minute. We were happy with out short stay here, as we were on the move from California to Alaska.
21976	1856970	10.0	9.0	11781894	"Carol is awesome!  Very kind, did plenty of research based on what I was visiting for (restaurants and night life!) and was extremely accommodating with my arrival time being pushed back due to traffic.  The place was great, comfortable and quiet.  Carol was very engaging but not at all intrusive, which was a perfect balance for me.  The house is a bit older, so if you are a very light sleeper some of the sounds may keep you up, but I had no problem personally (I am not the lightest sleeper, but I'm also not dead to the world when sleeping!).  I just noticed it when I would get in and the house was quiet - but it didn't prohibit me from falling asleep at all.  The location was great, a relatively easy walk to the downtown/Pike's Market area (the primary reason for my trip).  

I would definitely recommend this place, and will likely look to book with Carol again next time I'm in Seattle for work or for personal travel.  Thank you!!  "
21977	1856970	10.0	9.0	11935122	"We had a very pleasant stay at Carol's while in Seattle. Her home was very clean, the bedroom was spacious and comfortable, and most of all, Carol was a very gracious host. She offered french-pressed coffee, yogurt, cheese and toast for breakfast - which was very much appreciated because we were famished. 

The location was very convenient - we were able to get to all the places we wanted to see by foot (~20 mins to train station, ~25 mins to Pike Place Market). An added bonus to Carol's place was that it is only a couple minutes away from a very good Sichuan restaurant (Sichuanese Cuisine Restaurant). 

Since we only stayed one night, we didn't get to enjoy her beautiful backyard. It would be a great place to read a book during the day. And lastly, on the day that we checked-out, Carol suggested that we leave our backpacks at her house and to return later in the day to retrieve them. This was great because it enabled us to navigate around the city without the extra weight.

Carol - thanks again for everything."
21978	1856970	10.0	9.0	12003830	Our stay at Carol뗩 house was wonderful. The house was kept clean and the room was spacious with a very comfortable bed. It was a quiet and safe neighborhood and very convenient to many amenities and tour sites either by car, public transport or walking. Carol was such a warm and welcoming host, she made sure we뗬e got everything we needed and know our way around. We also enjoyed her little kitty Mimi뗩 company too. Thanks Carol for your great hospitality!
21979	1856970	10.0	9.0	12222181	Carol's home is a lovely place to stay in a great location. The bed is more comfortable than I have slept in at fancy hotels! Carol was there to welcome me after midnight, and there to wish me well when I left at 7am on the first day. She was friendly and informative, and if I come back to Seattle, I hope to get the room again.
21980	1856970	10.0	9.0	12279738	My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying at Carol뗩 house. The house, room, and bathroom were clean and comfortable, and we slept really well. The house is in walking distance from many of the nice areas of Seattle like Pioneer Square, downtown, and Capitol Hill. Taking the bus to and from the house is easy as well. Carol was a welcoming host, and was interested in ensuring that we enjoyed our experience in the city. We would absolutely recommend to anyone to stay with Carol, and would definitely contact her again next time we plan to spend the night in Seattle.
21981	1856970	10.0	9.0	12407124	Wondeful, invisting host. My husband and I loved staying here. I definitely reccommend it to anyone visiting the Seattle area!
21982	1856970	10.0	9.0	12549817	"A friend and I decided to randomly visit Seattle, and we read wonderful reviews on Carol. I thought, ""well she must be a good person! Everybody keeps writing good things about her!"". Well, I am now one of those people. Carol was an unbelievably gracious host. She was willing to answer any questions we had, gave us suggestions on local places to eat and visit, and had breakfast ready for us each morning. She was always open to having conversations, as well. Plus, her home is beautiful and is in a good location.  If you're reading this and if you don't quite know where to stay, stay here. Seriously. You won't regret it. "
21983	1856970	10.0	9.0	12797514	"I just stayed with Carol for a few days in Seattle, and I really enjoyed it.  She is a sweet, friendly person who wants you to have a good experience.  It's conveniently located.  It took me about 15 minutes to walk to the light rail station, and about 20 minutes to walk downtown.  As to her house itself, the description on Airbnb doesn't do it justice.  It's charming and comfortable.  There is a patio in front where you can relax and enjoy a nice view, and a beautiful garden in back.  You do have to share a bathroom, and because this was the first time I'd done that on Airbnb, I was a bit nervous.  No need to be!  The bathroom is located at the end of the same little hallway as your bedroom, and I never felt a lack of privacy.  It just wasn't an issue at all.  I strongly recommend staying at Carol's place.

21984	1856970	10.0	9.0	12938240	"Carol is a warm hostess and was great to stay with. The room was neat and clean, as was her house. It is charming and a unique place to stay. It is about a 25 minute walk to downtown or the U District. I did not have a car during my stay and did not experiment with public transportation, but I understand there is a bus nearby and I'm sure Carol would be happy to familiarize guests with the local transit options. Overall, a great experience!

"
21985	1856970	10.0	9.0	12946655	Carol was welcoming and comfortable.  Talking with her felt like talking with an old friend.  I only wish we had not been exhausted with jet lag and could have spent more time getting to visit with her.  Her house is charming, clean and a very comfortable bed.  She served a substantial breakfast of Seattle coffee and my favorite bread
21986	1856970	10.0	9.0	13034628	Carol was nice. The room was clean as expected. Her cat was friendly. Her house was close to bus station and link rail international/ Chinatown station. We liked walking to Pike market and nearby attraction. Her house is a perfect stay for downtown Seattle. 
21987	1856970	10.0	9.0	13111039	My 5 year old son and I had a lovely stay in this cozy and comfortable house. We enjoyed proximity to downtown and many of the places we went to. The yard is an urban oasis and I wish we could have used it more. 
21988	1856970	10.0	9.0	13140002	My sister and I enjoyed staying at Carol's! It was an incredibly easy walk downtown, and the best was very comfortable. Carol had to get up early in the morning, but she still made us coffee and laid out a selection of food for us. I'd definitely recommend staying here! 
21989	1856970	10.0	9.0	13253663	Carol's place was excellent & well located. Everything was organized, clean and welcoming. I only had a day there - in Seattle for work briefly - but expect to go back to stay again. Carol's garden was a great place to sit in the morning with coffee, and it's nice to have so many EXCELLENT Vietnamese restaurants within a block of two. Thanks!
21990	1856970	10.0	9.0	13540432	"Our stay in Seattle will certainly remain a very special experience thanks to Carol who was extremely friendly and warm-hearted. She instantly made us feel at home in her cosy kitchen and showed us her lovely garden where you can sit and relax.
Our room  was spacious with a  large closet and a very comfortable bed;
the  bathroom also rather big and very clean.
Carol's place is in a pleasant residential area, where  you can easily find parking space. Furthermore it is not far away from Chinatown with its excellent and reasonably-priced Korean and Chinese restaurants. Major places in  downtown Seattle can be reached in a 25 minute - walk. 
We enjoyed how openly Carol responded to us, how helpful she was  and how interesting our conversation with her turned out to be.
Thank you, Carol, we'll try to come again!
"
21991	1856970	10.0	9.0	13735807	"Carol was such a wonderful host! Her home is located in such a convienient location, close to the highways and to the city. The room was spacious and comfortable, and the bathroom was updated and clean. Carol's backyard is a peaceful little oasis to sit and read a book or drink some tea. I was also able to find street parking in front of her house without any issues. 

Carol was warm and welcoming, and made me feel so comfortable while staying with her. She is easy to talk to, and it truly felt like I was staying with a close friend rather than a host. She also has the most adorable cat, Mimi. I was out early for most of my stay, and Carol so thoughtfully provided some easy grab and go breakfast items such as yogurt, muffins, and fruit. 

I would highly recommend staying with Carol if you are visiting Seattle!"
21992	1856970	10.0	9.0	13859079	The room is clean and large, and the bed is very comfortable. The rest of the home is also clean and comfy. Carol is sweet and helpful, and treated me like family. I would definitely stay at her home again!
21993	1856970	10.0	9.0	13923071	It was great to stay st Carol's in Seattle! The house is a lovely old dwelling and Carol keeps it beautifully. The garden is a delight with a number of outdoor spaces. We appreciated Carol's clear instructions, local knowledge and interest in the world. The location is close to the international district and an easy bus trip to downtown. 
21994	1856970	10.0	9.0	14080155	Carol is a wonderfully warm host and her house is like a home! From use of the kitchen to use of the garden, I really enjoyed my time! Mimi the car helped with ensuring I was enjoying myself too lol. 
21995	1856970	10.0	9.0	14117811	"Very nice, pretty, well kept and clean home. Carol did a great job making us feel at home, offering tea and some things to nibble on if we needed it. The room itself is very cozy, the bed comfortable, bedding soft, and pillows fluffy (much better than the bed on the cruise we had for the past week!). The bathroom is shared, although there was absolutely no issue with that, and it is just outside the bedroom, with, as an added bonus, a door that closes off the hallway with the bedroom and bath. 

The house is very close to a few bus stops, and the light rail isn't TOO far either (we walked from the house there after a full day of walking all over- but we only had bookbags and a single rolling duffle- if you have a lot more, catch the bus) and Carol left an assortment of bus schedules and attraction brochures on the dresser as well. If you are more of a walking type, the hill is not steep (compared to most of the other streets) for Jackson St, and you can take that all the way down to the water. All in all, a great experience with a lovely host in a great city!"
21996	1856970	10.0	9.0	14172041	"Carol was a fantastic hostess! The room was spacious, clean and ready with fresh towels upon my arrival. She had a light breakfast and coffee available on my next morning, and I truly enjoyed holding a conversation with her! She's as warm and very welcoming as her home is charming! Such a delight.

I definitely recommend!"
21997	1856970	10.0	9.0	14292629	This was our first airbnb experience and it was a good one. Carol is warm and her home is clean and comfortable. Very comfy bed! We didn't have a car and were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, including to the light rail to the airport. Nothing fancy about Carol's--just homey and restful, which was just what we needed.
21998	1856970	10.0	9.0	14354464	Our one-night stay with Carol was perfect.  The home is very nice and centrally located--we walked to Chinatown, Pioneer Square, Pike's Place Market, etc.  And easy on-street parking, to boot.  Thanks, Carol!
21999	1856970	10.0	9.0	14512902	Thoroughly enjoyed staying with Carol. Gracious host who provided helpful hints for places to see and eat,  accommodations were comfortable with great views and nice back porch. Location was walking distance to Chinatown/ little Saigon and downtown area. Many great Asian restaurants nearby. Be advised that if you  are coming via the airport light rail, and plan to walk with luggage, its about 3/4 to 1 mile uphill to her house.  
22000	1856970	10.0	9.0	14865839	Carol was the sweetest lady and host. She has a lovely home that is very welcoming. The room is very cute and comfortable. Her location is perfect if you like to walk and see the city. She is a 20 minute walk to the prime part of Seattle and minutes away from Stumptown coffee. I highly recommend staying with Carol you wont be disappointed. 
22001	1856970	10.0	9.0	14969727	We stayed with carol for one night while visiting Seattle for a Mariners game. She was very quick to respond to any message and a fantastic hostess! Very kind, great to talk to. Her house is very cute and close to the stadium. We were able to walk to the baseball stadium and to Pikes place.  Great location, great trip!
22002	1856970	10.0	9.0	15103269	"This was more than a stay, it was a real connection. Even though Carol was working long hours when we were visiting Seattle, we managed to chat and I felt that we had a lot in common, including our attitudes towards life. This is probably because Carol has created a warm and welcoming atmosphere in her beautiful heritage home. This house is located within walking distance to downtown and Safeco field, which was very convenient for us as my partner, Joseph was going to a Mariners game while I could take the bus to explore Fremont's Sunday market. Also close to International Village - I highly recommend ""Jade Garden"" for dim sum. 

Carol's home is comfortable and very clean and tidy. You have full use of the kitchen and she provides breakfast items for you to help yourself. However, she made sure to leave us a pot of French press coffee before she left for work! 

Highly recommended- we are certainly going to try to stay here again the next time we're in Seattle.

Thank you Carol for sharing your home and your life with us."
22003	1856970	10.0	9.0	15213507	"Carol was really nice and we felt very welcome. She had yoghurt, fruit, bread and something sweet every morning for us. The room is great. Nice bed, enough room and clean. We were also very welcome to use the chairs in her backyard to relax and read. The house is a bit noisy and the bathroom is shared with Carol & her grandson, but if you don't mind: great place to stay.

One thing to consider is the neighbourhoud. It is a 20 minute walk to downtown, which is great, but the neighbourhoud didn't feel the safest. We always took the bus back at night instead of walking back. There is one really good Vietnamese restaurant though (entrance at the end of a parking lot, but really worth going there!). But maybe Carol has some good tips for other nice places around."
22004	1856970	10.0	9.0	15262851	Carol was really nice and fantastic hostess. She has a lovely house with a beautiful backyard.

22005	1856970	10.0	9.0	15569900	We enjoyed our 2 stays with Carol very much. She is a warm, welcoming, generous host. Her home is charming, set in a beautiful city garden, which were so enjoyable this summer. Besides her warm welcome, we were grateful for the home's central location, with a bus stop to downtown just 5 minutes away, as well as convenient neighborhood restaurants and easy parking. We would surely choose Carol's house for another visit to Seattle.
22006	1856970	10.0	9.0	15631112	Carol is lovely! She takes the time to make your stay as comfortable and private as possible. It was hot when we visited, so she got us a fan or our room. The location of this place also cannot be beat. Only minutes away by walking, bus or car to the wharf and the like. The bed was comfortable, the room just as described, carols company was lovely, and she even greeted us with coffee when we woke up and offered us breakfast. This is a great place to stay in Seattle !
22007	1856970	10.0	9.0	15758043	"Carol is a lovely person who graciously received us at her home at a late hour, as we had warned her could be the case. We had a short chat before all heading to our beds. Our room was extremely comfortable and we slept well: Carol had set up a cooling fan for us because she considered the weather was much hotter than usual.
In the morning we got to know each other better over the lovely ""continental"" breakfast that Carol provided. She advised us on transport for our planned activities of the day and was most helpful.
We stayed 2 nights in Carol's cute home. It is very conveniently located for a Seattle explorations. We safely parked our car in the street outside.
We highly recommend Carol and her AirBNB."
22008	1856970	10.0	9.0	15910751	We had such a great stay at Carol's. Her house is beautiful and the location is perfect, only 15 min walk to downtown. The room was clean and cosy.  We had lovely conversations with Carol on all sorts off topics. Would definitely stay there again!
22009	1856970	10.0	9.0	16003971	Carol was absolutely wonderful and the room was just as beautiful as on the pictures (and the bed really is super comfortable, and the breakfast was light and delicious -- exactly how we like it)! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there and I have nothing bad to say. The only recommendation I would give to future travelers: The walk to her place from the Amtrak station on South King felt a bit sketchy on some parts (the neighborhood where she lives is beautiful though!) 맙o next time I'd take the bus if arriving in the evening, or walk on Jackson instead.
22010	1856970	10.0	9.0	17039535	We totally enjoyed our stay with Carol Hughes.  It felt more like being with a family member or an old friend.  It was great.  Carol did everything to make our stay enjoyable with a lovely breakfast and conversation every morning.  Our room was comfortable and clean as was the bathroom.  There was no problem with coming and going at our leisure.  Carol was very knowledgable   with the area and helped with sightseeing activities.  Her home is located close to just about everything.  There are awesome running paths close to her home which we enjoyed throughout our stay. I would definitely stay with Carol again should we ever return to the Seattle area.

22013	1856970	10.0	9.0	18004525	Carol has a very nice and clean home. The room was great. Location-wise it is a little too far to walk to the center, however, taxi proces are reasonable. Would definitely stay there again.
22014	1856970	10.0	9.0	18171711	Thanks Carol for a wonderful stay. I appreciated your friendly and attentive hosting. Your place is homely and welcoming.

The bed was most comfortable and breakfast delightful, she even went out and bought cereal for me for the second morning.  The location was very good close to Pioneer square, Pike street markets and downtown which we were able to walk to.
We have no hesitation in recommending her lovely heritage home to other visitors to Seattle"
22016	1856970	10.0	9.0	18468493	We stayed for one day on our way back from a road trip up the Oregon Coast. The place was beautiful and the room was perfect. Everything was exactly as advertised. We didn't get a chance to meet Carol in person because we checked in and immediately went to see a Mariners game. Although we didn't meet in person, gaining access to the house was easy seamless. We wish he had more time to spend in town because the house was beautiful.
22017	1856970	10.0	9.0	18538579	"What a pleasure! 
Carol welcomed me, made me feel at home and made sure I knew where everything was and how to use it.

22019	1856970	10.0	9.0	19005680	Carol made us feel very welcome to her house despite our late arrival. The bedroom was large enough for us with a comfortable bed, albeit a bit shortish. We enjoyed the French press coffee and the muffins for breakfast.

It is a 15 minute walk uphill from King Street Station to Carol's house. If we would return to Seattle we would love to staying in Carol's house again. 
22020	1856970	10.0	9.0	19132283	Carol was a great host and took good care of us. We had good conversations & got a delicious organic breakfast in the morning. The walk from the International District station to Carol's place took about 20minutes. We took the Jackson street more often, because it was better enlightened.

Hot delicious coffee in the morning along with yogurt, fruit, pastry. Great tips on local restaurants in walking distance.  The bed was super comfy and one of the best night's sleep we had while on vacation. The gardens out back were lovely, refreshing, remarkable quiet ... we would definitely stay there again (as an FYI if you are traveling w/ children, it's quite a steep climb from street level up the stairs to the front door and no hand rail - the only thing that made me a smidge nervous with my fearless kiddo).

The house is located in an area that is easily accessible from the I-5 highway, in a neighborhood that has small, quiet streets with trees and houses with little yards richly filled with a variety of shrubs and flowers. The house makes a very nice impression of stability and warmth. The room was as I was hoping, cozy and comfortable, bathroom clean and the shower worked great. Morning coffee with a toast and fruit was perfect. The host has a talent to make me wanting to come back. 
22032	1856970	10.0	9.0	20915847	Carol's home was a lovely refuge during my busy trip to Seattle. The house was exquisitely clean and welcoming. The bed linens were so soft!

22034	1856970	10.0	9.0	21146035	"Carol was a very nice and helpful host. I arrived in Seattle from Vancouver at night and couldn't figure out her place well at first time. Thankfully, she picked me up from a bus stop. And also, she arranged a cab when I left. For the breakfast, she considered various tastes of guests and prepared. She is interested in various culture and enjoy learning about the culture via her guests. I also had a good time while I talk with her.
Her place is clean and tidy. I could hear train(?) sound sometimes, but didn't bother me a lot.

Carol has a large house so the room seems very private. The bed was very big and comfortable.

The bed was very comfortable & the bathroom was very clean. She gave me a huge poppyseed muffin & a yogurt for breakfast which was so nice!

Her charming and clean historical home is conveniently located in the Central District.

She is also walking distance from the light rail, which makes transportation from the airport a lot simpler and more affordable. I hope to stay with her again in the future :)"

Overall, I would highly recommend Carol and her accommodations to anyone.   The next time I stay in Seattle, Carol's place will be on the top of my list.   Good lodging fills up fast, so make sure to book your trip well in advance.

Was there to greet me and give me a tour of the house & rules.  We had great conversations, but she also gave me my space to relax and nap when I needed it.  She had coffee and breakfast for me each morning, even when she wasn't able to be there when I got up.  Listing accurately represented her home, and the neighborhood was safe at all hours and easily accessible by at least 3 major bus lines within a 5 minute walk.  Coffee, cat, and conversation - wonderful!  Would absolutely stay here again next time I'm in the area.
22059	1856970	10.0	9.0	25552444	Carol was friendly and accommodating.  The bedroom and bath were spotless.  Carol has a half bath of her own so there was no competition when I was there.

On top of being full of valuable information, she went up and beyond in terms of being a host -- everything from having a clean bathroom to giving us delicious coffee and snacks (every morning!). Her cat Mimi was also nice to have around. Location wasn't half bad either for someone who has never been to the city. I would recommend Carol's home for anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxed Seattle experience. 
22072	1856970	10.0	9.0	28121045	I recently enjoyed a nice 2 night stay in Carol's lovely home.

After we arrived by car we walked everywhere we wanted to go from her home, which included downtown, Pike's Market and the space needle. I would definitely stay with Carol again if I was visiting Seattle. 
22075	1856970	10.0	9.0	28590590	"Carol was a great host, very friendly and helpful.  The accommodation description was just as it said it was, and my 2 night stay there was very comfortable. Carol provided shampoo, and toothpaste if you forget/ unable to pack some along with you, and was also very respectful of the guests privacy as well. The cat and dog Mimi, and Evie won't bother you, but Mimi is quite friendly if you choose to interact with her. Evie prefers her own privacy as well. 

The location is also quite convenient should you need to take the rail, as it is a brisk 10-15 minute walk from the rail station. If you'd prefer not to walk, Uber/ Lift is available and would be probably a $3-5 dollar ride from the station. I'm not too sure if there's a bus line that passes by the main street that the house is located.  "

She welcomed us around 930 at night and recommended some eating places. We went the wrong way against her suggestions accidentally. On the mysterious and cold roads, many places were closed to eat, but we did end up finally finding a delicious restaurant. Carol was direct in her expectations and directions which was lovely. The next morning, she provided some yummy breakfast fruit and pastries. In an embarrassing attempt to take the bus short changed, she gave us some quarters to make the cut.
22079	1856970	10.0	9.0	29782405	Carol was a wonderful host for my stay in Seattle. She is very warm and personable, and immediately made me feel welcome in her home.

The whole house, and the bathroom is super clean, I felt right at home. Carol is very thoughtful, she respects your space but when you want to speak to her, she is open to do that anytime.

22082	1856970	10.0	9.0	30997407	"The house of Carol is very clean, and it is beautiful.
There is the very comfortable bed and is a cozy wonderful place.
A place is the place that is very convenient if I manage a bus!
Though it is near from the town, it is a very quiet residential area.
She is the person who is very ndustrious, and is gentle.
I can speak English little bit.But She was going to understand my English.I had a very wonderful experience in first airbnb.
You must experience it, too!"
22083	1856970	10.0	9.0	31105555	I am glad to have stayed at Carol's. She is very welcoming and nice so I really enjoyed my stay. I love the bedroom and bathroom. The room is cosy and exudes a relaxing, warm vibe. I could stay in all day. I like the victorian bathtub, it is fitting with the 1900s feel of the house. I think Carol is thoughtful with the decor and furnishing of her home, making it a comfortable, homely  experience for guests. She has a well-tended garden with lots of flowers. She also has a cat Mimi who is shy but friendly once she warms up! The first morning she mewed morning greetings and approached me for a rub when I emerged from the room. I really appreciate Carol's hospitality when I was there. Thank you.
22084	1856970	10.0	9.0	31455138	Very good experience in Seattle. The room was very clean and cute. Everything was ready when I arrived. And Carol was a very nice host and provided all tourism info if you asked. Breakfast was very nice as well. The restroom was always clean and cozy
22085	1856970	10.0	9.0	31518364	We had a great time with Carol in her lovely house. Easy to find from King St station. Only problem was not enough time to chat, we got on so well. Great location for downtown Seattle.
22086	1856970	10.0	9.0	31635830	Carol kept in touch with me and was ready for me when I arrived. The room and bed is Goldilocks-worthy; juuust right. Nothing was too much trouble. I felt welcome.
22087	1856970	10.0	9.0	31898221	"Carol is an absolute sweetheart. My friend and I stayed at Carol's during a weekend trip to Seattle. It was honestly one of the easiest airbnb experience ever. Upon arrival, I told Carol that I would check in at 6 PM. On the day of, we arrived an hour earlier than expected and she was able to check us in early. The room was clean and very cozy. It definitely has a homey feeling to it. In the morning, Carol set out some breakfast for us - coffee, tea, muffins, toasts, fruits. We really appreciated her hospitality. 

Location-wise, this place is great. It's close to downtown. You can either walk or take public transportation there. Street parking was easy. We never had a problem with that.

The next time that I visit Seattle, I will definitely stay at Carol's."
22088	1856970	10.0	9.0	32072660	Carol's house is located in a very nice neighborhood of Seattle.  The room was perfect for me and my boyfriend.  We are young and it was roughly a 30 minute walk for us to get to downtown/Pike Place area.  The walk brings you through chinatown which felt very safe.  It's an easy and mostly downhill walk there.  We often caught the bus back up to King St.  The location is very convenient with the bus being so close and Carol was able to offer us a lot of freedom as far as what time we came and went.  Would definitely stay here again.
22089	1856970	10.0	9.0	32188455	Carol was welcomed me with hospitality, and she generously let me use her kitchen to cook, which I loved. The bed was cozy and the room was clean. I liked it!
22090	1856970	10.0	9.0	32685318	Contact with Carol before we arrived was great.  She answered all queries quickly and provided useful information.  The room was exactly as advertised.  It was clean, quiet, spacious and nicely decorated, plus the bed was very comfy.  Getting to Carol's was a straightforward walk from the Light Rail stop, and getting to town was easy too.  Carol provided a tasty and filling breakfast in the morning with nice strong coffee.  Our host was able to answer questions about Seattle, and she provided some useful sightseeing tips.  We'd definitely stay with Carol again.  Great trip!
22091	1856970	10.0	9.0	33248851	Carol was an excellent host. She genuinely welcomed us to her house. Everything was accurate as the page suggested. The location was great, and the house was clean. We also loved her breakfasts and cat!
22092	1856970	10.0	9.0	33483047	Carol was very welcoming and made sure that I was comfortable during my stay. The room is exactly as advertised and is extremely comfortable for the price. The location is great and its a short walk into downtown. All in all it was a wonderful stay.
22093	1856970	10.0	9.0	33579643	What a lovely airbnb experience, top marks in every category!  Carol met us on our arrival, was friendly, helpful, provided a nice breakfast, even drove us to get our rental car.  The room is private, clean and comfortable,  the shared bathroom was always available and very clean.  We enjoyed sharing stories in the evening with Carol!  The yard is a peaceful retreat with privacy on the patios.  This is a great spot with a fantastic host!

22095	1856970	10.0	9.0	34876252	"Carol was a wonderful host. She was graciously accommodating from the minute I contacted her to when we said our goodbyes. I only stayed two nights but those two nights were very comfortable. Carol made double sure that I had all my needs met and was very flexible with my schedule (or lack of one). The room she provided was cozy and clean as was the rest of the residence. I also became good friends with her cat Mimi, but sadly never met her dog. Carol's residence is located in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the International District as well as Downtown area. That of course depends on one's lower extremities fortitude. I have walked from downtown to the house during the night and have had no issues with safety. In fact I really enjoyed the tranquil walks through the cool and breezy night. 
In addition to standard hospitality, Carol provided a light breakfast of high quality cheeses, breads, and fruit, which was more than I expected as I am not much of a breakfast person. She values organic produce and is a big fan of Trader Joe's :)
During my free time at Carol's place I enjoyed some really good conversations with her. We chatted about a range of things, from social issues to history. 
In summary, I am more than glad I ended up staying over at Carol's place. I would highly recommend Carol's place for any kind person looking for a wonderful experience while visiting Seattle.

When we arrived, Carol gave us a nice quick tour of her lovely home and made us feel less like strangers and more like guests. She even provided us with breakfast in the morning even though we didn't arrange anything in advanced, which was really awesome! Our room was charming and spotless, with a nice closet to hang up our coats and another hall closet where we could leave our luggage. 

Carol's home is down the street from Little Saigon and pretty close to the I-5 if you are planning to drive around Seattle. There are tons of nearby restaurants if the bar scene in Downtown Seattle isn't your thing. 

Overall, I highly recommend Carol's home. "
22105	1856970	10.0	9.0	38602825	The room is exactly the same as described. It's very clean, simple but has all the detailed stuff in the room. The bed is super comfortable.

22107	1856970	10.0	9.0	39288577	Carol is a super host, a warm and caring person who was attentive to our needs.  Her location is an easy walk or drive  (1.5 miles downhill) to downtown Seattle, the Pike Place Market, and the ferry terminals.  Her house provides a quiet and serene setting, especially her backyard. The accommodations are clean and thoughtful. We maintained our privacy, even though we shared a bath, kitchen, and other common areas.  I would definitely stay at Carol's again if I were coming back to Seattle. 
22108	1856970	10.0	9.0	39619684	We had a wonderful experience with Carol! She was helpful with input on places to visit while in Seattle. The space was clean, neat, welcoming, and beautiful.

22110	1856970	10.0	9.0	40920244	The house was very well located in the Chinatown / international District and was close to major bus routes , that were easily accessible and within walking distance from S. King Street . Carol came to collect me close to the light rail station when I arrived , which was very kind of her. The room was clean and well appointed and the bed most comfortable . She gave me a healthy  and very tasty breakfast in the mornings and allowed me to use the refrigerator .The only problems I had was that I was not told that there were 19 rather steep steps to climb to the entrance of the house and as I arrived with one large suitcase and a smaller one, as I was going on a 7 day cruise to Alaska from Seattle , it was very difficult for me to carry them up the stairs , especially as I am almost 70 years old. Also Carol informed me I would share the bathroom with one lodger , Nick , who worked at night,  and would seldom be there , but in fact I had to share the bathroom with her as well, and this was not always convenient. 
22111	1856970	10.0	9.0	43039440	"Absolutely perfect! Carol is a very nice and caring host, the room is super clean, it has an amazing bed and the bathroom is super clean! Carol even provided breakfast for us! 
A perfect location for exploring the city, which is a 20-35 min walk or a 8 min bus drive. However, it is nice that her home is in a calm neighbourhood."
22112	1856970	10.0	9.0	43484173	Carol's place is clean and exactly as pictured. Carol is kind and friendly and able to provide you with good advise about the local area. And her place is well positioned 
22113	1856970	10.0	9.0	43767029	Carol is supernice. We felt like home the moment we entered the house and met her cute cat. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable. She organised everything perfectly and made it a perfect stay for us. We would definitely recommend this place. Thank you Carol!
22114	1856970	10.0	9.0	44143099	Carol is very sweet, and she promptly responds to messages. Her home is lovely (I especially liked the clawfoot tub!) and on a fairly quiet street. The room was clean and tidy. There were other guests staying in her home, but given that we (my boyfriend and I) spent a relatively small amount of time in the house, we did not cross paths with the other guests. The walk to Pike Place market was about 35 minutes, so we decided to use car2go to travel to the downtown area. Carol was also helpful in providing information about the bus line nearby her house. She kindly offered us breakfast, but given that we wanted to eat at various restaurants during our stay, we declined her offer. 
22115	1856970	10.0	9.0	45244492	It was great! My girl Carol was super kind, easy to talk to, and was super understanding. Also she fed me breakfest, twas great.

One of the important things for me is that an Airbnb has great internet and Carol's place did not disappoint. Also, it was very sweet, she set me up with coffee and orange juice and even offered me bagels in the morning.

I can't imagine a better host in Seattle and anyone would be lucky to find this reservation open."
22119	1856970	10.0	9.0	46709339	Our first Airbnb trip to Carol's place was a wonderful experience. The room and amenities were exactly as described in the listing and Carol was more than accommodating. Being 7 months pregnant when we visited, it was important to be close to attractions and have a comfortable place to rest. Everything about our stay was perfect. Carol offered us coffee and breakfast every morning and was eager to help us navigate our chosen tourist sites. Thank you Carol for your kindness!
22120	1856970	10.0	9.0	47064596	"We were greeted at the steps upon arrival and we all sat together that afternoon for drinks in the garden.
Neighbourhood was reasonably quiet and walking distance to all the city offers."
22121	1856970	10.0	9.0	47389663	A great host with a great home. She did everything possible to make us feel welcome and comfortable during our stay. She explained all the house rules clearly and gave us a quick tour of the house. She's there if you need her but also gives you plenty of space to just unwind after a long day. She serves you a hearty breakfast in the morning. You can tell her that you won't be needing breakfast if you plan on eating at one of the many great eateries in Seattle but it's always a plus to be able to grab a bagel before heading out. Speaking of Seattle, Carol's home is in such a great location! You can walk to many places in Downtown or drive a really short distance to wherever you want to go (e.g., Space Needle, Pike's Market, Safeco Field, etc). Very convenient! For all you pet lovers, Carol has a wonderful, affectionate cat by the name of Mimi. She greeted us at the door and immediately started brushing up against us and purring. After a long day out and about in Seattle, I always looked forward to coming back to Carol's home and unwinding with Mimi. The room, the bathroom, the kitchen, the entire house overall was fabulous. The neighborhood is very quiet with plenty of parking if you drive.
22122	1856970	10.0	9.0	47625482	"Carol is a friendly, welcoming, lovely host. Her home is gorgeous. My guest bedroom was nicely decorated and very comfortable.  The bathroom was right next door. Carol kindly provided breakfast items.

The bathroom, right next to the bedroom, is shared, but that was not a problem. She offered great conversation, yet was respectful of my privacy as well. I'm glad I stayed. Mimi the cat, is a sweetheart.

No only that but her cat, Mimi, is super sweet.
Charming neighborhood to be in, a few minutes walking to a bus stop or the Link Light Rail. 
Now, it's not a matter of ""if"" I go back to Seattle, but when. And when I do, Carol's house has a spot in my heart and I will certainly be in touch with her again.

If you prefer to sleep with an open window (as I did) there will be some occasional sound carried from the railway line. Being a heavy sleeper, it did not bother me, but might bother a light sleeper. Closed window means quiet, however.
WiFi access fine.
Overall, recommended."
24274	5164581	9.0	9.0	26805982	I enjoyed my experince from when I got there to when I left. My hosts boyfriend who took care of everything I needed to know while at the 3 story home was very friendly and informative. I was able to take the 33 bus downtown which was only 2.25 each way and was only a couple hundred feet from the house. One street up the hill then !boom! there is the bus stop on to the left. I took full advantage of the beautiful trail that is very close to the home to walk back after my excursions to downtown Seattle each day. Great views of Sound and little parks along trail. Takes 1 1/2 hours to walk back to home from Seattle. Home was very clean and well organized for guests. Temperature was very comfortable. Long shag carpeting felt great between my toes in the bedroom. I slept well on the bed. Liked the provided Starbucks Vanilla K-Cups to get me going in the morning for my days adventures. Good food choices close by. Pizza!
24275	5164581	9.0	9.0	27064265	Luyao was sweet, kind, and accommodating looks just like the pictures. Clean bathroom with soap and shampoo. Beautiful view. The air through the window smelled amazing. Cool neighborhood, cool condo. 
24276	5164581	9.0	9.0	27185959	Luyao and company were great hosts. The house was clean and orderly.  They had tea available (cold or hot) all day.  Despite being a few blocks from a train yard, the house was pretty quiet while I was there.  The bed was the firmest I've slept on via AirBnB.
24277	5164581	9.0	9.0	28561059	The hosts of the place were warm, kind, friendly; they kept the place very clean and organized, and they were readily available to answer any questions about the place as well as my stay there. I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend the place to anyone who is looking for a short or long term stay in the nice Magnolia neighborhood. 
24278	5164581	9.0	9.0	28682603	"Very nice and quiet couple. I had an issue with my car on arrival and Tao drove me to the closest mechanic to get help, it was really nice!!The house is clean and the bed very comfy. Perfect area to stay only 20 min from downtown by bus ! Nice neighborough. You have access to the kitchen for the meal when your host are not there. The host are a bit shy or may be just want to respect your privacy so don't except long talk, it can be a great thing if you want to relax or you are not talkative yourself ;) 
Finally I think the price is good for what you get!
I recommend this place"
24279	5164581	9.0	9.0	28749290	Luyao and her husband were great! The space was clean and they were very accommodating with our check-in time. This is a great place to stay in Seattle!
24280	5164581	9.0	9.0	28839659	This was my first experience of airbnb and it could not have been better. Luyao and her husband were so understanding of almost any adjustment we made to our plans! We were there for just one night but I could see the immense changes they had made  to their entire house to make a guest feel comfortable for a long stay. I highly recommend their place, its clean, exactly like the posting and the neighbourhood is quite accessible from downtown even in late hours. We got back at 2am by bus and had no trouble getting home.
24281	5164581	9.0	9.0	28966409	Very welcoming, accurate description of a lovely home, nice neighbourhood with a bus to town every half hour or so.
24282	5164581	9.0	9.0	29061741	I had a good stay at Luyao's place. She was flexible with my late arrival and was very friendly when I arrived. The room was spacious and brightly lit, with more closet space than I needed for a one night stay. 
24283	5164581	9.0	9.0	29498938	"Comfortable room with lots of closet space! The bathroom is shared, so make sure you are respectful of other guest's schedule. This can be tough if you are in a rush and someone's in there! Just something to keep in mind. 

We did not meet Luyao till the last night we were staying there due to our conflicting schedules, but her husband was working from home and was downstairs if we ever needed anything. They were both suuuper accommodating and helpful throughout the whole trip!! Hosts are great about guests using their kitchen space. Everything is labelled in the kitchen for guest use (i.e. cabinets, drawers in fridge, toaster, etc.) and there are definitely utensils and what not for use!

Bus stops were only about a block away and even though there were some nights where we out late, it was really not a problem getting back to their place. I would definitely recommend if you don't mind the public transportation!"
24284	5164581	9.0	9.0	29715767	Luyao and husband were very helpful and welcoming.  The room is as described, quiet and close to downtown.  The bonus is there's plenty of off street parking if you have a car. 
24285	5164581	9.0	9.0	29740654	Luyao's house is pretty and quite. We had a great living experience there. Everything is clean tide and convenient. 
24286	5164581	9.0	9.0	29844843	"We had a wonderful short, but sweet, stay with Luyao. The neighborhood was convenient and she prepared a nice clean room for us to stay in. If you're traveling to Seattle, I reccomend staying here!

Thanks again,

Julia"
24287	5164581	9.0	9.0	30417391	"I appreciated the flexible check-in time. This was adequate for budget lodging. Room itself was as described. Location was quiet and safe, street parking was available for no added cost.
""Access to"" the bathroom here really means Shared bathroom with other airbnb bedroom rented on second floor. The one review that pointed this out was written after I booked this, unfortunately. Listing is not quite accurate on that. So I was not prepared to share a bath but it worked out fine and there was only one person in the other room luckily. 
The bus line downtown is just one block up and very convenient 10 minutes to downtown, however some planning is required depending on your destination. Mine was Seattle Center all weekend and the bus only ran every hour with last bus to get home at 10:24p even on a Saturday, not 2:00am like another reviewer commented. 
Overall it is a good choice if you need an inexpensive place to sleep."
24288	5164581	9.0	9.0	30876538	"Had such a wonderful time staying here! Luyao and her husband are lovely people and very accommodating. The room was nice and in a quiet neighborhood, but very easy to get downtown via public transportation. 

Would  recommend staying here and I would definitely return."
24289	5164581	9.0	9.0	31115861	The room was clean and nice. We didn't meet Luyao, but her husband was in the house to greet us. Sharing a bathroom can really be inconvenient sometimes, but we knew what we are getting into. The house is easy to find and get to, but if you come late, parking is limited, you might need to park on adjacent streets. The neighborhood is nice too.
24290	5164581	9.0	9.0	31524764	Very nice room & house in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood. Luyao made us feel welcome and was very hospitable and helpful with our questions. Supermarket, restaurants, and bus connection to the center were close by. I'd recommend anyone to stay at Luyao's place!
24291	5164581	9.0	9.0	32068863	"The host couple are very nice and friendly. They always tried to help me get the directions and transportation information. The room is tidy and neat. Wifi and detailed information/direction of the house are properly provided which has made everything easy during my stay.

Thank you so much for making my stay in Seattle so wonderful.
 "
24292	5164581	9.0	9.0	32173112	We had a great stay with Luyao & Tao. Their home is neat and clean, the room is cozy, and the bed is comfortable. They live in a nice neighborhood with easy public access to/from downtown via the 33 bus so you can get around without a car. We walked to the grocery store nearby and cooked a few meals in their kitchen. We would definitely stay again if in Seattle! 
24293	5164581	9.0	9.0	32296254	Comfortable and economical place to stay. Luyao was quick with communication and arranging check in which made for a smooth stay. Thank you, Luyao!
24294	5164581	9.0	9.0	32681558	Luyao was a very accommodating host! We were out most of the day each day to see Seattle so we did not get to interact that much. The room was perfect and the bed was comfy! The bus stop is so close which made getting around a breeze Luyao also provided transit books  and attractions which came in handy for us! Would stay again, great experience! 
24295	5164581	9.0	9.0	32866354	Luyao and her husband were great! The room, bathroom and location are as described, and it was a close drive to downtown. She was very flexible with check-in time, and we were very happy with our stay! 
24296	5164581	9.0	9.0	32974534	The Check-In was quick and easy, the room was clean and the bed very comfortable. It is not located in the city center, but there are busses or you can go by car in 20 minutes. We had only one night at Luyaos place but I could really recommend it!
24297	5164581	9.0	9.0	33650613	Comfortable and clean house to stay.  Even you don't have car, transportation is still convenient. Host are really nice and hospitable. 
24298	5164581	9.0	9.0	34146140	Great room! I recommend this place when you want to visit Seattle. Next to the house, there are many services (bus, shops...etc.). Luyao was very flexible with check-in time. Thanks Luyao for everything.
24299	5164581	9.0	9.0	34274944	Luyao was a great host. The place is in a really good location if u want to visit downtown or if going in a cruise like we did. The only caveat is that it is in the second floor so if u have a lot of luggage it is a little challenging. 
24300	5164581	9.0	9.0	34445948	Thank you so much to our host for greeting and inviting us we had a comfortable safe and secure stay right outside of central Seattle.  Plenty of closet space a comfortable bed and if you take a lift ride into downtown Seattle it's about 12 bucks for two people. A nice condo community with wifi
24301	5164581	9.0	9.0	34794092	"The room was very clean, the bed was perfect and there was plenty of space and shelves for luggage and other things, even more than I needed. Luyao was very flexible with check-in and check-out times and responsive about any question I had.

The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, with a couple of very close (2 - 5 minutes walking) stops for buses going in different directions. There is also a very nice pub close by, where you can have food and drinks any time of the day.

In conclusion, a very nice accommodation, which fitted perfectly in my first ever Seattle experience."
24302	5164581	9.0	9.0	35261571	Luyao was a great hostess. Her place is in a nice neighborhood with easy parking, and she was very kind and accommodating. Our only interaction was when we first arrived, but during that interaction she was warm and friendly. 
24303	5164581	9.0	9.0	38978498	We really enjoyed our stay -- Luyao provided us with everything we needed-- a clean bedroom with plenty of closet space, towels, etc. Luyao was flexible about a late arrival which we needed due to a late flight! We also really liked the neighborhood -- it was extremely easy to take buses downtown or to other parts of the city. We didn't spend much time at the BnB because we were extremely busy with our stay, but it certainly provided us with everything we needed! 
24304	5164581	9.0	9.0	39276956	This was my ver first Airbnb experience. I'm glad I got to experience this with Luyao and her husband Tao. They were very friendly and ver inviting. Their home was lovely in a very nice part of town. 
24305	5164581	9.0	9.0	40336888	My wife and I really enjoyed staying at Luyou's place. The place was clean, comfy and very easy to get in town as it's described. The area is safe and quiet. We didn't have chance to meet Luyoa but we met Luyou's husband. He was a nice guy. I would recommend this place to my friends and whoever is looking to visit Seattle.
24306	5164581	9.0	9.0	40638843	Luyao was very accommodating and friendly! The room was clean, with more than enough storage space, good bed, and a good bathroom. The location is pretty good as it's a simple bus ride or Lyft to downtown , Discovery Park, Ballard/Fremont, etc. All pretty awesome places. Of course it was all capped off with Luyao and her hospitality. 
24307	5164581	9.0	9.0	40897162	Luyao and Tao were very nice hosts and the place was clean and quiet. Starbucks and a couple good restaurants nearby. Great value!
24308	5164581	9.0	9.0	41924411	First time using Airbnb was a pleasant one. Luyao and her husband were very accommodating, although I didn't interact much with them due to our different schedules. The room was cozy and clean and the bed was large (always a plus). The area was quite nice as well, very quiet. Would definitely stay here in the future!
24309	5164581	9.0	9.0	43232778	This was my first time using airbnb, and i'm glad to report it was a positive experience! (Admittedly i don't having anything to compare it to yet, but i was very happy with my stay.) Luyao and Tao were very kind and welcoming, the accommodations were as advertised, and the neighbourhood was safe and quiet. I was initially worried the street parking might be an issue, but i was always able to find a spot nearby. I would definitely consider staying here again.
24310	5164581	9.0	9.0	43553004	Our stay at Luyao's was very pleasant and exactly what we needed for our short time in Seattle. Luyao and her husband were friendly and helpful whenever we encountered them. Luyao was very responsive when I later realized I had forgotten my passport in the room too. Their neighborhood is quiet and had good street parking. We found it easy to get into the city from their house, about a 15 minute drive. We did share the bathroom with other guests but that wasn't a problem for me. I'd recommend their place to others looking for a quiet place to sleep after exploring the city.
24311	5164581	9.0	9.0	44300738	Luyao and her husband are wonderful and kind hosts. The room we stayed in was comfortable and they washrooms had the basic essentials provided for by host. It was wonderful to return to their home after a busy day exploring to rest. Thank you!
24312	5164581	9.0	9.0	45244925	"I really enjoyed staying with Luyao. The neighborhood seems to mind their own business, the home was clean, cozy, and comfortable. I cooked a little for myself, but I was usually out most of the day every day. The room was clean, bed was comfy, and was pretty bright while there was sun outside. No complaints here!

The only trouble I ever had was parking, but there isn't anything Luyao could have done about that. There was only street parking available, but my issue was finding a place to park. Especially at night. My advice for anyone coming with a car, park on the street, and leave your car there. Take uber/lyft. It will save you money and hassle."
24313	5164581	9.0	9.0	45937284	"Luyao and her husband were very accomodating to my girlfriend and I :) There was ample space in the fridge for our groceries, the living areas were very well maintained, and we even got to enjoy a few episodes of a hilarious chinese trivia show with them. A downtown-bound bus stopped one block from their house and there's a pleasant grocery store a few minutes walk away. 

I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone who would like a low-key visit to Seattle. "
24314	5164581	9.0	9.0	46393670	Luyao's room is wonderful and she is a great host.  Communication prior to our arrival was excellent, too. The neighborhood is quiet and convenient. I can highly recommend it.
24315	5164581	9.0	9.0	48002288	Although we did not get to meet Luyao during our arrival, however, we were welcomed by her husband Tao who was accomodating. He showed us where are room was and that was basically it. We got to meet Luyao, I believe the following day or the day after. Both husband and wife are very friendly and Luyao made sure we were comfortable. I am a light sleeper, so the noises outside kept me up half the night. But, for the most part the drive to Downtown area and Ballard and to many attractions was not bad at all. We had a great time!
24316	5164581	9.0	9.0	48330684	Great experience, fine room, convenient location, wonderful hosts! 
24317	5164581	9.0	9.0	49137357	"I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough. The room and house are very clean. Soap, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips and toothpaste are all provided for those staying. The room has shelving in the closet which makes it very easy to keep the room from feeling cluttered while you stay. Another thing I liked was that there was a desk in the room. I had homework to do on my trip so this was very convenient. 
Another cool feature is that if you aren't familiar with Seattle you will have no problem getting to the down town area from the house. The bus stop is about a minute walk from the house and a single bus ride will take you into the downtown area. Also there is a variety of restaurants, a gas station and convenient store within a 5 minute walking distance. 
Luyao and her husband were both very nice. I hope they are both making a lot of money off this Airbnb because this is a great place to stay!"
24318	5164581	9.0	9.0	52464626	Luyao and her husband are a very sweet, young couple! Helpful, friendly and cheerful. A quiet, clean, uncluttered condo. The neighborhood is very quiet. Well placed for the Ballard, Queen Anne area. I was only 7-8 minutes from Key Arena where my concert was. The coffee was nice perk, plus some room in the frig. I would return.
24319	5164581	9.0	9.0	53014067	Luyao was a great host and the room was just as described. Great location and very convenient. The bed was comfortable and we had a great stay. We'll be back!
24320	5164581	9.0	9.0	53689206	Luayao was very welcoming! The room was spacious, tidy and warm for the cold/wet weather. The nice thing about staying here was the bus lines (33,31, & 24) were very close and take you pretty much everywhere. There is a grocery store near by, Starbucks, gas stations and other restaurants near by. Also, there's a Pizza place and a burger joint about 9min. walk away that are pretty good. This trip was a success thanks to Luyao's place.
24321	5164581	9.0	9.0	53859533	The host made me feel as if I was in my own home. Everything was very clean and the bed was comfortable.
24322	5164581	9.0	9.0	56852368	Luyao was a great host! I stayed for two weeks after just moving to Seattle from the east coast and I was thrilled to stay in such a nice place for such an amazing price. I was pleasantly welcomed and was helped with whatever I needed. Nice, quiet area in Magnolia/Interbay and would recommend to the next guest.
24323	5164581	9.0	9.0	57065087	Great host! She was very quick at responding to my messages. I felt comfortable and safe. She was organized with before and after instructions. I would definitely recommend someone to stay there. 
24324	5164581	9.0	9.0	57232186	Luyao is a very very nice landlord! She responded very fast whenever i had a question. The room is clean and tidy and there is a good view looking out of the window. The kitty pet in the house is super cute!!! When i opened the door in the morning i always saw her lying in the middle of the hall and she is not shy at all. Super cute. Recommend this airbnb to everyone. 
24325	5164581	9.0	9.0	57412377	Never met the host, but the place is in a nice neighborhood. It's a 30 minute bus ride from downtown. 
24326	5164581	9.0	9.0	57697948	The rom meets my expectations in term of size and as described. The ceiling to floor window provides feeling of spaciousness and some view of a small mountain and surrounding. The closet is relatively huge ang very functionable. It has many section that can handle different type of clothing and supply enough room for storage. Luyao provides a few sort of shampoo and body wash. After first day of introduction, The cat is so close to us that it wants to come into my room. The next day it was policed and is only allowed on third floor. The good part of Luyao ' house is that it is so close to downtown that it only takes 15 to 20 minutes by ONE bus to very core part of commercial.shopping streets. The best is that you will enter the border of downtown only 8 minutes after you get in the bus and enjoy the vivid modern city life. This impressed me as you may not know that many part of Seattle looks very countryside and infrastructure is underdeveloped . So luyao's house location also give sense of security to many first timer to Seattle.   On the other front. Luyao spent considerable amount of time chatting with me on how they settle,grow and develop in Seattle, which benefit me a lot.
24327	5164581	9.0	9.0	58028547	Luyao was a sweet, thoughtful hostess who provided me, a newbie AirBnB user, with a fantastic experience. Simple, safe, stress less - the trip was exactly what I had hoped it would be. 
24328	5164581	9.0	9.0	58565345	it was very nice to stay with Luyao and her husband. very clean and comfortable. Thank you guys!
24571	492287	10.0	9.0	1407506	"My husband and I were welcomed to the ""Birdhouse"" in May 2012 by Robert, who is a very gracious host and his friendly dog and cat. He makes a wonderful espresso which I enjoyed in the restful backyard.
The house is tastefully decorated and inviting. The private guest room and bath are clean and pleasant.  The bed and linens are super comfy.  I slept great.
Upon arrival, we sat down with Robert, shared a glass on wine and chatted about the house, our expected schedules, and the local area.
The neighborhood and nearby Discovery Park are beautiful.  Bring your walking shoes to enjoy the park.
The best references that can be given is to say that I would stay here again.  A very good first airbnb experience."
24572	492287	10.0	9.0	1500015	"My stay at Seattle's Discovery 'Birdhouse' was delightful.  I happened to hit the weather perfectly with sunshine and blue sky, which is a real treat for visiting Seattle.  So I took advantage of it by going for a fantasictic walk in Discovery Park (one block away) with views of the harbor and the beautiful Olympic Mountain Range beyond.

Rob was a wonderful host who's warmth and generosity made me feel right at home.  The accommodations  were quite suitable for my needs and I would be happy to stay there if I was ever visiting Seattle again, rain or shine."
24573	492287	10.0	9.0	1513076	Robert was the perfect host -- welcoming but unobtrusive. His home is peaceful and quiet, tastefully decorated, and immaculate. We had just arrived in Seattle after a cross-country road trip starting in New York, and were so relieved to find this perfect, cozy place to stay. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to sample Robert's cooking, because we had to leave first thing in the morning. But we hope to do so next time we are in Seattle! I couldn't recommend the Birdhouse more enthusiastically. 
24574	492287	10.0	9.0	1552182	"Jason and I stayed at Seattle Discovery Birdhouse on 6/22/12 - our second experience in one week with an Airbnb host. We made our reservation 4 days in advance at the beginning of our vacation week, and truly appreciated Robert뗩 quick response, his detailed description of the place, and the fact that his availability calendar was current! That was especially helpful since we were enroute to Canada and needed to make arrangements for our trip home. Robert was responsive via email and text and flexible with our arrival schedule. 

Had the weather been a bit better that evening, we might have taken advantage of the truly lovely backyard patio and hot tub. Instead, we took Robert뗩 advice on places to eat, and visited 3 of them in the one night! No, we did not eat full meals at all of them, but instead shared an appetizer or small meal.  The house was very clean and tastefully decorated, the bed quite comfortable (and I do have trouble finding comfortable beds) and the bedroom quiet. We heard no road noise in the quiet neighborhood, so we slept well - far different than we would have slept at a Best Western, indeed! We appreciated the sense of privacy. Although our bathroom was not in our room, it was adjacent; and the host뗩 room was across the house. 
The next morning, we were treated to a fabulous paleo breakfast, at my request, which was such a treat after a week of traveling. Robert is an excellent chef, friendly and enjoyable to visit with. After breakfast we rode our bikes to Discovery Park, two blocks from the Birdhouse, for a long ride around the park to the beach and back - all before the rain started up again. In all we had a lovely stay with a gracious host. We will definitely put Seattle Discovery Birdhouse on our Airbnb favorites list! Thank you, Robert. - D&J"
24575	492287	10.0	9.0	1564192	Robert was a great host, with a beautiful home and two lovely pets. We're dog and cat lovers so this was really the perfect place for us. We were also exhausted from a week of travel, work and play, and we spent the whole night there playing with the pets and chatting with Robert. He was also very gracious when we brought our parents over to relax and regroup after their cruise returned, before we all headed out to the city. Definitely a highlight of our Seattle experience!
24576	492287	10.0	9.0	1704848	We had an amazing experience at the Birdhouse! The house itself is very pleasant, comfortable and inviting, and very beautiful as well. Robert has a very interesting collection of artistic and cultural samples of all around the world  music, architecture, art, books Also, Cooper and Kowalski are the most lovely pets! We felt in love with them! Even the mattress, that we were concerned about due to health issues, are very, very comfortable, so we had wonderful nights and woke up ready to full-time tourism days! Robert and Hannah, his daughter, are amazing hosts, very kind, very polite, caring for providing us the feeling of being home. We went to Seattle for both tourism and a Conference, and several things happened that could have compromised some of our time for tourism, but we end up having no problem because Robert helped us to solve them in advance, for example receiving a battery pack for my notebook days before we arrive. Robert also helped us to improve our English language and expressions for our presentations. He and Hannah are very special persons. The only sad part of our travel was to say goodbye
24577	492287	10.0	9.0	1713842	"Robert was a great host to my dad, brother and I while we were passing through Seattle for a bike trip. He was extremely quick to respond to any questions I had, was very accommodating, and even woke up at 5:00 AM to make us a great breakfast before the ride.

You couldn't ask for a better host or a better place to stay."
24578	492287	10.0	9.0	1773476	Robert was an excellent host. He was very accommodating with my last minute, hectic schedule and a really friendly guy. The house was beautiful, clean, and in a great location right next to the scenic Discovery  Park. I had a great time with Robert and his adorable pets. Wish I could have stayed longer!
24579	492287	10.0	9.0	1792578	"We enjoyed our brief stay at the Seattle Discovery Birdhouse and appreciated so much Robert's hospitality and flexibility with an unforeseen complication in our arrival time. We were enroute to Whistler, BC and in our rush to get packed accidentally left our passports at home in Lake Oswego, OR. We only discovered this oversight after arriving by car in Seattle and we had to meet a flight at the Vancouver BC Airport the next day at 2 pm.
 We had reservations to see the King Tut show that afternoon at the Seattle Science Center. We called Robert and explained our predicament (after the King Tut show) at 6 pm that our only option was to drive back 180 miles to Lake Oswego, get the passports and get back to Seattle to check in at midnight at Robert's place. He kindly gave us instructions for letting ourselves into our accommodation at midnight -- after our 300+ round trip to retrieve passports at our house in Oregon.
We were so happy  with our stay at the Discovery Birdhouse with Robert (and his friendly cat, Kowalski, and his St. Charles Spaniel) that we immediately decided to make a reservation for another stay on our return trip from British Columbia. 
Thank you, Robert, for making a stressful event less so.

24580	492287	10.0	9.0	1804251	After a 10 hour flight we arrived in Seattle, had to go through customs, pick up our rental car and then drove to the Birdhouse. This was our first airbnb experience and it was a good one. Robert is very welcoming and well-grounded. He is very informed about places to visit or see, so we got tips for our trip that were very valuable. Not only for Seattle but also for other places we wanted to visit on our trip from Seattle to San Francisco. We had a private bedroom and bathroom and our daughter slept on the sofa in the livingroom. She liked Cooper the dog and Kowalski and they kept her company at night. Robert prepared a wonderful breakfast, he even bought some Dutch cheese. The birdhouse is in a very nice area of Seattle with steep hills and terrific views. The area is very quiet and we felt very safe there. The garden is well-kept and great to sit and relax. You can reach downtown (Pike Place Market) in about 15 minutes and it's a very easy drive. We were so glad we choose airbnb instead of a impersonal hotel. 
24581	492287	10.0	9.0	2041569	Robert made us feel very welcome in his home.  Although the Birdhouse is a shared place,  it still felt private.  I felt welcome and comfortable.  It was nice to share the space with his wonderful dog and cat.
24582	492287	10.0	9.0	2105319	Robert has a beautiful home in one of the nicest parts of Seattle. While we were staying with him, he graciously provided us with the best breakfasts that I've had in a very long time - this man knows where to get his fruit! His dog and cat were very affectionate, and a continuous source of entertainment for us. Rob's place is a great place to stay. We were very impressed.
24583	492287	10.0	9.0	2120659	Good clean room, private bath and warm hospitality.
24584	492287	10.0	9.0	2155829	You can't beat the location: it has both of two worlds--the charming hiking area with beautiful vistas and a short drive to the city. The place was clean and comfortable. You have to meet those two pets that have pleasant personalities. Robert was a helpful host. We would highly recommend this place. Orlin&vasanta
24585	492287	10.0	9.0	2193137	Robert was a great host! He made us feel welcome in his home and even had breakfast available for us both mornings. The location of his house was perfect for our trip. We really enjoyed our walk in discovery park, which was a block from his house. 
24586	492287	10.0	9.0	2336834	We had a great experience at the birdhouse. Robert was a good host  and has a very comfortable house.  A nice neighborhood close to the city.  
24587	492287	10.0	9.0	2393963	My wife and I had an enjoyable stay at the Birdhouse in September.  The home is lovely, and well kept.  Location is excellent, right near a large  park, and close to downtown (20 minutes by bus).  Robert is very cordial and was helpful with recommendations for restaurants, places of interest, and directions. 
24588	492287	10.0	9.0	2625987	"Oh, where to start... Robert, his dog Cooper and cat Kowalski are the most welcoming trio I've met so far via Airbnb!! From the first time we met to the very end of our stay Robert was helpful, suggestive, appropriately inquisitive (which made for great conversations), a GREAT cook, and vastly knowledgeable of jazz and other types of music. All those qualities plus his attention to detail came together so that we could have  a pleasant and relaxing stay in his home. The location of the Birdhouse is in a prime location minutes from the Discovery Park and other attractions in Seattle. The exterior of the house is breathtaking and the interior is equally taken care of and above all very clean. The private room and bathroom are conveniently right next to each other and the pull out bed has a comfortable easy to blow up air mattress. Breakfast cooked by Robert on our first morning was delicious and just when i thought it couldn't get better Robert filled the living room area with the most relaxing sounds of Jazz and other world music that he played at the most appropriate times and volume level. Hence, I, without reservation, recommend that you consider staying at Robert's Seattle Discovery Birdhouse.

Thank You Robert and hope to see you soon. "
24589	492287	10.0	9.0	2896582	"I said in my first review of the ""Birdhouse"" in May 2012 that I would stay again.  And I did!  Just left this morning (Nov 2012).  Again a very pleasant stay with a friendly welcome from Robert, Copper the dog and Kowalski the cat.  Our (husband and myself) schedule was demanding, as is the schedule of grandparents determined to bond with and begin the spoiling process of a new granddaughter, so we only slept and showered at the ""birdhouse"". And missed the shared glass of wine with Robert.  Next time.
The shared house is private and the bed is so comfortable. I slept so well after coming in from the 2am feeding.  He has provided some nice amenities in the room: chocolates, water glasses, (Seattle has great water), plenty of suitcase stands.
The birds visiting the front and back yard are fascinating and Robert is ready to identify them and provide info on plants that attract the birds.
The neighborhood is peaceful and relaxed.  I wonder if there is a house for sale down the street...?  No, I'll just stay with Robert again."
24590	492287	10.0	9.0	2961993	"Robert has created an beautifully detailed home where Agnieszka and I felt very welcome.  He is an engaging, gracious and thoughtful host who is really at ease in caring for others.   

In the midst of a working on an intense art project in Seattle, our stay with Robert was a respite.  I look forward to keeping touch with him (and his entertaining pets...)"
24591	492287	10.0	9.0	3070838	Rob is a great  host! His place has a great ambiance that is really pleasant and inviting. The room you rent is like a cabana and has a sense of being very relaxing. the house is very cozy and well decorated on the inside and landscaped on the outside. Great guides await you beside  your bed in your room. The bathroom is a step into the 40's w original tile from when the hosue was constructed. Magnolia is a pleasant village like neighborhood and it is safe and convenient. Rob is highly intelligent and very knowledgable. The  Birdhouse is a great choice for a stay in seattle.
24592	492287	10.0	9.0	3167154	Robert was a truly thoughtful and caring host who made us feel like staying at home, especially when we visited during Christmas time. We were provided with all the necessary amenities in the birdhouse plus the serenity of a quiet, clean, and safe neighborhood. Since we went out all day almost every day, we did not get to enjoy Robert's highly praised cooking talent, but at least we got plenty of play time with Cooper the dog and Kowalski the kitty. They were the most social and fun-loving animals we've ever met, keeping us company 24/7. We miss them a lot after we left, so hopefully next time we're in Seattle we'll be able to reserve our stay again with Robert. On top of everything nice and cozy, he got us some adorable Christmas gifts as well. It's hard not to want to come back!
24593	492287	10.0	9.0	3312973	"Our stay at the Discovery Birdhouse was great. We loved the location because it was easy to get to neighborhoods like Fremont and Ballard and easy to get downtown as well. We spent our last day hiking around in Discovery Park, which is right next to the house. 

As for the house, it is very comfortable, especially the bed. The bedroom is a bit small, but the bed is very comfy. Robert was very welcoming and helpful. He recommended an excellent restaurant near Jazz Alley. We loved his sweet pets and we enjoyed the music he played. Overall, I heartily recommend it."
24594	492287	10.0	9.0	3478068	"Robert was an excellent host to my niece and I! Very kind and lovely attention to detail. The room was quaint, and the bed comfortable and the house quiet. We opted to have breakfast made by him, which was a perfect choice. Tasty and covered all the bases... and mind you I like breakfast! He also gave us some very helpful recommendations of other places to check out for food and shopping. The location is easy to get to, very near Magnolia park with some of the most beautiful views of the puget sound you can get in Seattle. The ""boys"" - Cooper and Kowalski were adorable, fun and very respectful. I will happily stay there again and recommend it highly!"
24595	492287	10.0	9.0	3601792	Robert is a fantastic host.  He is very thoughtful and gracious.  We were supplied with delicious fruit to go along with our breakfasts.  Our host searched his music library to find music to suit our wants which helped make the fruit all the more tantalizing to our taste buds.  The man was never in our way, but was always available to help us.  Kowalski and Cooper lent their own loving ways to our stay which helped us feel right at home. 
24596	492287	10.0	9.0	3845882	"The birdhouse looks exactly like in the picture! It is nice, clean, and homey. I personally love the backyard ( it is so gorgeous) The location is perfect, it's really close to Seattle Center.
Too bad I didn't spend much time at the house, I had to meet friends. However, Rob is a great host, very respectful and friendly.. If you're looking a place to stay that is close to downtown Seattle, I highly recommend to stay at the birdhouse!"
24597	492287	10.0	9.0	4047754	"loved the Birdhouse! the view driving down Magnolia  to downtown Seattle was so pretty.
 Host was friendly but unobtrusive; kitchen very compact and well equipped. Pets were quiet and friendly.  I would definitely stay here again!"
24598	492287	10.0	9.0	4621051	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Robert 's beautiful 'birdhouse'. The bed was comfy & warm. Robert was the perfect host giving us many tips on how to fully enjoy our 4 days in Seattle. He even drove us to the beginning of a beautiful walking trail. The neighborhood is very safe & upscale. An easy, short distance from downtown on bus #24. We enjoyed relaxing in Robert's backyard - he even has an outdoor jacuzzi! Plus he has two charmingly adorable pets - Cooper & Kowalski - who welcome you as part of the family. We would definately stay here again.
24599	492287	10.0	9.0	4848149	Robert was an enthusiastic host, who provided not only a very clean but comfortable place to rest.  He was quick to share what he loves about the area and easy going to let us take his maps with us on our outings.  We enjoyed that he had lovable pets and we would definitely recommend his place to stay!  We will probably return ourselves someday for another trip to Seattle and would love to stay with him again.  His home is very close to downtown Seattle and a block from Discovery Park which is amazing. We loved not being in hotel and feeling like tourists....we got to have that neighborhood feel and loved coming back to a home and not a busy hotel.
24600	492287	10.0	9.0	4895386	"Robert is a pretty gentle man, also his companies, Cooper(dog)&Kowalski(cat) are totally cute& friendly! I felt as if I was in my house. I slept next to Cooper&Kowalski, enjoyed drinking japanese beer with Robert , walk at Discovery park with Cooper, talked about japanese budo, aikido etc. I'd stayed there for just only 3 days , so I wanted to be with them more timeX) He advised me some places for sightseeing. It was very helpful, so I really enjoyed seattle. If you like animals & hope kind & friendly host, I recommend this""BIRDHOUSE""!"
24601	492287	10.0	9.0	5152283	"It was a pleasure to stay at the 'birdhouse'. Robert is an excellent host who takes great care of his surroundings and gives you detailed descriptions of different neighborhoods when asked :) his animal 'companions' are entertaining and open minded as well. Beautiful, quiet surroundings come w easy access to other areas of Seattle. Thank You, Robert, Cooper and Kowalski.
A bientot!"
24602	492287	10.0	9.0	5319457	"I stayed in the birdhouse in June 2013 with my 9, 14, and 17 year-old kids.  Two of us got the (comfy) bed in the private bedroom, two of us were on the pull-out couch in the living room.  Even though the two on the couch were really right in the middle of things, they were able to sleep in, and Robert gave us appropriate privacy during the stay.  

He was a friendly and engaging host, and had provided an assortment host of tourist brochures and details on the house.  The house itself is on a quiet residential street, a half a block from Discovery Park.  We went there twice, and walked the 2.8 mile loop trail and the shorter (but hilly) South Beach Trail.  

The house features a very friendly small dog and cat.  My kids enjoyed playing with them."
24603	492287	10.0	9.0	5586458	"We had a great time in Seattle.
Rob is a great guy and gave us really good suggestions.  He was helpful and very accomodating.
If you like animals - he has 2 great pets.  Both very friendly and affectionate.
His house is right next to discovery park and we enjoyed runs in the morning with views of the Puget sounds.  
We had a car so did not have to worry about access and found getting around Seattle fairly easy.
We enjoyed our stay and will most probably visit again the next time we are in Seattle"
24604	492287	10.0	9.0	5674575	"My mom & two boys stayed at the birdhouse with Robert & I can't say enough good things about the house & Robert as our host!! He was SO pleasant & Full of good info about Seattle & the nearby Discovery park. His house was comfortable & very clean & his dog & cat for us made it all the more comfortable. 
Magnolia is a beautiful neighborhood & easily accessible via bus, car, foot & bicycle. 
You would be lucky to get to stay at the Birdhouse!!"
24605	492287	10.0	9.0	5972533	Clean house and room.  15 minutes from any cool neighborhood--so, be sure to have a car!  Good coffee in the morning.  Host works/lives at home.  Good if you're coming to crash and have a clean bedroom and  bathroom.
24606	492287	10.0	9.0	6254741	Thanks Rob for the lovely and peaceful stay at the Birdhouse! Great location within walking distance of a most beautiful park and a very comfortable bed. Almost didn't want to go home. 
24607	492287	10.0	9.0	6340133	We enjoyed our stay in the Birdhouse, which was located in a quiet neighborhood, just near Discovery Park. Robert gave us a lot of privacy and we felt very comfortable in the house. Breakfast things were always ready on the table in the morning, which was very nice. The cat and the dog were very playful and kept us company when we were in the house. Overall it was a great experience and we would recommend staying there if you are looking for a safe and comfortable place to stay, well located to visit downtown and other neighborhoods like Ballard and Fremont. 
24608	492287	10.0	9.0	6673555	We stayed at The Birdhouse for three nights and were absolutely comfortable the whole time. The host is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Offers breakfast, love from his two well behaved pets, a glorious and peaceful backyard, beautiful Discovery park right next door, and an AMAZING digital music collection + surround sound. Very inspiring stay for an artist but also cozy for couples :] Will return for sure! 
24609	492287	10.0	9.0	7015371	"We received a very warm welcome, from the host and his pets both. Robert is knowledgeable about the city and has one of the nicest, well behaved dogs I've ever met, excessive licking not withstanding. :)

The room is super-clean and in a very very quiet location, only the occasional airplane overhead and cat mewling at the door disturbed our sleep, there is no street noise at all. I highly recommend staying here if you want to enjoy Seattle while still being able to escape to a quiet sanctuary at the end of a hectic day running around town.

One thing to keep in mind is that this room is at the very north end of Magnolia, so it's good to memorize how to quickly get in and out of the area or else you'll get lost wandering steep hills and cobblestone alleys for hours, nothing a quick map search won't help. 

A great place to stay, hands down."
24610	492287	10.0	9.0	7104453	We loved the Birdhouse. The room is very comfortable, the private bathroom is great, the hot tub is a big, big plus, and Robert is really friendly and helpful. Wonderful cold breakfasts included in the price. Robert clearly enjoys hosting guests and was great just to chat to. And his animals are about the cutest things imaginable! 
24611	492287	10.0	9.0	7350374	"This was the first time that I booked a room via airbnb and everything worked well. Because of the pictures of the birdhouse, the positive reviews and the location I wrote a request to Robert - who responded already after minutes.

Communication with Robert via email, text messages and phone was good and all necessary information were available. It didn't work out to meet each other but access to the house was organized at the time of arrival and everything looked like shown on the pictures. The cute cat gave me a warm welcome and it was a pleasure to give her a scoop of food in the morning and the evening :) 

The garden of the Birdhouse is wonderful, the house clean and the bed is very comfortable. Private bathroom is next to the bedroom and a hot tub in the back yard ... which was broken at the time of my stay - since a spare part for repair did not arrive on time - wasn't a problem for me.  

Parking on the road in front of the house is also not a problem - enough space available. The birdhouse is located next to Discovery Park (great hiking to light house) in a wonderful area north west of Seattle down town. Very quite at night - no street noise ... only the meowing cat in front of the door woke me up once. 

Drive to downtown took me approximately 10-15 minutes and the Magnolia Blvd offers nice views to the ocean and downtown.

Long story short - Robert is a great host and communication worked perfect. If you are looking for a quite room in reachable distance to Seattle downtown - this is the place to stay.
"
24612	492287	10.0	9.0	7702185	the Birdhouse was a gorgeous location! Tucked away in a beautiful part of Seattle, with a bed that you'll regret having to get out of! Say hi to the wonderfully cuddly dog and cat while you're there. 
24613	492287	10.0	9.0	8121812	We really enjoyed our stay with Robert.  His place is in a lovely neighborhood, and is very nicely furnished.  It was a very relaxing setting, and yet a quick 10-15 min drive into downtown or other nearby shopping areas.  Robert was very pleasant to communicate with, and had a number of helpful Seattle area magazines, maps of walking tours, etc.  His cat and dog were very friendly, and we enjoyed listening to his extensive music collection. 
24614	492287	10.0	9.0	8952130	"I stayed at Rob's classy home for 2 nights and it was a very easy and fun experience.  Rob is a friendly host with a ton of info about the area.
The bed and pillow were much better than I have at home.
I would not hesitate to rent from him again.  Highly recommend."
24615	492287	10.0	9.0	13461625	Had a great stay with Robert in his beautiful house! Robert was kind enough to accept our request when we had a last minute change of plans with our trip. We enjoyed the breakfast he provided each morning as well as his two friendly pets. He was a great host who provided excellent advice on places to visit and places to get great seafood!
24616	492287	10.0	9.0	14141537	Rob was super friendly and accommodating when we booked last minute and it was extremely nice and comfortable to stay at his place for two nights. The breakfast is really good and his neighborhood is quiet but close to Discovery Park and isn't too far from downtown. This was my first experience at Airbnb and Rob made it a very good one! 勇 
24617	492287	10.0	9.0	14215527	Robert was a great host and his place was comfortable and immaculately cared for. The front and rear gardens are beautiful and I wish I could have taken advantage of the tub in warmer weather.  Robert provided a nice continental breakfast with yogurt and fruit. The neighborhood is great and close to Ballard Locks and the Botanical Gardens. Cooper the 'guard' dog was a sweet companion.  Thanks again Robert.  
24618	492287	10.0	9.0	14583623	We had a fantastic stay at the Birdhouse! It is right next to gorgeous Discovery Park, where we took beautiful sunset walks. Both the pull-out couch and the bedroom were very comfy and Robert provided us with ample privacy. We spent sunny mornings on the back patio with the cutest pup in the world and at night soaked our bike-weary bones in the hot tub! Robert provided us with delicious coffee and breakfast in the morning and was an incredibly gracious host. 
24619	492287	10.0	9.0	14800021	Bob was an excellent host.  His home is lovely.  The garden area is a wonderful space for outside dining. 
24620	492287	10.0	9.0	14933325	Robert was a wonderful host. The moment my family and I stepped foot into his home, he welcomed us with unbelievable hospitality. Throughout our stay, he offered recommendations on parks, restaurants, and site seeing locations. As first time tourists in Seattle, he helped us navigate the city and explore some hidden gems. He even went out of his way to lead us to a charming a hiking trail close by the neighborhood. Every morning we woke up to the smell of toast and freshly brewed coffee. If you have any hesitations on where to stay, look no further than Robert's home. 
24621	492287	10.0	9.0	15697255	I would highly recommend the Birdhouse to anyone looking for a welcoming and serene stay while in Seattle. Robert and his family of pets were warm and gracious hosts. The location is perfect; close to everything by car, great biking and walking right out the door, but quiet and peaceful at night. Really enjoyed our daily fresh fruit and coffee for breakfast, and evening jazz music. 
24622	492287	10.0	9.0	15972691	Thank you we felt very welcome in your home.
24623	492287	10.0	9.0	16056451	"Robert's hospitality was outstanding, and we had a fantastic time during our 2 night stay. The room and house is very colorful and welcoming, the pets very friendly and charming.

The Birdhouse enjoys a wonderfully serene neighborhood, very quiet yet with some car2go rental availability. The hot tub feels great after a long day, and Robert pointed us towards great nearby restaurants. This proved an ideal getaway for me and the missus, and I highly recommend it!"
24624	492287	10.0	9.0	16357300	"Robert is a wonderful host.  Everything met our expectations - the home is charming, the garden is lovely.  Hannah, his daughter was helpful and friendly.  Even the sweet dog and kitty seemed clued in to making this Airbnb work well.  We also loved the Magnolia district and nearby park,
Thanks to everyone,  this was a great 5 day stay!
"
24625	492287	10.0	9.0	16564908	Robert was a great host, taking the time to give us information about the city (we had never visited Seattle before) while also giving us our own space while we were there.  The description provided on Airbnb was accurate and his expectations and rules were clear, reasonable, and easy to follow.  His cat and dog, Cooper, were both welcoming and friendly  not a nuisance at all.  The two rooms were clean and comfortable and Robert even had a pullout couch in the living room for an additional guest who joined us on the last evening we stayed there.  His fantastic location near Discovery Park was a huge bonus as well.  Overall, we had a very pleasant stay in Robert뗩 beautiful home and wouldn뗪 hesitate to stay there again! 
24626	492287	10.0	9.0	16991079	Rob and his menagerie were very welcoming hosts.  Our teenaged daughters loved playing with the very friendly cat and dogs (Rob was boarding a neighbor's dog during our stay, which was no trouble to us at all).  We especially appreciated the great breakfasts and the evening relaxation in the hot tub after a long day of visiting Seattle.  It's an easy bus ride into town and the location, on a quiet street in a subdued neighborhood, provided restful sleep.  Thanks so much!
24627	492287	10.0	9.0	17213840	Upon arrival, we found we were staying in a charming house, in a great neighborhood.  The host family,  Rob, his dog Cooper and Kitty the cat, couldn't have been more welcoming.  Our rooms and bath were private and every morning we were treated to great coffee, fresh fruit and various breads, jams and other good things.  Being next to Discovery Park was an added bonus.  Wonderful walks, hikes just outside your doorstep.  We highly recommend staying here and hope to come back someday.  Many thanks.
24628	492287	10.0	9.0	17455705	"My stay at the Birdhouse was my first experience with airbnb and Robert has set my standards high. He made us feel very welcome.

The rooms, bathroom and kitchen were good. Robert was available when you needed him and gave some really good advice on moving around in Seattle (locks/one bus away), things to do, restaurants and pubs. The dog and cat were just as Robert, laid back and social. 

Location is good, well reachable by bus and a good quiet neighboorhood close to the wonderful Ballard and Freemont.

His communication by email was informative and on time. All in all we (my friend and I) were very happy with our stay and enjoyed the conversations with Robert on Seattle and lots of other things.

"
24629	492287	10.0	9.0	17567869	"We were excited to stay at Robert's house on the last couple days of a family vacation. The house was well cared for, Robert was very helpful and we enjoyed the neighborhood, taking advantage of nearby Discovery Park and the Ballard Locks. 

The one disappointment was that we were expecting two rooms, one for the grownups and one for our seven-year old but found out the day before our arrival that the second room was already occupied. Our choice was to squeeze all three people into a small bedroom or make use of a pullout sofa in the living room. We chose the sofa but it wasn뗪 the restful, private sleep we had hoped for.
"
24630	492287	10.0	9.0	17686632	Robert was very helpful. Two of us had to sleep in the sitting-room. The couch was large and comfortable but the sitting-room is a walk-through room. So actually for four people it's not so good - for two it is great.
24631	492287	10.0	9.0	18363058	"Robert was charming and welcomed us to his pretty home in Magnolia. It's small but cute with a lovely backyard we had breakfast in. Low-key breakfasts of yogurt, fruit, and toast. Comfortable bed. We would go back! 

His pets are also very sweet especially the friendly, portly cat."
24632	492287	10.0	9.0	18673741	"What a nice stay in Seattle! Everything was great and perfectly conformed.
The house and location were very convenient. Quiet and well connected to go downtown.
Thanks Robert for your welcome. It was a pleasure meeting you. We appreciated your availability and advices.
What about the breakfast뵨ating outside everyday under the sun was just perfect.
"
24633	492287	10.0	9.0	18825742	"This is a lovely spot in a quiet residential neighborhood, and is perfect for two people staying in the private room. Robert knows the area well and is full of great tips, and there's a fresh breakfast  of fruit (sliced papaya and local apples when we were there), coffee, tea, bread and spreads...all beautifully laid out on the best ceramic ware. The back garden is absolutely lovely, and I only wish it wasn't raining!

The neighborhood is about 15-20 minutes out of Seattle, but it's a ""real"" neighborhood, and right along the water and near a great park (we were in town for a wedding at said park). 

The private room is compact but well equipped, the bathroom is right next door to the private room, and Robert's room is on the other side of the house, through the living room. There was an exchange student staying there in the same ""wing"" in another private room when we were there, just to note that there is another guest in the house. He was super respectful and we barely noticed him, but just to note.

24634	492287	10.0	9.0	21627137	Robert is a great easy going host.  The property is beautifully landscaped, private and well kept... hot tub, wonderful!  The printed out house rules are straightforward and clear.  Birdhouse is on a quiet residential street.  We would certainly stay again when we're in Seattle next.
24635	492287	10.0	9.0	40008818	Robert was hospitable and wonderful with local recommendations and directions. His home is lovely and relaxing, with a great back patio.
24636	492287	10.0	9.0	40985502	This was my first Airbnb.  Robert was a great host - quick to respond to all my inquiries, provided helpful suggestions for exploring the neighborhood, and was welcoming and friendly.  The accomodations were clean, private, comfortable and quiet.  The backyard is lovely - great place for breakfast (Robert provided coffee, toast, yogurt and fruit - it was very nice).  The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood and is one block from Discovery Park, which provides trails and beach walks.  It's also possible to walk to Ballard for excellent dining and shopping.   I was on foot and public transportation was easy to negotiate from the airport.  I only spent one night, so had limited opportunities to explore, but I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. 
24637	492287	10.0	9.0	41452841	Robert's place was a great stopover. We ended up arriving later in the evening but everything was all set up for us. As we were heading out he greeted us and gave us some suggestions for the nearby park that were very helpful. I would recommend booking with him. 
24638	492287	10.0	9.0	46712097	"Among the plentiful birds we encountered at the huge & diverse park down the street from the Birdhouse lurked only one ""boo-bird"": the leaking air mattress that was our bed.  

The host (Robert) could not be more accommodating or considerate, going out of his way to ensure that everything was just right and that communication  was always available.  The home is stylish and inviting: we felt like we were at home.

If you are considering a visit to the Emerald City, I would absolutely recommend the Birdhouse as a ""home base"" for day trips ranging from Tacoma to Snoqualmie Pass to Bellingham!"
24639	492287	10.0	9.0	47751825	We really enjoyed our stay.  Robert was very polite and incredibly respectful of our space, not only in the personal space provided but also in the common areas if we were using them.  He made us coffee every morning and put out fresh fruit (which in our case was pineapple that was amazing!), english muffins (or bread of some sort), peanut butter, butter and delicious raspberry preserves!  The bus stop was not too far, nor was the ride to downtown to Seattle.  The hot tub was a great bonus as well.   
24640	492287	10.0	9.0	50580428	"The ""Birdhouse""....cozy and comfortable, nothing fancy.
Robert is a courteous, attentive and responsible host. He said he would be available at any time to acquaint us with the house, and he was. Accommodation is in the spare bedroom of a family house. It is a small room, and shares a bathroom with the daughter of the house, who still lives there. A double inflatable bed takes up 85% of the room; space would be too tight for a couple. As I was on my own, it worked out.
There is no TV in the room. The room and the house were very clean, clean towels in the bathroom. Robert hosts a continental breakfast every morning for the guest/s, usually accompanied by his charming red-haired tabby cat, and a sweet King Charles Spaniel who get on perfectly together."
24641	492287	10.0	9.0	55200886	The Birdhouse is the most delightful retreat, and our host Robert is a very interesting man.  My husband enjoyed many conversations with him.  The location in Magnolia is perfect for accessing all the attractions around Magnolia, with easy access downtown.  Our room was very comfortable and all provisions for our stay were available.  Our little dog made a new friend in Cooper, Robert's King Charles spaniel, and a friendly darling dog.  
26734	257140	10.0	9.0	696793	The flat was more like a suite. Darik set things up like a hotel with all the accoutrements such as laundry soap, shower stuff, etc. It was the perfect mix for our stay. The building was in a good location and had everything you could want. The space itself was perfect for two people. I'd highly recommend this.
26735	257140	10.0	9.0	727247	Derick has several apartments in the location I stayed in and they are all squeaky clean, stocked with everything one could need, and the building is in a prime location just a few blocks from the downtown area and Pike Place Market.  
26736	257140	10.0	9.0	757861	This is a great condo - really well-maintained and fabulous location.  Super-easy to check-in and check-out.  Professionally managed but with lots of friendly little touches.  I would definitely recommend staying in any of Darik's properties.
26737	257140	10.0	9.0	842405	My husband and I stayed here with our 2 year old daughter. While the space is small, it had everything we needed and was in a very convenient location. Highly recommended.
26738	257140	10.0	9.0	849743	"We had a great experience renting this property. The apartment was flawless, the location was excellent, and the transaction went smoothly. We walked to Pike Place, bought some seafood and cooked in the fully equipped kitchen, having the chance to experience Seattle like a local!
The apartment is small but the four of us fit comfortably (along with 5 suitcases).
I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle. "
26739	257140	10.0	9.0	11135773	Great apartment in a happening part of town. 
26740	257140	10.0	9.0	11479308	Darik and his apartment were wonderful - great location, easy check in and out, and any issues or questions we had were immediately handled. included parking - a big help as that can be costly in seattle. Thanks Darik! 
26741	257140	10.0	9.0	13012610	Unit 621 is a delightfully appointed getaway; indeed the photos are VERY accurate of this lovely little apartment.  It is super clean, thoughtfully detailed all around, and welcoming.  The location is ideal for walking to all downtown and waterfront amenities - which we did daily during our stay.  Having available and secure parking was a must for us and again, the locale made quick jaunts to the far reaches of town easy.  Our only disappointments were the lack of air conditioning (our stay was during a particularly warm week and all windows face western sun - but fans are provided and of course this is noted in the property amenities) and the slow speed of the internet connection (our laptops remained frustratingly packed while we resorted to 4G data service for all travel queries).  While the location IS ideal for getting around town, be aware that the apartment is directly above a major bus route / stop.
26742	257140	10.0	9.0	17773417	Communication was great, someone always answered the phone or an email right away. Apartment was well-stocked, we were welcomed with bottled water, popcorn, coffee, and tea. Parking at MODA was a huge plus as we could walk everywhere from the location.
26743	257140	10.0	9.0	22023045	Wonderful location. Everything was within walking distance. The apartment was very nice and cozy. The only downside was the slow internet
26744	257140	10.0	9.0	26159593	Had a great 2 week stay in Darik's apartment.  Wonderful location, central to many attractions, restaurants and shopping.  I had an initial issue with the WiFi not working but Darik and his staff were able to fix the issue within a few short hours.  I stayed here for a work trip and found the apartment to be well equipped with everything I needed for my stay.   A well appointed kitchen made it easy for me to make dinner.  Overall, it's a great place to stay and fantastic service!  
26745	257140	10.0	9.0	30502587	Nice place in great location. Building is a little loud (I think there was a small dog in the next apartment) and the furniture makes the place feel smaller than it is, but the neighborhood is great, and the bathroom and bedroom are very nice. Very easy transit connections and very walkable to lots of locations. 
26746	257140	10.0	9.0	37568300	The host made sure to send all directions and contact information prior to arrival. He was very quick with responses to any question. He also left a nice welcome basket with some nummy snacks. The location of the apartment was awesome, so easy to walk downtown. The washer and dryer was a nice plus half way through our trip! We definitely enjoyed the scenery from the rooftop patio. So beautiful!! Thanks!
26747	257140	10.0	9.0	37945593	Host was clear with instruction on how to arrive and depart and has a service where all calls are directed. Place was just as described with a great balcony for sitting out in the summer! Location is excellent! Thanks for a great stay in Belltown.
26748	257140	10.0	9.0	38359863	The place was great! It was clean and accurately described. A very good benefit was the free parking in a secured parking garage. Wihtout AC, it was hot when we arrived. The host has tried to use 4 cooling fans for this hot summer in the pacific nw, but it was still warm. Hopefully a window unit might be able to be installed in future. 
26749	257140	10.0	9.0	47254594	Great location!! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. We would definitely stay here again. 
26750	257140	10.0	9.0	49304581	The host canceled this reservation 272 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
26751	257140	10.0	9.0	49606618	This was out first airbnb experience and it was great!!! We flew into Seattle with our toddler and decided not to get a rental car. We didn't bring a car seat or stroller and basically took the light rail, bus, and walked everywhere. This unit in Belltown is the PERFECT location if you are trying to go minimal like we did. I don't even know if there were neighbors because the unit was very quiet. There is a little bit of street noise since it faced the street, but that was expected and the unit is almost on the top floor. It only sucked when a fire truck drove by in the middle of the night with sirens. On a Friday night it was non-stop. The rest of our stay it was much more quiet. Definitely bearable though. The unit was also clean. Laundry in unit was very convenient since we packed light. And the roof top deck is FABULOUS. We ended each night with hot cocoa or hot tea over looking the city. You can see Puget Sound from the roof as well. The only negative was that across the street is a mental health clinic, but no one bothered us. I would definitely recommend staying here.
26752	257140	10.0	9.0	50631956	Great place, just as described. 
26753	257140	10.0	9.0	55640277	Host was clear with instruction on how to arrive and depart.  Place was just as described and in a good location. 
35328	4106041	10.0	9.0	20456467	It was a great experience to stay in Seattle! The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location is really convenience to reach everywhere, and located in a very safe residence area. Miranda is really a nice, warm and kind person !!! I'm happy that I made the decision so right : )
35329	4106041	10.0	9.0	21795062	"If I could give six stars, I would! Miranda was a wonderful host - warm, welcoming, responsive, efficient, and respectful of her guests' privacy. The apartment (a junior 1bd) is superbly located, stylishly furnished, very fresh and modern. 

The apartment is top floor (!), with high ceiling. One thing to be aware of is the fact that the apartment faces an office building across the street and hence we kept blinds down during daytime on weekdays. "
35330	4106041	10.0	9.0	22558482	Really great location, very walkable. Beautiful place, very nicely set up and perfect for business + mini-vacation in Seattle. Miranda was super helpful and available for any questions.
35331	4106041	10.0	9.0	24600641	"Price gouging at it's finest!  So I paid $3300 for a stay for a month for an apartment that rents for $1690 tops because it has furniture, a view of an office building, and horrible water pressure?  

I started doing AirBnB years ago by renting out my room in our cramped NYC apartment because it was a way to offer guests who couldn't afford a hotel room a place they could stay in at a cheap rate while meeting cool people.  Since then I've traveled all over and met some truly amazing people who I hope to visit again.  My stay here was the complete opposite of what AirBnB is all about.  I never met Miranda she sent her friend to give me the key upon arrival.  Apparently she's never actually lived a day in the apartment either since when I called to ask how the shower worked she called maintenance for help.  It was ultimately not the shower, just the terrible the water pressure in the building.  And there's a whole list of instructions on here not to let anyone know you're staying there, probably because when I looked at a unit for rent in the building the leasing agent told me there is no subletting allowed or the tenant can get thrown out.  

Rent here at your own risk, had I had the time to shop around I would have learned most furnished places go for $1600 a month tops.  In fact I'm now renting a great furnished place with parking included in a much nicer building with a view and a gym for $1400.  I chose this rental because it was the closest walking distance to work, only to have Miranda try to price gouge me another $300 when I needed a place just for a few days until mine was ready and wanted to extend the rental.  Needless to say my work put me up instead for those few days and I was happy to get out of this place.  The apartment is nice, but not even remotely close to worth the money.  Learn from my mistake, do your homework and shop around or break up your stay and stay with other AirBnB people who actually live in their homes."
35332	4106041	10.0	9.0	24698571	The unit was located in a pleasant neighborhood, very close to downtown and walk-able.  Was a nice secured entry building and the unit was very clean and spacious.   The one bedroom was a junior one bedroom, but fine for two people.
35333	4106041	10.0	9.0	25566080	We had a fantastic experience with Miranda and Michael. They were extremely professional and friendly (they even greeted us with a bottle of wine!). The room was exactly as advertised and very clean. They really helped make our trip to Seattle enjoyable with such an easy process. Thank you guys for the hospitality. Overall, great experience! 
35334	4106041	10.0	9.0	25732064	My stay was absolutely fantastic! The place looked exactly as advertised in the pictures. I was greeted with a warm welcome and wine. There were even chocolates on my bed. Any trouble I had, they were quick to respond! Someone mentioned the water pressure and I would agree it is not the best but honestly it was not an issue. I would stay at this property again in a heart beat. Such a great location to the heart of the city and super close to the convention center. For being a work trip, this location offered ther perfect combo of comfort and convenience. Thank you Michael-- you and Wally were sooo wonderful!! 
35335	4106041	10.0	9.0	26529955	My boyfriend and I arrived in Seattle early so Miranda was nice enough to let us check in early. She couldn't meet with us at the time so she had her friend help us get situated. There was a bottle of wine and chocolates on our bed, which was absolutely sweet. The place was super cute and at the heart of Seattle so everything was really close by. 
35336	4106041	10.0	9.0	28619835	I enjoyed my stay at Eve's & Michael unit a lot. The location is terrific, you can walk to all major attractions and the Convention center. There is a great all organic store 4 blocks away, the coffee downstairs is to wake up for and the rooftop with a grill is a nice addition. I also very much liked the bed - so comfy. Eve was extremely helpful and welcoming. The bottle of wine was a nice welcome too!
35337	4106041	10.0	9.0	29924728	My stay at this apartment was all I needed and more for a great stay in a Seattle. The location is super close to town and transit to other areas but also quiet. Especially great for me was its proximity to the convention centre should you similarly be attending an event. The apartment is bigger than expected, bed is super comfy, wi-fi is fast plus Eve and Michael have set up some great connections to uber and local grocery delivery. A+ all round.
35338	4106041	10.0	9.0	30494435	"I came to Seattle for a conference and was looking for a place close to the convention center. The apartment was everything advertised and Eve went above and beyond to make my first Airbnb experience a great one. 

The apartment was just a short walk from the conference center and convenient to shopping and dining establishments. The kitchen was stocked well enough to allow me to cook my meals in.  

Any time I had a question, Eve was very quick to respond.  I let her know of one minor maintenance issue and told her that she could wait to have it corrected because it was not a major deal.  It was fixed within 2 hours while I was out. 

There are many more positives about the apartment, but I will close with this. Any time my wife and I return to Seattle, we will call Eve. "
35339	4106041	10.0	9.0	31546966	I had a really nice stay, the bed was super comfortable, the room was really beautiful, and the apartment is very nice. My host, Eve, was friendly, although I barely saw her while I was doing my own thing! The area is perfect, very close to downtown, nice shops, caf칠s and some of the best food I've eaten this trip. Easy access to public transit and public parks. What a nice spot! I totally recommend staying here. :)
35340	4106041	10.0	9.0	31841074	Eve had excellent communication before and during our stay. Her place is perfect if you need to be by the invention center. Her responses were almost immediate. 
35341	4106041	10.0	9.0	32978352	"Awesome Eve's place was right in the center of everything we wanted to see.  We had planned on using Uber to get around however we were so close to all the sights we wanted to visit we just walked.  The apartment was small but nicely laid out and everything was very clean and fresh feeling.  Felt like being at home.  I have a hard time sleeping when I travel and am not sleeping on my own bed.  The bed here fit me like a glove.  Eve is very professional she met us and showed us all we need to know.  Well make sure and ask her about using the shower.  It has a little water saving device which was a little tricky to figure out once I got in the shower.  Once you know what to do the shower is wonderful.  If you rent this place it will help make your trip perfect.
"
35342	4106041	10.0	9.0	33616386	Eve was such an amazing host, she was responsive and truly cared about my overall experience.  I look forward to visiting Seattle again soon and getting an Airbnb from Eve.
35343	4106041	10.0	9.0	34153201	The listing was very accurate, exactly like the pictures and Eve was great! She made the whole process super easy and was very accommodating to my flight times. The apartment was just like a hotel, very modern and clean. She gave great instructions so you knew exactly what to do for check out and how to leave the house. Next time I'm in Seattle I would totally rent from Eve again! 
35344	4106041	10.0	9.0	36016273	Wonderful stay in a lovely spot! Great location to walk to everything. Eve was a kind and conscientious host. Definitely recommended. 
35345	4106041	10.0	9.0	37270809	"I had an absolutely amazing experience this past weekend staying at Eve & Michael's Airbnb in downtown Seattle!

This was my first time using Airbnb and thanks to these two it will not be my last! The apartment was completely decked out and furnished by someone with great taste! I particularly enjoyed the art work in the apartment and the choices made in furniture selection that gave it a very uptown and modern feel!

Eve was extremely accommodating and made our stay a true pleasure. She suggested great sites to see and fun places to visit for a great night life. She even bought us a bottle of wine!

Hand's down Eve & Michael made my Airbnb experience and my trip to Seattle was no doubt enhanced as a result. I will be sure to look them up the next time I am in town!"
35346	4106041	10.0	9.0	38142369	We had a great stay. The apartment was exactly as described in the listing and perfectly clean. The bed was comfortable and other than some road noise from the freeway, it was very quiet.  We appreciated the amount of space and fabulous location. Eve was always prompt with her responses. We would stay here again!
35347	4106041	10.0	9.0	44018357	Really enjoyed our trip to Seattle- nice, clean apt (with a beautiful roof top deck!) with everything you need; good location; and Morgan was very professional and easy to communicate with. Would def recommend! 
35558	5793477	9.0	9.0	29876349	Niki was a superb host! She was very welcoming and knowledgeable and made me feel at home. Her apartment is really clean and tidy and has a few good features like a couch outside on a sunny balcony + couch with TV and stereo was great. Her bed is super comfy and she provides towels, sheets etc. The neighbourhood is nice enough too, very close to the bottom of town and not too far from Capitol Hill, bars and food places. I highly recommend staying with Niki! 
35559	5793477	9.0	9.0	30408448	Niki was a sweet and gracious hostess who made me feel at home instantly. As soon as I arrived, I was greeted with a German beer on the balcony in the nice weather. Her apartment was a 15 min walk from downtown which I enjoyed every day of my conference at the convention center. It was a very clean and neat apartment, and the balcony was key for hanging out in the evening. Great experience.
35560	5793477	9.0	9.0	32395261	Very warm and welcoming flat. Welcomed and made to feel at home by Niki, the host. Flat was very close to centre of town and would definitely recommend staying here to both friends and family, as well as staying again should I visit Seattle again! 
35561	5793477	9.0	9.0	33517818	Nikki was a polite hostess that made sure I felt welcome. Her apartment is walking distance from the downtown areas in Seattle. I would recommend staying with Nikki to anyone!
35562	5793477	9.0	9.0	33955570	"Niki was the perfect host. She is very smart, funny and charming and takes care of you as a guest. I felt very welcome.

The flat is located super central with access to anywhere. I would for sure stay with her anytime again!"
35563	5793477	9.0	9.0	34299982	Very nice place to stay, hostess Niki was very sweet and accommodating.
35564	5793477	9.0	9.0	37243001	I arrived late in the afternoon and she was there to greet me and show me around the place. The place was clean and well-kept. She was very nice and offered complimentary bottle water and shower amenities. Overall was a great experience and would recommend her to a friend!
35565	5793477	9.0	9.0	37825023	Accurate listing description. Neighbourhood is relatively quiet, considering its downtown location. If you're walking, there is not much around in a two block radius, but driving or busing would take few minutes to get to central downtown. I was welcome by Niki's cousin, who was very nice and welcoming, even drove me to a nearby restaurant for pickup :) The place is ok clean (can be cleaner). I think its a bit highly priced, but i guess its because of location.  Overall a good experience, and would recommend / consider it again. 
35566	5793477	9.0	9.0	38176398	"Excellent and professional communication throughout my stay.  I had a late night flight and host was happy to accommodate. Apartment was clean, comfortable, and local convenient store/gas station 5min down the street.   15-20 minute walk downtown. 

Would recommend staying to anyone. "
35567	5793477	9.0	9.0	38354754	The accommodation is very comfortable and I had a relaxed stay. The host is very friendly and provided me all details n necessities
35568	5793477	9.0	9.0	39088224	Niki was out of town during my trip but she communicated well before and during my stay. Her cousin was there to check me in and was around if I needed anything. The apartment was clean and the bedroom is large with a very comfortable bed. Within a 10 minute walk you can get to quite a few restaurants and shops as well as site like the Frye Museum. It's a convenient location to explore First Hill, downtown, and Capitol Hill, and with major bus lines within a few blocks you can easily get to all the Seattle neighborhoods (and to/from the airport)
35569	5793477	9.0	9.0	39224609	Perfect for my short stay in Seattle and VERY close to everything downtown. 
35570	5793477	9.0	9.0	39761235	Apartment was lovely, clean and tidy with a nice balcony. She had adaptor plugs for different electronic devices which was ace. Its very well located and was very convenient for my requirements. Lovely area too.
35571	5793477	9.0	9.0	41766430	Nice Place, clean, quite and comfortable. My flight is 11:00 PM and Niki's cousin help me check in. The apt is close to bus station to downtown and Seattle center.
35572	5793477	9.0	9.0	42531701	Even though Niki was out of town at the time of my stay she made all arrangements for me to feel comfortable. Overall, I had a great experience. Nice location on the  Capitol hill. Easy to get everywhere by foot.
35573	5793477	9.0	9.0	43251980	"This is a really nice place to stay in a great location: good, quiet neighborhood a walkable distance from Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill. To be clear (because the listing isn't entirely so): YOU ONLY RENT THE BEDROOM NOT THE WHOLE APARTMENT, even though you do have use of the rest of the apartment as long as no one else is using it. Two of my three nights, I had the whole place; one night, I came back to Niki's cousin and co-worker sleeping in the living room. I hadn't realized that was the arrangement (she had texted me in advance but I didn't get that's what she was telling me). Even though ultimately it was my misunderstanding of the listing, I appreciated that Niki and her cousin were apologetic and communicative (I had had trouble contacting Niki to get information beforehand, and her cousin served as a host proxy and was very friendly and accommodating).

Bottom line: really nice place to stay, and I was impressed and gratified by how Niki and her cousin handled a fraught situation."
35574	5793477	9.0	9.0	44467437	Niki's place was just as advertised and is really convenient getting to most of the city area within a 15-20 minute walk.  It was great having a nice grocery store around the block and I'd have no hesitation staying here again.  Thanks!
35575	5793477	9.0	9.0	55228905	Although Niki was away when I arrived, the check-in was easy.  Niki was very kind and accommodating.  The location is in perfect proximity to downtown and local transport links.  I recommend staying here to anyone.
35576	5793477	9.0	9.0	56023490	"Fantastic location and host of the house.
Nobody need a hesitation to stay at there. It's acceptable to go to everywhere not only landmarks but others as well. Make sure I'll stay again when I go back to Seattle. "
37178	6002165	10.0	9.0	35712876	The Huey House was fantastic from booking to our departure.  It's in the coolest neighborhood and the location was perfect for a family weekend.  This is very much a family home, not a professional rental.  The Huey Family was super accomodating and straightforward.  When we arrived there was a basket with beer and juices for the kids and they were cool enough to have toys for the kids laid out and soap/shampoo in the bathrooms. There was plenty of everything and we felt welcome in their home.    We are grateful.
37179	6002165	10.0	9.0	45091828	"Amy was fantastic and so accommodating. Our flight arrived earlier than check in  and we were able to check before the posted time. The the house was so warm and comfortable.They left us a nice welcome basket in their beautiful kitchen.  We loved the outside patio and BBQ was great for our family.  On our 3rd and 4th day,the weather turned pretty stormy and they emailed us  from out of the country to make sure we were ok and  wanted to know if we needed anything.  The house is within walking distance to markets, restaurants and the junction. We had a great time and will be back again-this is a great house for your family.

39040	153967	9.0	9.0	355042	Our stay was fabulous! The beds where incredibly plush and the neighborhood was so peaceful. What a great place to relax. And our kids loved the giant chess set! Thanks again and again Meg for the best weekend.
39041	153967	9.0	9.0	371037	"My wife and I spent a week in July-2011 in this very attractive cottage. The house is ideally situated in a quiet part of Seattle with easy excess by car to downtown, as well as to the Seattle Area. Free parking in front of the cottage. Has also a magnificent garden, and free wifi-access.
All the conveniences that we liked to be in the cottage ( kitchen with all equipment, refrigerator, TV, and -very important- a very comfortable double-bed ) were present, and everything worked for 100%.
In short: good price/quality rate.
We recommand this cottage without any hesitation."
39042	153967	9.0	9.0	373580	Our family stayed at the cottage for one night during our recent visit to Seattle.  The cottage was very charming.  A nice change from small hotel rooms.  The view was nice from the yard too. The kids enjoyed Alki Beach nearby.  We would stay there again.
39043	153967	9.0	9.0	431877	"Thank you, Meg, for letting us stay in your cottage. We had a very relaxing time. The cottage is clean, and in a very quiet neighborhood.  It felt like ""home"" for our week. The decorating touches made it feel warm and inviting.  We were lucky to have had 5 great summer days, and we enjoyed visiting with friends in the front yard. I did attempt to walk back from the Junction, which is only about 6 to 7 blocks away; however, the hill from Alaska to Hudson was more challenging than I realized. I advise against it, unless it's part of one's exercise routine. All in all, we feel very fortunate to have rented this place."
39044	153967	9.0	9.0	459969	The house was comfortable and perfect for what we needed. We were five adults traveling to Seattle for two nights. Staying in West Seattle was great, easy to get into Seattle Proper and fun to explore the neighborhoods in West Seattle too! Thanks! 
39045	153967	9.0	9.0	475527	Meg's cottage is marvelous -- I stayed for several nights, and when I first arrived I was delighted by how charming the place is. The yard is spacious, and inside it's very clean and comfortable and nicely decorated. Checking in went very smoothly, and my entire experience was positive and relaxing. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely place to stay that's got old-time character with modern comforts.
39046	153967	9.0	9.0	495949	"Very nice house in West Seattle, in a residential neighborhood.  The description of the house was very accurate, so there is little we can add.  It was nice to have so much room, and we also enjoyed the chairs and table on the front lawn on one sunny afternoon.

Even though it looks like this is far from the downtown, the connection is very convenient: bus stop is two blocks away, bus ran every 10 minutes and was near the Pike Place in about 10-15 minutes.  Buses have a special lane on the Seattle Bridge, so they can often get to downtown faster than a car.  We have friends of a friend who live in West Seattle and they use the bus every day.

West Seattle is a cool destination itself.  The beaches are nice and full of people, views of Seattle from the east side are spectacular, and there is an abundance of bars and restaurants to choose from--especially along the Alki beach and California Avenue.

One last thing: read carefully the house rules/manual.  Even though you pay a cleaning fee, the guests are supposed to clean after themselves, including washing the towels and linens. The cleaning fee is refunded afterwards.  We spent good 2 hours cleaning up the house (especially because it takes that long to wash and dry towels). We knew about it, so it did not come as a surprise, but I can imagine this could be problem for some people, especially if they need to leave early in the morning.  "
39047	153967	9.0	9.0	568333	Perfect location, close to friends. 
39048	153967	9.0	9.0	766248	"This was a great little cottage with easy access to downtown.  West Seattle has great food options so we enjoyed being able to get good food close to ""home.""  Meg's instructions for the house were very easy to understand and the place was clean and cozy.  The only thing we didn't love was having to do the sheets and make our own beds (one of the beds was a double bunk bed that proved to be quite difficult to make,) but Meg discloses this upfront so no one should be surprised by the request!  In general, the place was a great house to have at a very reasonable rate!"
39049	153967	9.0	9.0	1053740	This place was exactly like Meg states. Really comfortable and in a great location. Easy trek over the bridge gets you downtown. West Seattle is a real cute place and we had a great time. Meg was very quick to respond to Nything and we really enjoyed our stay. 
39050	153967	9.0	9.0	1094626	It felt home away from home... It was wonderful!
39051	153967	9.0	9.0	1263500	Meg was awesome, everything she describes about her cottage is true. Everything was really easy to check in and a detailed list lets you know where everything is. Everything you need, groceries, coffee, whatever, is close distance to the cottage. 
39052	153967	9.0	9.0	1421429	A lovely small cottage in a quiet part of West Seattle - the place is stocked with just about anything you could need or want during the stay. Meg's cottage was a perfect place to escape to during our visit to Seattle. It was quiet, peaceful, the neighbors were very friendly, it is only 10 minutes from Downtown, and very close to a cafe that apparently has the best dirty chai latte known to mankind from what I'm told by my wife. We very much recommend a visit if you're in this neck of the woods.
39053	153967	9.0	9.0	1952857	We had a nice stay in this cottage. What we very much appreciated was Meg's responsiveness and flexibility. For a family with kids the garden was perfect. This was also helpful when we had to clean the house, the only part of the deal, which was not so good, as your simply not sure, whether the next guest have similar standards as you or not, and also, as it costs two hours of your stay. 
39054	153967	9.0	9.0	2331182	"This cottage is a great deal for the number of people it sleeps! The number one reason I would recommend it is the affordable price. It is also in a great location: 5 minutes from I-5, just blocks off the West Seattle Bridge. It is close to Trader Joe's and a neighborhood with cafes, restaurants, bars, and other amenities. It is a long, but pleasant, walk to the water (over two miles). The kitchen facilities were adequate, and the laundry facilities were convenient. The yard is quite large for any city, and we enjoyed eating meals at the outdoor table and chairs.

This would be a great house for a couple and kids. The king bed is very soft but comfortable (that room is quiet and dark as well). The full bed on the bottom bunk is claustrophobic and not good for two adults. Also, the entire bunk bed is unstable/shaky and feels like it might break soon. The queen sofa bed in the living room is relatively comfortable. There were some missing blankets during our stay, but it sounds like that was an accident that will be remedied.

The only other thing to be prepared for is a general lack of atmosphere indoors. The size is cozy and comfortable, but there are almost no decorations and lamps, and the location and number of windows allows for very little natural light. We were not very tempted to ""hang out"" indoors. That being said, it's a great place to come back to and sleep, being dark and in a quiet neighborhood. We felt very safe and enjoyed going for walks and runs around the neighborhood. And I don't think you can beat the price for 5 or 6 (or 7, though I wouldn't recommend 7) people!

Lastly, Meg is a great hostess - she is very easy to communicate with and is quickly responsive to questions."
39055	153967	9.0	9.0	2393881	The house was cozy.  Small but a GREAT deal for Seattle.  We enjoyed our stay.
39056	153967	9.0	9.0	2777145	"*I would actually give 3.5 stars if they allowed that*

My girlfriend, my dad, 2 aunts, and myself recently rented this cottage for a week while in Seattle for my graduation. My girlfriend and I previously lived in West Seattle and loved it, so were excited to find a rental in the area when traveling back. Overall we had a great experience, it was quiet, cozy, close to what we wanted yet far enough away to be comfortable, and it was nice to have amenities like a kitchen and living room. 

That said, I do have a few complaints/suggestions and things you should know upfront; 1) the couch in the living room was painfully uncomfortable!! This wouldn't be a huge deal, except that it was counted as a bed. I would highly suggest a new couch, or at least listing the place as ""sleeps 5+"" instead, because by no means did it make for a comfortable bed. 2) There were a few other updates that would have made for a more enjoyable experience (new towels, covering the old dirty chair, etc), nothing too bad, but its the little things that make a difference. 3) The owner had obviously not been there prior to our visit, it was really cold (55 degrees), the tv wasn't working, and there was a box by the front door. I have stayed at other AirBnB places and its just really nice when they take the time to ""prep"" in little ways like turning the heat on. Again, its the little things. 

And finally, 4) I know the cleaning thing is said upfront and others have mentioned it, but it truly needs to be reevaluated. Im happy to clean up after myself, but really didn't enjoy doing actual cleaning for the last 2 hours of vacation. I know we knew what we are getting into, but its just not a great last memory to have of a place. 

Again, overall it was a great experience and I would probably consider renting it again. I would though, first do some searching for something similar that had a more comfortable sleeping arrangement and didn't require this level of cleaning. "
39057	153967	9.0	9.0	3385905	"Great location, cute little place.  However, there are not enough blankets in the place and there were only 5 of us. Luckily, we had some in our car and were able to keep warm.

The couch would probably not be a very comfortable place - I would say this place comfortably sleeps 5.

Kitchen is not very well stocked.  We had a hard time cooking as pots were missing lids, the knives were horrible and basic tools weren't available.  Kitchen table only has 2 chairs so we ended up eating on the floor.

However, the place is very clean and well priced.  "
39058	153967	9.0	9.0	3854955	It was a great place to stay with perfect neighborhood and location. Clean and neat and the beds are comfy as well. 
39059	153967	9.0	9.0	3930222	"It was very conveniently located and the neighborhood was very nice. The kids enjoyed having a bunk bed and we enjoyed them having a place to eat breakfast in the mornings. 

This was a great alternative to a hotel and we would stay here again in the future if we were not moving to the area!"
39060	153967	9.0	9.0	5422026	Great little funky cottage in Seattle!  Super quiet residential area...we all slept like babies!  Large front yard perfect for kids.  Real comfy beds...especially the king size bed!  It was overall very suitable for the 5 of us - 3 adults and 2.  
39061	153967	9.0	9.0	5962064	Reasonably priced, easy connection to attractions, nice cottage, good experience. Only the view was not as good as expected. At least not from the garden.
39062	153967	9.0	9.0	6028051	Thanks Meg
39063	153967	9.0	9.0	6386525	"We rented this house for one week in August and overall it was okay. It was in a good location for us as we had relatives in West Seattle. It had dishes and cooking utensils, and washer and dryer that made life easier and less expensive then hotel. The big front yard was nice since we had family over the last night for a big dinner.  I like that it was alarmed and made me feel like my belongings were safe during the day on our travels. There was an issue with one bed, but Meg responded quickly and had in fixed on our third night. The area is pretty quiet.

There are several things that I did not like. 

First, I could only get one window open (Small one in kitchen). Other than the window I got open there were no screens in windows or on the doors. Since we had to open the doors for air we had to also deal with bugs. There was one portable AC in the main bedroom (which was nice), but it only cooled that room and the living room. The kids room has no fresh air flow and stayed fairly warm during the day. I am guessing for 9 to 10 months a year this is fine, but it was over 80 for several of the days we were there. 

Second, there is some drywall work that needs to be done in kitchen and bathroom. It looks as if cabinets and other items have been replaced or fixed, but the drywall has just been patched and not painted. There is a dishwasher, but it is not hooked up and can only be used for drying. 

Third, parking can be a problem. If you come back during the day you might not find parking within a half block of the house.
"
39064	153967	9.0	9.0	6487388	The cottage had everything we needed. Clean, reasonably priced, nice yard, and in close proximity to Seattle. Many thanks!
39065	153967	9.0	9.0	7169188	"Overall a wonderful experience and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

PLUSES
- The ginormous shower head.
- The memory foam king size bed.
- The very very quiet streets
- The yard (It was pleasant to hang out with some friends on a sunny afternoon in Seattle out in the yard.)
- All the plates and utensils one would need are right there.
- Close proximity to many restaurants and markets by car.

There are 2 things that I'd pay extra attention to while staying there: 
1. The manual warned the wood floor for the living room is extremely soft and scratches very easily. That forced us to be extra gentle compared to carpet floors, but we also felt better knowing it's visibly clean.
2. The manual's text formatting made it a little hard to read sometimes. I wish it was spaced out over another extra page or two for better readability, but that's the graphic designer in me speaking."
39066	153967	9.0	9.0	7435421	Megs cottages was just perfect for our needs. good price nice secure and quirt neighbourhood, easy access to the city and airport good parking and daily shopping, I definitely come again ! 
39067	153967	9.0	9.0	8343610	The reservation was canceled 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
39068	153967	9.0	9.0	9933366	My parents were coming to visit us from the Midwest and our West Seattle apartment just wouldn't have been very comfortable for all of us. My parents were initially leary about staying in another persons home, but with the welcoming fireplace and big bed-they could not have been happier.  The kitchen was well stocked so we were able to purchase ingredients to prepare and enjoy family meals-we could have even baked a cake!  This space was perfectly cozy for our needs.  Meg was very communicative and timely in all correspondence.  We will absolutely stay at this rustic-ish cottage again
39069	153967	9.0	9.0	10068037	Meg was extremely accommodating to any request that I had. The place was very clean and definitely accommodated the 7 people that were in the cottage. Thank you!
39070	153967	9.0	9.0	10567450	Nice, comfortable experience.  Thank Meg
39071	153967	9.0	9.0	11567768	"Hello :-) It was really fun to communicate with Meg. She knows this place inside and out, and there is no way to surprise her, which is nice. It means she loves the place, and it shows. 
My stay was a really memorable Spring stay. Sitting on top of the hill, so close to West Seattle groceries, and restaurants, and this time, the beautiful Old Growth Lincoln Park looking at the Sound and the Fauntleroy Ferry - it really made me like West Seattle a lot.
The cottage is exactly that, heated by a gas stove, and creaky in a comfortable way. Yet, everything works as if it is modern, and with windows open, it is light and airy.
As the Spring is coming, the outside table and chairs were calling me, but it was still raining on them, so they are there for the next guests :-)
I like having a washer & dryer, and cupboards full of useful things, just like in a cabin. 
I'd come here again, and would recommend it to anyone who respects a well-worn, well-maintained home with a good host. 
Thanks!"
39072	153967	9.0	9.0	12017249	"Staying at the Cottage was the perfect little getaway for my group of friends and I for the Easter long weekend! There were six of us and all of us sprawled out comfortably from the master bedroom, the room with the bunk bed, and the living room couch that turns into a double bed. Everything we needed was provided - kitchen utensils, a coffee machine, and even condiments, spices and beans that have been left in the house from previous guests to pass down to the next. 

The fireplace was so key in the place feeling like a true cottage! We sat in the living room a lot, relaxing and snacking from the delicious food we bought at Trader Joe's - just two minutes drive away! That place is amazing and I wish we had one in Canada. So many good local and organic foods for cheap/reasonably priced! 

In the morning, we made brunch and ate out in the front yard with the patio furniture set up. It was so SO lovely! 

I really appreciated how easy everything was - it can seem intense with the alarm for the house and the cleaning manual book, but it actually isn't at all! Meg lays out everything so simply and clearly that there's very little room for error. 
At the end of the weekend upon our leaving, the entire group got together to divide cleaning duties and put the cottage into pristine condition! It was actually a rather nice bonding moment and made us all feel like a team, and wrapped up our amazing weekend in Seattle wonderfully. I like how this is a guest-run cottage and it's cool to think who will be staying there next. Meg should perhaps start a guest book?!? Would be a cool idea! People can share little things like what they discovered in the neighbourhood or how to properly use the coffee machine, brunch recipes - whatever! 

Lastly - Alki Beach being three minutes drive was amazing! You get the whole westside city skyline from across the water! There's a boardwalk and a bit of a beach that you can explore. On the boardwalk is a cool restaurant called Ma Kai - Hawaiian/Korean fusion restaurant! We had panko breaded fish and chips with kimchi and miso tartar sauce! They also had a patio to relax on too and got a great view of the water...

Anyways, I strongly recommend staying here. It's perfectly simple and what you make of your experience.
"
39073	153967	9.0	9.0	13176871	"Everything went smoothly at Meg's cottage. The place has a lot of charm. The neighborhood is quiet and safe and close to Alaska Junction.
I'm not sure I've ever slept on a more comfortable bed!! I would definitely stay at Meg's again."
39074	153967	9.0	9.0	14169103	We had a group of 6 adults stay in this cottage for one night and there was plenty of room for everyone. The check-in and out process was completely hassle free thanks to all the information provided via email by the host. The cottage was clean and had everything a person needs for a visit to Seattle. It is also perfect location, only a 10 minute cab ride to the stadiums and a short drive to downtown. West Seattle is also a neat little area with a ton of restaurants and cafes. Would definitely go back. 
39075	153967	9.0	9.0	15910813	This cottage is very cute and comfortable. It is also very well located, in a quiet and safe neighborhood, close to downtown, by car and public transportation. It is also pleasant to have a garden to enjoy outdoor breakfast or dinner.
39076	153967	9.0	9.0	16347258	Great spot for our families to soak up Seattle. Communication with Meg was flawless and we felt it was our little home away from home. The front lawn area was just what the doctor ordered for the kids to stretch their legs. Nice quiet neighborhood.  
39077	153967	9.0	9.0	16672041	We had a great time at Megs's cottage, it was very well kept and has good transport links to downtown Seattle. There were 9 of us and we fitted fine and all had a thoroughly enjoyable experience!
39078	153967	9.0	9.0	18049263	Great place to stay and just minutes from so many great places in Seattle! Meg was extremely helpful and responded to all of my messages within a minute or two. I would definitely stay here again!  
39079	153967	9.0	9.0	18630486	"What a wonderful place! I would highly recommend Meg's cottage for those staying in Seattle.  We hope to be back again soon!

"
39080	153967	9.0	9.0	18873844	We had a great time and enjoyed the cottage
39081	153967	9.0	9.0	21531002	Nice place, nice neighborhood.  Easy rental.  Host was on top of everything from the security to the cleanliness.  You do have to clean the place yourself, and the cleaning list is a bit involved which made a 1-night stay a little stressful, wouldn't be bad for staying several nights.  Eat at Chaco Canyon cafe while you're here, right down the street and so good!
39082	153967	9.0	9.0	24321609	"We spent four days at the cottage, and had our family Christmas there. It뗩 a beautiful location, on a hill overlooking Seattle. It뗩 a cute, family-friendly neighborhood. The cottage is small, but cosy and heated well by a wood stove. The stove was on and had heated up the place nicely when we arrived. 

The bed in the master bedroom is very comfortable. We also found everything we needed in the kitchen to make and serve our meals.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. But we had a couple of issues:  There was a big crack in the frame of the top bunk bed (which my younger son had looked forward to sleeping in). He didn뗪 feel safe sleeping on it, so my older son volunteered to lay out a bedroll on the floor and give him the bottom bunk for our stay. 

Then on our last day, as we started using the washing machine to wash the linens, stinky sludge started backing up in the bathtub. The kitchen sinks began draining very slowly. Part of the deal at the cottage is that you do the cleaning at the end of your stay (which should take about 2 hours). Unfortunately, the backups made this a messy, stressful time닱ot the best end to our stay. 

Meg was friendly and responsive to our texts, but the holiday wasn뗪 the best time for getting people in for maintenance and repairs. "
39083	153967	9.0	9.0	25539786	Lovely cottage that holds up to the description. Meg is very quick to respond to any questions/concerns and makes you feel very welcome. Great place to stay in a quiet residential area just a quick drive from excellent restaurants and scenery. 
39084	153967	9.0	9.0	33067789	Meg was very great at communicating before and during our stay at the cottage. The description and information we received was accurate and the house looked as expected. We loved her cute cottage! I would definitely recommend staying here. It is in a cute neighborhood in West Seattle. 
39085	153967	9.0	9.0	35478380	The cottage was everything Meg had described and pictured. Cute and clean home not far from the city center. Meg is responsive and is a great host.
39086	153967	9.0	9.0	39240415	I thought this house was very convenient for a small family to stay in. It has a washer and dryer if you you need to clean your clothes, a fully functional kitchen for cooking, and a living room area equipped with a tv. The appearance of the house is well kept and i would recommend to any of my friends coming to stay that this house is the place to be. not only are the living quarters awesome but also the person who own and runs the cottage. If ever i had a question Meg would respond minutes after messaging her. 
39087	153967	9.0	9.0	40195664	The cottage was clean and had a cozy feel to it. The yard space was great for eating out on the table provided and for having the 2 toddlers run around in. We appreciated some of the kitchen cupboard items left by past guests such as sugar, seasonings etc... and left a few of ours for future guest. (great idea!) The area felt very safe and its location was close to many stores/attractions.  We only had 2 problems.  The coffee maker didn't work on day one but after contacting the owner, a new one was delivered through Amazon within 8 hours!! Super impressed!  Also the twin bed leg broke and we appreciated the prompt attempt to repair it.  We would be happy to stay there again should we ever be in that area.
39088	153967	9.0	9.0	40603456	Meg was an informative, responsive host, eager to make our stay memorable. Our family of five had a wonderful stay in her cozy, clean cottage, as we explored Seattle for a few days. Particularly memorable was the water taxi from the West Seattle dock (just 8 min away) to the Seattle Pier. The cottage exceeded our expectations, offering a quiet, relaxing retreat after our days of exploration. 
39089	153967	9.0	9.0	40891003	Lovely home in wonderful neighborhood.   We loved having a kitchen and the front yard was such a perfect place to sit out in the sunshine and read and have meals.  Although comfy quarters for the 6 of us, it worked just fine and we were completely happy.  The location in West Seattle is amazing as it was an easy hop for us to get to downtown, the beach and to nearby shopping.   Definitely a great spot!
39090	153967	9.0	9.0	45238485	Everything was as advertised, the place was really great. Me and the family have never been to Seattle and we were there for PAX. This was the perfect place to come back to from the Busy city. Cant say enough good things about the location and the surrounding area.
39091	153967	9.0	9.0	45650062	Meg was very responsive and communicative. The cottage was very homey, cute and conveniently located. Our guests enjoyed their time. 
39092	153967	9.0	9.0	49279075	The cottage was the perfect place for my stay.  Meg made everything really easy and it was a great stay. I would recommend this cottage to anyone.
39093	153967	9.0	9.0	55340765	Loved the location, easy to find.  Host was very accommodating.  Perfect size for 8 of us.  I would definitely stay here again when I return.
39192	158953	10.0	9.0	403029	"We first reserved the guest bedroom, but then reserved the master too, so we could have the whole place to ourselves.  This place is great! Within about a mile, there is a golf course, beaches, tennis court, coffee, bars, bread makers, cupcakes, stores, gas stations... it's like staying in a small town, right over the W. Seattle Bridge, minutes to downtown! There's a great Irish pub, great sushi, great pizza... without the hassles of city parking. It's the perfect location, and Meg is great, too! We will definitely stay with Meg again on our next trip to Seattle!
"
39193	158953	10.0	9.0	540744	We rented the main bedroom at Meg's house mid week and ended up with the whole cottage. It was just as wonderful as we expected. Such a cute place with lots of character. Large yard to enjoy coffee in the morning and close to everything. We loved it!
40109	4518037	10.0	9.0	22940345	Very beautiful house with nice and cosy bedroom. 
40110	4518037	10.0	9.0	23001996	Nice place.
40111	4518037	10.0	9.0	23620326	Celine's home was so warm and welcoming. It is a beautiful home and Celine has added a lot of lovely details to make it really comforting. The room itself was really cosy and comfortable, and absolutely perfect, especially at the price. The decor and the little touches also makes it feel like home. She was also incredibly accommodating, even when I was late checking in, and gave me good directions and advice on exploring Seattle. 
40112	4518037	10.0	9.0	23739509	The room itself was clean, comfortable, beautiful and neat. The couple are friendly,  quiet and easy going. Would absolutely recommend them as hosts.
40113	4518037	10.0	9.0	24194490	I spent 9 nights at Celine and Kurt's place, and it was the best Airbnb experience I have had to date! Celine and Kurt were super friendly and welcoming and treated me like a roommate. They even included me in a game night they had! They have a lovely, playful cat, but she won't bother you if you don't like cats. Their house is absolutely beautiful and just fun to be in. They've provided a radiator in your room, so you can keep it as cool or toasty as you'd like.  The house is right next to the bus stop and about a 30min bus ride (or 45min bike ride) to downtown. There are plenty of excellent and diverse dining options within walking or biking distance (1.5-4 miles) including some excellent vegetarian and vegan choices (I highly recommend Georgetown Liquor Company). Overall I had a wonderful experience and would recommend their place to any visitors. 
40114	4518037	10.0	9.0	24690438	It is so excited to live in a house which is a hundred years old! Cozy room and nice host impressed me! Celine and her husband made my trip in Seattle special. Thanks for buy me a cola haha. I will be back again.
40115	4518037	10.0	9.0	24789508	This is my 1st experience of using Airbnb to book a room and I had a very pleasant stay at Celine and Kurt's home. Their home is very clean and neat, and the couple is very friendly and the cute cat is friendly as well! I would love to recommend their home to my friends, if they come to Seattle and want to find a nice and comfort place convenient to  downtown. 
40116	4518037	10.0	9.0	25118037	"C칠line and Kurt's home is every bit as beautiful, clean, and tidy as it appears in their listing's photos, and I found my room upstairs to be very cozy and comfortable. 

Because my hours were completely out of alignment with her weekday ones, I never got to meet C칠line but her gracious presence was still felt through her generous correspondence with me. My arrival at their house was more complicated to arrange than many others she must deal with, and she was very kind and patient with me throughout. Kurt is the one who greeted me, showed me around, made sure I had what I needed, and was very polite and nice with me. (Mademoiselle) Domino, the cat, is very affectionate and playful so if you like cats, you're in for a treat :-)

It's about a half hour bus ride on the 36 from C칠line's into the downtown. This bus runs right past the Amtrak station on South Jackson and the International District-Chinatown light rail station (a terminus of the light rail line is the SeaTac airport) before running well into the city's central commercial district, along 3rd Ave to about Stewart before turning south again. I found the convenience of this public transport option to be terrific: very simple.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend their place to others!"
40117	4518037	10.0	9.0	25451620	"Celine and her husband Kart were at home and welcomed me when I arrived there. They were very friendly and nice to me. And there was also their cute, friendly and very quiet cat, Domino.
 The house was decorated with cute pink furnitures and it was really clean and comfortable as it was shown on their page. I loved it! My room was also a cute room with comfortable bed. And she brought me a heater which made my room very warm.  I was out most time of my staying, but I had a nice conversation time with them couple times. They told me their recommendations of Seattle and gave me some advice. It helped me a lot since I didn't know about Seattle and was traveling alone. They love Seattle and know many things about Seattle. They are great hosts and I really enjoyed staying there with them! "
40118	4518037	10.0	9.0	25868604	Really nice place, only stayed for a night but Celine and Kurt were very welcoming. Good location near Georgetown. Thanks guys!
40119	4518037	10.0	9.0	25978651	I very like the pink bedroom, which has pink table lamp, pink carpet, and pink wall.  Also, Celine and her husband are very friendly. 
40120	4518037	10.0	9.0	26170303	Great stay. Very convenient and easy. Thank you! 
40121	4518037	10.0	9.0	26433245	I only stayed a day with Celine before my flight out the next afternoon.  Check-in was extremely easy.  Her place was just as listed and very welcoming!  Great stay especially for the price!
40122	4518037	10.0	9.0	26811680	I had a lovely first airbnb experience staying in this charming home. The reservation was made last minute, but I was graciously welcomed by Celine and her husband, Kurt. If I'm ever in need of a place to stay in Seattle, I will definitely be booking this place again. Perfect little room, well maintained home in a central location, amazing shower, and a playful cat are some of the extra perks of this place, next to Celine and Kurt being really sweet hosts. 
40123	4518037	10.0	9.0	29535026	"I was here for a job interview at the Seattle VA and the location was perfect!! (FYI- if you need to head to the VA, it's definitely walkable, but I also took the 36 bus to the hospital- costs $1.25 and only takes ~10 min. Bus stop is only 2 or 3 blocks from their house!) 

My flight came in the morning but check-in wasn't until late afternoon so they let me drop my stuff off early in their garage then I spent the day checking out local coffee shops and restaurants. 

And Celine and Kurt were the best hosts possible! Spent one of the nights eating dinner together and just chatting- they are the nicest Seattle natives I've ever met ;) We also bonded over our favorite blogs and thrifting!! (Of which Celine is the best.)"
40124	4518037	10.0	9.0	32792667	"C칠line was an exceptional host. Even after a slight misunderstanding on my part she was super helpful and welcoming. Her home was beautiful and catered to my needs as far as my stay was concerned perfectly. 
She was very helpful and good fun to talk with. 
A+ host. "
40125	4518037	10.0	9.0	33403248	Celine and Kurt's house is exactly as pictured--very cute and well-kept.  Celine took time out to chat with me when I got there and before I left, which I thought was cool.  And their cat is super sweet!  It's easy to take the bus into town (about a half-hour ride, give or take).  The room I stayed in was cute--it does exactly what you need it to, gives you a place to put your stuff and sleep.  The house is up the hill from Georgetown, where there are a lot of great bars and restaurants--that's about 15-20 minutes' walk.  My only problem with this rental is that there is another guest bedroom for two people and another roommate in the house, so when I stayed there, there were anywhere from 4-6 people sharing one downstairs bathroom (the guest bedrooms are upstairs).  I wasn't aware of this going into the reservation.  Other than that, I had a good experience.  Thanks to Celine and Kurt!
40126	4518037	10.0	9.0	34174906	"The Perfect Airbnb: C칠line and her husband were so wonderful! They were very welcoming and warm, and their beautiful home is absolutely charming, and just as pictured. I wish my house looked this pretty! The house is immaculate, with an impressive pink fridge (centerpiece of the house). The single room I stayed in was so cozy. I had two very good sleeps here. The bathroom was also very clean, and the water pressure was perfect. Thank you for the clean towel! 

Upon arrival, I was offered a tour of the house, and C칠line very thoughtfully lent me a few tour books and walking maps of Seattle, which was so helpful for me! I used the books the very next day, walking for hours through hilly Seattle. 

The little backyard and front porch are so picturesque, and I enjoyed reading as the sun went down in the back. The public transit is an easy, hassle-free ride into downtown. 

C칠line was very fast at getting back to me, and was helpful at offering transit advise and suggestions. Thank you C칠line for your  generous hospitality! Hope you enjoyed the wine! :) 

I heartily recommend you stay with C칠line and her husband! It's really the perfect Airbnb."
40127	4518037	10.0	9.0	34746113	"C칠line was very friendly and welcoming into her home.  She was willing to be very accomidating and helpful.  Unfortantly my schedule kept me busy and I didn't see C칠line very much.  The time that I did she was very friendly.

The house was beautiful and well kept. "
40128	4518037	10.0	9.0	38183776	My stay at Celine home was very nice! Their home was very clean and tidy always. Exactly as they describe it it in the listing.
40129	4518037	10.0	9.0	39224006	Charming home and very comfortable room, everything as described in rooms profile. Celine and her husband are friendly and accommodating hosts. I recommend this home!
40130	4518037	10.0	9.0	43542673	I arrived pretty late, so I didn't get to talk to C칠line and Kurt much. But they were very friendly and flexible, showed me their beautiful place, and my room under the ceiling and let me go asleep. So: Friendly, flexible, uncomplicated, nice  perfect!
40131	4518037	10.0	9.0	44742880	"Celine's home was the perfect crash pad for me. I was in town for just one night and was set up in the smaller of the two rooms in the attic. Small details like the Wifi network and password near the bed and granola bars in the kitchen were a nice touch. Both her and her husband are very sweet, the home is cozy and in a quiet neighborhood, and I had a great experience.

 "
40132	4518037	10.0	9.0	46834837	C칠line's place was absolutely lovely! The pictures really don't do it justice because you can't see all the neat little details that are beautifully put together by the host. C칠line and her husband also made me feel right at home and gave me great advices for touring around Seattle. The bus was close by and very straightforward to take to downtown. Even if you Uber from the downtown area, it would only cost ~$15. I would definitely recommend C칠line's place!
40133	4518037	10.0	9.0	47232678	Celine was there to greet me when I arrived and gave a tour to ensure I knew where everything was that I might need. She also had suggestions on places to go.
40134	4518037	10.0	9.0	48156625	"C칠line and kurt are wonderful host! And the home is definitely one of a kind experience ;) Wish I could stay longer but they were fully booked until my departure date :'( 
So, If you are the lucky one, don't let it go! 
"
40135	4518037	10.0	9.0	48354049	"Super lovely, designer caliber decorated house. Everything was really pretty and the home was immaculate. Since I was in Seattle for work, I came in the middle of the week, and therefore spent no time with Celine and had a brief conversation with Kurt. Everyone seems very nice. 
The room was perfect for one single short statured person, who can climb a small flight of stairs. It was decorated nicely and certainly was cozy. 
There were some limitations to using the shared bathroom and what to eat/prepare in the kitchen (no soda or sticky stuff). And no shoes in the house (I was told this immediately). Like I said, the house is immaculate. Bring a flashlight to find the house numbers if you arrive after 9:30pm (I passed by it twice since the house was dark and since I told them my delayed arrival time, didn't think they'd shut off the outside lights). Kurt kindly oriented me to the space.
In spite of all these parameters, this situation seemed to fit well for what I needed during my brief trip to Seattle and with a work reason to be in town. 
For anyone who wants a little more social interaction or a feeling of connection with people who live in Seattle, this may not be match for you. For the fully independent person who eats out the entire time, and only needs a (very pretty) crash pad - this place is highly recommended."
40136	4518037	10.0	9.0	48961141	Great location good communication. 
40137	4518037	10.0	9.0	49577700	I had a great 2 night stay with Celine and Kurt! The house is very clean, furnished with a great love for detail and just 15 minutes away from downtown Seattle (by bus). You can either keep to yourself but also have funny, interesting conversations with both them. I'd stay there again!
40138	4518037	10.0	9.0	50734224	Very comfortable and cute attic room  congenial host pleasant environment. Easy parking close to eating and shopping. Easy drive into downtown. 
40139	4518037	10.0	9.0	52164541	Yes they are very nice. Highly recommend to those who do not have a car, because the bus is very convenient and only takes no more than 20 minutes getting to downtown!
40140	4518037	10.0	9.0	53547721	C칠line and her husband were very welcoming and shared some wonderful suggestions for dinner. The room was neat and looked exactly like the photos included in the profile. Bathroom was also clean. It was a convenient drive to downtown and some delicious restaurants.  I was in town for training that took up most of my day so I did not get to interact with C칠line and her husband too much but they were very friendly when we did. They were very quiet. The room was perfect for a solo getaway. Thank you again for the hospitality!

I stayed so well. They are very kind and easy-going. I was very comfortable. And close to bus stop. Also room was really cute and lovely. Thanks!! :)"
40142	4518037	10.0	9.0	57073205	Great experience with Celine and Kurt. They are warm and nice. They provided me tourism and transportation information, which was very helpful. The house is very clean. Felt like staying in my own apartment. 
40971	9091301	10.0	9.0	52383757	My stay with Kathryn and Olivier (and Dixie!) was great. The room was comfortable, clean, and exactly what I needed for a short one-night stay. Kathryn and Olivier were warm, welcoming, and glad to answer any questions I had about the house and area. The location is great. It's close to the main strip of Greenwood area, and close to bus lines that take me downtown. I would recommend this place to anyone who needs a place to stay in Seattle!
40972	9091301	10.0	9.0	52950472	The people at the house are kind. The experience was pretty good except for the bedroom had a sliding door without a lock. The room also had a mini dog stench (I'm not a dog person), but was clean. Overall, pretty good. 
40973	9091301	10.0	9.0	54796378	The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Both were a little sparse but had what we needed. Bed is only a full sized but comfortable. Room is on the lower floor which was cold but the room had separate heat which kept the room very cozy. Neighborhood is a bit far walk to coffee or breakfast but it is close to the rapid ride bus straight to downtown. Overall the stay was great and we had a good time. 
41507	8034871	10.0	9.0	46234030	Nice, clean, big, it has everything you need, including laundry, so close to everywhere, can you imagine we came back to take a nap during the day of visiting Seattle downtown. Recommend:)
41508	8034871	10.0	9.0	46435272	Great space. Comfortable, clean, exactly as described. Nice quiet location with parking and all the amenities of home. A+
41509	8034871	10.0	9.0	46970478	Overall- great experience!  Amenities were perfect and the neighborhood allowed us to experience Seattle without having to pay too much. Annalise accommodated anything we needed and was very responsive via text!  
41510	8034871	10.0	9.0	48316534	Great space - had everything we needed. Modern, clean, full kitchen. Annalise and her husband were nice and helpful. Easy access to downtown Seattle on Rapid Ride E. Highly recommended
41511	8034871	10.0	9.0	54644010	Annalise was a great host and we had a lovely stay at this cute little mother-in-law.  The apartment entrance is behind the house, and they have little hand-painted signs directing and welcoming you - it is very cute!  We also had some great beers in the fridge waiting for us, compliments of her husband the brewer!  The bedroom is nice and large with a comfy bed and an exposed beam.  The kitchen and bathroom have nice updated tiling. Overall, we were super happy with our stay here!
41512	8034871	10.0	9.0	57559280	The apartment was even more spacious than the pictures show. Everything we needed was provided, and the apartment was squeaky clean! The bed was very comfortable: always a plus! Being able to accommodate our dog, and having the fenced-in back yard for her, was also an extra plus. In addition, the location was excellent: lots of privacy and easy access to major roads. While this was not a problem for us at all, I will say that you can hear people walking around upstairs. I only mention this because some people might be bothered by it. We found the place to be perfect in every way, and I would highly recommend it. 
43032	6421243	10.0	9.0	34804140	Anna was very good at communicating information quickly. The neighborhood is great, price was great and apartment was exactly as advertised. 
43033	6421243	10.0	9.0	35239831	Anna's apartment is very clean, nice, and in a great location, right on the bus stop to downtown and Capitol Hill.  I even walked one day to the international district to see the neighborhoods and experience the city up close.
43034	6421243	10.0	9.0	36027590	"I think I was unlucky on my stay with a number of small issues starting with the initial disappointment on finding the place.  The apartment is in a bland (1970's?) concrete and pebble-dash block.  The apartment itself is at the back of the building in a basement with  a concrete stairwell which had an old discarded car radiator in it when I was there.  The front door and screen door are old and battered.  On entering the apartment there is an overwhelming damp and musty smell.  There was a can of room deodoriser provided which did clear it after I sprayed the whole apartment - but it was noticeable every time I returned to the apartment at the end of the day.  Because of the basement location there is no view whatsoever and not a lot of light.  

On the plus side, I must say that the apartment was spotlessly clean everywhere and clearly very well cared for.  The bedlinens and towels were clean, soft, fresh smelling and of good quality.  The bed was comfortable and welcoming.  Whilst there are no facilities in the immediate area, there is a bus stop immediately outside the apartment with a very good service which takes you downtonwn in 10 minutes.  

I had a few issues with the Wifi and the fridge not working but as soon as I reported this to Anna, the host, she reacted immediately to sort them out promptly.  Both she and her maintenance man were friendly, welcoming, approachable and helpful.  

This could be a pleasant apartment but the basement location, external appearance and, particularly the damp smell, combine to spoil the experience.  Overall, I thought it was very overpriced compared to other airbnb places I have booked in the same price range.
"
43035	6421243	10.0	9.0	36716378	Great little apartment in Beacon Hill.  We loved the neighborhood (especially Tippe & Drauge) and the proximity to the light rail stop.  The apartment felt secure, and having parking for our rental car was a plus.  Without air conditioning, it was a bit warm due to Seattle's heat wave, but that seemed to be the case for every place we went.  Anna provided a box fan, and that helped out quite a bit.
43036	6421243	10.0	9.0	37757620	Anna made my boyfriend and I very welcome during our stay in Seattle. It was our first time in Seattle and she gave us great ideas to tour the city. She made sure we were comfortable in her place and she was available at any time if we needed anything. The apartment was exactly as described in the post. I would definitely recommend her place to any of my family or friends. Thank you Anna!
43037	6421243	10.0	9.0	38730606	The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. We enjoyed our stay. 
43038	6421243	10.0	9.0	39207040	The listing was accurate and Anna was easy to coordinate with via text messaging. The apartment has all needed facilities, and is very clean. It is very small and in the basement, so on hot days it is a little stuffy; but it cools off quickly with open windows and the fan. The refrigerator is a small dorm-room style frig, and it doesn't have a freezer so no ice (which we missed on Sunday with 95 degree weather!) Overall we enjoyed our stay and the neighborhood. It is a very accessible location.
43039	6421243	10.0	9.0	45282985	"Anna's responses were prompt, polite, and though we never met face-to-face I was happy with our interactions.

The apartment itself was clean, though just a little musty smelling. Opening the window while we were there helped to air it out.

It's only a block or two away from a fire station, so we did hear the occasional set of sirens, but they were not terribly frequent and we did not notice them at all after about 10 or 11pm."
43040	6421243	10.0	9.0	46831013	Anna was very responsive to our last minute request to book.  The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  The bus stop was literally steps away which made it super easy to get to the heart of downtown.  We loved Oak which was a cool neighborhood restaurant and pub.  The food there was exceptionally good.  Grocery store just a few blocks away.  Great little neighborhood!
43041	6421243	10.0	9.0	49696053	A+ Anna was easy to deal with and place was great. 
43042	6421243	10.0	9.0	52286802	"Space was exactly as described. It had basic essentials and conveniently located in Beacon Hill area with good food & grocery options. Plus it was right across the street from Jefferson park which was a bonus. Everything was good and Anna was a great host, she was totally understanding and accommodating when it came to making our stay happen. 

Best,

Christine & Larry "
43043	6421243	10.0	9.0	53571791	"Anna and Trond were very accommodating.  the unit was ready for my arrival, very clean, exactly as described.  i had some trouble with the lock and somebody came right away to fix the issue.

thanks again!"
43044	6421243	10.0	9.0	54866994	Anna was a great host. She helped us find our way home from the airport with great instructions. Communication with her always was efficient. The place was easy to find and in a great location near to restaurant (5-10minute). The apartment is exactly what you read, everything very clean and organize. The kitchen came useful for late coffee and soups. Overall amazing experience and would stay again next time I visit Seattle.  
43045	6421243	10.0	9.0	55496196	Anna was very responsive with questions and concerns. The unit was clean and just as described/pictured. I would recommend it.
44585	5593399	9.0	9.0	29199983	Great place to stay! Close to everything we wanted to do! Amazing view from the park right next to the condo. We would definitely stay there again. 
44586	5593399	9.0	9.0	31241780	Beautiful condo and great location! We would definitely stay again! 
44587	5593399	9.0	9.0	31922758	Great experience. All the clinic action was swift, and directions for entering the condo were extremely organized. The condo is spacious, pretty, and very clean. The bed was so comfortable and the kitchen was very well stocked for cooking. Since it's a little removed from the downtown area, we were so glad to have a parking spot for our car! Would definitely return. 
44588	5593399	9.0	9.0	33150385	Our host was helpful and responsive with our needs. The condo is located just outside of downtown with a parking garage conveniently in the building. The space was large, had a reliable WiFi setup, and satisfied us. Plenty of room in the family room and dining room.
44589	5593399	9.0	9.0	34863394	Michael and Hope's apartment is on Beacon Hill part of Seattle, WA.. It's exactly as shown in the pictures, large and spacious, with a place for us to safely park our car and use public transportation to all the sights in the city. Michael was kind enough to help us navigate the city. The rental also gave us high speed internet access to make reservations and do our airline check in. Mike also gave us late check out, and let us leave our car in the garage till 10:00pm on our last day so we could spend the day in Seattle and catch the red-eye home.
44590	5593399	9.0	9.0	35559054	Michael did an excellent job of hosting us for our short visit to Seattle!  The place was very clean and tidy, and the location was excellent.  He even arranged for a lift back to the train station for us, which was above-and-beyond!
44591	5593399	9.0	9.0	48001101	"We like the Parkside Condo, easy access to shopping and downtown.  The building is a bit old but the unit interior is comfortable and rather spacious.   Condo is well stocked and we managed to cook a few lunch/dinner after a long day out.   We checked in rather late (around 10pm) and Mike was emailing us to make sure we had no problem getting into the condo.  He is helpful and available when we had questions.

When we were there, one of the elevators in the building complex trapped a resident for a few hours (from 11pm - 3am in the morning).   We did not know about it until some neighbors gathered around the building courtyard and when the police/fire department showed up around 2:30am.   From what we were told the poor guy had been kicking & shouting for help since he was trapped.   We used the stairs after this incident.    "
44940	4374326	9.0	9.0	21774237	Carol was a great host! The room is comfortable, economical and central. Easy access to downtown. It was quiet, clean, and perfect for my stay. I would recommend her rooms to anyone.  She provided me with some snacks which was a really nice touch.
44941	4374326	9.0	9.0	22213635	Carol's place is clean and offers good value for someone who is just looking for a quiet place to sleep and is not high-maintenance... Carol is a very direct and upfront person so it might across intense to some people at first ( Being European, I thought it is Ok ;) but she is a nice person and good host overall. 
44942	4374326	9.0	9.0	22687137	Carol is a fantastic host.  The house is situated in a charming neighborhood.  I had a car and Carol let me park on the driveway.   I would definitely stay next time!  
44943	4374326	9.0	9.0	23256362	Carol was a good trustworthy host thanks.
44944	4374326	9.0	9.0	23667166	Great I came back a second time!
44945	4374326	9.0	9.0	23778981	"Carol is great. I was one of two guests that kept extending our stay. She is a friend now more than a host. Thanks.
"
44946	4374326	9.0	9.0	24123114	I found Carol to be a very friendly host who enjoys talking with her guests.  She is very interested in learning about her guests and sharing her own stories, which I found very enjoyable.  For my situation the easy access to a 15 minute express bus (#9x) to First Hill was ideal; since I work in that area.  I also enjoyed the quiet of the house in the evening; perfect for relaxing and reading, although a TV is available.  
44947	4374326	9.0	9.0	24452631	Same!
44948	4374326	9.0	9.0	24515479	"Carol is simply a delightful host. 

She had everything prepared as listed and she was incredibly accommodating for my needs including amenities and privacy. She is a great conversationalist and just a wonderful human being. I am certain anyone else who visits her place will have a great time!

"
44949	4374326	9.0	9.0	24693393	I didn't get to talk to Carol much since I was out all day, but she was very nice and gave me a nice overview of the house. It's located in Beacon Hill, near Rainier Ave. This gives you access to nearby shopping and a quick route to downtown/Capitol Hill that avoids I-5. The room is warm/large, the bed is comfy, and the bathroom is clean. You also have a private entrance which is great if you're out during the days. Like Carol says in her description, this is a great room if you just need a base of operations while you explore the city. 
44950	4374326	9.0	9.0	27884533	The room is as described with all necessary amenities and plenty of space to walk around. The air bed is comfy with lots of blankets to keep you warm. Wi-fi is fast and reliable. You can walk downhill (or uphill for some exercise) to and from Light Rail station. The place and neighborhood is so quiet (that I need to set my phone to silent lol.) Carol was there to greet me and show me around when I checked in. She is very friendly and gave me overview of the city. We also had a nice little chat. If you are easy-going and only need a room to crash after a long day in the city, this is the place.
44951	4374326	9.0	9.0	28102782	Carol is so great host for sure. She is always very kind and helpful to me, thank you Carol! 
44952	4374326	9.0	9.0	28499842	"I liked staying here. I took Carol's advice and when arriving from downtown I used Beacon Street Station and walked downhill, and when leaving the house to go downtown, I used the Mount Baker Station and walked up hill. 
The bed is very comfortable and the internet connection was fast. I also liked having my own entrance, since I came in around 11 or so.

"
44953	4374326	9.0	9.0	28739476	Carol was a very nice and accommodating host. She offered me free doughnuts and coffee and we had good conversations while I stayed. The room offered enough privacy for me, even though there wasn't a door for the room. Although this space was out of the way from the central part of Seattle, it wasn't too far from the light rail station and traveling back and forth wasn't that bad. I would recommend this space to anyone who needs a place to stay in Seattle, but if you're looking for a place more central, I would recommend finding a place in downtown or in Capitol Hill. 
44954	4374326	9.0	9.0	29358455	Everything was great. Welcoming host. Comfortable room. Definitely recommend.
44955	4374326	9.0	9.0	30482808	Carol was very accommodating with my last minute reservations. Carol is a great host and had great conversations with her during my stay. Due to the location of Carol's house I had the choice of taking the Link(train), bus, or drive my car around Seattle. I ended up leaving my car parked most the time and took advantage of the public transportation to get around Seattle. I definitely recommend staying here and will again when I come back to Seattle!
44956	4374326	9.0	9.0	31273045	Staying at Carol's place was a great pleasure for me. It does look like she has done everything she could to make the guest feel comfortable and welcome in her place. She is a great conversationalist and her house is flooded with books which she actually read. That means you can have great conversations with her about anything in the world.
44957	4374326	9.0	9.0	31609731	"Everything was just how it was described in the posting. The ""air bed"" was very comfortable and had a cushy memory foam mattress on top. The room was spacious and despite not having a door, everything was still relatively private. The location was convenient to bus routes and it was only a 15-20 ride to the airport. I accidentally left some items behind and the host was gracious enough to mail them back to me!  "
44958	4374326	9.0	9.0	32428651	The basement recreation room at Carol's house is spacious and comfortable. The location is great. The side entrance is convenient for coming and going without disturbing your host. Carol is interesting and friendly. I enjoyed my stay and hope to return in the future. 
44959	4374326	9.0	9.0	33050823	This room is large, comfortable, and quiet. Carol is friendly, generous, and helpful. The house is within walking distance to two light rail stations.
44960	4374326	9.0	9.0	34029367	I really enjoyed my stay there. When I was lost in her neighborhood, she managed to find me and take me to her home. She did her best to make me comfortable and I am glad that I chose this place for my Seattle trip. Also, the location was really good for person without a car because it was real convenient to go to downtown.
44961	4374326	9.0	9.0	34385025	Carol was very nice and welcoming when I first arrived. Her place is as advertised. Affordable, clean and very close to downtown. Will stay here again if in Seattle!
44962	4374326	9.0	9.0	34712114	Great experience! Carol was great!
44963	4374326	9.0	9.0	35145902	"I really had a good time at Carol's place.She is a caring person and her house was perfect for me.
Thank you again Carol for everything !"
44964	4374326	9.0	9.0	35433296	Carol is a great host. She is friendly and helpful.
44965	4374326	9.0	9.0	35701056	Responsive host--communication was prompt and clear, though a bit strained at first by mistrust of my identity. Decent location about 25 minutes on the bus from downtown, so a quieter neighborhood without as many main attractions. The place and room itself were very clean, with drinks and snacks offered. Some very specific house rules--not the most laid-back experience, but turned out fine for a short stay.
44966	4374326	9.0	9.0	36886968	"Carol is a great host. This was my first experience using Airbnb and it was a great place to stay. I felt very welcomed from the moment I arrived in Seattle. 
Carol is always willing to talk and share ideas about were to go.
House is close to LINK station and bus stop which was nice for exploring.
"
44967	4374326	9.0	9.0	37411620	"Carol made me feel very welcome, was always open to have conversations in her beautiful backyard and prepared breakfast and hot coffee and tea every morning. She was also respectful of my privacy at the same time.
The basement room was really big, and also nice and cool (air conditioned) which was great since it was very hot that weekend. The room is also very quiet and the bed is comfy. Everything was clean. The neighbourhood is a bit far from downtown but transportation is easy and it's close to the light rail station. There's also lots of cute little restaurants nearby. This is a great place to stay!"
44968	4374326	9.0	9.0	38243708	Carol was helpful. I booked the place short notice and she was quick to comminicate. I would stay again. She was even kind enough to share some beers with an tired traveler.
44969	4374326	9.0	9.0	38656616	I have stayed at five other Airbnb homes in Seattle. I like Carol's place the best and have visited many times. Her home is in a good location and the cool basement rooms have been perfect this hot summer. Carol is genuinely interested in her lodgers and seems to enjoy the variety of people who pass through her doors. 
44970	4374326	9.0	9.0	39226702	"Mi experiencia ha sido fant치stica en todos los sentidos.
Cuando llegu칠, Carol estaba esperando y todo estaba preparado para mi. Toda la casa est치 muy limpia y cuidada y Carol se ocupa muy profesionalmente de su mantenimiento.
Pero lo mejor sin duda es la propia Carol. La mejor y m치s divertida anfitriona que he conocido, con la que es imposible aburrirse y que siempre tiene buenos consejos y recomendaciones para hacer que tu estancia en Seattle sea diferente e inolvidable.
Cuando vuelva a Seattle, definitivamente quiero volver a este alojamiento."
44971	4374326	9.0	9.0	39583485	Carol was a good host and her place was accurate as described in the listing. It was just a short drive into downtown which carol gave me rides to at convenient times. She even provided coffee and snacks in the morning. Everything was clean and I felt like my room was very private. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Carol!
44972	4374326	9.0	9.0	39840681	Carol is incredibly hospitable - everything that I expected I got and sometimes she exceeded these expectations. For example, she provided a complimentary breakfast in the mornings with fresh brewed coffee, which really gave me a great start to the day especially when I was in a rush! Professionally executed Airbnb; would recommend.
44973	4374326	9.0	9.0	40543647	Very friendly host, great big air conditioned room.
44974	4374326	9.0	9.0	41111018	Carol was very accommodating, responsive, and friendly. The ad was accurate, and in a number of ways my expectations were exceeded. Anyone staying in the area should seriously consider renting one of the rooms here.
44975	4374326	9.0	9.0	41910066	Have a great night there. Carol is friendly and easygoing.
44976	4374326	9.0	9.0	42581602	" Carol is very friendly and I should say a great host and person. I was attending a conference and stayed there for 5 days and that was a great experience. 

The room/bathroom/kitchen was quite clean and nice. The place is close to Mount Baker train station and quite convenient if you want to commute to downtown.   
"
44977	4374326	9.0	9.0	43425984	Carol was an amazing host.  My first time using airbnb and she made the experience wonderful.  The room and house was clean.  She was really cool to talk to and hang out with in the backyard.  Also she gave me great tips on where to go and how to get there.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thanks Carol!
44978	4374326	9.0	9.0	44072394	Carol was very friendly and accommodating, and was really informative about places to go to eat and see. The room was very comfortable and exactly as described. The location was convenient as it was close to 2 link stations. I would stay here again!
44979	4374326	9.0	9.0	46344251	Carol replied my enquiries very swiftly and her basement room was quiet and the bed was good for sleeping and resting.  Very good location and easy to transport to and from.  Lots of interesting books all around the room and great to have a private entrance and the access to the patio outside.  Cool excercise machine also, although I did not have a chance to work out on it.  :)
44980	4374326	9.0	9.0	47314032	It was great staying at this place. Carol was very friendly and interactive! The house is also in a calm neighbourhood and has all the required stuff. All in all it was a good experience !!
44981	4374326	9.0	9.0	47592378	Carol's place is my Seattle home away from home. 
44982	4374326	9.0	9.0	50892083	Great experience - room was exactly as described and Carol was super friendly and accommodating!
44983	4374326	9.0	9.0	53842536	Carol was a very welcoming host who provides everything you need to have a pleasant stay. She is a great communicator and takes time to get to know her guests. A nice spot for the solo traveler.
44984	4374326	9.0	9.0	56148551	"Great location in Beacon Hill. Carol was a fantastic host and was very responsive! 

The room is very clean and spacious. There is a TV provided for extra comfort. The room is located on the bottom level of the house, which can be accessed from the side of the house, so it's almost like having your own apartment! There is also parking available, which is very convenient, because parking can be a pain in downtown. 

It was the perfect place for me to spend a week while I was moving into the Seattle location. Within a 5 minute drive from SODO and Downtown areas. 

"
44985	4374326	9.0	9.0	58053662	My experience of stay in Carol's house is fantastic. You can ride the Link from the airport to her house. The house environment exceeds my expectations. The rec room is clean, tidy, private, and big enough. Also, Carol is so far the best airbnb host I have ever met. She is cool, warmhearted, and helpful. I definitely expect to stay in her house next time I go to Seattle. Five-star expience.
45124	6482409	10.0	9.0	34391111	"I found myself needing to find a place at the last minute while visiting friends in Seattle, and landed at the Tiny House. It was perfect -- as compact and cozy and clean as you might expect and very pleasant on a summer weekend. The yard was also really nice. 

I did not get to meet Akiko, but Matt was very friendly and accommodating. 

It was a beautiful stay. I would return anytime."
45125	6482409	10.0	9.0	34615622	Both Akiko and Matt were polite and very welcoming.  Tiny House was exactly as listed.  Perfect for two or small families.  Upstairs bedrooms were cozy and well ventilated to the outside cool air.  We had some trouble connecting to the internet but overall it was a unique and wonderful experience!
45126	6482409	10.0	9.0	35021624	"Akiko and Matt promptly replied to our inquiry.  The Tiny House is amazing.  It's located in Matt's deep back yard, with chairs and a fire grill in front for outdoor comfort. The T House is small but complete.  Two loft beds upstairs and a 6 foot couch downstairs gives u 3 options for sleeping.  Plenty of kitchen utensils are available, and coffee too.
M & A were super friendly and spent time with us, trading adventure tales. 
We will be coming back!"
45127	6482409	10.0	9.0	35844649	This is such a lovely little space, but don't let the little scare you.  It had everything we needed and was super comfortable. Great hosts and very convenient location.
45128	6482409	10.0	9.0	36156826	I had a great time staying here. The place was as described and had everything I needed. I only wish I could have spent more time there! Thanks! 
45129	6482409	10.0	9.0	36431791	"Matt and Akiko's tiny house is super nice and very well appointed. The tiny house has everything you need to enjoy a great stay and was a very cool experience. Transportation is near (lightrail is 10 minute walk, bus is closer) as is a Safeway. For the time being, the lightrail only goes between downtown and the airport. I believe near future plans (2016) have it extending to Cap Hill and the University.

Be sure to check out Seward Park (great trails for hiking, running and biking) and Columbia City as both are pretty close and nice.

Matt and Akiko were extremely attentive and welcoming -- I honestly wish we had more time to hang out.

It is worth noting that the neighborhood around to tiny house appears to be in transition. Having said that, we never felt unsafe.

All in all, the tiny house is a place we will look visit again in the future."
45130	6482409	10.0	9.0	36928332	My dad and I had such a great time staying in Matt and Akiko's tiny house. It is small but the layout is great and it is equipped with everything you'll need to feel at home. The beds were comfortable, the shower was awesome and it's in a great setting tucked away in their backyard. Other perks are the free and unrestricted street parking, walkable distance to the train, grocery and some yummy restaurants. They left lots of helpful information for travelers and Matt was also very accessible when we had questions. If you are at all interested in tiny houses, engage Matt in a conversation about his experience building this one.  
45131	6482409	10.0	9.0	37092790	"Matt and Akiko's tiny house was perfect for me and my husband. It had everything we could possibly need. It felt surprisingly spacious and is extremely well designed and equipped. The attention to detail in the home is extraordinary. We loved every minute of it! 

The tiny house is a quick Uber ride to downtown and about a 20 minute train ride. The train/bus is conveniently located about a 10 minute walk from the house. There is also a supermarket which came in handy. It's also a quick Uber ride from the airport and Amtrak train station.

This is definitely the place to stay if you want a relaxing, quite retreat with easy access to the hustle and bustle of the city. "
45132	6482409	10.0	9.0	37540126	We had a great time visiting the tiny house! The house was new, clean, and functional. Two lofts, WIFI, Apple TV, a composting toilet (don't be scared!), even a full sized shower! The appliances were nice and new. The house is conveniently located near the light rail station. It took us probably a half hour or so to get to Pioneer Square on the train. It was a really cool way to explore the city and get familiar with areas I'd never been to. I'd definitely recommend this tiny house to people wanting to visit Seattle or anyone looking to try out the tiny house lifestyle. Matt was a great and helpful host! We had an awesome time!
45133	6482409	10.0	9.0	37767597	I could not have asked for better hosts or a better experience. The tiny house was very spacious, even with 2 people. Matt and Akiko thought of everything when building this house so every comfort you want or need is provided. The house was definitely part of my Seattle adventure and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. So many different types of restaurants to try nearby and access to downtown was very easy. Akiko and Matt were very gracious hosts and I truly enjoyed their company.
45134	6482409	10.0	9.0	38155309	"If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle where you can minimise your environmental footprint while not sacrificing on comfort, then the Tiny House is for you!  From the moment we walked in, we got a sense for the time, effort and care that Matt and Akiko have put into designing, building and fitting out the house.  It has everything required for a great stay.  The loft-style beds look out over the trees where we saw squirrels running about - it's just like being in a treehouse!

PS - if you're a foodie, the house is located in an area with a multitude of great Vietnamese restaurants.  Don't leave without getting a vietnamese roll.  We also ate twice at the Rainier BBQ - visited by Anthony Bourdain and recommended by Akiko and Matt in the Tiny House book.  Plenty of other suggestions are provided - a thoughtful touch!"
45135	6482409	10.0	9.0	38425564	Loved staying at the tiny house! Matt and Akiko were gracious hosts and the house was a unique way to experience Seattle. Light rail is very close and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly. I highly recommend staying here. You won't regret it!
45136	6482409	10.0	9.0	39035204	"What a charming place this Tiny House is! Clean, compact, such an efficient use of space, and perfect for the two of us. My daughter and I especially loved the two cozy lofts, where we slept hard after wonderful days exploring the Seattle area and Mt. Rainier National Park. We used the nearby light rail to get to and from the city easily. This airbnb worked great for us! 

--Mary and Emma"
45137	6482409	10.0	9.0	39423736	The Seattle Tiny house was a great place to stay while visiting Seattle. Matt and Akiko welcomed us upon our arrival and answered any questions we had. The brochures and informational folder they left were also very helpful to make the best out of our trip.  
45138	6482409	10.0	9.0	40145852	"The tiny house was great, such a lovely place! It turned out to be very spacious even for 3 people. Cleverly constructed and fun to explore.
When we arrived Matt was there to welcome us. The house was very clean and tidy. Basic amenities were provided. On the table you'll find several guides and a guest info book compiled by the hosts. It gives you a nice overview of the area and it's restaurants. We went to 2 of them and both were worth recommending. 
For us the tiny house was part of the perfect Seattle trip. It is something we will always remember. 
"
45139	6482409	10.0	9.0	40635850	"We absolutely loved our stay at Akiko and Matt's Tiny House!  Even with record highs, we slept comfortably.  Akiko and Matt are very welcoming and helpful.  We didn't get a chance to really get to know them as we were constantly on the go, but if we ever make it back to Seattle, we will definitely consider staying here again and hopefully have a chance to hang out a little.

Thanks again!"
45140	6482409	10.0	9.0	40935714	Fantastic hosts, unique accommodations, great experience. Matt and Akiko went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic. Great communication before and during our stay - including letting us know about some big events happening during our visit. Really impressed. The Tiny House is such a fun experience. Small space, but that's the point! Highly recommended. 
45141	6482409	10.0	9.0	41279940	"Akiko and Matt are very friendly and they provided every detail to make my stay comfortable. My flight arrived after midnight, their self checking-in process was super easy and intuitive. Inside of the tiny house it was quite a great experience. It's beyond your normal understanding of ""minimum living"". The house rules are explained in details in a folder on the table. You can find every helpful information in there, very well written. Everything I need to know is explained. The house is great and didn't even feel crowded or tiny. I highly recommend Akiko and Matt's place. "
45142	6482409	10.0	9.0	41359239	Matt and Akiko were wonderful hosts who greeted us cheerfully from the main house. Matt came down and unlocked the door for us and gave us a little insight on his tiny house, that he built himself.  The neighborhood was easy to navigate, very walkable, and had fruit trees dotting the yards. The tiny house was impeccable, smartly set up, and had everything our family of three needed.  I would absolutely recommend these wonderful hosts and their special house.
45143	6482409	10.0	9.0	43372465	Matt and Akiko were among the most hospitable AirBnB hosts I've met, helpful in practical ways and welcoming in the sense of inviting us to dinner with them. The neighborhood is fascinating, full of New American as well as traditional Seattlites, and between the Tiny House and the light rail station are two wonderful blackberry bushes waiting to be picked!
45144	6482409	10.0	9.0	43708096	First of all, Matt and Akiko were great hosts! Upon our arrival, Matt greeted us, unlocked the door and showed us around the house. The house IS tiny, but spacious enough to fit all of our belongings when tucked away in the closet spaces. The house was clean and neat, furnished with comfortable beds, couch, silverware, kitchenware, towels, television, internet and so forth. The compost toilet was an interesting experience since we뗬e never used one before, but it doesn뗪 take long to get used to. It also didn뗪 cause us any problems. Other than that, our stay was pleasant and would definitely recommend to adventurous travelers. Well decorated, cozy and modern feel to the place. We really enjoyed the experience of living in a tiny house!
45145	6482409	10.0	9.0	43928692	Such a great experience!!!
45146	6482409	10.0	9.0	44376949	We really enjoyed our stay at the Matt & Akiko's tiny house. A really cool concept, implemented nicely. Despite its size, the house has just about everything you'd need to live in it long term! We were there for a couple days after a long week of camping at Olympic & Rainier, so it was a wonderful return back into urban life. Didn't run into Akiko while we were there, but I talked to Matt a bit and he was very friendly. Overall a great experience!
45147	6482409	10.0	9.0	44939467	The tiny house was great! We were a group of 3 guys who travel for a living and were meeting up in Seattle for a guys trip. The house made our trip incredible. We didn't have any issues. The composting toilet took a minute to understand and get accustomed to but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The toilet did not smell! They have a nice TV in the house and has an Apple TV hooked up to it but we didn't watch any TV. The hosts were friendly and very accommodating!
45148	6482409	10.0	9.0	45447751	"Absolutely loved staying at the tiny house. Makes me doubt ever staying in a hotel room again. We only saw Matt a couple times and he was delightful to talk to. The space was very clean and cleverly designed. If I'm ever in Seattle again I only hope this place is available again. Their tiny house handbook was very helpful and gave us some great local suggestions. Thank you so much for everything.

Joshua"
45149	6482409	10.0	9.0	45670933	Made the reservation after reading other reviews.  Matt and Akiko were great with communication and really helped seal the deal.  I came into town for a game and this house is a 10 minute walk from the light rail.  The Tiny House isn't really all that tiny if you're not spending you're entire time there.  My 24yo daughter and I aren't small folks and we had plenty of space.  Everything worked and was SPOTLESS!  Much has been said already regarding the eco-toilet.   Its absolutely no big deal.  Finally, Matt was on the spot with local recommendations for food, etc.  Enjoy!
45150	6482409	10.0	9.0	46172228	Though the house is very tiny, everything is provided by the host. It's very quiet. The host is very nice and thoughtful.
45151	6482409	10.0	9.0	46564737	We absolutely loved our stay at the Seattle Tiny House. The house was very charming, clean and private and the description of the space was accurate. The parking was easy, and the yard was lovely and on a very nice, well kept property. I met Matt at the end our stay and he was very nice and welcoming. We would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a very nice, cozy place to stay in the Seattle area. 
45152	6482409	10.0	9.0	46904130	"Matt may not seem like the quintessential homebuilder type, but he has put together one sharp, tiny house nonetheless. If you're even entertaining the idea of super-downsizing your own home this is the ultimate proving ground because this place is as good as tiny gets.

We loved having private access to the place and since our entire trip was public transit based the location couldn't have been better. An easy walk to bus lines and the extraordinarily convenient light rail made our trip!"
45153	6482409	10.0	9.0	48359553	"Cute and clean tiny home, with friendly hosts. Neighborhood is quiet. Despite previous reviewers I would say the area is safe, just older. Train station is with a 5-10 minute walk through a residential neighborhood.

Would definitely recommend!"
45154	6482409	10.0	9.0	48701991	My husband and I recently stayed here and it was fantastic. The tiny home was so quaint and Matt & Akiko were so welcoming. Would definitely stay here again if given the chance. 
45155	6482409	10.0	9.0	50051954	I had such an enjoyable stay in the Tiny House. Matt is a great host and did everything he could to make the stay great. If you've never stayed in a tiny house you owe it to yourself to experience what tiny living is all about. And this is a fun spot to try. And the composting toilet is very easy. Will be staying here again. 
45156	6482409	10.0	9.0	50227106	"Our stay at the Tiny House was terrific.  The location is convenient to the airport and some attractive retail is found both near at hand and on the short trip to downtown.  Accurately described- tiny, but comfortable and functional. The Tiny House is aesthetically satisfying through minimal and tasteful appointments.  This space works. 
We had three adults (one a teenager) so the quarters were close, but totally possible and easily achieved.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
Our stay was brief and totally scheduled so we only crossed paths with Matt once and unfortunately time didn't allow for extended conversation.  Matt and Akiko's property is lovely; the neighborhood is appears to be on the rise in popularity - blocks and blocks of quiet residential bordered by some mixed commercial on main corridors at a a reasonable distance. A great place to stay in a convenient and quiet city neighborhood.  Oh and this property is minutes away from Seward Park, an Olmstead Brothers designed forested park on a hilly promontory that extends into Lake Washington with views of Mercer Island, cityscape, and if sufficiently clear, Mount Rainier. "
45157	6482409	10.0	9.0	50602938	The tiny house is amazing. Perfectly designed for the amount of space and very comfortable. Matt was a great host although we kept to ourselves while there. 10/10 would stay there again. Thanks Matt and Akiko, I would exclusively use air b&b if every place was like this. 
45158	6482409	10.0	9.0	51038886	"We had learned about tiny houses on tv and were excited to stay in one in our trip to Seattle. This tiny house is pretty on the outside and very nicely designed on the inside. My husband, baby and I stayed at the house and we didn't feel crowded. With the two lofts, there was plenty of space. Having the tv available with HBOGo was a plus since the baby had an early bedtime. 

It was really convenient to get to downtown Seattle since the light rail was about a 10-15 minute walk. The ride to downtown was about 20 mins. We tried driving to downtown but with traffic and paying for parking, the light rail is the way to go. "
45159	6482409	10.0	9.0	53531966	Having done quite a bit of reading about tiny house living, we were excited to see a tiny house accommodation on Airbnb.  The space is small as the name indicates, but had everything we needed for a long weekend trip and it was a great experience!  Burner stove, comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood, warm shower and close to Light Rail.  The walk from Othello Light Rail is 10 minutes and the trains come frequently.  The composting toilet is true to it's description and has no odor.  Matt and Akiko were very accommodating and letting us keep our luggage in their garage while we explored the city our last day. It was a treat to be able to experience a tiny space!
45160	6482409	10.0	9.0	54010511	The home was clean and offered all the amenities we needed (specifically a warm shower and comfy beds for weary travelers). Very easy access to the rail - just a 5 minute stroll. Matt also gave timely and easy correspondence on any inquiries we had. 
45161	6482409	10.0	9.0	54906002	Staying at the tiny house was a new experience. It provided everything we needed and was very cozy. Matt and Akiko were very nice and attentive! 
45162	6482409	10.0	9.0	55392916	The tiny house is tiny, as described, but a cute experience. The house is designed with a nice radiant heat system where it kept the floors heated, but I didn't really feel it warm up the whole house as I was expecting. On my last night, I actually bumped into Akiko and mentioned that it was a little cold but nothing I couldn't handle. Matt heard and was super nice to bring over a space heater for me. He also told me a bit about how he designed this house over the past year. Akiko and Matt were so sweet. 
47244	491958	10.0	9.0	1667700	Jay, Colleen, Mica & Gigi-dog were excellent hosts! They welcomed us with warm and cheerful greetings as well as a delicious treat from the local bakery! They even delivered us a fan when the weather was projected to climb above 75, which was so considerate, although, the majority of the trip we thoroughly enjoyed having all the windows open to allow for the cool & crisp Seattle breeze to set the temperature of the apartment. Jay took the time to share some gems with us on good places to eat, event happenings and must-do activities in the charming Columbia City area as well as greater Seattle. After that, they allowed us total privacy in our treehouse apartment retreat. The apartment was our perfect home away from home after expoloring all that Columbia City and Seattle has to offer. In Columbia City, we hit up the local Farmer's Market, listened to some great live music during Beatwalk, perused the little shops and galleries and enjoyed delicious coffee and meals all within walking distance of the house. The location is convenient to the major highways as well, so downtown and the airport were extremely accessible and just a quick 10-15 minute drive. The apartment is just as described and pictured, immaculately clean with all the bases covered. The bed was extrmemely plush and comfortable, probably some of the best sleep we've had in a long while. We had a truly wonderful experience and would highly recommend Jay and his Columbia City Treehouse to anyone visiting Seattle!
47245	491958	10.0	9.0	1691431	Wonderful place in a great neighborhood near much of the best of Seattle. The place was clean. Check in and out easy. The Rood's were very nice and helpful. I would highly recommend it. Loved the treehouse feeling.
47246	491958	10.0	9.0	1819816	"Lovely, very clean, little apartment under a large tree (thus ""the treehouse"").  It was bigger than the pictures portray and perfect for my brother and I to stay in different rooms. Jay and his family were very accommodating and GiGi the dog greeted us as we came and went.  I would definitely recommend this place!"
47247	491958	10.0	9.0	1837775	A very clean little apartment, everything feels brand new. A long walk from the business area of Columbia City, it would be best to have a car. The hosts were friendly without being intrusive. It feels like the countryside out there!
47248	491958	10.0	9.0	1982895	Seattle is a very nice and lovely town as much ist Jays treehouse. It췂s small but really clean and we enjoyed our stay especially the big balcony under the tree. Jay is a helpful host who provided us with books and maps of Seattle. 
47249	491958	10.0	9.0	2159496	"We enjoyed our stay tremendously- so much that we will soon be back!
Franka, Dexter and Eric"
47250	491958	10.0	9.0	2240116	Convenient location and quiet, nice community! I stayed here for two nights with my parents and my sister. We really appreciate the home feel here and making breakfast together every morning. All facilities are great. The host is very friendly and helpful. Strongly recommended to couples with/without a child.
47251	491958	10.0	9.0	2278746	"My mother and I had such a wonderful experience at the treehouse apartment!  It was clean, quiet, comfortable and beautiful and had with a well equip kitchen that we took full advantage of!  Our hosts were kind,  helpful, respectful of our space and flexible with our schedule.  It was a nice walk (about 1/4 mile and hilly which could be hard for some) down to the super cute columbia city strip, where there were some great cafes, shops, bars/live music venues,  a bakery and a yoga studio.    It was also a good walk/short drive away from a local organic co-op where we did our grocery shopping for the stay.   

Columbia City is a great neighborhood -- a bit removed from downtown, but this apartment is close enough to public transit to make it a relatively easy commute anywhere.  

Highly recommended! "
47252	491958	10.0	9.0	2351321	This was ideal for my husband and me.  Couldn't have worked better.  Very comfortable, spacious and quiet.. Our daughter lives close by so the location was great too.
47253	491958	10.0	9.0	2418664	My wife, sister-in-law, and I stayed for 3 nights, and we have nothing but positive things to say about our stay.  First of all, the space was modernized, clean, fun, accommodating, and-- did I say-- clean?  Careful thought was put into the guests' experience, and I truly appreciate that. Jay and the gang were fun and down-to-earth. The bathroom was fully stocked with CLEAN towels and soap, and the kitchen was also stocked with plenty of dishes, rags, coffee mugs, appliances, dish soap, bottle opener, and just about anything else we needed during the stay. I am so pleased to leave high marks for Jay and our stay at his Treehouse Apt. 
47254	491958	10.0	9.0	2543082	Nice clean place with everything we needed for a great stay.   Kitchen was well equipped and also had a microwave which we didn't see listed in the description.  Light, airy, nice location, walking distance to Columbia City shops and restaurants, as well as to the Columbia City Light Rail station for trips to/from SeaTac and/or downtown.   Short drive to beautiful Seward Park with spectacular views of Mt. Rainier on a clear day.    Fast WIFI, and greatly appreciated the bathtub after a long day walking all over downtown Seattle.  Jay was great and his dog Gigi was an added bonus!  
47255	491958	10.0	9.0	2588749	The Columbia City Treehouse is comfortable, quiet and in a great Seattle neighborhood. Jay is a good communicator and check in and out is simple. This was my second stay here and I once again enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend it!
47256	491958	10.0	9.0	2840967	Apartment was awesome and as described.  Will visit again.
47257	491958	10.0	9.0	3043693	The Columbia City Treehouse is a wonderful, quiet, and private hotel alternative in a great neighborhood. Jay and his family are really nice, interesting and helpful people. The place is pictured accurately, clean, and has a very comfortable bed. You can't go wrong staying here!
47258	491958	10.0	9.0	3317709	The Treehouse is great! Before heading to the apartment, Jay established himself as a friendly, good communicator who was willing to be flexible. Our stay was great - the apartment was spotless and tidy and you could tell the hosts took pride in their space. Of note was a great heater, lots of clean extra sheets and towels, TV/Cable/Wireless, and a great kitchen. It was the perfect home during our Seattle stay - about a 10 minute walk from the light rail to the airport and downtown, and even closer to buses. Jay was also just a nice guy who gave us plenty of space but was also open to any questions we may have had. Highly recommended!
47259	491958	10.0	9.0	3340396	Our hosts were very friendly and accomodating. The treehouse apartment was perfect for our stay. We would definitely stay there again.
47260	491958	10.0	9.0	3416412	I really enjoyed my stay! The property is very nice and the neighborhood is great. The treehouse has a great layout to utilize all the space. The bed is comfortable, couch too, the kitchen is brand new looking with garbage disposal and all the pots/pans/utensils/dishes you would need, the bathroom has a full bathtub and the deck is a good size. Jay was very easy to work with and I would defiantly recommend this rental. 
47261	491958	10.0	9.0	3435450	"The Treehouse at Columbia City was wonderful!  It was very clean and nicely organized.  I felt very safe there and slept great on the very comfy bed.  In the morning I enjoyed coffee made in the French press - the first time I ever used one, and I loved the flavor of the coffee, which I had picked up in a little gourmet shop downtown.  There was a toaster and pots and pans for cooking, plus a dishwasher.  Clean up was easy!  I could listen to music on the CD player, or watch TV when it was time to relax.  It was about a 20 minute walk to the Light Rail when I decided not to drive my rental car.  All very nice!  
 "
47262	491958	10.0	9.0	3675268	This worked very well for us.  It is well furnished, very clean and the view was lovely.  Lots of windows was a plus.  The queen bed was very comfortable.  Loved the world map on the shower curtain!  The owner responded promptly to emails and phone calls, and was available to give us a key when we arrived.   
47263	491958	10.0	9.0	3790595	My boyfriend and I visited Seattle for 5 nights and the treehouse apartment was great! The kitchen was well-stocked and we had everything we needed to cook and relax. The location is very good, as long as you don't mind a bit of a walk to the metro. Jay was very friendly and welcoming; we would definitely stay here again!
47264	491958	10.0	9.0	3852493	My in-laws stayed at the C.C. Treehouse Apt.  for a week.  The apartment was very clean and inviting.  Everyone felt comfortable and cared for.  Jay was always accommodating and friendly.  In all of our email and phone correspondence he was very prompt in responding.  I will be encouraging the rest of my family and friends to stay here when visiting Seattle!
47265	491958	10.0	9.0	3874121	"We loved Jay's treehouse - one of the highlights of our Round-the-World trip. The apartment adjoins the main house but is completely separate, and you do almost feel like you're in your own little 'treehouse'. It is the perfect size for a couple, cleverly designed, with all the amenities we needed for our two night stay. 

The neighbourhood is a delight, peaceful but close enough to drive right into Seattle, should one wish to do so. We chose to catch the LINK train, which was an easy walk away through downtown Columbia City's buzzing hub, and then 15 mins ride to downtown Seattle. Super easy and super green (but you could take your car close to the station should you wish to). Columbia City is worth a mooch in itself - we loved it so much we want to move there!

The local area is so relaxing, there's beautiful Lake Washington nearby, and a great PCC for groceries - fab pizzas and organic wine.

Jay was an excellent host, he was quick to respond and gave us all the information we needed. He was available if we needed anything, but left us in total privacy for our stay.

We're only sorry we couldn't stay longer - thanks Jay and family!"
47266	491958	10.0	9.0	4096690	"I am grateful for the opportunity that I was able to stay at your lovely ""TreeHouse apartment.  It was wonderful! The apartment is well laid out with all the basic amenities one needs to make you feel right at home. The location was convenient for going around Seattle. Downtown is just a quick train ride away and buses are easily available to get to and from places. It's a great neighborhood too - lots of places like grocery store, restaurants and coffee shop, are within walking distance. And best of all, it is right by Lake Washington and Seward Park. The host himself is super nice and readily available when you need help. I definitely recommend this apartment for a great stay in Seattle. Thank you again Jay for everything!!!  :)"
47267	491958	10.0	9.0	4141250	We spent 5 nights at the tree house in Columbia City and it was fabulous! The place is clean, well-organized and super quiet. It is cozy but big enough for our 2 kids (3 & 6) and us.  The beds are very comfortable (especially the futon in the living area).  I recommend the Tree House to anyone looking for a great location to stay in Seattle.  Best of all, Jay, the owner, is a kind and wonderful host!  
47268	491958	10.0	9.0	4479628	My daughter and I had a beautiful time in Seattle and the tree house was perfect : easy access dowtown, then peace and quiet in a clean and well equipped apartment, then the other side of Seattle : the lake, the parks, the people... and trees and flowers blooming everywhere. Jay was a perfect host - available but discreet. Glad to have seen the best of the city!
47269	491958	10.0	9.0	4604482	We used Jays place when we were visiting our new grand-daughter in columbia city. The treehouse is secluded and private. Jay is super friendly and the room had everything we needed. We thought it was great and we will use it again. We loved it!
47270	491958	10.0	9.0	4771741	Jay was very easygoing. He gave us easy directions to the rail which is a short walk from the house. We left our car parked at his house and took the rail to the city center which saved a lot on parking fees. The treehouse is very clean and bright with many windows. We actually went out to buy a deck of cards one night, but later realized there was a deck provided under the tv. There was also a binder of maps, sights to see and bus schedules in the apartment. Jay's place is recommended by me!
47271	491958	10.0	9.0	4830813	"My grandchildren loved the TreeHouse!-as did we.
We live in the Columbia City neighborhood and our family reunion overflowed our home.  The TreeHouse was a wonderful ""extension"".
One branch of the family stayed there and it was perfect.
Well equipped, very convenient for us and with access to so many places and modes of transportation.
Jay was very prompt and clear with communication and that gets a high rating.    
We will definitely recommend the Treehouse and our family will use it again, when our main house bulges with visiting relatives.
Thanks very much Jay and Coleen and Mica and Gigi(too).
Aleana"
47272	491958	10.0	9.0	5080126	"I LOVED my stay at Jay's tree house. It was so close to Seward Park, blocks away from light rail and some of the best cafe's, and restaurants. It's clean, quiet, very blight, and equipped with all the necessities. I would definitely stay here again once my travels bring me back to the NW. Jay is a great host, and I highly recommend his place to anyone :-)

-Amrit"
47273	491958	10.0	9.0	5156369	This was our second stay here and it was as good as the first one.  It is very quiet at night, even with windows open.  The natural lighting is a real plus.  The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and pots and pans and it would be easy to prepare good meals here.  We tend to have a cup of tea and toast in the morning and then join our family for the rest of the day, because they are so close. I can highly recommend this place.
47274	491958	10.0	9.0	5228239	When visiting Seattle, this is a very nice play to stay! Nested in  the treetops is a very quit appartment that is equipped with every thing you need, from pots and pans to bus-schedules. A few streests (with hills) down there are restaurants and the light-rail and bus are close to bring you to down-town Seattle.
47275	491958	10.0	9.0	5258940	"We had the most wonderful short stay with Jay in his lovely treehouse apartment. 

He greeted our very tired, jetlagged family warmly and extremely kindly organised for his daughters car to take us to the supermarket and farmers market! Jay even bought us freshly roasted and ground coffee for our breakfast! 

The apartment was perfect for our needs (safe for our crawling 9mo and the two beds were extremely comfortable). The kitchen was well stocked, the shower pressure nice and strong, the linens high quality. 

The shopping strip is just a couple of short blocks away (an easy walk even with kids, though it us up and down hills), complete with Starbucks, bakeries, supermarkets, bars and cute shops. Columbia City really is a great little neighborhood.

We couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable stay; we only wish we could've stated longer!"
47276	491958	10.0	9.0	5289650	"Our stay at the treehouse apartment in Columbia City made for a quite enjoyable one. As soon as we parked, Jay's wife, Colleen offered us warm greetings. (Jay was away from the house at the time of our arrival). She gave us suggestions on the best food and goings-on in the downtown Columbia City strip. They were always available whenever needed, yet quite respectful of our privacy whenever we were upstairs, enjoying our retreat in the treehouse.

The apartment possesses an open layout with high ceilings which gave the treehouse quite a spacious feel. It became clear quite early on that two very skilled architects involved themselves in the construction and design of the apartment  I also fancied the wood flooring in its bedroom, the modernity of its appliances and the wide selection of channels available via television.

I would recommend Jay and the treehouse apartment to anyone visiting Seattle, especially the southern neighborhoods of Seattle (including downtown and the Capitol Hill area)."
47277	491958	10.0	9.0	5340203	The Treehouse is a wonderful place to stay -- A great space and with great hosts.  Will definitely be staying here again next time I'm in Seattle.
47278	491958	10.0	9.0	5433436	"Es ist sehr nett an einem gro른n Baum mit einer schattigen Terrasse,
Gut um nach dem Sihht-aseeing zu erholen.
Die Vermieter sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit!!
Das Haus ist au른rhalb in einer sehr ruhigen Gegend. Mit dem Auto sehr gut zu errreichen und zu parken. Um mit dem Bus/Stra른nbahn in die Stadt zu faheren mu man aber erst 15 Minuten gehen.
Die Wohnung ist f칲r 2 Personen super, f칲r 3 machbar f칲r 4 Personen aber ein weig klein.
Insgsamt:Sehr empfehlenswert."
47279	491958	10.0	9.0	5577492	"This is an absolutely wonderful place to stay and explore Seattle. We would definitely stay here again.

The location is quiet and convenient. It was lovely to have a kitchen to prepare coffee and breakfast in the morning. The bed was exceedingly comfortable, and it really felt like waking up in a tree house. "
47280	491958	10.0	9.0	5979962	This was my second stay here and I look forward to the next one.  Jay and Colleen are extremely nice.  The apartment is very well set up for any length stay.
47281	491958	10.0	9.0	6024459	The Treehouse is a great place to be for a Seattle stay. Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. Jay (and Gigi) were both very hospitable, the place was super clean and the bed ultra comfortable. Very safe area, easy walk to the train station and a parking space!
47282	491958	10.0	9.0	6340481	"We had a great stay at the Treehouse accommodation. We really enjoyed stay and Jay's warm and flexible hospitality.We will definitely recommend this accommodation to family and friends.
"
47283	491958	10.0	9.0	6752497	Jay's treehouse is a good base for us to check out what the Eastside (Bellevue area) can offer. His place is cozy and comfortable. I appreciate his thoughtfulness to all the details.
47284	491958	10.0	9.0	6804330	We started our US road trip at the Colombia city  treehouse. A very nice place and Jay is the perfect host. Very friendly and helpful. The treehouse  is a short walk from restaurants and to the train to the airport and downtown Seattle. We will definitely stay at the treehouse again if we return to Seattle. Thanks Jay for a perfect start on our holiday.
47285	491958	10.0	9.0	6875339	The treehouse apartment was a perfect AirBnB experience!  It was so clean and comfortable, exactly what we needed after a weekend of camping in the North Cascades for our friend's wedding.  Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful apartment, we had a great time!
47286	491958	10.0	9.0	6981152	We very much enjoyed our stay in this lovely little flat, just right for two people. It's in a very pretty, quiet location, surrounded by trees. It's a 15-20 minute (rather hilly!) walk to Columbia City where there are shops and restaurants and a must-visit bakery. From Columbia City you can get a tram right into the middle of Seattle. Jay was a very welcoming and most helpful host, and not at all phased by us being 3 hours late due to delays at the border.
47287	491958	10.0	9.0	7193583	Didn't get to meet Jay on our visit, but his wife was kind enough to pick us up from the Link station when we got turned around trying to make our way to the apartment on foot. Very walkable location if you aren't afraid of a few hills, and the apartment itself was lovely. Would recommend staying here if you are looking to come home to some peace and quiet after the bustle of downtown Seattle. Stop by the local Columbia City Bakery and Espresso Bar if you stay here!
47288	491958	10.0	9.0	7274412	Really nice apartment and friendly host and family. A little far from the city center as expected, but a very nice calm neighborhood; we had the best sleep in ages. Thanks Jay. Great place to stay in Seattle.
47289	491958	10.0	9.0	7487274	"Very comfortable, very clean and cozy with beatiful tree near the entrance! One of the best places I've ever stayed before. 

Thank you very much, Jay for everything! Our next stay in Seattle will be in your appartments :)"
47290	491958	10.0	9.0	7578804	Great accommodations! Very comfortable for the two of us and was very clean and well maintained.  Will definitely stay there again.
47291	491958	10.0	9.0	7645378	We enjoyed our stay at Jay's apartment.  It was very quiet and peaceful.  Parking was a problem one night.
47292	491958	10.0	9.0	7769915	"Jays treehouse in Columbia City was our first experience with airbnb. The treehouse is a spacious, clean and adorable alternative to a hotel. The coffee (Empire!) , bars (Lottie's!) restaurants and bakery nearby are all great! I was nervous about feeling ""awkward"" staying at someone's house but it couldn't be farther from that. The treehouse is very private. This location is very convenient to downtown and Capital Hill (so cute!!!); about 15 minutes. 
I would definitely stay with Jay again."
47293	491958	10.0	9.0	8079437	The apartment was great - clean, spacious for a small apartment, wonderful sunset views, quiet, peaceful location and gracious hosts. Jay offered to pick me up at the light rail when I arrived in Seattle (my son picked me up so didn't need the ride but it would have been most appreciated!)  The apartment really is as advertised - a lovely oasis in a busy city, but close enough to walk to the bus stop and local shops.  I will definitely return to the treehouse when I am back in Seattle.
47294	491958	10.0	9.0	8256737	"The Treehouse in Columbia City is a lovely place to stay.  Our hosts were helpful, cheerful, and fun.  The apartment is such a nice space:  lots of light, an open design, well appointed and stocked, and a comfortable bed.  This met our needs perfectly.  We're keeping our fingers crossed that The Treehouse will be available the next time we have out of town guests/family visiting.
Thanks Jay!
"
47295	491958	10.0	9.0	8369543	Had a wonderful 3-night stay in the Treehouse. Immaculately clean, very comfortable, well-situated to my itinerary, and stocked with all the essentials. Will hopefully stay again on my next trip to Seattle.
47296	491958	10.0	9.0	8513534	Jay was fantastic -- our plans changed three or four times in the span of two days, and he rolled with it every time. Thanks again for a great respite from a crazy few days!
47297	491958	10.0	9.0	8597576	Wonderful place - exactly as pictured. Very clean, convenient, and had all the amenities needed for either a weekend or extended stay. Would definitely stay here again.
47298	491958	10.0	9.0	8977317	"We had a great stay in the treehouse. It was spacious enough for my wife and I, our daughter in her pack-n-play, as well as my mother-in-law out on the futon. It was clean, quiet and peaceful regardless of the fact that it was right near everything.  We will definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Seattle. 

Thanks Jay!"
47299	491958	10.0	9.0	9138595	This Apt. was great for our visit to Columbia City and we will return to it in the near future.
47300	491958	10.0	9.0	9422940	"NIce little apartment in a cool, eclectic neighborhood, walking distance from a great bakery and several restaurants and coffee shops. The apartment was clean, neat, and had everything we needed. Jay and is family were great hosts, and were seemingly and hopefully unbothered by our 7-month-old, who isn't a great sleeper. Would definitely stay here again.
"
47301	491958	10.0	9.0	9599386	"Great place to start the year! Loved it at Jay's, very nice family. Very accommodating, and amazingly nice. This place was a wonderful place to stay, even if it was for 2 nights. It almost seemed to good to be true. All the previous comments were on point, so don't you give it a second thought if you are considering your stay here. Would definitely come back here if given
 the second chance. Thank you again Jay!"
47302	491958	10.0	9.0	10616730	The Treehouse was very cute and in a quiet neighborhood. It was a great place to come and unwind after a day exploring the city. I would stay there again.
47303	491958	10.0	9.0	10724611	The apartment is lovely in a great part of town. It's a bit off the beaten path so if you want to say you've been to a neighborhood that tourists don't often frequent then this is your best bet.
47304	491958	10.0	9.0	10911443	"Apartment was great; clean and just like the pictures showed it to be. 
Not too far of a walk from the light rail to downtown Seattle or to the airport. I went downtown Seattle or to the university district at least twice a day during my stay here and it wasn't a problem at all. Really enjoyed my stay at Jays. Definitely recommend it. "
47305	491958	10.0	9.0	11405492	We had a wonderful stay. The treehouse apartment was the perfect place for my daughter, her friend, and me while we explored Seattle and visited nearby colleges. Jay was a great host and we loved Columbia City. It was an easy walk to a fantastic bakery and many great restaurants as well as public transportation. I would definitely stay here next time I'm in Seattle.
47306	491958	10.0	9.0	11566375	Jay was lovely and the apartment was clean and perfect for our needs. Lovely to be high above the ground overlooking the grand tree and the park below.
47307	491958	10.0	9.0	11706041	"Wonderful little place up in the trees.  Very modern and clean, but with a rustic homey feel.  A very convenient location for day trips to the flight museum, downtown, Pioneer Square, and the stadiums.

Three things we must share... Just north on Raineer Ave., we found Borracchini's Bakery that had super awesome deserts, sandwiches and soup for a great price, and a produce market at 2119 Rainier (can't remember the name) that had unbelievable prices on fruits and vegis.  Finally, Seward Park on Lake Washington is a short distance away and has beautiful views, lots of walking trails, and a great playground for the kids. Thanks for the stay and give Gigi a pet on the head for us."
47308	491958	10.0	9.0	11868420	We really liked staying at Jays. The place was clean and quite. The host was gracious and helpful. I would stay here again without hesitation. There was off street parking and queen bed and a queen futon. I an allergic to pets and Jay confirmed that no pets stayed in the apartment.
47309	491958	10.0	9.0	12111397	It was a lovely time. His apartment was perfect , clean, quiet and near transportation. We didn't rent a car once! We also got alot fitter climbing the hills. Not bad after the first two times. The diners and bars were great. We weren't that far from downtown and many options to get there. The neighborhood is quaint and warm. We really enjoyed it and plan to stay again! Greg & Irene
47310	491958	10.0	9.0	12294380	A great little space in Columbia City, clean and well kept. Within reasonable walking distance to light rail transit station, giving people easy access to DT or airport. 
47311	491958	10.0	9.0	13944490	"I stayed at Jay's for an extended period of time, and the entire experience exceeded my expectations. Jay's apartment is clean, comfortable, and has everything you could possibly need.

More importantly, Jay and his family are fantastic hosts. They made sure I was taken care of, and they definitely represent the best of what Airbnb has to offer. 

The location was nice for nightlife too--Columbia City has some really nice bars, restaurants, and coffee shops, and I'll really miss the neighborhood. 

Highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle. "
47312	491958	10.0	9.0	14195129	The treehouse was a very calm and beautyfull accomodation to start our vacation with. We felt very comfortable. Easy acces by train from columbia city to seattle downtown. Anytime again!
47313	491958	10.0	9.0	14859925	The Treehouse is very very nice and we really enjoyed our stay there. Communication was easy and all things were very well organized. Buses and the metro can be reached within a 10-15 minutes walk. Many thanks to Jay and his family!! 
47314	491958	10.0	9.0	15211083	Nice and cozy! Would stay again!
47315	491958	10.0	9.0	15481116	We enjoyed our stay with Jay and his family. They were gracious and helpful. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, and convenient to the places we needed to be. Everything we needed was there, and the surrounding trees helped to keep it cool on the hot days. The neighborhood was quiet, and the neighbors even stopped the fireworks at a very reasonable hour on the 4th. We would love to stay here again the next time we come to Seattle.
47316	491958	10.0	9.0	16057102	The treehouse was exactly what we needed for our stay in Columbia City. It's very comfortable and Jay and his family took care of us as if we were their guests. We've already booked this location for our next visit.
47317	491958	10.0	9.0	16287538	It was a perfect place for the start of our family Westcoast-Trip. location was clean, comfortable, privat and cozy. thanks for the uncomplicated hospitality. The neighbourhood is quiet, the housedog friendly and in short distance you find good groceries and restaurants. It was our first airbnb-Experience in USA and we're complitely happy with it. 
47318	491958	10.0	9.0	16413773	Jay was great. The place was very cute and comfortable. Loved staying there.
47319	491958	10.0	9.0	16656299	Clean apartment and very nice place to stay. 10 min walk to bus or 15 min walk to air train to downtown. 
47320	491958	10.0	9.0	17036714	The listing was more then what we expected. The place was extremely clean and we had everything we needed.. We had enough space for my husband and I and our 2 younger boys. Loved that there were enough hooks in the bathroom to hang all of our towels and lots of closet space for our suitcases. It was great to have a dishwasher too. We felt safe in the neighborhood and if we had any questions we knew Jay, the owner would answer them. Jay always responded to emails and questions in a timely manner. We will definitely stay here again when we get back to Seattle to visit my sister. 
47321	491958	10.0	9.0	17668028	The treehouse was perfect for our stay.   Most of the stay we parked our motorcycles and walked to the trains and shopping.  The location is on a private dead end and the neighborhood was very safe to walk at night.  The treehouse had everything we needed and if it didn't Jay was very accommodating.  
47322	491958	10.0	9.0	17930510	Meeting Jay and staying at his Treehouse Apartment was a real pleasure. It is in a beautiful neighborhood and is a great little spot to relax. As an extra bonus it is pretty close to the Columbia City light rail station which I took downtown and also used to get to the airport when my stay was done. I'm so glad I found this place. It was just what I was looking for.
47323	491958	10.0	9.0	18131417	"We had a great time in Seattle. Stayed at Jay's tree house for 3 days in mid-August. Very convinient location, away from busy streets but still close to the center. Beautiful view, fresh air. Apartment was clean, and comfortable. Jay has everything we needed in the kitchen (full kitchen, not kitchennete). There were four of us - two adults and two boys, who shared the futon. Tight but still very comfortable for a family. 
Communication before the stay was quick; Jay met us at the door when we arrived. 
If you want a confortable budget place close to Seattle Downtown, this is it! 
Thank you, Jay!
Elena, Roger and the boys :)"
47324	491958	10.0	9.0	18464836	The treehouse was great - as described - fit our needs perfectly. Jay was away when we got there but correspondence by email was easy, as was access to the apartment.
47325	491958	10.0	9.0	18935089	We had a lovely stay in the Treehouse.  It's in a very peaceful location.  Everything was lovely and clean.
47326	491958	10.0	9.0	19270108	Jay and his wife run an exemplary Airbnb! The welcome we received was warm and friendly, the neighbourhood is residential and feels very safe with nice restaurants a short 10 minute walk away. The accommodation itself is a self-contained upstairs flat complete with cooking facilities. I would stay here again and again without hesitation.
47327	491958	10.0	9.0	19419244	Jay is super accommodating and flexible with check-in/out times. The apartment was perfect for my brother and I and it looks exactly how the pictures show it to be.
47328	491958	10.0	9.0	19595721	From the moment I was in contact with Jay I knew our trip would be fantastic. The Treehouse was very comfortable and extremely easy to make home. The neighbor hood was perfect, close to the lake and great food and coffee. Everything is walkable and Jay and his family were happy to help us navigate when necessary. All and all the stay really helped to make our trip easy breezy and surely one to remember. 
47329	491958	10.0	9.0	19745488	"Our stay at the tree house was exactly what we needed. When we arrived, Jay was there to welcome us, even though it was a bit late (we got delayed on the drive). He walked us upstairs to the apartment, which is actually a part of their house which has been sectioned off into a separate suite. The suite is very nice, clean, and has everything you would expect.

The neighborhood was probably the most pleasant surprise. Columbia City is a part of Seattle I had never visited. Clearly, it has just seen a major revitalization. There are several bars and restaurants about a 10-15 minute walk from the house, some of which are downright excellent. In particular, we loved Tutta Bella (a very authentic pizza place) and the Columbia City Ale House. There are also several African restaurants in the area. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. It's a bit out of the way, but the light rail makes it a 15 minute ride to downtown, maybe less. Jay is a great host, available when you need him and out of your way when you want privacy. We were only there a couple of days, but we talked to many people while walking around and did not meet a single unpleasant person. Seriously, not one."
47330	491958	10.0	9.0	20013972	We loved Jay's Treehouse. It's conveniently located in Columbia City, 30 minutes from downtown Seattle (by public transport). The apartment is clean, completely furnished and comes with plenty of space for up to 4 people. Jay was an excellent host, always available to provide local recommendations. 
47331	491958	10.0	9.0	20277590	We had a nice stay at Jay's. It was comfortable, clean, quiet, and in a good location. Restaurants and coffee shops were close and it was a quick drive downtown.
47332	491958	10.0	9.0	21868084	"Jay was so welcoming. I was staying for a whole month and had a large amount of luggage. He kindly offered to pick me up from the light rail station, which is very near the house but would have been tough with a month's worth of bags to wrangle with. He helped orient me to the neighborhood and toured me through the property to acquaint me.
During my stay, Jay was very responsive through phone communication and very accommodating of any needs I had; for example cleaning of linens/towels etc, where to park my bike, etc. The house is also in a very nice neighborhood and even people who lived on the block were very nice when I ran into them."
47333	491958	10.0	9.0	22104697	"Jay was a great host.  I only stayed for a short period, but he was very flexible with my schedule and gave me and my girlfriend a warm welcome.  Everything was clean and there were no major complaints.  

The surrounding neighborhood is absolutely beautiful.  We kept falling in love with every house we saw along the way.  There's also a great view of Lake Washington and the lakefront from this area.  Lots of grand rolling hills and quaint cafes and eateries in this area.

For those who do want to cook in the apartment, just know that the saut칠 pan available is about 8 inches in diameter, so don't expect to cook a dish that's so large. "
47334	491958	10.0	9.0	22620104	We were totally delighted with the  Treehouse.  Jay met us at the door, handed us the keys and left this private getaway to us.  The Treehouse is exceptionally clean, comfortable and quiet.  We especially appreciated the full kitchen that had everything we needed to prepare meals.  The fact that it is nestled in the trees in a neighborhood with big yards removes the experience from the hectic energy of the city, and yet we were a comfortable 10 minute walk from the shops and restaurants of Columbia City.  We hope to return.
47335	491958	10.0	9.0	22768426	This space was exactly as pictured and wonderful. The kitchen was fully stocked with everything I needed to cook with. Such a great stay and will definitely be back and recommend to friends visiting the city. 
47336	491958	10.0	9.0	22930676	This was our first experience with Air BnB and it was great! The apartment is in a great location with a ton around it, so the spot is cool. The interior was super cute and simple with everything we needed. We didn't cook or anything, but had the ability. Jay was great. Very easy and laid back. We didn't communicate a ton as it was a straight forward experience (he leaves a binder with things to do, wifi, etc).  Overall it was really good for a simple stay. I didn't realize (and this was probably my bad being a newbie) that this was an apartment above the house. This really wasn't a problem at all, but I did feel like I had that in the back of my mind a bit (in terms of walking loudly or having visitors (my boyfriend's family is in the area). So just something to keep in mind. But honestly, great and simple.
47337	491958	10.0	9.0	23015053	Our stay was great! We had everything we needed.
47338	491958	10.0	9.0	23543654	Comfortable clean place in Columbia City. Jay is very responsive & accommodating.  Everything you need is provided. Will definitely be back 
47339	491958	10.0	9.0	24027582	The apartment was exactly what we needed - clean, attractive, well-stocked.  Perfect for a couple.  Jay made it super easy to accomodate our late arrival too.  There are several good restaurants and markets within a few blocks.  And there's a view of Lake Washington from the deck and bedroom.  Will definitely stay again when we're in Seattle.
47340	491958	10.0	9.0	24458258	"We enjoyed our stay at the Treehouse.  Jay and his family are great people and have always made us feel welcome.  We look forward to many visits in the future.

Kathleen and Bob"
47341	491958	10.0	9.0	24628312	The Treehouse was my first Airbnb experience and I enjoyed it thoroughly! We were greeted with the keys to our private apartment fully socked with kitchen items and fresh towels. The tv has cable and the couch is extremely comfy. We had an easy walk to catch the bus to the Seahawks game. Parking was a breeze next to the apartment as well. Staying at the Treehouse was refreshing, as it gave us the peace and tranquility that a hotel simply would not provide. I recommend this specific airbnb to anyone staying in the greater Seattle area! 
47342	491958	10.0	9.0	25766208	Next time I'm in Seattle, I will book this adorable little apartment with Jay. The pictures where true to how the place looked. Jay was easy to communicate with and the perfect host. I loved it and highly recommend it!
47343	491958	10.0	9.0	26214893	Had a fine stay in the Treehouse. Nice neighbourhood and chill apartment. All was very clean and all things you need for a short stay was present. Thanks Jay for your hospitality.
47344	491958	10.0	9.0	26320937	The treehouse was amazing! It was just as described. It's located in a quiet neighborhood with a bit of a walk to public transit. We had a car to get around and it was easy to find parking on the street. We preferred sleeping on the futon over the bed because it was in front of the TV and was firmer. The small wall heater was able to heat the place quickly. Jay kept the bathroom stocked with fresh towels, the bedroom with extra pillows and blankets, and the kitchen with lots of kitchenware. 
47345	491958	10.0	9.0	26894128	Jay was a great host - very welcoming and helpful. The neighborhood was easy to navigate, quiet but also with good access to restaurants and places of interest. The place was super clean and accommodating - Jay has organized it so that while he is accessible, everything you need to know is right there, including a folder with information to help. The accommodations were very comfortable and the way it is set up allows us to go out and back without feeling intrusive on Jay. This was our first Airbnb experience and we look forward to using it again.  This was way better than a hotel.
47346	491958	10.0	9.0	26985743	Our little family enjoyed a comfortable stay at the Columbia City Treehouse Apartment. The accommodations were true to description. We greatly appreciated the well-stocked kitchen. It made making meals a breeze. Jay and his family were very welcoming. We hope to come back in the summer so we can do more exploring in the neighborhood! 
47347	491958	10.0	9.0	27355643	The place was amazing, I had my parents stay there when they came to visit seattle and they loved it!
47348	491958	10.0	9.0	27724031	The treehouse was absolutely perfect! Beautiful setting, close to shops and restaurants, and very walkable. I will definitely stay here again in the future. 
47349	491958	10.0	9.0	28205303	My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay at the Treehouse. The space was very clean and the neighborhood felt safe and comfortable. 
47350	491958	10.0	9.0	28874397	Amazing place. Will come back again
47351	491958	10.0	9.0	29098778	My family and I had a wonderful stay at the tree house! The setting was absolutely beautiful, neighborhood was adorable and functional, and the house was stocked with everything we needed! 
47352	491958	10.0	9.0	30027626	Jay was awesome! He was very nice and welcoming. Our plans changed due to unexpected circumstances and he was very flexible. The place was very nice and clean. We also loved the town of Columbia city! We would definitely stay there again!
47353	491958	10.0	9.0	30438712	"We had a wonderful stay at the tree house! Jay was very accommodating with our odd arrival and departure times. The apartment is located in a gorgeous, quiet neighborhood with the perfect amount of privacy. Neighbors were very pleasant and always offered a smile and ""hello"" while walking about. 

The unit was fully equipped with a bedroom, full bath, kitchen, and living area. We highly suggest making use of the kitchen! One night we made steamed mussels from Pikes Place Market (taking precautions to not stink up the place too much). Delicious!

There are also a number of lovely shops and restaurants along Rainier Avenue within a short walk, and downtown Seattle is about 40-50 minutes away via transit. While it was a short hike (~1 mile) from the light rail (and a little less to bus lines), the walk was pleasant and helped to justify the extra latte (or three)! Having a car would probably be helpful, but it's not completely necessary if you don't mind a little walking."
47354	491958	10.0	9.0	31518838	Our stay at Jay's Tree house Apartment exceeded our expectations!  The apartment was as described and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay for three adults. The location in Columbia City was absolutely perfect and we enjoyed long walks  through the beautiful neighborhood and eating at several of the great restaurants in the charming downtown.  The location was perfect for catching the light rail to all the major Seattle attractions.   Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to friends and family!
47355	491958	10.0	9.0	32741559	We have stayed at the Columbia City Treehouse Apartment at least 3 times and will definitely be back.  It is always clean, the kitchen is well stocked, the internet is dependable, and the cable has a variety of choices for relaxing in the evening.  We can walk to restaurants, a movie theater, and some shopping.  The bus and light rail are within walking distance to travel into downtown Seattle. The price is very reasonable and Jay is very responsive to your needs.  This is an excellent find in a quiet neighborhood.  I highly recommend this great apartment.
47356	491958	10.0	9.0	33026290	This spot was great. We really liked it. I would recommend it. 
47357	491958	10.0	9.0	33430871	"The Columbia City Tree House was our first AirBnB and I would say we were spoiled by it. The tree house accommodations were great. The place was what was depicted in the pictures. It was very clean and Jay made it very easy to get in and settled despite our very late arrival.

Jay and his family and friends made the stay that much better and were very helpful and friendly. Locationwise, the treehouse is very easy to get to from Downtown Seattle as well as the airport. Columbia City also has plenty to do, see and eat. The treehouse is a very central location but still far enough that you get nice, quite nights.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
47358	491958	10.0	9.0	33819420	"Excellent experience with Jay even though I did not actually have the pleasure of meeting him. We arranged for arrival and keys through SMS and airbnb messaging and we had no problems finding the treehouse or getting settled. 

Everything was as described, the area was very pleasant, and we enjoyed our stay. We would be happy to stay again the next time we are in Seattle. "
47359	491958	10.0	9.0	34306798	Very clean and comfortable in a quiet neighbourhood with ample parking. Would definitely  stay here again. 
47360	491958	10.0	9.0	34692680	Nice family, great mother-in-law suite.
47361	491958	10.0	9.0	35202133	Columbia city is a great suburb of Seatlle. We fell in love with the local spots and enjoyed the neighborhood and all its sights and sounds. The tree house was a cozy spot with plenty of space for 3. It's a bit distant from the city if you do not have a car, but transit was very accessible. Bring your walking shoes and enjoy the neighborhood!
47362	491958	10.0	9.0	36499466	We had a wonderful stay at the Treehouse and Jay was the perfect host.  The location and accommodation was perfect for our 12  night stay.  Close to public transit to get us downtown and walking distance to Columbia City to enjoy restaurants and live music at the Royal Room.  We fully utilized the tree house, enjoyed cooking some meals and sitting on the patio.   
47363	491958	10.0	9.0	38095642	We have stayed at the Treehouse several times. As usual, it was clean and comfortable.  Thanks, Jay.
47364	491958	10.0	9.0	38476096	My husband and I stayed at Jay's Treehouse for three nights.  It is located on the hillside of Columbia City.  The Treehouse is very clean and well equipped as it is described.  We love sitting on the deck enjoying the breeze and walking around the neighborhood admiring the berry bushes.  We didn't have rental car those three days.  It was quite a hike from Columbia City Light Rail Station to Treehouse with two suitcases or groceries even it is only a mile away.  The bed is very comfortable.  We enjoyed our stay there very much.
47365	491958	10.0	9.0	39142536	Everything was just right  as it was described! We loved Jay's place because it's like a little oasis: a cosy, nice and clean place! We enjoyed the living space including porch and garden! It was just the perfect choice for us.Jay's avery friendly and welcoming host and we thank him and his family for their hospitality!
47366	491958	10.0	9.0	40073331	Our stay at the treehouse was wonderful and Jay was a great host.  The lush setting was more like being in the woods than in the city.  Columbia City is a quaint little neighbourhood with reliable transportation links to the airport and downtown.  Be prepared to walk up and down slopes; you may want to cab/drive if you have luggage or heavy shopping bags.
47367	491958	10.0	9.0	40423558	"The Treehouse in Columbia City, Seattle, was a great experience. Lovely place! We were four of us, two adults and two kids, and the apartment was big enough and has great atmosphere + everything you need. The lovely weather meant that we spent a lot of time on the veranda, playing cards :-)
Columbia City is a nice neighborhood, and we would recommend that everyone tries the brunch at Geraldine's Counter.
Jay and his wife are great hosts, very friendly, quiet, and welcoming. I greatly recommend the place."
47368	491958	10.0	9.0	40901592	We thoroughly enjoyed our 2-night stay at the Treehouse! It's a cozy little loft apartment with a stylish contemporary vibe. Super clean and comfortable, and quiet, on a dead-end residential street tucked among tall, leafy shade trees with west-facing windows that let in plenty of sunshine. Yet it's an easy few blocks' walk to the heart of the lively Columbia City district. Seattle is a city of neighborhoods, and this is one of the most interesting, a multi-ethnic enclave filled with diverse eateries, coffee shops, pubs and funky boutiques. Genessee Park on Lake Washington is also a relatively short walk. We enjoyed meeting and chatting the owner, Jay, who was very welcoming and hospitable.
47369	491958	10.0	9.0	41313058	Jay was a great host.  He answered all of our questions quickly and was always available to chat.  Thank you, Jay, for an awesome and fun time in Seattle! 
47370	491958	10.0	9.0	41917779	I had a great stay at the treehouse! It was clean, open and relaxing. A great spot. A short walk to the light rail and a great neighbourhood. Would definitely stay here again. Jay was a great and helpful host. Thank you.
47371	491958	10.0	9.0	43352577	The treehouse apartment was everything that we expected and more. It's in a quiet and friendly neighborhood and just a short walk away from the Seattle transit which can take you to downtown Seattle. We didn't get to meet Jay and his wife when we arrived, but their apartment was welcome enough, with its abundance of natural light and cozy design당hich they built themselves! We knew that if we had any problems or questions that the hosts were either in their home or an email away. They had tons of tourist pamphlets that we poured through and used to plan out our itinerary. I always love getting suggestions by locals because they know best. My husband and I had a wonderful time in their treehouse apt. We would quickly recommend it to our friends and family as well as the rest of the airbnb community. Thanks so much! 
47372	491958	10.0	9.0	44565611	"The Treehouse listing was as described. Jay was very responsive to all communications. He was also very accommodating and allowed us to check in early because our flight arrived so early in the morning. 

The apartment had everything you would need in the bathroom- spare towels and shampoo, kitchen- pots/pans, cutlery, coffee and hot water, and living area- extra blankets, cable, tour books. The keys were left for us upon our arrival and everything went smoothly. 

As far as getting to the Treehouse it was about a mile from the Link station. It's not a bad walk unless you are toting luggage. The treehouse was the second stop for myself and two friends on a two week vacation so we had quite a bit to carry. Each of us pulled 40-60lbs, plus carry ons, and small backpacks, up a few hills to get to the treehouse. We were sweating by the time we got there. Like I said it's not a bad walk, without all the extras, we did it just fine every other day and a quick cab ride would be possible. 

The only problem was that the description stated ""laundry available upon request"" and we were really counting on doing our laundry but when asked were told there was a laundromat at the Safeway 8 blocks away. "
47373	491958	10.0	9.0	45055001	Wow what a stay! Firstly, the treehouse was lovely - clean, comfortable and it has everything we needed to feel at home. The bed was incredibly comfortable too. Columbia city itself was a great neighbourhood, with restaurants and bars just a short walk away. The bus downtown was also very close , and cheap, and we utilised that every day. The best part of our stay, really, was Jay's hospitality. He is truly passionate about his city, and wanted to share his knowledge about it with us - he really went above and beyond, and we would not have seen half the city without his help. Ask him about the tiny coffee shop in Fremont with the amazing pastries! Thanks so much Jay - we couldn't recommend staying with him enough. 
47374	491958	10.0	9.0	45765521	Jays place in Columbia City is very convenient to getting around Seattle . Public transportation is easily available whether by light rail or bus.Walking up the hill from the station with luggage could be quite a chore however. The queen bed is super comfortable & the Ikea couch/bed as (website hidden) is very handy & dishwasher was nice! We would definitely recommend staying here & great value!
47375	491958	10.0	9.0	46717106	The place was really nice and comfortable. Easy car access and had everything we needed. Lovely lake and park along the neighborhood as well. We didn't really get to meet up with the hosts but from our brief encounter they are pretty nice. They had a cute dog as well. 
47376	491958	10.0	9.0	47342246	I really enjoyed the stay here, the room was clean and so was the bathroom. The kitchen was nice and the binder of information was very helpful! I am sad that I never got to meet to host but with my busy schedule, I wasn't there for much time. Communication with the host was easy and they got back to me quickly and made me feel very welcome!
47377	491958	10.0	9.0	47954480	Really lovely place in Col City.  Jay was clear and easy to contact.  Cozy and quiet (except when there's soccer games in the nearby park).  Our group of 2 used the bed in the bedroom and the futon out in the living room for sleeping.  Full kitchen has everything you'd need for any length of stay plus a nice deck out front.  One tiny drawback was lack of comfortable seating options (for watching the television or reading/relaxing).  Other than that - brilliant!  Thanks!
47378	491958	10.0	9.0	48412209	We really love the Treehouse in Columbia city. The place looks exactly like the pictures. It's very cozy. We will definitely stay at this place again in the future. We love the drive from the house to Lake Washington!
47379	491958	10.0	9.0	48871335	This apartment was perfect for us! The description was accurate and was what I had expected. The space was small, but had everything we needed. I would stay at this location again in the future.
47380	491958	10.0	9.0	49459627	Had a perfect stay with Jay's tree house. Everything just lovely really like the house cozy and clean and Jay is so nice definite go back庸
47381	491958	10.0	9.0	49885269	Jay gave us a warm welcome, he is a very uncomplicated host. The appartement was clean, cozy and perfect for our stay. We  recommend it. Thanks for hosting us!
47382	491958	10.0	9.0	50293107	The tree house was a great place to stay in Seattle. The pictures did not do it justice. It was the perfect spot for my wife and I to stay. Jay was the perfect host.
47383	491958	10.0	9.0	50747224	Very clean apartment in a quiet neighborhood. I did not really look into where the apartment was in relation to downtown so I found out when I got there it was 20 minute drive or hour taking public transportation to get into downtown. Would probably be a good place for someone planning to stay longer and wanting to be away from the noisy downtown.
47384	491958	10.0	9.0	51269267	Host contacted us prior to arrival and made us feel welcome as we anticipated our trip.  He laid out what we could expect upon arrival. 
47385	491958	10.0	9.0	51645318	"I stayed in the treehouse apartment with 3 of my colleagues. The apartment was a fantastic base for us to explore Seattle. I love Columbia City, and although not central Seattle, a very worthwhile neighborhood to get to know. The shops and restaurants are awesome. The proximity to Seward Park is also ideal. 

The space was perfect and Jay was very responsive and helpful as we settled in. Thanks!"
47386	491958	10.0	9.0	53458322	Awesome location and very clean apartment.  Great experience!
47387	491958	10.0	9.0	53885709	The Treehouse was my first stay with airbnb & I don't ever want to stay in a hotel again!! My husband & I loved the location & the vibe of this great space.  The Treehouse is about 20 minutes from downtown as well as the airport, and close to 2 amazing restaurants: Both Ways Caf칠 where we had an amazing breakfast & The Flying Squirrel where we had dinner 2 nights.  We were out early & back late so we didn't have the opportunity to meet Jay but he was fantastic about communicating with me before our arrival.  I definitely recommend The Treehouse & look forward to returning!
47388	491958	10.0	9.0	54313166	Very functional apartment. We enjoyed our stay. Clean and easy experience. 15-20 minute walk to downtown Columbia City and 20 minutes on the light rail into downtown Seattle. 
47389	491958	10.0	9.0	54704768	This apartment was perfect for us! The description was accurate and was what I had expected. The space was small, but had everything we needed.  We walked to Rainer St to the Columbia Bakery for coffee and their pastries.  The walk is about 15 mins away from the Treehouse.  The view of Washington lake is amazing. I would stay at this location again in the future.
47390	491958	10.0	9.0	55421313	Jay is a great host.  He was quick to respond to emails before and during our stay.  We have little kids and Jay was very accommodating.  His place is very clean and in an awesome neighborhood.  Thanks for the hospitality Jay!  
47391	491958	10.0	9.0	56120269	"Jay was the perfect host, the Treehouse had everything we needed, it was light (as light as rainy Seattle days can be) and cozy and warm.  My husband and I loved the neighborhood (and only 10 blocks from our son's house). It was indeed totally private, up in the trees and so quiet - no traffic noise or street noise.  The kitchen had everything we needed and PCC was very close for groceries, and Walgreen for sundries.  We had a great porch where we could have sat out on a sunny day.  Jay was very accommodating and graciously allowed us to ship a large box of presents and cold weather gear in advance. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the bathroom was great.

We will be returning often and the Treehouse will be our first choice, "
47392	491958	10.0	9.0	56797084	"Michelle and I found Jay's Treehouse to be as described and more.  We were very comfortable in his spacious accommodations.  The view from Jay's upper deck amidst a tall evergreen tree equals any child's (or adult's) dream of a tree house perspective on the world.

We didn't meet Jay face-to-face but had a cordial interaction with him on the telephone when we made an error on our reservation dates.  We will look forward to staying at the Treehouse during future trips to Seattle."
47393	491958	10.0	9.0	56952497	The treehouse apartment was perfect! Excellent location. Far enough from downtown for some peace, but close enough to get to the city center in less than 20 minutes! Would stay here again. 
47394	491958	10.0	9.0	58120069	"The Treehouse was the perfect place to stay for us.  Clean, Cozy, Comfortable, and close to the light rail and a great grocery store!

47448	1599856	9.0	9.0	8031084	"We rented this apartment because the price was right and it was close to Columbia City Theater, but we didn't realize just how close it was! It's literally steps from the main street. It's also a short drive (like 10-15 min.) to downtown Seattle. 

Joseph was a great host. He made recommendations for restaurants, made sure we were comfortable, and was available by text/phone if we needed anything. He even had a sign when we came in that said ""Welcome Home."" The apartment itself was perfect for me and my 3 friends. The kitchen came with pretty much every kitchen appliance, the apt was really clean, and we loved the fact that it had Wi-Fi and 2 separate bedrooms as well as a bathroom and living room. This place is great, whether you're a bunch of college students/friends (like us) or a family. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. I have nothing bad to say, and I can't recommend this place enough."
47449	1599856	9.0	9.0	8246925	Nice space, friendly host, fun and convenient neighborhood.  An altogether pleasant trip.I would certainly stay again.
47450	1599856	9.0	9.0	8390225	We had a very nice stay at 2.5 Blocks from Anywhere and it truly is the most centrally located for Columbia City that we've ever stayed at.  The apartment had everything we needed and our host's mom Dana came right away and let us in and was very welcoming.  We were very comfortable.
47451	1599856	9.0	9.0	8680190	Had a wonderful stay here! Loved the location, beautiful home, would recommend to anyone considering to stay! :)  
47452	1599856	9.0	9.0	8894497	We had a great stay! The apartment had more than enough room to accommodate the 4 of us and was in walking distance to the light rail to get downtown Seattle for our event. The host gave us detailed directions, provided us with information about the neighbourhood and made sure we had a comfortable stay.
47453	1599856	9.0	9.0	8908461	"The location truly us 2.5 miles from anywhere. the condo unit is on a quiet street with 1 parking space. there was adequate street parking for vehicle #2.
the unit is tidy, cozy and welcoming. the beds were comfortable. the kitchen had everything we needed and more. we didn't cook, but we could have put together a nice meal given the cooking utensils provided. 
One comment to keep in mind: the privacy curtains are not black-out curtains, so if you are a light sleeper, you may chose to pack some eyeshades. 
back to location - this is a block from Rainier with many great restaurants and cafes to chose from so cooking not essential.
Its a lovely space, I didn't want to leave, I will stay here again. "
47454	1599856	9.0	9.0	9012210	"It was a great stay. Even though my group of 4 only stayed in Seattle for 1 day, the apartment was nice and cozy with everything we needed. The location was near plenty of shops if someone wanted to walk around the neighborhood passing traffic was minimal and quiet. We didn't get around to using the washer and dryer either, but the 2 beds and futon were great! This was also my first time booking through AirBnB, and I'm very happy with how everything went. Joseph and this location is definitely on my list if I'm ever in Seattle without a place to stay. Thank you very much for everything Joseph!

"
47455	1599856	9.0	9.0	9077390	This is a great little apartment just a block from Columbia City center (and Columbia City Bakery!). The apartment is clean and comfortable, equipped with linens, toiletries, kitchen supplies, and treats (coffee and chocolate!). We only stayed one night, but would happily plan a longer stay in the future.
47456	1599856	9.0	9.0	9160364	The place was great! Well stocked and close to everything. We loved it and thought it much better than a hotel. The only problem was that the upstairs neighbor was a bit loud. But it was a great stay. Thank you, Joseph! 
47457	1599856	9.0	9.0	9297630	Nice place! Good location, a good choice for you to stay in Seattle.
47458	1599856	9.0	9.0	9369334	Check-in was convenient.  Comfortable stay for me and 3 friends.  Good location to explore Seattle.  Highly recommend staying here if you are visiting!
47459	1599856	9.0	9.0	9436089	Clean and comfortable! 
47460	1599856	9.0	9.0	9457975	Nice place. Very convenient location to the light rail. Quiet street near some fun shops. Easy access to the city. Thank you Joseph. Liz
47461	1599856	9.0	9.0	9571134	"Joseph met us at the apartment exactly on time and was very helpful. The apartment was  charming and had everything we needed including coffee and creamer! The location was perfect for where we needed to be. The only problem was that there was a quite a bit of noise from the upstairs neighbors however it was new year's eve so perhaps that is unusual. 
We felt it was a great value for a 2 bedroom in Seattle."
47462	1599856	9.0	9.0	9663238	"Lovely flat which was very well stocked with all we needed including an excellent espresso machine and an interesting selection of books.  Would definitely recommend and would use again if I am in Seattle again.

Thanks Joseph!"
47463	1599856	9.0	9.0	9693882	Joe was very responsive to my texts and was willing to work with me to arrange the keys. His place was very clean and cozy, accomdating 5 ppl easily. The location was great. I would definitely be wiling to stay here again if I return to Seattle
47464	1599856	9.0	9.0	9762499	Joseph and the total experience of booking, finding, and lodging at 2.5 Blocks from Anywhere was fabulous! Really good communication at all points and the place was exactly as I expected. And the neighborhood of Columbia City is amazing! ;) 
47465	1599856	9.0	9.0	9824108	The apartment was very nice. Very close to light rail and the CC Main Street. Big ups for the coffee and real cream. Would certainly stay there again. 
47466	1599856	9.0	9.0	9971697	"We had a great stay at Joseph's place; he and his mom were so helpful and responsive.  the place is perfectly located, you can walk to any one of Columbia City's restaurants and its great little movie theater, plus you can walk to the train.  The apartment itself is clean, cozy, warm; we were able to do a laundry when we needed to, no fuss about linens and plenty of towels.  The Huffords made everything easy.

Highly recommend!"
47467	1599856	9.0	9.0	10041591	"2.5 Blocks from Anywhere was a great place to stay while on a short trip to Seattle. I stayed here with my fiance and two other couples over a weekend in late January.

The apartment was very comfortable and well appointed. They even had some great coffee there for us waiting in the freezer!

The location is perfect for taking in sights as it's out of the hussle and bustle of downtown, but close enough that you can get there in about 20 mins on public transit. There are tons of shops, bars, and other great spots just half a block away on Rainier street as well, so it's a win win. They even have a shelf of books you can read from and even take with you when you leave!

The only issue we had was with the heat which seemed to only come out of the vents in the living room, so if the bedroom doors were closed, it could get a bit chilly at night. 

All in all an awesome home base for a trip to Seattle. I'd definitely recommend it to friends."
47468	1599856	9.0	9.0	10244792	I had a great stay here for a whole week with my coworker. The hosts were very quick to respond to any questions. The place was great and comfortable and close to everything Columbia City has to offer. The upstairs neighbors are a bit loud and affect the water pressure, but the hosts are in communication with them and looking into it. Loved staying here! Thanks!
47469	1599856	9.0	9.0	10587413	The place has a genius location in Seattle, a real house very close to a lot of restaurants and also to the train station, all are walkable conveniently. Joseph was busy at that time, but he delegated some other person who was very helpful and generous in cooperation. Our stay was too much pleasant and convenient. The neighbourhood was very calm and nothing had disturbed our sleep. The neighbors in the upper floor were hardly heard, and they were very calm and polit. The overall experience is perfectly great, I think I was too much accurate and lucky to have such a place and people, I definitely recommend it for whom seeking calm stay and tourist and also for business in the downtown. Thank you.
47470	1599856	9.0	9.0	10679831	"Joseph (& his helpful mother, Dana) could not have provided a better experience! They were prompt and careful in replying to all questions, the apartment itself is adorable and completely stocked with anything you could need.  The neighborhood is great, the train truly is 2.5 blocks away and gives easy access to Seattle proper. I would definitely return! 
"
47471	1599856	9.0	9.0	10844067	Top marks to this clean, comfortable, reasonably priced rental with easy airport access.  Columbia City is charming, a neighborhood I otherwise probably wouldn't have discovered, and bus and light rail to downtown, Capitol Hill and other central areas of Seattle are convenient.   If you intend to spend a lot of time in further north neighborhoods like Ballard and Fremont, though, the transit can be on the lengthy side, especially in off-peak hours.  We didn't do much more than sleep at the apartment but felt that the hosts were easily accessible if we had needed anything.  Highly recommended!
47472	1599856	9.0	9.0	11011138	"Cannot get a better location!

It was a quiet neighborhood and all the residents were cheerful and polite. We spent an equal amount of time between this home and venturing out to explore the city. It was a lovely reprise from some of the busy days we had. It is just as nice to stay in, make a french press (they have a couple of them), and read a book, as it was to go out and explore. 

Downtown Columbia City was a treat in itself. Go into town to have a coffee and excellent breakfast goodies at Columbia City Bakery. A rugged in town drinking well called the Hummingbird Saloon makes stiff drinks. Walgreens is down the main road for any items needed at the home front, plus Lottie's had a great brunch!

Beds and bedding were comfy with the apartment able to heat up and cool down very quickly. The kitchen was stocked with everything necessary for a meal and the coffee they left us was a nice touch. Neighbors upstairs were very easy going and down to earth. Washer & dryer beat out all the tough stains. There were tons of extra blankets, down comforters, towels, and linens for your hearts desire. 

Bring an extra book! There is a communal bookcase where you can leave behind a book and take another one with you. I ended up with a great read I had wanted to get my hands on for a while now! 

There is no need to rent a car here. The easiest public transportation I've ever used. $4.50 for an all day pass and it brings you right into the heart of Seattle. If you want, pay another $4.50 for a round trip pass on the monorail that takes you to Queen Anne were the EMP Museum and Space Needle are to name a couple of places!

The communication was quick and thorough. We were given a list of recommended places to go to right from the start, and any questions we had while staying at the property were answered quickly. Prompt, helpful assistance from everyone who helped us with the apartment. 

The price of this place is very reasonable for what you are getting (I personally think a steal), and it makes it that much better with the assistance we got, and the terrific town we were in. Will definitely stay here again when we come back!"
47473	1599856	9.0	9.0	11274148	"Joseph's place was a cool little bottom floor apartment that accommodated the 4 of us well for our 3 nights. The heating worked well and the beds were comfy. 
The full feature laundry and kitchen are great if you need them and there was plenty of little extras for your use such as toiletries and condiments. There is however no TV so if thats what your into beware of that.
The highlight of the place is the location, 2minute walk to the main drag in Columbia City which has a plethora of drinking and dining options from literally every cuisine imaginable, its also  an easy 8 minute walk to the light rail to take you into the city or airport.
Joseph also is very knowledgeable about the district and provides plenty of literature on good places to go whilst on your stay.
Would definitely recommend

47474	1599856	9.0	9.0	11331307	Cute place in a great neighborhood. Dana called to take care of us and make sure everything was all right--very sincere and helpful. Had a few road bumps with some ants and a broken dishwasher, but Dana was very attentive. Would recommend
47475	1599856	9.0	9.0	11666235	Had a great stay right in the heart of Columbia City! It's a vibrant town and Joseph's place is literally two blocks from anything you might need/want! The two bedrooms actually have more light than it might seem in the pictures and everything was exactly what I needed for my stay (also didn't need a car at all!). So grateful to Dana and Joseph for being such great, caring (but not overbearing!) hosts. 
47476	1599856	9.0	9.0	11800968	This is a great spot close to lots of great restaurants. Great communication with hosts. House was clean and very true to pictures. We enjoyed our stay and would return if in the Seattle area again. Thank you Joseph and Dana!
47477	1599856	9.0	9.0	11878818	Joeseph has a nice place.  Clean, well appointed,  diverse library and awesome location.  He was great about communicating with me and flexible with meeting plans.  Overall an easy and enjoyable experience!
47478	1599856	9.0	9.0	12243604	Wonderful hosts. Easy, clean, comfy, crows (you'll understand later). Would  recommend and stay again.
47479	1599856	9.0	9.0	12268998	"Great location!  I think it was more like 1.5 blocks (vs 2.5 blocks) from the train station and the little downtown area with lots of nice restaurants and shops.

The apartment was very well equipped, though we didn't really need to use much of it as we only stayed for 1 night.  Four of us fit very comfortably; cozy, which was really nice, yet the 2 bedrooms allowed for privacy.

I'd highly recommend this place if you want to stay in Seattle but want to avoid the exorbitant hotel rates downtown.

Like all other reviews stated before me, this was a great place to stay at. It was a great location, easily accessible from the airport & downtown Seattle, and most important check in/out flexibility. The apartment was nice, cozy, and clean. Joseph's mother, Dana, stayed in contact with my mother in law and was very quick to respond. Even though we didn't walk around late at night, the location was safe and quiet. Overall, we had a great experience staying at Joseph's place. When you have a good location, very good price, great reviews, and a home away from home, you can't beat that! "
47481	1599856	9.0	9.0	12993780	Prefect place for our stay! Joseph accommodated us at such short notice and late night arrival, the keys in the lockbox was convenient. Upon entering the sheets from one of the bedrooms and the futon were pulled as if they were going to be replaced/cleaned. The apartment was not ready for our arrival, but luckily there were clean sheets and blankets in the closets. We weren't too put off by it. I'll chalk it up to miscommunication as they mentioned they did not expect our arrival until the next day. The rest of the place was nicely kept. We did not make use of public transit near by but everywhere we needed to go was within a 15min drive. 4 of us stayed more than comfortably for 2 nights, definitely will return when in Seattle again. Thank you Joseph!
47482	1599856	9.0	9.0	13418679	host met us at the house.  Although it was 2.5 blocks from anywhere you need to take public transportation 15 minute to downtown to be anywhere.
47483	1599856	9.0	9.0	13613977	Joseph was able to accommodate our request for an earlier check-in, which we were grateful for.  The place was spacious for the three of us, and it really felt like a home away from home.  Without a car, we were able to easily access the light rail from the place, and we were only a block away from the lovely restaurants and coffee shops of Columbia City.  I recommend this place for any looking to enjoy a respite in Seattle. 
47484	1599856	9.0	9.0	13883181	My family of four had an awesome stay at Joseph's place. It had all the ammenities needed for a weeks stay, full kitchen, comfortable beds and lots of reading materials, games and puzzles. The location is fantastic, so close to the light rail system and easily accessible by car from main highways. They graciously accommodated our early check, Joseph's mom Dana came, showed us the property and answered questions.  After that we had 5 nights and 6 days of fun, fun, fun.  We love Seattle and Joseph's place.  Also, the neighborhood restaurants are a short walk away, plenty of variety, and the ones we went to were great. This was truly a great way to celebrate my 50th birthday.
47485	1599856	9.0	9.0	14003782	"Joseph's apartment is really nice, clean and silent. 
We were 5 people and could easily fit in this place. The neighborhood is also great. The public transportation is nearby and the parking is free. 
It's the perfect spot to stay if you want to explore Seattle!"
47486	1599856	9.0	9.0	14085972	While we didn't get to meet Joseph, he was very clear in communicating and let us pick up the keys in a lock box when we were delayed getting to our meeting time.  The apartment was clean and quiet but we hardly got to use it because there were many cute restaurants and bars on the main strip of Columbia City we wanted to try.  Getting to/from downtown or the airport was very convenient via the light rail so it is a great place to stay if you want to get away from the more touristy side of Seattle.
47487	1599856	9.0	9.0	14344888	Perfect for our girls weekend getaway! Both Joseph and his mother were great hosts! We arrived in the evening and were greeted at the apartment by Joseph's mother, Dana! The Columbia City neighborhood was very quaint and friendly. Dana had lots of great recommendations for restaurants in the area and provided great info for the rail hours. The place was very clean and welcoming and just as it appeared in the pictures. We didn't nearly have enough time to do the things we wanted to do in Seattle and would come back and stay here again, in a heartbeat!! Great place!
47488	1599856	9.0	9.0	14568021	This place was great! Had everything we needed and lots of space. Kitchen had tons of dishes and appliances. Joseph was easy to get in touch with and very helpful about exploring the area. Everywhere we ate was within walking distance and tasty! When we come back, we will definitely stay here again!
47489	1599856	9.0	9.0	14736696	Great place to stay. Joseph and Dana were very helpful with lots of information about the area, and they made us feel very welcome. The location is great, only a few minutes walk to the light rail transit system which goes into downtown Seattle. Half a block to many great restaurants and pubs. We parked our vehicle in the driveway when we arrived and then were able to use public transport to get around the city, very easy and convenient. Will definitely stay again if we are back in Seattle.
47490	1599856	9.0	9.0	15026495	We had a great 6 day stay at Joseph's place with our two little kids! It was truly perfectly positioned, a short walk from the light rail and from the adorable downtown area of Columbia City. The place itself was nice and clean, with two full beds and space in the living room for us to set up the portable crib we brought with us. We weren't able to meet Joseph, but his mom Dana stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed. This was one of if not the best airbnb experiences we've had and we hope to stay again if we find ourselves in Seattle. Also, this is a great place to stay with kids as there is a playground across the street as well as around the corner, and beautiful Seward Park is just a short drive away.
47491	1599856	9.0	9.0	15528389	We had a great time staying at this apartment. Very comfortable and user friendly, equipped with all the necessary supplies for a home-like experience. Joseph's mother, Dana, came over the first day to give us some basic info, and one night we even came home to find some children's books waiting for us! It was a very comfortable size for me, my husband, and our 3-year-old, who enjoyed having his own bedroom. The kitchen is easy to cook in. It is on a cute little residential street that's truly convenient to a lot of things. In one direction you get the cool businesses on Rainier Ave., where we had breakfast at the Columbia City Bakery (fantastic croissants!) more than half the days we were there, and pizza at Tutta Bella on our first night in town. The house is also right across the street from a playground. In the other direction there's the light rail stop, which was a really easy way to get downtown, and to Seattle Center (via the monorail), with a little kid. We were in town for a wedding weekend where many of the festivities took place in South Seattle, and those locations took less than 10 minutes to drive to. The master bedroom gets a lot of sunlight in the morning. Some nighttime noise from the upstairs neighbors walking around, but you get used to it. The only improvements I'd suggest would be a more conveniently located bathroom light switch (it's on the hinge side of the door, outside the bathroom, so you can't reach it from inside the door), and more shelves or drawers to put your clothes. Overall a very nice place to stay, and friendly hosts!
47492	1599856	9.0	9.0	15748536	"We (family of 4) stayed at Joseph's place for 3 nights, and we can report that all was as advertised--especially charming was the multicultural and just plain cool neighborhood.  

We were even allowed to check in early (back from a cruise early in the morn) and check out late (late flight).  Also, the hosts left a full bag of coffee beans to grind.  Nice touch. 

All  in all, to be recommended."
47493	1599856	9.0	9.0	16016717	Apartment was really spacious and location was excellent - easy tram to both downtown and airport.  The neighbourhood was great - lots of bars / restaurants within easy walking distance.  Joseph is a great host - made me feel really welcome after a long flight.  I recommend staying here!
47494	1599856	9.0	9.0	16072271	We had a great time at his place, very straightforward, comfortable and lovely experience!
47495	1599856	9.0	9.0	16345239	Just great! Very responsive and helpful hosts, excellent apartment that suited our family of four (two adults, a teen and a tween) just right. We have deep roots in Columbia City and loved being in the middle of our old stompin' grounds! Also the beds were super-comfy. Will be back for sure. 
47496	1599856	9.0	9.0	16477449	This listing was an awesome place. So close to everything and very clean. We hope to visit again in the future. 
47497	1599856	9.0	9.0	16993018	Joseph was a great host and easy to get ahold of.  The apartment was just as described and close to the subway line into downtown.  There were a lot of pamphlets and maps about Seattle so those were a great reference.  The neighborhood was nice too.  There were quite a few bars, restaurants, and shops within a very short walk.  
47498	1599856	9.0	9.0	17147095	Logement tr칟s propre et tr칟s bien am칠nag칠, parfait pour notre groupe de 6. Bien situ칠 par rapport au centre ville de Seattle, dans un quartier calme. Joseph et Dana se sont montr칠s tr칟s accessibles et chaleureux. Je recommande :)
47499	1599856	9.0	9.0	17428468	Great place, great neighborhood.  Plenty of space, just as described.  Hosts are available for any questions or recommendations.  I would definitely stay again!
47500	1599856	9.0	9.0	17552669	Communication with Joseph was fast, friendly, and very helpful. The place was just as advertised - clean and comfortable, with lots of reading material (both Seattle-specific and wide-ranging fiction and non-fiction). The maps of local establishments were particularly appreciated. The heart of Columbia City is a block away, with endless culinary possibilities. We also took the Light Rail to downtown Seattle to a Mariners game, again very convenient and quick. Lake Washington and Mercer Island are also a short bike ride away, and there is a bike shop just down the street. Next time I plan a trip to Seattle, the first place I'm going to check is Joseph's, and hope he isn't completely booked.
47501	1599856	9.0	9.0	17687465	In a word, great. Joseph was helpful and flexible. Thanks for a great stay!
47502	1599856	9.0	9.0	18169967	We had a very enjoyable experience staying here.  The place was as described, in fact even better.  Good internet connection and an ample kitchen.  Joe and his mother were gracious hosts, with quick response times, and willing to go above and beyond to help us out.  The location was as described, near the light rail and walking distance from some nice areas and restaurants.   Overall, our small group was very pleased and would definitely stay here again.
47503	1599856	9.0	9.0	19279030	Great location and the apartment was charming.  Beds slept comfortably.  Kitchen well stocked with everything needed to cook.  Lots of restaurants very close by.  Light rail 2 blocks away and a great way to travel.  So glad we cancelled our downtown hotel and stayed here.  Did not get to meet Joseph, but did meet his mother, Dana.  She was very helpful I getting us settled.  
47504	1599856	9.0	9.0	19392581	"What a nice place to stay!!!
Joseph did everything to feel comfortable at his home and welcomed us very warmly by providing some maps of the surroundings, which helped us to find a restaurant in the close area. We arrived very late, but that was no problem. The flat is very clean, looking exactly like the pictures promised and is perfect for 4 to 6 persons, additionally there is a washing tube and a dryer. We haven't met Joseph during our stay for 2 nights, but he gave me very helpful informations by phone. His mother wanted to welcome us, but unfortunately we haven't been there, when she planned to see us. Probably we will meet the next time, because it is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle with lots of different italian, american, indian, chinese, greek restaurants nearby and a famous bakery to get a delicious breakfast there. Additionally a public transport stop is very close to get to downtown. (lasts about 25 minutes)
We definitely recommend it to further guests."
47505	1599856	9.0	9.0	19729154	The location in Columbia City is outstanding with easy access to light rail and bus service. There are excellent restaurants, coffee shops and a bakery close by. While there is a Walgreen's pharmacy within a 15 minute walk, there is no supermarket located conveniently nearby. This was a negative. The duplex was well equipped with working wifi, but there was no tv. It would have been nice to have one to watch the news. The hosts responded promptly to our questions. I would recommend this location to Seattle visitors.
47506	1599856	9.0	9.0	19841329	This apartment was a great place to stay for our trip to Seattle! We felt very welcome the entire time we were there, and the place was very close to downtown. Joseph was helpful and quick to respond to questions, and his mom Dana stopped by to make sure everything was going good. We were also very close to a street with a ton of restaurants, and a nice farmer's market was just a street over. I would definitely stay here again if I go back to Seattle, thanks Joseph and Dana for the hospitality! 
47507	1599856	9.0	9.0	20091773	The house was perfect! Joseph and Dana were so helpful and responded very quickly to any questions we had. The house was very clean and walking distance to very good restaurants.  We will absolutely be staying here the next time we come to Seattle. Thank you Joseph and Dana!
47508	1599856	9.0	9.0	20188825	One of the things I love about Air BnB is that you get to stay in places with personality, and this place had a lovely personality.  Really felt like a home, with a great personal welcome from Joseph and a wide variety of coffee making methods and ingredients provided.  Columbia City is a lovely area and extremely well served by restaurants so I didn't even bother looking for a grocery store.  Geraldine's for breakfast is recommended. There's also a farmers market Wednesdays from 3pm.  The place is a bit out of the centre, but close to the light rail and you're anywhere in town in around 15 minutes.  A perfect choice if you're coming in and out of the airport.  Highly recommended and I'm sorry my stay wasn't longer.
47509	1599856	9.0	9.0	20491452	"Joseph and his mother were great to work with. They tried to stop by to meet us a couple of times, but we were out every time. We didn't spend a lot of time at the house because it was our first time in Seattle and we had lots of exploring to do. We were also in town for a wedding so we were pretty busy. 
The photos of the house are accurate and the space was nice. We had plenty of blankets, towels, etc. We didn't need anything, but Joseph and his mom offered to help if we did need anything. 
As other people mentioned, we could hear the renter above us, but it didn't bother us. We felt guilty for talking too loud or making noise when she/he was sleeping, but we couldn't figure out their schedule.
We really liked the location. It was really close to the light rail and you could see the little main street from the house. We ate at Geraldine's twice and liked Empire coffee and sandwiches! We thought the street that the house was on was precious. The little houses were cute and it felt safe. We had a couple of Seattle locals (who live in other neighborhoods) tell us that Columbia City was dangerous or sketchy, but we never got that vibe. Overall we liked the house and loved the price! "
47510	1599856	9.0	9.0	20611588	"The best thing of this place is that it is easy to get to the downtown in Seattle. And his mother, Dana, is so considerate and helpful. And the house is cozy and quiet.
I also like his quick response."
47511	1599856	9.0	9.0	20903420	The house was nice. But I had a hard time reaching the host. Not easy to communicate with. 
47512	1599856	9.0	9.0	21057093	Joe and Dana were great hosts and communication was quick and helpful. The house is in a great location, close to shops and light rail which is the easiest way to downtown. Also, Lake Washington Boulevard is a lovely walk to see the water. I would highly recommend staying at Joe and Dana's. 
47513	1599856	9.0	9.0	21285041	First time airbnb user and our stay was fantastic. We spent most of our time traveling around Washington & Canada that when we really appreciated coming back to a spot that was so cozy and home like. 
47514	1599856	9.0	9.0	21582490	"There was a nice welcome on the board, pretty flowers on the table,  and a personal and timely meeting with Dana for other information.   The house was as advertised, very clean and comfortable.  We are familiar with Columbia City and the location is great for walking access to restaurants and other businesses in Columbia City.    

Thank you.  "

47516	1599856	9.0	9.0	21959453	Loved it, loved it!  Our family of three adults stayed two nights. We would have stayed longer but the apartment was fully booked,  which we understand having had the pleasure of staying there. Absolutely everything for a comfortable stay has been thoughtfully provided. Everything is of a high quality standard, Including organic bsthroom products. Was wonderful having access to a washing machine and dryer. Joseph's mother met us at the apartment and talked us through the neighborhood. Columbia city business district with it's great restaurants just a few steps away snd light rail into the city at the end of the street. Particularly recommend Watercress  for Vietnamese food. Would love to stay again. T V addicts should note, there is none, but we're readers so of no consequence to us.
47517	1599856	9.0	9.0	22115105	The apartment is well maintained with one off street parking.  Nice neighborhood with restaurants/sports bar within 3 blocks. The only negative I experienced is that the beds are at floor level.  The mattress within the Ikea bed frame is not raised off the floor.
47518	1599856	9.0	9.0	22300053	The host was very welcoming, and the neighborhood was safe! We did not get a rental car, and it was not a far walk at all to the nearest light rail station. There is one full size bed, one queen, and one futon in the living room. The space is fairly small, a bit crammed for 4 people. Shower water pressure was low. We needed a home base to go back to sleep mostly so it worked out for us, this is not a place you would throw parties. Be prepared in Washington because it rains a lot! Don't forget warm clothes and an umbrella.
47519	1599856	9.0	9.0	22459794	We LOVED our stay in Seattle, and this apartment was perfect base from which we could go exploring. Columbia City has a really fun vibe and is only a few tram stops from both downtown Seattle and the airport. Clean, tidy, welcoming, spacious, everything we could have hope for. And although we didn't meet Joseph, he was super helpful via email too. Would definitely recommend!!
47520	1599856	9.0	9.0	22577751	"Joseph's AirBnB was the perfect place for my group of five to spend a long weekend while attending an old friend's wedding. Although we were initially drawn to the listing because of its proximity to the wedding venue, it turned out to be super convenient for getting to and from the airport and also heading downtown to take in some sights. It really is 2.5 blocks from anywhere because of the train, which is super cheap and fast and runs regularly, and the apartment was totally set up with everything we could have needed. Didn't get a chance to do much cooking in the well set-up kitchen or use the laundry facilities but over a longer stay, those would have been great amenities. I also loved being around the corner from the main strip in historic Colombia City which was a new area in Seattle for me and I was happy to find some great eateries. 

Joseph was readily available via email/cell to answer any questions and I liked the helpful maps and books that were left for guests in the apartment.

As this is a downstairs apartment, you got a little residual noise from the upstairs residents walking around late at night, so maybe bring earplugs. Wasn't a dealbreaker."
47521	1599856	9.0	9.0	22850828	"This place was great and located right next to a small downtown. Joseph had a list of places to visit with great local food. 

Beds were comfortable. The place is not a great a place to hang out for the day because of the size, but is a great place to crash and located to close to everything. "
47522	1599856	9.0	9.0	23204633	Myself and 3 family members loved this place.  It was a great place to use as a base; clean, comfortable and warm.  Excellent location in part of Seattle that I had never been and I really liked.  Proximity to the light rail was the reason I picked this place and it was exactly as advertised, and made our multiple ventures out very easy.  I would definitely recommend this place.  
47523	1599856	9.0	9.0	23424850	"Very streamlined process. We arrived quite late, and they way joe set it up it was easy to get settled. Well stocked kitchen with equipment, pots and pans and knives. 

The location is great and close to a hip and commercial street.

Only thing is what other have mentioned already, which is the shower pressure is low, and it is a first floor apartment.

Would totally recommend for a stay."
47524	1599856	9.0	9.0	24000438	Joseph was a great host even though we only met his mother Dana. Everything was as described and the location is great. We drove only 20mins with the car to downtown. The apartment was clean, cozy and the beds were really comfortable. Would stay there again and recommend it to everyone! Thanks for everything ;-)
47525	1599856	9.0	9.0	24229360	We absolutely loved Joseph's place!! The house was clean, comfortable, and has everything you needed. The location is great, easy to get to Seattle either by car or light rial. The kitchen was fully equipped, definitely a plus if you wish to prepare food during your trip!!  We were greeted by Joseph's mom, Dana. Such a lovely lady, easy to communicate with and made sure we had a good stay! Highly recommend their place if you are looking for a place to stay Seattle!!
47526	1599856	9.0	9.0	24416585	"We had a lovely time here and liked both the accommodations and the neighborhood. We enjoyed checking out the local diner, Geraldine's, for breakfast and amazing bakery and even took a yoga class -- all one block away. The space itself worked just fine for our family of four: We had one parent and kid in one room and another parent and kid in the other. We liked that there was no TV but plenty of books and even played a game of University of Washington Monopoly!
We would recommend this as a great home base for exploring Seattle."
47527	1599856	9.0	9.0	24571957	The unit was the perfect size for our group. It was great having two separate bedrooms. It was clean and very comfortable for our weekend visit to Seattle. It was very close to transit and walkable to a few bars and restaurants but we were glad to have a car to make trips into downtown Seattle. 
47528	1599856	9.0	9.0	24934802	Great place to stay in the Seattle area!  A 15 minute drive to Pike Place, and located just steps away from a cute street with bakeries, bars & restaurants.  The apartment has all the amenities you need while staying away from home.
47529	1599856	9.0	9.0	25349436	We didn't meet joe, but the apartment was awesome! Close to the airport and an easy to get to downtown Seattle on the light rail. They provided great information about the local area and we thoroughly enjoyed breakfasts at Geraldine's. It was a great few days in Seattle! 
47530	1599856	9.0	9.0	25815918	Great place! The house had everything that was needed was clean and comfortable
47531	1599856	9.0	9.0	26132275	We stayed here in Joseph's sweet apartment for 5 nights while we were attending a workshop that was down near the airport. The apartment was very well situated for traveling anywhere in Seattle. We went from SeaTac to Mercer Island to Ballard to Greenlake to Pioneer Square quickly and easily! Then we could come back to our clean, quiet, warm and well appointed space. There is a business district 1 block away where there are many restaurants to choose from as well as shops and bars. This space served us well. The beds are very comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need and I was surprised by how quiet it was at night. I live in the Boondocks of Eastern Washington and I always have trouble sleeping in loud, busy cities, but  not here! I hope to book this apartment again the next time I travel to Seattle. Thank you Joseph!!
47532	1599856	9.0	9.0	26295577	Joseph and Dana were kind and helpful as ever. The place is welcoming, well stocked, an obviously sharing and hospitable group of friendly people.  Attentive and responsive.
47533	1599856	9.0	9.0	26672185	Joseph and Dana were great hosts. The apartment was very homey, had great interior design, and everything we needed. It was located in a great spot for us with coffee shops and restaurants nearby. It was also very close to where we need to be for our conference. Both of them were very responsive to our texts and checked in on us to make sure everything was ok. We had a great stay!
47534	1599856	9.0	9.0	27437048	Joseph was great host, and his place in Columbia City was the perfect spot from which to explore Seattle.  My best Airbnb experience yet.  
47535	1599856	9.0	9.0	28042966	We had an excellent time! Joe was very helpful and flexible with our check in. His mom stopped by to say hello, give tips and answer any questions. The place itself was very nice and had everything we needed, the beds were super comfortable! It was in a great location close to the light rail to get downtown. I have nothing but good things to say about the place and host :)
47536	1599856	9.0	9.0	28236209	It was a great space for myself and friend to stay while studying in Seattle for the week. The place was clean and homey. I would stay there again.
47537	1599856	9.0	9.0	28337284	It's a warm & cozy place to stay during the raining season in Seattle. House is clean with everything there. Close walk to light rail also lots of shops and bars just around the corner. We did not see Joseph in person, but he is being helpful. Thank you Joseph. We had a nice stay.
47538	1599856	9.0	9.0	28571957	The listing was very accurate, the house was 2 blocks away from the restaurants and stores. The house itself was clean. Thank you for providing a lot of clean towels for us. The space was comfortable and cozy. It was a great first airbnb experience, thanks to the hosts. I'll be using airbnb again. 
47539	1599856	9.0	9.0	33767224	"
This is a great location -- walking distance to many fine restaurants and night spots, as well as the Link into the city or down to SeaTac. The space is very accommodating -- lots of linens, towels, cooking utensils, everything you could need for an extended stay. And the hosts ... well, they were magnificent, from providing things and information, to letting me back in after I locked myself out, to cleaning up after me after I left. And very friendly, helpful, and generally welcoming and pleasant. A great place to stay and great people (and the upstairs neighbors are nice too!)"
47540	1599856	9.0	9.0	34071625	Joe is very kind to greet us at the house and makes sure that everything is okay. The house was nice and the location is excellent.
47541	1599856	9.0	9.0	34399571	Friendly and helpful greeting and introduction. Comfortable place to stay in a great location. We had a great weekend. Thanks.
47542	1599856	9.0	9.0	34942985	"We had a great time, the place is convenient, close to shops and restaurants. Very clean and it has all you need, enough supply of towels and bedding needs. 
Thank you Joseph and Dana"
47543	1599856	9.0	9.0	35385001	We didn't get to meet Joseph during our stay, but we kept in touch by messages before arrival. Joseph's mom Dana stopped to say hi, and provided us some useful information about nearby grocery stores. Also when we got some problems unlocking the door, she was very patient and helpful in the phone, telling me what to do. It is a nice place for a family to stay. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen, which saved a lot of money. Overall, Joseph's place has made our vacation in Seattle a quite satisfying one.
47544	1599856	9.0	9.0	35566615	"The location: transitional and quiet after dark, but within walking distance to restaurants and bars, and LINK in the other direction.
The apartment: Cute and mostly well-kept (but please see below)
The hosts: Jo and his girlfriend (I'm sorry, I don't know your name) were very accommodating. She went out of her way so our family could get into the apartment an hour early. 

If that was it, I'd give the space a 4 or 5. Sadly, the apartment has fleas. I know this can happen to anyone, so in a month or so, the apartment should be safe again (if it's treated properly). We stayed only for 2 nights, as planned. After the first night, I noticed bites on my feet (by the time I left, I had around 20 on my feet); the evening of the second night I began to see them everywhere: kitchen, bathroom, both (website hidden) admitted that a prior guest (some time ago) had animals w/fleas but said no one has mentioned anything. These fleas were tiny, maybe the apartment was treated once and only eggs were left; now the eggs have (website hidden) and his girlfriend came over promptly to change the linens and check in with us. We spent our last morning in Seattle laundering and bagging our clothes instead of taking in a few more sights like we had planned. 

We were 45 minutes late getting out of the apartment. Just as we drove out (parking on the street so my 3  kids and I could walk to our first meal of the day at Geraldine's), Dana drove in. I'm sure under normal circumstances, she's a perfectly lovely person. She kind of waved me down, and after handshakes/introductions, she said ""Let me educate you about fleas."" What ensued was a not very coherent, defensive ""education"" about how fleas don't choose people as hosts, which she interpreted to mean that they can't survive on human blood (false) and I didn't need to wash all my things because they don't travel on you (mostly false). When I argued her ""facts"" she'd say things like ""What do you want from me? I can't give you your morning back. I can't take the bites off your feet."" I didn't start the conversation. We simply left. 

I tried to remain matter of fact and courteous throughout this whole fleas thing, but stopping a single mom and her three kids in the street to have this odd and ill-informed ""conversation"" after a stressful morning and no meals...that last experience was just too much. My last day in Seattle was a huge disappointment, and made me late for a commitment on the other side of the (website hidden) refunded around 1/3 of my money, which I never asked for but do appreciate. I'll probably spend it on flea prevention for my pets at home in case we brought anything back."
47545	1599856	9.0	9.0	35910474	My wife's 2 sisters and she had a fabulous time in Seattle due in no small part to Joseph's accommodations. It was fabulous complete with fresh locally roasted coffee beans waiting to be ground and brewed! They found it easy to use the light rail and it was so efficient to get to and from the airport and to downtown Seattle. The business district a block away is exceptional. Joseph had everything they needed and more. It was extremely comfortable for them. They enjoyed the bird theme, the wide variety of books and numerous pieces of information about Seattle and Columbia City. I'm rather envious of their visit and hope to stay there with my wife some time.
47546	1599856	9.0	9.0	36924389	Joseph welcomed us to the unit and gave us a tour when we arrived. The description of the unit was accurate, although it was a bit of a tight squeeze for five guests. Four guests would fit a bit more comfortably. A two minute walk to the Light Rail allowed us to get downtown with ease, and there were a lot of great shops and restaurants in the immediate surrounding area as well.
47547	1599856	9.0	9.0	37547465	"Joe's place was wonderful. There were four of us on a family vacation: my sister, my parents and I. Joe's futon and two bedrooms suited us perfectly. Joe was the best host, even springing for a fan in the warmer than average Seattle summer when we visited. The location can't be beat, with the vibrant Columbus City neighborhood right around the corner. And getting into downtown Seattle is a cinch.

We loved our stay and would stay here again, no question."
47548	1599856	9.0	9.0	37861441	"We had a very nice time 2.5 blocks from anywhere!

Our host was there to great us and personally make sure that we came in OK.

The description of the place is accurate and the kitchen is fully equipped, so that you can make a real meal there. A nice thing, when you need a break from hotels and airlinefoods. "
47549	1599856	9.0	9.0	38105703	Nice spot near a street where you can eat anything you like. House is nice, you can even take a book with you. The house was a bit smaller than expected but good enough for a family of four. You can park your car in front of the house. Thank you for let us stay at your house Joe

47551	1599856	9.0	9.0	39487117	A great stay in a great neighborhood in a great town. The home is warm and cozy and was perfect to put us parents in one bedroom and our 5- and 2-year-old in the other bedroom. As advertised, it's a fun neighborhood perfect for walking, eating, playing. Couldn't be happier. Owners were helpful and responsive but not the slightest bit intrusive.
47552	1599856	9.0	9.0	39912597	2.5 blocks  from Anywhere says it all.  Could have stayed the whole weekend just exploring and sampling food/drink in the neighborhood, but we were there for the ball games. LRT was just up the street to get to the stadium and go downtown, perfect.  meeting up with Joseph was quick and easy, pretty straight forward for the apt. and it was clean and functional with great local fair to support us including a new natural foods store one block over.  Apt. is clean and comfortable as described.  Would definitely use it again if in Seattle.
47553	1599856	9.0	9.0	40202899	"Logement agr칠able situ칠 dans un quartier calme.Pas tr칟s grand pour 5 personnes mais pour 2 nuits c 칠tait bien. Les commerces et restaurants sont proches c est int칠ressant. 
"
47554	1599856	9.0	9.0	40563232	Great location. We walked with our suitcases from light rail. We spent the full day downtown so didn't spend much time in the apartment. It looked like it had all the essentials for cooking etc. 
47555	1599856	9.0	9.0	40917635	Easy communication and conveniently located space. Taking the light rail was easy and great eateries around the area. Close to the sea fair. The unit was a bit smaller than expected.
47556	1599856	9.0	9.0	41924676	"To put it briefly, this place is flat out amazing. 

Our stay involved going in and out of downtown daily via LightRail which was only a two block walk and when we didn't go into the city, there was more then enough going on down the main street (about only a block away) to keep us occupied and full of food. 

The tenant was there to meet and greet our group as we showed up and give advice to some of the local hotspots and eateries just down the street including a new market that was opened right around the corner. 

The house is just as it is described and shown in the listing. A smaller downstairs apartment with 2 bedrooms and a fold-out in the living room. Even with 4 larger guys, there was enough space for us all to sit together and discuss the days events each evening.  

There is no TV, but there are lots of books to read and WiFi is available so be sure to have a laptop or tablet with you if you feel like you need some visual entertainment while you are there (Hulu, Netflix, etc.) 

There are very few words that I can use with my limited vernacular to express how satisfied I am with my stay here so I guess I will end this review just as I opened it: To put it briefly, this place is flat out amazing."
47557	1599856	9.0	9.0	42520305	Joseph's place was exactly what my three friends and I were looking for. It is clean, cozy, had a nice sized kitchen for cooking with all necessary cooking ware, and it was an incredibly good value. The location is excellent too. It really is about 2.5 blocks from the light rail which can take you anywhere in Seattle. Ranier street, which is a block away, also has tons of restaurants, bars and fun stuff to visit. I would highly recommend staying here, but do note the square footage because it might not be large enough for a large family. We easily fit four people comfortably (one couple and two single men). Thanks Joseph!
47558	1599856	9.0	9.0	43025612	We had a lovely stay in Joseph's apartment. The area is great, transport links fantastic and communication with him was excellent. It is a bit of a squeeze for five people - you can't sit round the table because there are not enough chairs, but if you are eating out all the time it is great.
47559	1599856	9.0	9.0	43368701	It's a nice apartment. My families and I spent two wonderful days in this apartment. It is not too large but it is enough for small group people to have a good rest. It is located on a good location. It is convenient for us to take bus and train to the city center and some good view points! Joe and Dana are so nice! Thanks!
47560	1599856	9.0	9.0	43939998	This was a perfect homebase for our exploration of Seattle. As the description says, we were close to transportation and a really cool neighborhood. A great bakery and grocery within walking distance were really appreciated. There was always a spot on the parking pad for our rental car, and communication and entry were easy. Space was clean and comfortable, and would definitely stay again. Thanks, Joe!
47561	1599856	9.0	9.0	44515840	We stayed at the apartment for 4 nights.  Although we did not meet Joseph, he gave us plenty of information prior to our stay to make it easy.  The kitchen was well stocked but there was no shampoo or bath soap in the bathroom.  The apartment was generally true to its reviews.  However, there was evidence (cat food, smell) that a cat had been in the apartment and I would have appreciated knowing this since I am allergic to cats.  I also found the carpeting old and stained.
47562	1599856	9.0	9.0	45795147	"Everything was great.  The place was exactly as described.  No surprises.  Cool neighborhood with restaurants and grocery stores near walking distance.  Awesome shower.  Check-in and check-out was painless.  I would stay again at this place.  And, they had delicious almond chocolates!!  We ate all of them!  :) 
"
47563	1599856	9.0	9.0	46161872	We spent a great time in Joseph's house. It is convenient to the central Seattle City. Nice neighborhood with the best brunch restaurant just one block away. 
47564	1599856	9.0	9.0	46406751	This place is not at all too small for 4 people, and even 6 people could work out if you'd arrange yourself. You feel this is a home to Joe. His mother was kind to welcome us, and give us some tips to get around.
47565	1599856	9.0	9.0	47147774	Our stay was amazing at Joseph's apartment. Although Joseph was away, his mother Dana was a great host and very responsive. The apartment is in a great neighborhood and close to all the things you could need. The new co-op is a block away, and there are a ton of restaurants nearby. I will definitely being staying here during my next stay in Seattle.
47566	1599856	9.0	9.0	47586482	Had a wonderful stay! Very easy to get to and the key code door lock made it super easy to check in. Everything you need is already in the apartment. The host was very accommodating, super nice, and communicated very well. Would definitely stay again! 
47567	1599856	9.0	9.0	48089161	This place worked out really well for my family- myself, my wife and two kids. The neighborhood is great! Thanks for sharing your home. 
47568	1599856	9.0	9.0	48400320	Joseph was an amazing host that provided information about our stay in a quick and courteous fashion. The apartment we rented from Joseph was very clean and was easily accessible from a light rail station. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Joseph as a host in the future to anyone traveling to the Seattle area. Thanks again! 
47569	1599856	9.0	9.0	49759247	This is a quaint clean quite 2 bedroom apt that fit our needs to the tee!  Joe met us at the door and after just a few minutes, all was completed and we settled in.  Rooms clean and allow for a good sleep.  No TV which was actually a good thing as it allowed us to talk and just chill back and read, take walks, etc.  The area is so nice with a few  breakfast restaurants, small pubs and of course the coffee places.  the rail system is an easy walk to and from there to go anywhere within Seattle.  I would recommend this place and stay there again without blinking an eye!! Thanks Joe
47570	1599856	9.0	9.0	50831038	We just finished our stay in Joseph's place and it was perfect for myself and my two children (6&8). The place had everything we needed but wasn't so 'precious' that I was worried the kids would mess anything up (they didn't!). We loved Columbia City and walked every morning to the bakery around the corner and then every evening to Full Tilt Icecream for dessert and vintage video games. There is a school across the street that had a playground and basketball courts and another great playground and fields a few blocks away. All in all a great place to hang out
47571	1599856	9.0	9.0	51305539	Joseph was super nice & very easy to talk to. His place was perfect for four people. We didn't have any problems at all. Thanks again for letting us stay in your home. Btw-we loved your cultured library!

47573	1599856	9.0	9.0	51939330	Joseph was an awesome host, very welcoming and accommodating. The house had more than enough room for 4 close friends and I. Everything was very clean and comforting, really homey feeling. Definitely going to have to stay here again next time I visit Seattle!!!
47574	1599856	9.0	9.0	52828760	Our host was available to meet us at our arrival and extremely responsive to our concerns during our stay.  We did not use the kitchen because of the many dining out choices in the area, but it was nice to have available a full kitchen and laundry.  Great neighborhood!
47575	1599856	9.0	9.0	53040201	Really fantastic place. Very comfortable and very clean. Hosts were very responsive and accommodating. Location was great and very easy to catch the train downtown.
47576	1599856	9.0	9.0	53460182	The apartment was great - clean, comfortable beds, fantastic location.  We didn't really use the kitchen, but it was well-equipped.  Joseph was really helpful- we unfortunately didn't get to meet him in person as we were out most of the time, but he checked in with us and was very friendly  and accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again!!
47577	1599856	9.0	9.0	54230970	Had a great stay at this Columbia City apartment. It's small, but there is plenty of room for 4 people, especially if you're using it primarily just to sleep. Perfect location to catch the light rail to the airport and to downtown. Close to a great grocery store and some good restaurants and coffee shops. Super cute area. It suited all our needs!
47578	1599856	9.0	9.0	54537673	Awesome place to stay, super cute and homey!
47579	1599856	9.0	9.0	55426517	"We love the place so much! We are a group of 4, 2 couples taking a road trip from Vancouver. Location is perfect, quiet but accessible. Just 15 mins drive from downtown, 15 mins from airport (normal traffic).
The place is warm and cozy! Jo is so nice to be so flexible with our late check-in on the first day (as we were doing our crazy shopping @outlets before getting there). and thanks for the recommendations of restaurants and supermarket nearby.
The 2 nights we were there was really cold outside, but the home is so warm all the time. 
The kitchen is what we love most although we only had chance to cook for one dinner (cos of our short stay), things are well kept and utensils are clean. 
The washroom/ bathroom is newly renovated and it's clean too. (Though the wall between the bedroom and bathroom is a little thin and you can hear the noise when water is running from the tap, but that's not a problem for us.) 
Will definitely return next time! "
47580	1599856	9.0	9.0	57083093	Great location. Very cute place. Good value.
47581	1599856	9.0	9.0	57212059	The place was just as it was described. Joseph's mother welcomed us and accommodated us while we there, and she was very helpful. The space was clean, cozy, and close to decent restaurants and shops. I would recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle.
47582	1599856	9.0	9.0	57629803	Great location! Very convenient to Columbia City shops and to the light rail. Worked at well for my husband, 19 month old, and I! Extra books were a nice touch :). Bit on the cold side even when adjusting the thermostat. 
47583	1599856	9.0	9.0	57909216	"Joe's mother, Dana, welcomed us at the apartment. She was very helpful with information about the apratment and directions for the neighbourhood. The apartment was delightfully retro with gorgeous handmade quilts and a crow theme throughout. There were lots of good books and kitchen and bathroom amenities. The place was very environmentally conscious, the beds were comfortable, and it slept all 4 of us quite comfortably. The furnace made the apartment toasty warm very quickly. We would definitely stay there again! Also, a great neighbourhood, and truly 2.5 blocks from anywhere.

47892	7585688	9.0	9.0	40414615	Clean and comfortable, two blocks away from the train, tucked away.  Pretty close to downtown.  Erik is a friendly and hospitable.  Mahalo
47893	7585688	9.0	9.0	40869524	Erik was a great host in a convenient up and coming area of Seattle. He was able to help us out in a bind too. We were able to ride the Link Light Rail easily from downtown. We didn't have a vehicle during our trip, but there many surrounding stores and places to eat recommended by Erik within walking distance. Erik was absolutely wonderful. He gave us as much privacy as we would like, and yet was social and accommodating as well. Not to mention - he is one of the most interesting people that I have ever met. The accommodations are comfortable, and the bathtub was absolutely delightful. Erik's back yard is filled with fruit trees and an herb garden. He lives in a cottage behind the property so he's easy to access if need be. If I come through Seattle again, I absolutely would stay with Erik again. Highly recommended! 
47894	7585688	9.0	9.0	41853581	"As a host Erik was great and did everything he could to make me feel comfortable, including opening the door at 2:00am after a delay at the airport and making sure there were always something to eat (even though it wasn't on the agreement). Erik has also lived at many places and speaks a few different languages, which makes him the perfect host to have pleasurable conversations.
The place is indeed peaceful, generally well looked after and very close to the tram station, yet it lacks a few details to make it truly comfortable, which Erik mentioned he will take care of very soon."
47895	7585688	9.0	9.0	42199702	Erik was waiting on us outside the property when we arrived and made it feel like home right from the get go. The property was very unique and welcoming. The inside was very clean and organized. The neighborhood seemed to be very safe and the metro rail was only a short 5 minute walk away. Will definitely book with Erik next visit to Seattle! 
47896	7585688	9.0	9.0	42943394	My husband and I were traveling to Seattle then departing on a cruise and needed something close to Pier 66. This place is about 5 mi from the pier, Pike Place Market, Space Needle, and more. It's walking distance from the Link Light Rail -- very convenient! Erik's place is a multi-unit home with eclectic decor. We stayed downstairs in one of two bedrooms separated by the kitchen and living area. The bathroom is shared by the guests. We walked through the kitchen and living room to get to the bathroom. Erik was very gracious! He offered us the use of his washer and dryer which was very welcome as we had been on the road for a week. It's located in a safe neighborhood and a quiet place to stay. He was very engaging and provided us with good tips and info about the area. We met a nice  couple staying there that evening. 
47897	7585688	9.0	9.0	44949804	We had just moved to Seattle and needed a place to stay and Erik was extremely accommodating. His place is so nice and has an excellent kitchen where we cooked many of our meals. All the fresh pears and plums from his fruit trees was a great bonus. He had great coffee and food recommendations and we were able to get to know the area, couldn't have asked for a better air bnb!! Thanks Erik!!
47898	7585688	9.0	9.0	45154157	Eric hosts a great place to stay in Seattle! We arrived very early and he was so gracious about it, made us comfortable right away. Would definitely stay at Eric's again. Also, very close to the train station so you can get around quick.
47899	7585688	9.0	9.0	45340476	I needed a place to spend a quiet night between two long days of driving.  Erik's place was perfect.  I arrived in the late evening, just as Erik was returning from a grocery run.  He greeted me and guided me into my parking spot (there's plenty of parking) -- just what I needed after 14 hours of driving.  The vibe is very homey and communal -- Erik is really a gifted host.  He made sure I was fed and comfortable.  I went right to bed since I needed to get up early  and go -- I slept great, my room was comfortable and everything was nice.
47900	7585688	9.0	9.0	45894389	We were made feel extremely welcome. It was pretty much like staying in a friend's house. Erik gave us a great deal of advice on where to go in Seattle which was great. He even made a great breakfast on our last morning. The neighborhood was great, very close to the city center. The house was great and had a really friendly dog who made the stay even better.
47901	7585688	9.0	9.0	46413757	Erik's Airbnb was great. Erik was there when we checked in and was very friendly during our entire stay. He was also very gracious and let us use his kitchen. We were exploring Seattle for the first time and it was nice to come back to La Guarida after a day of activities. The neighborhood is extremely safe and peaceful and his place is conveniently located close to the LINK as well as nearby buses. Would definitely book this place next time we're in Seattle! 
47902	7585688	9.0	9.0	46929365	The room and layout were exactly as described and Erik was very friendly and patient.
47903	7585688	9.0	9.0	47579575	La Guarida is a great place to stay, very comfortable and easily accesible from all the main areas of Seattle. The train station is literally within 3 minutes from the house. The room is awesome, and Erik is really helpful and informative. He left some maps and tips for places to go around the city and Gustavo (the dog) is lovely. We'd definitely want to come back if we ever return to Seattle.
47904	7585688	9.0	9.0	48012626	We stayed at Erik췂s place for three nights and we had a really great time there. The room was nice and clean. The place itself is very warm and we felt like at home. Erik is very nice and hospitable. He came to pick us up at the railway station in the middle of the night. He gave us some tips where to go, which restaurants to visit etc. The house is 3 mins walking from the light rail station. There is direct connection from Erik췂s place to both airport and city center. :)
47905	7585688	9.0	9.0	48364183	An amazing experience and very nice place. Erik was a great host and very hospitable. Would return. 
47906	7585688	9.0	9.0	48727930	Great host, very welcoming, did not see a lot of Erik after my initial check in but found him to be very friendly and helpful
47907	7585688	9.0	9.0	48966612	Erik is an awesome host. He was waiting to greet us and made us feel home the moment we walked in. He gave us a tour of his beautiful home, offered a beverage and made us very comfortable. The room was very spacious and his kitchen reminds me of a Hibachi. Erik is a great guy to hang out with. He had a few maps, recommendations on a few restaurants, grocery stores around the house which was convenient. He has a wonderful garden and he offered to pick the veggies and herbs for breakfast and my wife made the organic omelette with eggs. He also provided a lot of tips to travel around the city. If I come back to Seattle, I'm staying at Erik's.
47908	7585688	9.0	9.0	49087533	Great place to stay, incredible kitchen and deck. Wonderful place with a nice individual touch.
47909	7585688	9.0	9.0	49674189	Erik's space is absolutely gorgeous! We unfortuantely were not able to stay at his space very long, but we had a really nice time while we were there. Erik has some GREAT recommendations of what to check out nearby. The space itself was super clean and welcoming. The bathroom is absolutely gorgeous (don't think I've ever written that on an Air BnB review before! :D ) and everything is just perfect. Be sure to watch the sunrise on the deck if you are East Coasters like us and will be awake in time for it. Overall, an awesome place with great location. Will hopefully be back again!
47910	7585688	9.0	9.0	53365819	Erik is a great host. He let me drop off my luggage hours before the check in time. His house is beautiful and in a great location. The room is perfect. Comfortable bed and spacious closet. The bathroom is very artistically unique and beautiful. For my first time using airbnb I had a good experience.
47911	7585688	9.0	9.0	54064612	This is a very nice and lovely  place to stay, close to downtonw. It was a pleasure to meet and discuss with 칄ric.
47912	7585688	9.0	9.0	54183285	"Great place! Seems remote as tucked away in wooded area but so close to transit and a really homely/natural feel. Off street parking and a friendly pooch Gustavo welcome!
Loved the wood and tile work and bed was the best I've ever slept in! Fresh cozy flannelette sheets and KING size - perfect for recharging!
Erik very friendly and helpful with information. Printed info for local eats and treats and city info tweaked to our likes and intentions. 
Shame we had only one night but the later check out meant a nice relaxing departure.
Thanks Erik!"
47913	7585688	9.0	9.0	56923252	We arrived late and left early, but this was a nice place to crash for the night. The bathroom and shower were really great, especially after a whole day of being on a plane. We never saw Erik or the dog, but we could hear the footsteps when they got home. That was the only downside to our stay. So if you're a lighter sleeper, I might suggest earplugs. Overall, it was a great room. We really liked The Station's coffee too. Thanks for the recommendation, Erik! 
49049	826436	9.0	9.0	3075686	My stay at Casa de Esperanza was delightful.  Great location in a beautiful, quiet  neighborhood.   The B&B. rooms are very comfortable, nicely decorated.   Breakfast was cooked to order- excellent food!  Barbara, the host, is friendly and knows Seattle well.    I have stayed at several B&B's in the Seattle area.  Casa de Esperanza is  a great  find.   Will definitely return.
49050	826436	9.0	9.0	3732404	We spent three nights in Art Deco BnB on our last visit in Seattle.  Great location in a quiet part of Seattle, short walk from the Light Rail station. Cozy home with a lot of character and a pleasant and caring host  Barbara. We would recommend (website hidden). Breakfast was delicious.
49051	826436	9.0	9.0	3856084	This was truly a wonderful experience. Barbara was a delightful host and fun to chat with, but also understanding if you prefer to be alone. The room was clean and the bed was really comfortable. Breakfast was always tasty and Barbara was more than willing to accommodate any food allergies. The location is perfect, close to water and also very convenient if you don't have a car (it is pretty close to the Light Rail). I would definitely stay here again!
49052	826436	9.0	9.0	4026307	I had a very comfortable stay at Barbara's Bed and Breakfast!  Spent almost a week there while I searched for more permanent housing in the area.  The breakfasts were delicious and varied, and she is quite accommodating of food allergies and preferences.  I enjoyed the Mexican shower and the Art Deco decor.  Barbara is a kind, thoughtful host, and a delight to chat with.  Definately recommended!  :)
49053	826436	9.0	9.0	4312267	Barbara is a great host.  She was very friendly and cooked a delicious breakfast every morning.  The house was clean and interesting with a lot of art everywhere.  I'd stay with her again if possible.
49054	826436	9.0	9.0	4438460	"I had a wonderful time at Barbara's bed and breakfast. 
The Helen Keller room is a lovely room with a very comfortable bed and Barbara뗩 cooked breakfasts are delicious.
Barbara is a wonderful host. She is happy to provide you with everything you need. She gave me the best recommendations to explore Seattle and I loved our inspiring conversations. Thank you Barbara for a true home far away.
"
49055	826436	9.0	9.0	4650061	"Barbara was very warm and friendly. The bed was comfortable. Barbara made very tasty breakfast with varieties. I stayed a week in her house and had several breakfast with her. She has lots of interesting story and photo to share on the breakfast room table. Her garden grows beautiful flowers. She decorated the breakfast table with fresh flowers. I enjoyed the stay in her house and a few nice conversations with Barbara.

49056	826436	9.0	9.0	4683251	Staying at Barbara's B&B was a highlight of our weekend in Seattle - because meeting Barbara was a joy.  She is a delightful host who will entertain you, feed you wonderful meals and be available for whatever you need.  For me, B&B's are about meeting the people who run them, having a comfy bed and being able to use them as a base to get around.  This experience was marvellous in all those ways! 
49057	826436	9.0	9.0	4821507	Nice quiet neighborhood, lots of parking.  Room was clean.  Shower is on the same floor and I was not sharing it during my stay, but I believe that was because Barbara was out of town.  
49058	826436	9.0	9.0	5080808	Barbara is an amazing hostess! My husband and I stayed with her for part of our honeymoon and our trip was greatly sweetened by Barbara's delicious cooking and detailed knowledge of the area. She gave us wonderful tips on how to get around Seattle, where to eat, what parts of Olympic National Forest and Mt. Rainier to see. But aside from those helpful things, she was a delight to be around! Oh, and her cooking is amazing! The first morning she made us an egg mcmuffin sort of thing with fresh guacamole. The next day she prepared a broccoli and mushroom quiche. Another day was breakfast tacos with fresh, homemade home fries. And she offered to send some of the rhubarb pie and bread that she made from scratch with us for our adventures. If you have an opportunity to stay at her BnB, definitely take it! You won't regret it!
49059	826436	9.0	9.0	5188073	Barbara is a wonderful woman - attentive host on top of great conversation and intriguing life experiences to inspire, adding to my already exciting trip to this great city. I would absolutely stay again, and recommend Barbara (and her wonderful breakfasts!) to anyone in the area. 
49060	826436	9.0	9.0	5318642	When in Seattle the best place to stay is with Barbara. The homemade breakfasts were very tasty and got us off to a good start. Barbara goes out of her way to make sure you are comfortable and all your needs are satisfied. The price for our room was among the best in the city and when you throw in the breakfast you wonder how you got such a great deal. Seattle is an expensive city to visit and Barbara makes it affordable for anyone to enjoy. My wife and I will return to Seattle in the future and our first choice would be to stay with Barbara. I will add this was my first airbnb experience and I am hooked. No more overpriced hotels for me. 
49061	826436	9.0	9.0	5790614	"We were made to feel very much at home in a warm, friendly atmosphere. Comfortable beds and generous breakfasts. Barbara was a great hostess.
"
49062	826436	9.0	9.0	6013803	"Barbara's B&B is a perfect place for those who look for a simple yet comfortable accommodation. It is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood just about 5 minute walk from Mt. Baker Light Rail station. Just hop on the Light Rail and in 10 to 15 minutes, you are in downtown Seattle. Don't forget to visit Lake Washington which is about 10 minutes on foot from her place. The Vietnamese restaurant called BEN THANH near Mt. Baker station was decent. Columbia City has more choices of restaurants including Senegalese, Thai, Japanese, etc. 
Barbara is an intelligent woman with a big heart. She did everything to make my stay comfortable and memorable. She graciously let me leave my luggage at her place for the entire day after I checked out as my flight did not leave until late that night. When I left her B&B for the airport, she walked with me to Mr .Baker Station. What a kind hostess she is!
I enjoyed our conversation over her homemade quiche and fair trade coffee for breakfast. Thank you, Barbara. 
"
49063	826436	9.0	9.0	6068013	Barbara goes out of her way to make you enjoy your stay at Caza the Ezparanza. When my friend Nanna and I stayed she tried to make a traditional Danish treat, which we really enjoyed and appreciated. Overall Barbara is an absolutely loving women and a wonderful host.
49064	826436	9.0	9.0	6166405	Barbara is a very gracious host. She serves delicious breakfast daily which is a huge plus. Her place is close to the Link light rail station and it`s a short walk to Lake Washington. The room is lovely and the bed very comfortable.
49065	826436	9.0	9.0	6469855	Lovely home and Barbara is a great host.  She helped us with all of our questions of how to get around and find things.  The room is set up a little differently than the pictures as well as the breakfast.  The room is great with where the bed is located (in front of a window in the east for great morning sun.)  The breakfast was yummy and Barbara made sure she met our request for wonderfully strong coffee in the morning (and plenty of it!)  I would recommend staying with Barbara and hope our travels bring us to her neck of the woods again.
49066	826436	9.0	9.0	6561604	"Barbara is a cheerful & positive & humorous ,, nice  lady.
Her room very clean ...she made very nice & delicious breakfast 
Unfortunately , this is the first & last during our stay ...the subsequent days she had a ad-hoc request to Canada to help a friend , & we unable to spend more time with her...."
49067	826436	9.0	9.0	6762582	Barbara is a gracious host nice older home very close to Lake Washington and close to the Rail station
49068	826436	9.0	9.0	12931857	First time using AirBnB and I'm sold now because of Barbara!  I could not have asked for a better stay than at Casa de Esperanza.  Perfect for couples, singles, art lovers, or those seeking close access to downtown.   I stayed here for two weeks and was blown away by the kind service and delicious, homemade breakfasts.  She is truly a delightful host and I would recommend her to any family or friends on their way to the Seattle area.
49069	826436	9.0	9.0	14121840	Barbara is a great host, accommodating and friendly, witty and intelligent. She made my stay really enjoyable, her house is comfortable and fascinating and the breakfasts excellent with delicious fresh eggs every morning from her chickens. The location, being so handy for the Light rail station, is perfect, with easy and rapid access to the airport and the city, with the added attraction of interesting local walks. Barbara is a great conversationalist  and made me feel right at home, we parted as good friends. When I return to Seattle I'll definitely stay again.
49070	826436	9.0	9.0	14416032	"I had noticed Barbara's many positive reviews before booking my stay, so I was already expecting that my host would be a friendly, generous and interesting person.  She was all of this and more.  What a fascinating woman! If my schedule has not already been so full, I would have enjoyed talking about a multitude of subjects with Barbara for hours.  

She was very generous with her time and even walked me the several blocks to the location of my meeting. And her breakfasts are exceptional! What more could one ask for?"
49071	826436	9.0	9.0	14734356	"This is a very comfortable lodging convenient to light rail service, in a lovely home. The most unique features are Barbara's wonderful hospitality and her delicious and healthy breakfasts. Barbara is a warm generous person who goes out of her way. She cooks using organic and local ingredients including eggs straight from the chickens. We will go back when we visit again. 
"
49072	826436	9.0	9.0	15106347	Barbara is one heck of a host! I had never used Airbnb before this, but the room and the comforts of her home were above and beyond my expectations, and her casual charm put me at ease the minute we said hello. Plus, she cooks like a champ. I sincerely wish I had spent more time hanging out and talking with this fascinating lady. If you ever want to visit Seattle, I highly recommend planning a stay with Barbara.
49073	826436	9.0	9.0	15561150	We had a great time. Barbara is a wonderful hostess and we felt very welcome in her beautiful home. 
49074	826436	9.0	9.0	16420297	Barbara was a caring, attentive host.  She helped us figure out public transport options, helped us decide on must-see sights, gave her honest opinion on different tourist attractions, and all the while making us feel right at home in her sweet home.  A delicious breakfast awaited us each morning.  The neighborhood was simple and quiet.  We stayed in the second-floor bedroom which was lovely and very quiet with lovely light in the morning.  The accommodations are simple and homey -- just what we wanted for our trip.  
49075	826436	9.0	9.0	16660653	Barbara was very welcoming, flexible and accommodating; Delicious cook with great variety over the three days I was at Barbara's home. Charming suburb and I often came home late at night, so the close-by Light Rail was terrific.
49076	826436	9.0	9.0	17105615	"Barbara is such a lovely lady! She was so kind and generous to me during my stay. Her breakfasts were always great and her company and conversation were fantastic too.

Her place is right near the light rail station which takes you right into the heart of downtown Seattle. She has a lovely large home in a safe neighborhood. The bed and room were clean and cosy.

Thanks Barbara for making my stay in Seattle great!"
49077	826436	9.0	9.0	17629541	I stayed Barbara's home for seven days. It's a really nice and sweet house. I stayed there just like I stayed in my home. The house is near the light rail, you can use 10 minutes walk to there. She also made delicious breakfast for us, most of food were organic. Barbara is a really nice lady and I am glad to meet her. I spent wonderful time in her house.
49078	826436	9.0	9.0	17962016	"Barbara lives in a very nice old art deco style house with a a countryside inspired garden. The house is nicely located in a residential neighbourhood. It is easily accessible by public transport (light rail).

Although the room itself was fine as seen in the pictures, our experience in Barbara's house did not completely meet the expectations triggered by the extremely positive comments of other users and by Barbara's ad. Maybe we came at a inconvenient point of time for her, but the common spaces of the house (hallway and living room) appeared to be rather chaotic with a lot of boxes stored in the rooms, things lying around in an un-organized way. Actually what made me decide for the house was the picture Barbara gives of her house on her page such as the common spaces and the nice breakfast table. Unfortunately, this is not really what we got. When we were there it was rather unappealing to hang out in the common spaces (although it got better after we said something).

Finally, although I was aware that the bathroom was shared, I found the bathroom rather unfit (especially the shower) for being shared with strangers.

All in all, our experience was not what we expected, but we admit that we might be just a little bit disappointed of the place."
49079	826436	9.0	9.0	18710619	I stayed with Barbara for a few weeks while I moved to Seattle and it was an absolutely wonderful experience. Barbara was incredibly welcoming and had a lot of advice about the area, making my move smooth far smoother than I could have imagined. She is also a fantastic cook and just in general a friendly and warm person. I would recommend anyone stay with Barbara, whether it be for 4 days or 4 weeks. You won't regret it.
49080	826436	9.0	9.0	23802046	Barbara was a great host. I arrived on short notice and she was totally flexible and cool. Her home is awesome and really gives you a great sense of community. The room was great and the desk was very practical. Parking is very easy to find as well which is very convenient. One of the coolest aspects of Barbara is wow informed she is of international cultures. Had great conversations and learned several things from her. She also gave breakfast in the mornings or whenever you decided to eat breakfast. She runs an art gallery which was very cool and fun to see in person.  I would definitely consider going back again. 
49081	826436	9.0	9.0	37845089	"I arrived on July 4th and Barbara went out for the holiday weekend, so she asked her friend to take care of me. Everyone I met there is really nice.
The room is on second floor. Its layout/decorations had changed a bit. It looks smaller than that on the pictures, but as I went there alone with a 28-inch luggage and a backpack, the room had enough room for me to lay down the opened luggage.
It took me 10-15 mins to walk to the light rail station. The Lake Washington is not far away. It's great to walk around the lake. I stayed in the house during a hooooot week. The house is lovely. Amazingly, it has no air conditioner, but the living room was cool with breeze even when it was hot outside.
Barbara made good breakfast. I had smoothie (yummy), fresh fruits picked directly from her yard, toast, omelet.
I had a good time. Will live here again if I go to Seattle next time:)"
49082	826436	9.0	9.0	39212542	This artsy home is a close walk to the light rail and Lake Washington in a quiet and safe neighborhood. We felt very welcome. Barbara does the breakfast as there is no kitchen access. She is a lovely hostess.
49083	826436	9.0	9.0	41977783	Barbara was a gracious and welcoming host and her home was lovely. Absolutely comes as advertised, my 11 day stay with her was wonderful
49084	826436	9.0	9.0	42946701	Barbara is an amazing person. She is very caring. She also serves great breakfast. I loved the daily coffee, organic pancakes, poached eggs and toast. She also prepares a sauce to go with breakfast from fruis and berries in her garden. The fruit that she served in the morning was also amazing. She provided great suggestions regarding transportation and what to see/do in Seattle. 
49085	826436	9.0	9.0	46009480	She welcomed us into her beautiful house and ran her AirBnB more like a real bed and breakfast. She cooked us breakfast and brewed coffee in the morning. Such a great host!
49086	826436	9.0	9.0	47791133	"Barbara is very good at sharing necessary information with her guests on how to get from her house to downtown Seattle, even to providing an Orca card for use on the light rail and bus. I enjoyed hearing about Barbara's work and the artists she represents in her gallery.  Her breakfasts are terrific: quiche, fresh fruits or smoothies, zucchini bread, etc. Also you can come in and make tea whenever you want.   I did find that the bedroom was smaller than it looked in the photo, and the furniture has been rearranged, so the rooms look different. There was no longer a mirror in the bedroom, which meant spending more time in the shared bathroom. 

Note to future visitors: If you take the Link to her place, just come out of the station, avoid that circuitous walkway if you have luggage, and just walk across and up the street.  If you have heavy bags, taking a cab or Uber would be better the first time because there is a hill up to her street. Much easier to walk down when you're departing.  The walk to the bus #14 is through a lovely neighborhood and there's a beautiful lake and park right there by the bus stop which is worth walking in."
49087	826436	9.0	9.0	48434414	The space was pretty much as advertised.  The light link rail stop is a short walk, albeit with a bit of a hill and an overpass that you will not enjoy lugging your luggage over, which made it convenient.  The bathroom does not lock, but we did not have any issue in that area (not sure if any other guests were there though).  The breakfast was very tasty and Barbara was very helpful with spots to check out in town and informative about Seattle and the neighborhood.  If you don't mind a quirky house with a little character, this space is a good spot just outside the city proper.
50639	8409962	10.0	9.0	47917463	The host provided a very comfortable and homey environment. The room was exactly as described. The neighborhood was very quiet and calm.  Pretty close to Downtown Seattle and other tourist spots.  Definitely recommend staying here.
50640	8409962	10.0	9.0	48367838	"Nice and clean room and bathroom, with a great breakfast.
I recommend this place, but if you are walking from the Light Rail Othello station know theres quite an ascent.

50641	8409962	10.0	9.0	48664997	Stayed in this room one night and another for two. Great value and amenities!
50642	8409962	10.0	9.0	49192734	Great stay at this airbnb!! The space was exactly as states. Very clean and organized. Loved that they actually provided breakfast food/options :) A little far from downtown Seattle but is located in a safe neighborhood.  Would stay here again. 
50643	8409962	10.0	9.0	51797437	Dario and his team went the extra mile to accommodate my needs. The house was comfortable and had a nice breakfast. I will likely be staying here again on future visits.
50644	8409962	10.0	9.0	52190576	It was nice and easy for me to come and go. I met Dario's roommate Alessandro, he was very nice
50645	8409962	10.0	9.0	53299574	"Overall, my stay at Dario's place was exceptional! Very nice neighborhood with beautiful views of Lake Washington you go out for a walk. The home was just as described and the selection for breakfast was beyond my expectations. 

Even though I was unable to meet Dario Would he certainly has the place set up well to make guest feel welcomed. 

Thanks Dario!       "
50646	8409962	10.0	9.0	53420661	I enjoyed my first stay in one of Dario's houses I thought I'd give this one a try too, and this house was on point! With a kitchen, living room and bathroom on each floor it is a really cool experience. Nice family neighborhood too
50647	8409962	10.0	9.0	53853760	"Amazing & fantastic!
If u go to Seattle, certainly you should go to there. I'm really, really recommend to you guys. there is far from downtown about 30min. but You can approach dario's house by No.7 or No.9 bus directly. When I arrived the house, they welcomed us.:D I've been to stay 3nights with my husband. We had very! very! really!!! good time. Dario& his mom is very kind with smile always. And I think, Room is even better than you expect. Kitchen, bathroom, highspeed wifi. everything was fine!! everything is perfect!!!
Go where you may go, but I really recommend Dario's lovely house."
50648	8409962	10.0	9.0	54549153	Darios place was exceptional.  Comfortable. Clean. Breakfast options were great to have. Plus a washer and dryer! I can recommend this Airbnb with complete confidence that your stay will be good.
50649	8409962	10.0	9.0	55435788	Everything in this house is great. The bedroom is very clean and warm. The kitchen is awesome as Dario prepared a lot of food for breakfast. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The parking is easy. Will definitely pick the place next time.

50930	3115801	10.0	9.0	14745322	I absolutely loved staying with Linda and Mike. First of all, their place is gorgeous. I was looking for a place for a one-month stay of my parents who visited me from India. The 1 BHK apartment is completely separate and private. This was perfect for my parents as they never felt that they were living at someone's else house. The house is very well furnished and the outside view makes you feel like you are living in mountains - it's very green, fresh air, and just beautiful. Linda and Mike are great host too - they arranged for extra mattress when I stayed with my parents for few nights. In addition, my parents wanted some Indian channels on T.V. - Linda surprised me when she visited the office of the cable company and got me the channels. My experience was just great.   
50931	3115801	10.0	9.0	15583997	This is a fantastic space to stay in Seattle -- Serene is the perfect word! Linda had all of the promised accommodations, and then some. My husband and I had a rental car, thus there was no need to navigate the public transportation system so I can't speak to that. But it never took us too long to get anywhere we wanted to go. The bed was SO comfortable, and it was nice to have reliable WiFi and some great TV/Movie selections. It was the perfect hybrid of home and hotel, and we loved it!
50932	3115801	10.0	9.0	16013577	"We've stayed in quite a few Airbnb listings around Seattle and this was by far the best. The apartment was very clean, nicely furnished and has the convenience of a full size kitchen. The house is nestled up to nature for early morning cups of coffee on the porch, or you can walk across the street to the Duwamish Greenbelt for a walk. We didn't have a rental car so route 125 straight to downtown being right down the street was extremely convenient. There's nature when you want it, a very short trip to central West Seattle or Downtown Seattle when you don't.

I was also surprised to see the place was surprisingly stocked with snacks, fruit, juice, etc. which is a very pleasant surprise. This is good because the only downside (and it certainly wouldn't be for most) is that there's not a whole lot within convenient walking distance.

Overall our stay was fantastic and we had nary a complaint. We were even graciously offered a ride to the nearest light rail station so we could get to the airport. Definitely above and beyond! Wish we could have stayed longer."
50933	3115801	10.0	9.0	16552070	Staying with Linda and Michael was serene, to say the least! What a lovely place they envisioned - we are so thankful they opened their home to share through AirBnB. Located in West Seattle, the space was quiet and calm, a great retreat after a long day of adventuring around Seattle. The bed was so comfy, and we loved using the TV w/ Roku set up for a date night-in watching documentaries! Our hosts were fantastic -  so thoughtful and responsive to any needs that arose. Meeting Linda was a true pleasure, and we were so thankful for her amazing hospitality. Thank you, again!! :)
50934	3115801	10.0	9.0	17209433	"A warm welcome from Linda via email began our great stay in her immaculate apartment.Linda is a gracious host who provided every breakfast need possible and attended to our enquiries. The quiet, peaceful balcony overlooking masses of trees, was a lovely place to have breakfast and evening drinks. We highly recommend staying here.
"
51250	4681687	9.0	9.0	24681154	Great location and place to spend the night. Lilia was a great host and was quick to respond to anything that was needed!
51251	4681687	9.0	9.0	25259963	All I needed was a place to stay for one night. Instead of trying the hotel I decided to do Airbnb instead. This place was exactly what I needed. Instead of staying in a cold stuffy room I stayed at a place that felt like home. Very happy with it.
51252	4681687	9.0	9.0	25647560	Lilia's studio was fantastic and exactly what I needed for a few nights in Seattle! I didn't actually meet Lilia but she kept in constant communication, ensuring that everything was okay, as well as providing many tips on great eating/drinking establishments. She was also kind enough to leave some local coffee and beer for me. The place was lovely, comfortable and an easy bus ride to downtown - I would definitely stay here again should I ever return to Seattle!
51253	4681687	9.0	9.0	25852512	"Lilia was very friendly and accommodating. Apartment was as described, clean and on a great location. I'd definitely stay here again.
"
51254	4681687	9.0	9.0	26692235	Lilia was a great hostess.  The studio was great and in a nice neighborhood.  She had a basket of breakfast food for us as well as ground coffee.  There is a nice little kitchen area with a coffee maker, microwave and toaster oven.  Just a few blocks away you have some great restuarants, a music club, trader joes and some nice shops.  She provided us with some fabulous restaurant recommendations.  We had a great stay and I would recommend this studio for anyone traveling to Seattle.
51255	4681687	9.0	9.0	26897414	I booked very last minute and Lilia was great about making sure the place was clean and ready for me. This is a cute little studio, I was very comfy here. I had one small issue and Lilia went out of her way to take care of it for me. It's the details that count, like having coffee, tea, and bagels set up, it really made the difference for me coming in from out of town. The neighbor hood is great, and you're back in a quiet ally away from the main road so you have great privacy. You're also really close to all the basics, including the core of the California St. area. 
51256	4681687	9.0	9.0	27444914	Had a really good experience w Lilia.  Nice, quiet unit, close to shops, and convenient to W Seattle bridge.  While we did not actually meet, Lilia was very quick to respond to my emails, and was great when I accidentally locked the key in the unit.  Resolved it w/o interfering w/ my plans.  :) 
51257	4681687	9.0	9.0	27846096	Lilia's place was welcoming from the beginning.  It took a little to find it, as I had not been in her neighborhood before and the house numbers were on the houses on the hill, but once there, I was greeted warmly and the place was shown to me personally by her sister.  Overall I like the neighborhood, plenty of amenities, even a lovely downtown view just down the hill in the park.  There was a coffee press, all the plates etc. I would have needed, and some items to munch on, which was convenient each morning. Overall a place I would love to use again on a future trip.
51258	4681687	9.0	9.0	28342071	Really close to the beach and the freeway to get pretty much anywhere in Seattle. Right next to California street which has a ton of food and shopping. WiFi signal was so weak I really couldn't get any work done while inside the room but, maybe that's not such a bad thing while your on vacation. Thanks for everything Lilia.
51259	4681687	9.0	9.0	28591047	"This little studio was exactly like the description and photos -- clean, light, and functional.  We had a car, and the location was convenient for accessing West Seattle, Alki beach and downtown Seattle.  Parking off street in the carport was super nice after dealing with parking in other parts of the city.  We had a lovely meal at a restaurant called Locol not terribly far away (we drove though).
We never had to interact directly with Lilia, but that was because everything was so easy -- in fact we appreciated the privacy that this cozy studio provided in the middle of West Seattle."
51260	4681687	9.0	9.0	28716773	We had a wonderful stay here in West Seattle. The studio was what we expected, very clean and quaint! There was coffee and tea left for us that we enjoyed in the morning. The covered parking was very convenient. It is close to Alki beach and California Ave which has a lot of cute places to shop and eat!
51261	4681687	9.0	9.0	29648248	Lilia has a wonderful little get away spot.  Emails and information was spot on.  West Seattle is a great place to stay, easy access to downtown, but lots of great places to eat and shop just a few blocks from Lilia's on California Street.  Easy alley access, with a place to park.  Also, patio table and chairs to enjoy a glass of wine outside!  The apartment is clean and well maintained.  I would stay again.
51262	4681687	9.0	9.0	30346840	Lilia was a wonderful host. The studio is located in a garage but once inside it's extremely cozy and offers complete privacy. It is also located in a great neighborhood: Close to downtown and close to Alki beach. I would definitely stay here again. 
51263	4681687	9.0	9.0	30843676	Lilia was very nice and communicative!
51264	4681687	9.0	9.0	31375545	This place was great!! Me and my friend enjoyed our stay very much. It is a good distance from downtown. Definitely will be coming back here.
51265	4681687	9.0	9.0	31825412	"It is a very nice little place. It met my needs well.

My host was very thoughtful and communicative (online) which made things easy. We had no interaction in person, which was just fine for me. 

I ended up coming and going at odd hours, but the entrance was private and separated from both the main house and the neighbors so I didn't feel like I was being a nuisance to anyone. 

Room for Improvement:
-The wifi was only consistent from outside.
-A mini-fridge would have been exceptionally useful. (A microwave and dishes for two were provided.)
-A bottle of hair gel would have come in handy. (Shampoo, conditioner, body scrub, and hand soap were provided.)

...but these aren't complaints. I had a very pleasant experience :)"
51266	4681687	9.0	9.0	32390693	The studio was easy to find thanks to Lilia's directions. The room was clean and comfortable. It was great for our over night stay in Seattle. 
51267	4681687	9.0	9.0	33904312	This place was perfect for our week long stay, and Lilia was so helpful.  The studio had everything that we needed, and was cozy and comfortable.  Lilia was there if we needed anything, but was not at all overbearing.  I highly recommend staying in this place.  It's in a beautiful neighborhood, and a wonderful city.
51268	4681687	9.0	9.0	35441871	We stayed in Lilia's wonderful quaint and private studio garage for a few nights. A great place for a couple to retire after a days excursion. Great location in West Seattle that is walking distance to great parks and great food, (a bit hilly so bad knees beware). And you definitely have to check out the north shore water front (5-10 min drive) great for bike riding! Cab/uber was about $30 round trip to downtown. Which was fine since we were new to the area and didn't want to worry about all the hassles of taking a car into the city. Everything was really great, Lilia was easy to reach, and we had more privacy than we could have asked for.  Definitely on our list for places to stay next time we're in the area!
51269	4681687	9.0	9.0	35625779	A very comfortable space and about a 20 minute drive to Seattle. The room was as described with a private parking space, clean towels, soap, shampoo, and even complimentary tea! Lilia gave us very easy instructions for checkin which was extremely convenient since we got in late at night. Although we didn뗪 meet Lilia in person, she made sure she was always just a text away. Also the room is separated from the main house which gave us the privacy we were looking for. Highly recommend!
51270	4681687	9.0	9.0	36236069	The space was really clean and easy to access! Lilia made sure I was able to get in and get settled and the space was exactly what I needed!
51271	4681687	9.0	9.0	36723521	Lilia's place was great.  It was a private bungalow with everything that I needed.  A short walk away is a very nice 24 hour QFC for any food supplies you might need.  In addition, a little past the QFC was a street with a Sunday market and a bunch of restaurants and a microbrew.  At first, I rented a car when I arrives, but public transit to and from Lilia's was so convenient that I canceled the car.  I would definitely stay again.
51272	4681687	9.0	9.0	37371619	"The studio is small but comfortable and a 15 min drive to downtown. Check-in was very easy and convenient. Wi-fi was good. Parking was easy. Thanks to Lilia's studio, I could enjoy my trip.
"
51273	4681687	9.0	9.0	37694592	The cozy studio is a great spot. It is located on the main route 21 bus into town and just down from West Seattle running oval. The studio was tidy and everything you needed was available. Lilia was also very attentive and sorted out my wireless password issue. Fantastic. 
51274	4681687	9.0	9.0	38523339	Lilia was a wonderful host and her space was absolutely lovely. She was super responsive for any questions we had but gave us privacy and space during our three night stay. She even allowed us to check in a bit early when we arrived to Seattle earlier than we'd anticipated.
51275	4681687	9.0	9.0	38890876	"This place suited us perfectly. Close to my sisters and near the track where my competition was being held. Had a great breakfast nearby at Easy Street Records and Cafe on Alaska St. Lots of great restaurants along Alki beach. 
We will stay again for sure next time we are down this way. "
51276	4681687	9.0	9.0	39325522	Private studio with covered parking.  Nice neighborhood.  No frig which turned out to be an inconvenience.  I think they are trying to get a frig.
51277	4681687	9.0	9.0	39647923	Great location and you don't feel like a tourist staying in West Seattle. If you are looking for privacy, this is the perfect place. 
51278	4681687	9.0	9.0	39960421	Lilia's laneway home was a nice little place just outside of downtown Seattle, and was perfect for our trip. It's a really nice cozy place, has the basic amenities, microwave, fridge, and a french press, and most importantly: Parking! I have a Mazda 3 GT and it was a bit tricky getting into the spot due to the dip in the road, but going in from the right angles it worked just fine. Lilia's studio is located really close to downtown, it's just a short ride to the city centre. Definitely a good location.
51279	4681687	9.0	9.0	40409882	Great place!
51280	4681687	9.0	9.0	40767662	Nice, cozy spot in West Seattle! I'd definitely recommend it!
51281	4681687	9.0	9.0	41772468	The studio is super cute and convenient to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods. The listing was descriptive and accurate.  It's a perfect place if you are visiting Seattle for a short time and need an affordable, fun place to sleep.  
51282	4681687	9.0	9.0	43062511	This was a great place for our stay in Seattle. Easy drive to downtown (I also took the bus in one day and that was close and easy too!) but we liked being able to just stay in West Seattle for our meals (It is so much easier to park and get around!) The place has most anything you might need, mini fridge, microwave, toaster oven, plates and cups, and of course a bed and your own bathroom. Pretty quiet neighborhood and we were never bothered staying there. Lilia said she was available if we needed anything but we never really did so we didn't contact her. 
51283	4681687	9.0	9.0	45110652	Cozy studio just as described. Clean and quiet. West Seattle is the gem of the city and Lillia's place affords you great location to The Junction, Alki Beach and of course downtown Seattle. Loved our stay there and would come back again.
51284	4681687	9.0	9.0	46599868	Lilia's place was as described. The bus stop just a couple minute walk away was very convenient; we could get to downtown Seattle easily without having to deal with the hassle of driving and parking. Lilia was also a great host and made our stay in Seattle an enjoyable one.
51285	4681687	9.0	9.0	47124479	Lilia was a great host. Very easy to communicate with and flexible and understanding when I had to modify my reservation. The apartment was relatively basic, but comfortable, affordable and well-located. It comes with a covered parking spot, which is huge. I certainly recommend Lilia and her West Seattle apartment.
51286	4681687	9.0	9.0	47975940	Lovely stay! The room was clean and had nice little extras, like granola bars, teas, shampoos, lotions. The neighborhood is safe, walkable, and accessible to everything we needed in West Seattle. Bus sop for Downtown Seattle is right out the door. Thank you for hosting us.
51287	4681687	9.0	9.0	54827460	"I liked the location of your room built into your garage. It was easy to find and get to.  Off street parking in Seattle anywhere is very nice.  The dishes and flatware were great to have and the coffee was very nice.  It was good to come and go and not disturb or be disturbed.  I'm sorry I wasn't at your place the weekend before.  It's actually a great location for a diver or other sports participant since there is ample room for gear to set under that nice little carport.   I bet it's quite nice in the summer as well.  It felt secluded even with homes all around.  

I felt very welcome and appreciated you checking in to see if I needed anything.

"
51288	4681687	9.0	9.0	55157871	Place was exactly as described. Adjacent to all West Seattle attractions and bus line to downtown. Great host, and highly recommended listing to all. Simple, easy, swift check in and out.
51289	4681687	9.0	9.0	56315910	Lilia is a wonderful host and the apartment is fabulous!! It is spacious, clean, small kitchen and a cozy living area. The location is in a very quite residential area. I loved that I could park the car right by the private apartment entrance with a covered parking spot. Lilia is available for communication anytime. She is very accommodating, kind, and caring. I felt like I was right at home and would love to stay again. I highly recommend!
51290	4681687	9.0	9.0	57102649	The air bnb is located near everything which makes traveling into the downtown very convenient and easy. Beautiful location. I throughly enjoyed my experience. Lilia was a great host! Super helpful and very accommodating. She checked up to make sure if we needed anything; but of course all was provided! Would definitely recommend staying here. 
52360	7483750	9.0	9.0	39712218	Lars waited us for arrive at 4pm, where we met his two doggies and discussed our plans for the evening. He has a beautiful place and we had a great time discussing Italy. Thanks!
52361	7483750	9.0	9.0	40045447	Lars was super nice and friendly. He gave me directions and was always present to help me. The house was easy to find, behind a small vegetation wall. The room was bright and clean and once again our host was great : easy going, eager to please us and smiling.
52362	7483750	9.0	9.0	40545422	Lars is a great host - very concerned with your happiness and comfort. The space is large and has plenty of room. Very comfortable and usable. The space is exactly as described. The place is in a very quite neighborhood that is close and convenient to many prominent areas with easy access to both the local neighborhood as well as the freeway.  
52363	7483750	9.0	9.0	40670394	Lars was ready for me when I got there and was a great host. We also had a nice conversation about sailboats and he was helpful to recommend a book to me, and let me use his copy during my stay. His space was spacious and comfortable. 
52364	7483750	9.0	9.0	41142524	"The pictures were accurate in displaying this airbnb. For what we paid, it fulfilled our expectations. Lars was a kind host, and gave us the privacy we needed for a weekend getaway. Some things to note was that there were no curtains to the window adjacent to the bed so we were very self conscious at night when the lights were on. As well, the shower and toilet pressure were low, and the place itself was ""rustic"" and slightly older. Furthermore, it was very HOT with only a very small fan to move around the air. All in all, it was a good location for a cheap price. "

52366	7483750	9.0	9.0	41680293	The listing is exactly as described.  Very quiet neighborhood and the host is very accommodating.  It was very nice having a separate entrance to the room from outside so we could leave early in the morning and not have to worry about waking anyone up.  The only down side is the front of the house looks a bit like a jungle (lots of trees) so you can't really see the house from the street.  However the host did meet us in the street upon arriving to make it easier.  
52367	7483750	9.0	9.0	42742267	"Lars place was quite spacious with a wonderful large bath and many windows and in a great location. It is located close to the city yet tucked away in a nice and safe residential area with many trees.  Lars was very welcoming and kind.  Supposedly Lars has 2 roomates but it felt quite private as we never saw them in passing and Lars was rarely home.  The only things that was an issue for us was that the place was very dusty and had quite a few spiders and spider webs but Lars reassured us that he would be hiring new housekeepers.  The toilet also had issues but I believe he mentioned he replaced that as well.  With that said all else was exactly what we were looking for and I would highly recommend his place to those traveling the Seattle area.  A very reasonable price for what you get!! While in town I did work some late evenings but tried to return to his home very quietly and hoping it did not disturb anyone.  No one woke as far as I knew.  Being hosts in Maui ourselves we wanted to express our gratitude and did so by spoiling Lars with a $30 tip,  we brought him a tiki mug and chocolate covered macadamia nuts from Maui.  Plus we got him 2 chairs for his patio and left him 2 ponchos for guests to utilize when it rains.  We ended up checking out early but for no other reason other than my daughter and her friend flew into town from Chicago to surprise me and we had to get a hotel that would accommodate 4 people.  I was grateful that Lars did not make us feel bad for doing so.  
Thank You Lars for having us in your home!!"
52368	7483750	9.0	9.0	43582583	The room was just as described and Lars as a welcoming host. The room as a private entrance through some beautiful trees and everything you need is within the suite, minus the kitchen which is the first room in the main part of the house. 
52369	7483750	9.0	9.0	43875624	" Lars welcomed us like old friends! We were right at home with the chirping chickadees who also greeted us upon arrival.The  house is a red wood ark with Japanese flavors nestled in a leafy bird sanctuary. Lars immediately steered us
to a lovely exploration of the Fremont area with simple driving directions and a\lovely dinner at Vios A local eatery within walking distance.  The neighborhoodis low key and residential,  about a mile from the University area and Greenwood Park. In the morning  we chatted with Lars for nearly and hour and a half --he
so kindly gave us the fixings for breakfast and the use of his kitchen.  Unusual artwork graces the walls and there are lovely touches like handmade soaps in the bathroom and a shoji screen in the sleeping/ living area. We will definitely
stay in touch with Lars as we connected with him genuinely.  if you are looking for a unique space, with a kind exuberant host this is he place for you."
52370	7483750	9.0	9.0	44035743	"Serene neighbourhood, just a short drive away from dt Seattle. The host, Lars, was welcoming and friendly. Showed us around the place and had guidebooks and suggestions on what to visit. 

The airbnb room is just like the photos situated in a quaint, rustic house with lots of nature around. There's a private entrance to the private room and bathroom. We only stayed for one night so we didn't used the kitchen nor laundry facilities. However, they were there. Only downside is that the water pressure in the shower was very, very low. "
52371	7483750	9.0	9.0	44496787	We had a great stay in Ravenna! Lars was a lovely host who even picked us up from the bus stop. We came without a car and it was a direct ride from downtown with public transport but a bit slow. The area itself Ravenna/Green Lake was lovely. The house itself was great, maybe even prettier than in the photos, with a beautiful view of the mini forest around it and lots of birds! A great bath, a shelf of nice books to read, herbal teas to drink, a private entrance and quite spacious. Lars was gracious about us coming with 2 kids, we brought our own travels cots and bedclothes for them. We would look forward to staying there again.
52372	7483750	9.0	9.0	44740817	The room had a nice feel and was perfect for our night in Seattle. We walked to a great Thai restaurant and icecream store not far from the room. Lars gave us a great recommendation on the neighborhood Greek restaurant/book store and pub. 
52373	7483750	9.0	9.0	44835675	We had an exceptional experience.  Lars is a very warm and friendly host, and clearly invested time in making us feel welcome, from leaving tea for our arrival to offering access to his laundry room.  A delight!
52374	7483750	9.0	9.0	45292057	everything was smooth. i really enjoyed our  little private space while we were in Seattle. Lars was kind and The room was nice too! it has its private entry and is hidden in the trees so that people cant see you from outside. 
52375	7483750	9.0	9.0	45537250	Lars was so quick to respond to my request and very accommodating to our needs. I reserved from out of town for my son who was in town and Lars contacted him and set up the check in almost immediately. The room was just as advertised and was a great respite from the city while still convenient for everything. Really great price for the quality of the place and the level of service.
52376	7483750	9.0	9.0	45828747	Lars is a happy, go lucky guy and staying at his place was easy and worked out well.  The had character and for our brief stay didn't need to be anything spectacular but it was a nice, quiet respite from the day.  Very private and treed in (like Lars said it would be) so somewhat challenging to find at night but he was easy to get a hold of and even had some light drinks and apples in the room.  Parking was on the street but a nice neighborhood and quiet.  Shower/bath was cute.
52377	7483750	9.0	9.0	46066422	Lars owns a very nice cottage tucked in behind many trees. It's full of character and charm. Although connected to the main house, it is very quiet and private. Lars was very attentive and courteous and I could highly recommend his spot. 
52378	7483750	9.0	9.0	46510624	The space was exactly as described.  Our first time in Seattle, my wife and I enjoyed staying here in a nice neighborhood experiencing life as a local.  The room was comfortable, we didn't need any a/c and the bathroom was nice and clean.  This was our first Airbnb experience and we will do again.  If ever in Seattle we would certainly consider Lars again.  
52379	7483750	9.0	9.0	46833066	Wonderful place. Loved the restful rad of the place.  highly recommend
52380	7483750	9.0	9.0	47230982	"Lars is a really nice host, very welcoming, very interested in discussing with his guests. On the arrival in the morning, he showed us everything we needed to know in the house (except which plates, pans, etc. we could use in the kitchen as his flatmate Alla also lives in the house and has her own things). Later in the afternoon, Lars came back and we discussed about history, present politics, life in Seattle and London and Paris, so we had an interesting talk!
The room is really nice and you do feel at home with some tea, mugs, plates etc and a kettle. The bed is comfortable. It doesn뗪 feel at all like being in a big city given the room is surrounded by trees (and perhaps a spider or two, but mainly birds :-) ).
One downside: the pressure of the shower is really really low, which is a shame because the bathroom is amazingly beautiful.
"
52381	7483750	9.0	9.0	47449784	Very much enjoyed the room. Lars was a great host!! 
52382	7483750	9.0	9.0	47584598	Lar's was great. He was attentive, and on-top of all our communication. Although I never met Lar's in person, he made sure we felt welcome. The place was indeed in a small forest on the corner of an urban setting. It was warm, cozy, and a great place to stay. 
52383	7483750	9.0	9.0	47829664	The room is much larger than advertised.  There is plenty of sunlight.  The entrance is secluded but easily accessed.  There is plenty of parking available.  Lars is a great host.  He welcome me warmly and showed me where everything was.  I would not hesitate to stay there again.
52384	7483750	9.0	9.0	48336840	This is my first time using Airbnb and was excellent. Lars our host welcomed us and gave us a tour of the room and the kitchen.  The house is pretty much a forest! The neighborhood is super quiet and there are excellent restaurants and pubs a few blocks away. Lars is a very pleasant gentleman and made us feel like home. His two dogs are a blast too! The bed was comfy and overall is a very nice area if you need a quiet restful night.
52385	7483750	9.0	9.0	48921005	My experience staying at Lars' place is amazing! He's so nice and kind. The room looks even better in person than in the photos. I would definitely book the place again in the future.
52386	7483750	9.0	9.0	49245248	Lars is such a great host! He made us feel really comfortable and right at home. The room looks even better in person. Everything about the place is just great. It's so close to UoW. The view and the trees surrounding the house is incredible. Will definitely come back when we visit Seattle again.
52387	7483750	9.0	9.0	49692320	The house and neighborhood were beautiful! This place really is a pleasant little forest gets away in the middle of the city (we saw so many birds and critters just sitting on the porch). Lars was very polite and helpful and we loved our stay! 
52388	7483750	9.0	9.0	49963996	Lars was a great host. The place is really great feels like a cottage in the woods but in city. Was very clean and private. Thanks for a great stay.
52389	7483750	9.0	9.0	52032574	Very friendly host!
52390	7483750	9.0	9.0	52463388	Lars' place was very nice and felt like a home inside a forest, surrounded by trees.  He greeted me that evening to ensure that everything was ok and that I had what I needed.  Communication was great as well.  I liked the private entrance to the room and it had an attached bathroom.  Both were clean and the home was quiet.  Lots of space too!  I would stay again.  Thanks!
52391	7483750	9.0	9.0	52635562	Lars was a very inviting host. he met me at the door and gave me the run down of where everything was. The neighborhood was quiet, it was the perfect wilderness getaway. I will stay here on my next visit! Communication was speedy and concise.
52392	7483750	9.0	9.0	53030470	The neighborhood is very quiet, and has fast access to highways. If you are new to Seattle, Lars has prepared ample resources such as guide books for you as references. The room is well-equipped, and there is a Japanese folding screen to block the french window if you need extra privacy.
52393	7483750	9.0	9.0	53500673	Despite the cautions, I had no trouble finding Lar's home.  It is, indeed, surrounded by trees and bird feeders.  The whole neighborhood, which is a lovely residential area, is filled with all kinds of flora.  It is a short walk to cafes, restaurants and a grocery store. The room was as pictured and included coffee/tea provisions, snacks and shampoo.  Lars provided a fan, a heater and a screen for the window.  The bed was very comfortable and the linens are good quality. He was welcoming, cheerful, and efficient. I thought I had locked myself out one night and, he was completely relaxed about it.  I may return to Seattle on occassion and, I will stay at Lar's place again.
52394	7483750	9.0	9.0	53723938	Lars greeted us warmly, the list was accurate, good location to the UW, safe neighborhood.
52395	7483750	9.0	9.0	54211745	"Lars was very friendly and gave me lots of good ideas to get started, based on what I was interested in.  He was willing to spend the time to get me oriented on the first day, and he didn't bother me after that :)  Exactly what I was looking for.

The place itself was just as advertised.  The bathroom was especially well-crafted and interesting (in a good way).  I would absolutely stay here again."
52396	7483750	9.0	9.0	54472734	Lars' house was a lovely place to stay. Our interaction was short but he was friendly and kind. He recommended a great place to grab food as we arrived late and hungry. I would definitely stay here again if given the chance. 
52397	7483750	9.0	9.0	54544280	We were welcomed by our sweet host...Lars is very accommodating. The room is clean, comfortable and spacious. We also liked how private the room is. We will be back!
52398	7483750	9.0	9.0	54670440	Lars was a very nice host and gave us a lot of information about the location in advance so we found the neighborhood exactly. The room is spacious and  cozy, great location and but quiet at night, good for rest. We'll be back again.
52399	7483750	9.0	9.0	54808484	Lars is a good host, friendly and thoughtful. The cottage is nice and spacious, with pretty wood paneling, a lovely picture window and sweet art. I found the bed a little too firm for my tastes, but enjoyed the big bath tub with it's attractive blue tiling. We couldn't get the little heater working and so were a bit chilly until we warmed up happily in the bath. The location is excellent, with great cafes and restaurants and Third Place Books very close by.
52400	7483750	9.0	9.0	54950670	Lars was a perfect host! The room is spacious and comfortable! He even provides a microwave and small fridge! iT is a sweet neighborhood and I felt right at home! Lars showed me around the neighborhood and even picked me up when I got lost getting there by public transit. Highly recommend!
52401	7483750	9.0	9.0	55319222	Wonderful place to stay! Lars was very welcoming and very flexible about check in time which was very appreciated because of our late arrival. The room was private and had everything you could need and more. Great location. Would definitely return and strongly recommend! 
52402	7483750	9.0	9.0	55705340	Beautiful space, very comfy and warm. Quiet and peaceful neighbourhood that's still within walking distance of the main university strip. Lars really makes you feel at home and is can tell you anything you want to know about what to see/do in Seattle.
52403	7483750	9.0	9.0	55814158	"Lars house was great and cozy! I really like his house. While we stayed he help us as much as he can. And it was very helpful.
His dog is very friendly and lovely!
I really want to stay there again.

52404	7483750	9.0	9.0	55956832	As always, Lars was so welcoming! The room was clean and delicious chocolates were sitting on my pillows. I left and item in the room on my first visit a month ago and Lars remembered and brought it to me...I had forgotten. He is an excellent host. 
52405	7483750	9.0	9.0	56053071	Lars was very kind and helpful when I called a couple of days prior to our arrival with some wrinkles involving our ground transportation.  He gave us detailed directions on how we could find his place using public transportation. The room was warm and inviting with added niceties like a welcome chocolate on our towels and complimentary beverages in a small fridge.   
52406	7483750	9.0	9.0	56290302	Lars has a beautiful home in a very private yard. The foliage and wildlife around his place adds a lot of peace to the experience. The bathroom was lovely, the bed was comfortable and clean. We had a great time and a great host!
52407	7483750	9.0	9.0	56353044	Lars was a great host. Very positive stay! (:
52408	7483750	9.0	9.0	56570034	Lovely little neighborhood and lovely room! The bathroom was beautiful, thank you for the heater and the hospitality. Would love to stay here again. Thank you!
52409	7483750	9.0	9.0	56818576	"Lars's room is wonderful, the pictures don't do it justice.  It's a beautiful tranquil little oasis and a great home base from which to explore Seattle's northern neighborhoods.   The room comes with a mini-fridge, a microwave and a full set of silverware which is really handy for making small lunches.  And the bath is delightfully cute.

The neighborhood is a little tucked away but you're a 15 minute walk from Whole Foods and it's a 10 minute walk from two of Seattle's most-talked about new restaurants which is kind of interesting for such a residential neighborhood.

All in all, a wonderful place.  "
52410	7483750	9.0	9.0	57126304	Best Airbnb I've ever had! Lars' place is the perfect getaway. It's a very nice & quiet neighborhood. My friends & I used Lyft & Uber to get back & forth from downtown -- it was very convenient & not pricey (Tip: if you have a Lyft account & you're vacationing with a friend who doesn't, invite your friend to download the app -- you get a $30 credit after their first ride, & the other person gets FIVE free rides up to $10. That's how we got around for a very cheap price). Overall, Lars' place was very homey. The room was just as described -- very spacious, cute picture window, the bathroom was beautiful, lots of storage. Looking forward to staying here again!
52411	7483750	9.0	9.0	57269152	nice host, nice room!
52412	7483750	9.0	9.0	58008494	"I very much enjoyed my stay at Lars' place.  It is so quiet and peaceful!
Bed is comfortable and hot water in bathroom is immediate!  Lots of closet and drawer space as well.  
As I came to visit family who live close by, I didn't spend any  real time in the room except for sleeping so it was perfect for my needs.
Lars welcomed me and showed me where everything is located.
I'm glad I brought my eye mask since the large picture window has no curtains and 1 shoji screen is not enough -- another one would be useful for more privacy.  
Thank you, Lars!"
53639	3206305	10.0	9.0	14142202	"Dana and Jack responded very quickly to my request on what amounted to be a very busy day in the Seattle area for Airbnb and traditional hotels. They were flexible and provided me with multiple options for picking up the keys on what was a hectic day for me during a short 24-hour visit. When I met them at the house, they couldn't have been nicer - and the words 'as advertised' don't begin to appropriately sum up the experience! It truly is a garden oasis, and you get an incredible view whether lounging outside on one of the many pieces of comfortable outdoor furniture or inside looking out large windows at the picturesque environment. 

The apartment itself had everything you could possible need. I loved the organic soaps, ample supply of bath towels, and even some freshly ground coffee for the extra touch. The living room had more kinds of entertainment than I ever could have hoped to use in the few short hours I spent here - but I will definitely be hoping for availability on my next trip when I may get to spend more time in this relaxing environment.

Location-wise, you are secluded from the city center, but even during rush hour in the evening and morning it took only about 20 minutes to get door-to-door with my office downtown. Also, a 10-minute car ride will get you to beautiful Alki Beach, where I trekked for an evening walk along the sound at sunset.

Even the wifi is strong enough that you cna take your laptop out to the patio, if you must email, and do so in peace and solitude.

Really enjoyed this stay (and bonus for me that I'm told I was their first guest!) - they knocked it out of the park with this place! Would stay again for sure."
53640	3206305	10.0	9.0	14216329	My interaction with Dana and Jack was brief but lovely. They seem to be great people that are running a fantastic little airbnb suite in their back yard. The suite was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable. The space is peaceful and tranquil. You'd never know that it's within a city....I had a fantastic sleep there. 
53641	3206305	10.0	9.0	14754807	"Great (and very safe) accommodations! This place was wonderful. Living Room, Kitchen, Bath and Bedroom. All the comforts of home! If I would have known all of the items that would have been available to us I would have packed less. Seriously. Gas stove, full sized fridge, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, towels, shaving gel, wow! This place was like staying at my house on vacation.

Jack and Dana were fabulous! They gave us great restaurant recommendations and were super friendly. We even hung out with them by the fire one night. It was fun guys!

Among my favorite restaurants were Pearls Tea and Coffee (great coffee and quick breakfast), Bakery Nouveau (go here, we did, 2 or 3 times), Elliot Bay Brewery and Pub (awesome beer and burgers), Bar del Corso (amazing pizza and desert), and The Walrus and the Carpenter (holy wow yum tasting menu, a must visit, we went with our 7 month old and she did great!).

This location is also great. It feels like you're out of the city completely, but downtown and restaurants are super close. Very nice."
53642	3206305	10.0	9.0	14894766	"Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Dana, Jack or Nolan, but the communication was fantastic and they had everything ready for me.  This place was exactly what it should be, quiet, tranquil but close enough to the city to enjoy it. 

I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in the area!
"
53643	3206305	10.0	9.0	14994906	"Our stay with Dana, Jack, and Nolan was great!  The space was lovely and clean, with a very comfortable bed and nice bedding, and they have an amazing back yard.  Everything we needed for morning coffee was provided, and there were nice toiletries stocked.

Communication was excellent -- they were very friendly and responsive.  If we find ourselves in need of a place to stay in West Seattle, we will not hesitate to book again.  Overall, it was a really good experience.  Thanks!"
53644	3206305	10.0	9.0	15341347	We couldn't have asked for better hosts! Dana and Jack were always helpful and friendly and even let us borrow their BBQ! We loved our stay in our cosy granny flat, the listing was exactly as described. The house was in a fairly good location, pretty close to two bus stops that get you into the city in about 10-15 mins. The public transport in Seattle was fairly difficult for us to navigate so next time we'd rent a car. Overall, we loved staying with Jack and Dana. We'll definitely be back if we head to Seattle again.

53646	3206305	10.0	9.0	15776931	Garden Oasis is truly what this place is! My parents came to Seattle for a visit and this was right down the street from my apartment. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Short bus ride to the downtown area and two main bus lines run one block from here. Such a beautiful garden/patio area with great hosts! Such friendly and nice people. The apartment was very clean, comfortable and had everything just perfect. Defiantly would recommend staying here!
53647	3206305	10.0	9.0	16137285	"We planned to check in early, Dana and Jack did their outermost to make it possible. We came much later (after midnight) that we planned, but they are still very friendly in their responses. All information are clear, so we could find the key quickly.

As we stay only for one night, we did not see and experience much at the apartment. But I was glad, we made this reservation."
53648	3206305	10.0	9.0	16479020	"Dana and Jack were very welcoming and helpful.  They were always quick to respond to questions and to offer suggestions when asked.  They even brought a plate of fresh cherries to the room when we arrived! Their place was very clean and well-equipped. The ""Garden Oasis"" was accurately described-- I wish I had more time to spend just hanging out in the gardens!
I would highly recommend Dana and Jack's place to any one visiting the area.  West Seattle is very accessible with interesting shops and restaurants. Going into downtown Seattle is not bad, but if traveling during rush hour, allow a bit more time.  I would definitely return to the Greenbelt Garden Oasis!"
53649	3206305	10.0	9.0	17055634	I feel like we hit the jackpot with our first airbnb experience! Dana, Jack and Nolan were very welcoming and made us feel right at home, I don't think we'll ever use a hotel again. Greenbelt Garden Oasis was just that, it felt secluded from the city but was still a perfect location for us. They responded quickly and were always available to any questions. It was a quick drive to many of the destinations we  planned in and around Seattle. Our family of three had plenty of space and more amenities then we could fit in to our stay. Our hosts gave us many suggestions of local food, beer and activities. Not only were  the accommodations awesome but so were the host, it was nice to get a chance to talk with Dana and Jack and spend a few evenings enjoying the garden and even a fire in their outdoor fire place. The kitchen is fully equipped with just about every utensil you would need to make a dinner.  Overall, it was an awesome experience; we hope a return trip to Seattle will include a stay Greenbelt Garden Oasis!
53650	3206305	10.0	9.0	17138660	"Wow!  A beautiful garden and lovely hosts.  They accommodated our special needs and were very patient with my lack of technology skills throughout the process. 
Jack and Dana made themselves available for questions when we arrived and the apartment was full of games/books/dvds for entertainment.  We were on a quick trip so there was no time to take advantage of all they had to offer.  
This is a special place made extra special with attention to detail and kindness."
53651	3206305	10.0	9.0	17165622	Our stay at Dana and Jack's place was fantastic. Our visit was brief but was comfortable, easy to coordinate and largely enjoyable. The garden is beautiful; full of fresh herbs and veges, the cats are super friendly and the apartment itself is clean and spacious. We only met Dana briefly but she was lovely and easy to communicate with the whole time. I'd definitely recommend a stay at Dana and Jack's.
53652	3206305	10.0	9.0	18310976	We had a fantastic time staying at this spot.  The hosts made us feel right at home immediately and it was exactly as described.  From the gorgeous large back yard to the great location that is minutes drive from great restaurants, alki beach and a nice park.  Highly recommend this location.
53653	3206305	10.0	9.0	18548005	"We were over the moon with the location and the property was just as descried on the web site. Dana and Jack were really nice and friendly and provided us with lots of local knowledge on where to visit and the best places to eat.

We had a great stay, and can highly recommend this location  "
53654	3206305	10.0	9.0	18887125	In our travels we have experienced many different types of accommodations, and our stay in West Seattle with Dana and Jack truly stands out as one of the most enjoyable and relaxing.  The Airbnb description was accurate, the place was everything we expected it to be and much more.  Dana was a perfect host; very accommodating, extremely responsive, thoughtful and generous, but she also gave us ample privacy.  The backyard was lovely and picturesque. We stayed on Labor Day and the garden was full of basil, tomatoes, peppers, beans, cucumbers, strawberries and many beautiful flowers.  It felt very secluded from the road and we appreciated starting our days with breakfast at various spots throughout the garden, which is directly outside the apartment door.  The apartment itself had everything we wanted.  It was quiet and VERY clean , we both slept great and did not want for anything.  The location also provides easy access to downtown Seattle with a car and, although we never quite got around to it, there are buses nearby.  We found grocery shopping and dining options to be a short drive away (and Dana offers many great suggestions for various spots to try).  Although we did not have much chance to meet Jack, Dana was fascinating and truly a kind and wonderful person.  Needless to say, I highly recommend this spot.  
53655	3206305	10.0	9.0	19130385	Wonderful hosts. We had a great stay. The house was perfect - had everything we needed, was clean, quiet and nicely laid out. The garden was amazing too. Thanks so much for a great intro to Seattle. Also loved the West Seattle neighborhood.
53656	3206305	10.0	9.0	19302852	We really enjoyed our stay with Jack and Dana. At first we weren't sure what to expect seeing as how this was our first time using air BandB but they made us feel comfortable throughout our stay. The apartment beautifully decorated. The kitchen had all the cooking utensils you may need.  The garden was  my favorite. It's a beautiful setting to eat breakfast or finish off your day with a glass of wine. She also left a list of restaurant and bar recommendations which was very useful. They also made themselves available as needed. Another important factor for us was that it was just a short drive to downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking to stay in Seattle without staying in the hectic downtown area. 
53657	3206305	10.0	9.0	19497394	We were warmly greeted by our hosts.  They were very gracious and welcoming.  The proximity to the city was amazing.  Three minutes over the West Seattle bridge and we were downtown.  The stadiums were right there as well.  We couldn't have been happier.
53658	3206305	10.0	9.0	19633333	Wow! we had a great time a Dana and Jack place! Everything was as described.  We enjoyed having a nice evening in the garden (Charcoal BBQ, Fire , music!).   Good communication , fast answers,  and super friendly.  We will recommend to our friends... Merci!
53659	3206305	10.0	9.0	19977426	It really is an Oasis, and Dana, Jack and Nolan (when around), made us feel part of the family, while leaving our privacy. Close to everything in Seattle (if you dont mind 5-20 minute drives), this serene place is perfect to just stay in the whole day and enjoy the quiet surroundings and beautifully kept garden. It was one of the highlight stays of our trip, not least due to the hosts. Would definitely come back!
53660	3206305	10.0	9.0	20094008	Our experiance was amazing we booked this place for the night of our wedding it was great! They even spread rose pedals down the stairs for me upon request it was clean had fresh towels and everything would highly recommend this place! !
53661	3206305	10.0	9.0	20470738	Absolutely wonderful experience. The space and the hosts could not have been better. It is airbnb experiences like this that make it so great. Thanks Dana and Jack!
53662	3206305	10.0	9.0	20740216	This is the 2nd time I've booked Dana and Jacks apartment. It's great! Couldn't ask for a better experience or people have as a host. I will be using this place again in the future! The garden is so beautiful all year round.
53663	3206305	10.0	9.0	21728718	We loved our stay in Dana, Jack and Nolan's apartment! The place was very cozy and their garden oasis is lovely. They left fresh ground coffee, tea, creamer, shampoo, etc. for us, and Dana was very responsive and easy to reach. We would definitely stay here again!
53664	3206305	10.0	9.0	22663501	"The apartment is wonderful. Three of us stayed there for a girls weekend in Seattle. Make sure you take Uber or have a rental car of some sort. We had beautiful weather so we could walk, but I think if you were there during rain you would probably not want to walk to the bus. 

Dana and her family were absolutely wonderful! Highly recommend "
53665	3206305	10.0	9.0	23370353	We had a great stay at Dana and Jack's guesthouse. Super comfortable and well-appointed, and we were able to easily do some of our Thanksgiving prep in the kitchen. 
53666	3206305	10.0	9.0	24561950	We had a wonderful stay. Everything was clean and comfortable. We hope to stay with Dana, Jack, and Nolan again next time we go to Seattle.
53667	3206305	10.0	9.0	25558961	This was the perfect place - plenty of room, nice and private, and well-equipped with all the ammenities needed (kitchen, bath, tv, cable, games!). I felt very welcome and had all the information I needed on arrival - as well as a nice packet left by my hosts on the area (restaurants and stores). The apartment was quiet and clean, and I would stay here again in a second :)
53668	3206305	10.0	9.0	26665392	Wonderful rental! Absolutely everything we were needed and hoped for. Great location. Clean. Very helpful and warm hosts that made our stay a complete pleasure. Will definitely look to stay here again. 
53669	3206305	10.0	9.0	27039643	This was a great stay.  Dana was prompt in responding and made some great recommendations for dining/places to visit in the area.  The apt itself was everything I could have asked for. A very cool space, clean, and a good location.  The garden and backyard were especially unique.  My only regret is I wish I could have stayed longer!
53670	3206305	10.0	9.0	27671254	This was our second stay with Dana, Jack, and Nolan.  It was great!  The apartment is well furnished, with a full kitchen and very comfortable bed, and there is a beautiful back yard.  Checking in and out was a breeze, and they are always very responsive.  We will for sure book again any time we are looking to stay in West Seattle.  Thank you!
53671	3206305	10.0	9.0	28050629	"Great stay! Exactly as described. We were made to feel welcome and the back yard is beautiful.
The location is convenient to West Seattle and downtown. 
The fresh eggs when we got there were a nice added touch. 
We'll definitely be back!"
53672	3206305	10.0	9.0	28429280	"
They have a really cute place and if it was not raining we would have definitely enjoyed an outdoors fire. The organic eggs and oatmeal were a nice touch! The bedroom and living room/kitchen are in separate spaces (upstairs and downstairs) but there is no door between them, which can be nice if you have a child you are putting to bed early. We had a little bit of a misunderstanding during our stay, regarding a broken toilet seat. We had not done anything out of the ordinary with the seat, but learned that it had broken during out stay. The communication with the hosts regarding the broken toilet seat was very professional and everything was sorted out. My husband also left his shaving kit and they were really good about sending it to us. This place is close to a lot of sights. This is a great place to stay and would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle."
53673	3206305	10.0	9.0	30214723	" I cannot say enough good things about Dana and Jack and their accommodations and them as people.

I stayed with them for an extended period  of time/few weeks,  until I found a place to live in Seattle as I relocated for a new job.    They are truly awesome people,  so friendly,  and the place was cozy, comfortable, private, and they were so responsive to any questions I had  or whatever came up.  I really love their backyard garden oasis, so nice to wake up to or just hang out in, and of course they have two awesome cats who are just are total love bugs, Lizzie and Token.

 I don't want to ramble on too much, as there is of course a limitation on the number of words you can type, but I highly recommend Dana and Jack and their place to anyone who may be lucky enough to come across it if it is  available for a stay.    You will not regret it and I don't think you will be left wanting for much of anything either.

Thank you so very much Dana and Jack, I truly enjoyed myself and am happy to of made new friends as well. "
53674	3206305	10.0	9.0	33293794	The neighborhood is nice and quiet. I love the garden and the house very much. The place is clean and is exactly what Dana described online. I would recommend this place if you travel to seattle! 
53675	3206305	10.0	9.0	34150935	Really friendly host and a nice little guesthouse. Liked that we were easily able to get in/out privately.
53676	3206305	10.0	9.0	35103970	Great apartment! My mom and I had a great time staying here. Everything was just as pictured and described, including the backyard which was super nice and very pretty.  Definitely recommend.
53677	3206305	10.0	9.0	35320299	The apartment was located on a hill, the scenery is perfect. And we like the organic coffee and eggs a lot. 
53678	3206305	10.0	9.0	35459800	Thank you three for your kind hospitality! Your place was a great introduction to the NW for especially my Texan cousin, definitely set the tone for a laid back adventure!
53679	3206305	10.0	9.0	36022516	Dana and the gang were fantastic. Very welcoming and even left coffee and fresh eggs in the fridge for us!! We extremely enjoied our stay and the listing was extremely accurate in every way. I would definitely go back on my next visit to Seattle!
53680	3206305	10.0	9.0	37460665	"CONS: 
The hosts were very offensive, we completely felt unsafe. 
- they shouted at us when issue happen instead of sit down and discuss how to resolve. 
- they entered the guest's room without notice.  I challenged them why they do this, they said this is their house.   They take 'messy' private pictures.  They don't respect privacy. 
- they kept messaging us not doing this and that, They are monitoring us. 
- 1 day before we leave, they msg us ' you need to clean the apartment today'.  It looks like they want to drive us out. 

We can't afford monitor the 4 years old kid all the times, we told the host we have a kid and they didn't provide a kid-freiend environment.  We paid $200 for the broken window, although there is no prove that my kid broke it.  

The air mattress didn't work at all when we arrived, and I end up slept on the Sofa which was not suitable for a man and very closed to the noisy refigerator, and almost didn't sleep.  

In general I'm really scared by the hosts.  We want Service, privacy, and safety these basic things, but we got nothing. 

The windows sheding is weak, the Sun wake you up at 5am. 
The noise is a bit loud.  We constantly heard steam-whistle and planes even at nights. The hosts asked us to use an air fan to mitigate the noise. 

PROS:
- the garden is beautiful
- the kitchen is very useful and well equipped. 
- close to the airport.

53681	3206305	10.0	9.0	37869346	"The descriptive ""Garden Oasis in the City"" could not be more apropos. A definite respite from the hustle and bustle of Seattle and its parking hassles, the super convenient location in West Seattle is beautiful, restful and well placed. Beside the wonderful hosts, you may also spot butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds, plus a couple of cats. Speaking of those hosts, Dana, Jack & Nolan are most gracious and hospitable. Besides helping us use/discover Uber, offering her secret parking place for the Mariners game, and printing our boarding pass after we had to change a reservation, Dana has created a sublime paradise in the backyard, which must be seen to be appreciated. If we are ever fortunate to return to Seattle, we know where we'll be staying. "
53682	3206305	10.0	9.0	38496941	Jack and Dana were very accommodating to me and my friends on our visit to Seattle. The apartment was very cute and clean. It had everything we needed, including lots of info on things to do in the city. We really enjoyed our stay here :)
53683	3206305	10.0	9.0	39542475	My husband and I were hoping to find a quiet oasis to spend a few nights exploring Seattle and away from the hustle and bustle of home. We DEFINITELY found it here! Dana and Jack greeted us when we arrived and comfortably let us know that we were free to utilize their luxurious garden! There was a fully furnished kitchen, fresh eggs in the fridge, and an incredibly cozy bed in the bedroom. Our choice to stay at the West Seattle Greenbelt Garden Oasis, as opposed to a hotel in Seattle, was the best decision we made for our 5-year anniversary trip! We could not have been happier with our experience! Thank you Dana and Jack! :) 
53684	3206305	10.0	9.0	39762059	This is a fantastic option in Seattle that we would highly recommend.  Everything exactly as advertised, and delivered flawlessly.  We couldn't have been any more pleased.
53685	3206305	10.0	9.0	40118507	Dana was very flexible with our check-in time and accommodated our need as fast as she can. The garden is so pretty, esp when its sunny in Seattle.
53686	3206305	10.0	9.0	40385864	Dana's guest home was absolutely beautiful, and we really appreciated that the kitchen was stocked so that we could make breakfast!  Everything was extremely clean and well organized, and the garden was beautiful.  Dana was very friendly and accommodating.  I hope to stay here again whenever I revisit Seattle!
53687	3206305	10.0	9.0	41337684	The listing was just as described . Check in and check out was super easy. Also, we appreciated the complimentary coffee, eggs, and brews in the refrigerator as it was very thoughtful of the hosts to do so. I would say the listing is probably best suited for two people as opposed to three, but its very do-able in a pinch. 
53688	3206305	10.0	9.0	42035570	"This perfect little apartment is tucked away behind Dana and Jack's home, accessible via a path that goes around the house and edges their beautiful garden.  The friend who I stayed here with and I had a super busy Seattle weekend and having a space that was quiet and we knew we wouldn't be bothering anyone by coming and going was absolutely ideal.  

The space is perfect for two people.  We didn't spend too much hanging out time there because we had so much going on.  But when we were there we were so comfortable and felt like we could treat it as our very own space.  The split level made it easier for us to get ready in the mornings without being in each others way.  

Towels, cream, coffee, tea and a million other things were provided if needed.  We were so thankful for such thoughtful and easygoing hosts.  The car we rented had tricky headlights and I had left them on and Jack came over to let us know and introduced himself.  AND, my friend accidentally forgot her earrings and Dana was kind enough to get in touch with me and mail them up to Alaska for us.  

Our Seattle weekend was made perfect very much thanks to this great, easy space.  I would (and will) recommend it to anyone looking for a perfect space for a Seattle weekend for two."
53689	3206305	10.0	9.0	42858095	"After the craziness of wedding planning, I knew my husband and I would want a relaxing, cozy, and welcoming environment for our honeymoon in Seattle. When we came across Dana's listing, we were thrilled. 

The price was just right, the location was perfect (the best spot to come home to after a day in the city), and Dana and her family seemed very inviting.

When we arrived, they had left champagne and fresh blackberries and cherries in the fridge for us, and there was beautiful bouquet of flowers on the table. The kitchen was equipped with all the basics plus a little more, and I can't tell you how nice it was knowing that eggs, oatmeal, and coffee would be available for us in the morning. 

We enjoyed our stay a LOT. Dana is quick with responses and is the type of host who will go the extra mile to make you comfortable. The privacy was also nice, but I made sure to meet her before leaving and it was a pleasure. They really have a knack for this process, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
53690	3206305	10.0	9.0	43720237	Easy to get to from the airport (with a car), clean private apartment in a beautiful garden. It was a pleasant and convenient stay with welcoming hosts! Thank you for having me!
53691	3206305	10.0	9.0	44051578	Our stay here was very nice. It was clean and well stocked especially if you are interested in using the kitchen. They were thoughtful in the information they left for us about great local places and the garden view was nice. I would recommend this place.
53692	3206305	10.0	9.0	44558567	"This was my first experience using airbnb and was extremely pleased with my stay with Dana and Jack.  They are such gracious hosts with an eye for every little detail that makes you feel at home.

The bed is extremely comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked that you can cook all your meals in a day!  You also get to enjoy a rare perk of picking fresh vegetables and herbs from Dana's well maintained garden!!

The stay was so pleasant and comfortable that from now on, my every visit to Seattle will find me requesting to stay at their place!!"
53693	3206305	10.0	9.0	45519677	"This was the loveliest of little getaways in West Seattle. The place has all the necessities for a comfortable stay and Dana takes extra special care of her guests by providing eggs, teas, and cream. She and Jack were great hosts: communication was quick, directions on how to get into the house were easy, and Dana even lets you eat from her garden! 

Being in West Seattle for work, this place was the perfect location and I would definitely stay again if given the chance!  "
53694	3206305	10.0	9.0	46906324	Jack and Dana were fantastic hosts.  The apartment was perfect with everything you could possibly need and the yard was beautiful.  Jack even helped us jump our car when the battery died.  Really great ABnB experience!
53695	3206305	10.0	9.0	48951102	What a great place to stay! Dana, Jack, and Nolan are very nice. The house is very peaceful and quiet, and exactly what we needed for a relaxing vacation.  I would absolutely stay there again. 
53696	3206305	10.0	9.0	49027582	"Small but very cute.  Would have preferred a little more seclusion but the owners were very friendly and respected our privacy.  We were at the tail end of our trip so we were looking to just relax and the apartment worked out just great.

Beautiful yard!  Lizzie was also very sweet and friendly.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking to get away from the city. "
59643	4082250	6.0	9.0	20459925	In capitol hill, it can be hard to find a quiet place to rest after a day of work or play, but this place managed to be incredibly walkable, yet still peaceful.  Thank you for a relaxing long weekend! Lovely!
59644	4082250	6.0	9.0	38454157	Good location - Capital Hill is a great area.  Apartment was not as clean as we are comfortable with - we appreciate that the host split the cost with us to get the place cleaned while we were there.
59645	4082250	6.0	9.0	39209838	Wesley's place is in a great location on the hill and close to downtown. Communication was easy and he arranged to have his friend meet me at the apartment and let me in. I feel like the towels and bed linen quality could be improved but overall I had a great stay. 
64213	7714585	10.0	9.0	45144269	"It was the best airbnb experience I've ever had! Sabrina was a such a wonderful host. The place matches the pictures (looks even better in person). The neighborhood was quiet and easy to find parking just outside the house. There are restaurants and cafes nearby as well.  

The home decor is artistic and absolutely beautiful. Sabrina was very thoughtful that she put notes everywhere in the house to give us kind reminders. (e.g where to find a working outlet, where is coffee, wifi code...etc) All the shower essentials are provided including a makeup remover! She even gave us postcards WITH STAMPS to send home. 

Say no more! I HIGHLY recommended to stay at Sabrina's! Feels just home :)"
64214	7714585	10.0	9.0	46005787	Sabrina's house was great for our long weekend in Seattle. Very accurate listing and cute neighborhood. We found it easy to get around without any trouble due to being close to public transit and using ubers. Very cute home and has all the essentials and more (loved the stamped postcards and treats!). Sabrina was out most of the weekend, but we still felt welcome and at home! Thanks Sabrina!
64215	7714585	10.0	9.0	47290268	Sabrina's house is the most nice house I have been.The house is very beautiful and cute.Sabrina writes some notes make me warm.If I will come back Seattle,I will come back here.
64216	7714585	10.0	9.0	47794363	Great place with many unique touches that made us feel welcome. It's also within walking distance to cafes and the Ballard street market. Sabrina was a great host.
64217	7714585	10.0	9.0	48536395	Sabrina was a gracious host. Her house was clean, warm, inviting and beautifully decorated. Sabrina let us check in early and responded to all our questions quickly. We had a great visit thanks to Sabrina. 
64218	7714585	10.0	9.0	50784195	What a wonderful experience. Sabrina is a terrific host. She made us feel extremely welcome. The room was exactly what we needed. The postcards and breakfast pizza were added bonuses and very much appreciated. 
64219	7714585	10.0	9.0	51191459	Sabrina welcomed us with a cute note on the front door when we arrived. The room was decorated nicely and the whole house has an amazing, decorative and fun feel to it. I enjoyed the coffee in the morning! Good location close to Ballard area, which we were interested in checking out. Overall a nice stay.
64220	7714585	10.0	9.0	51921307	The description of the house is very accurate. Sabrina was very quick with her communication, and arriving at her house and getting settled was a cinch! She has cute labels throughout the house to help guide guests. The room is in the basement (along with a sitting area and TV for relaxation), and she provides extra blankets but we were warm and cozy. I'm grateful for such a positive first Airbnb experience! 
64221	7714585	10.0	9.0	53219833	Sabrina is an excellent and exceptionally friendly host and I felt warmly welcomed in her home during my stay in Seattle for work. Her home is a uniquely and pleasantly designed interior space, showcasing her creative talents and attention to detail. Not only are the accommodations comfortable, the living space downstairs creates a nice place to relax after a long day in town. Her place is  easily accessible to downtown Seattle via the bus line a half block away that runs every 15 minutes. I look forward to staying at Sabrina's place again!
64222	7714585	10.0	9.0	55215793	Well located a short bus ride to downtown,  and near all sorts of interesting places to explore. Eclectic and interesting decor inside, with a ton of personal touches. The helpful notes throughout the house along with the welcome message on the front door make it friendly and comfortable. The bed suffers from roll together if there are two of you.
67089	6782993	10.0	9.0	35510996	The Host made me feel very welcome...and was incredibly outgoing, caring, and gracious.  The Host also provided me with the necessities of the house in a timely manner. The House is very clean and my room was very comfortable and it had everything I could possibly need for my short stay.    The neighborhood is very safe and beautiful, as the neighborhood was once an apple orchard...so it has a country feel to it.   Furthermore the host knows the area very well and helped me feel right at home in the Seattle area. 
67090	6782993	10.0	9.0	36447077	"This house was a wonderful solution for travelers looking for a room. The bunk beds were comfortable and suitable for a weekend trip. Logan is a terrific host, very kind and friendly. The overall house atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing. This room is located 15 minutes (without traffic) from downtown Seattle. It was ideal for a shopping weekend where we spent our days in the city and came in late at night to sleep in the room. The house was clean and wifi access was extremely useful. Overall, a great experience for 2 sisters taking a weekend shopping trip. This room is recommended for flexible travelers looking for a cheap and reliable sleeping option.
"
67091	6782993	10.0	9.0	37275714	Logan was an excellent host! She is very friendly and accommodating. The home is beautiful and well kept. It was too bad I didn't realize she was a trained chef until it was time to, I would have tried to bribe her to cook sumthin!
67092	6782993	10.0	9.0	38183426	Comfortable, quiet, with soft blankets. This room is just as described, and more when you take Logan into account. She's interesting, fun, talented, and accommodating. I like the little thoughtful touches she offers.
67093	6782993	10.0	9.0	38679425	Very accurate and clean. Logan was very nice to deal with.
67094	6782993	10.0	9.0	39113717	There is a simple word for our stay at Logan's - great! First of all she was incredibly spontaneous taking us in like last minute and from the second we got there we felt very welcome! The room was clean and she provided us with everything we might need! We just stayed for three nights but as far as we can tell Logan is very open-minded, sweet and caring!! Bus Nr. 41 takes you straight downtown and also other destinations were easily reachable! We'd definitely stay there again!!!! 
67095	6782993	10.0	9.0	39470243	Great stay in a comfortable house!
67096	6782993	10.0	9.0	39826644	Logan is welcoming and friendly. The room is simple and convenient. Thank you very much !
67097	6782993	10.0	9.0	40190132	Very straight forward, as advertised. Nice host and clean place. Single bathroom and a door right next to another person, so it's not a private room. Overall positive.
67098	6782993	10.0	9.0	40299748	Super nice host, gracious, and timely in her communications. Nice neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle. I was in and out quickly but I know Logan would have been very helpful with guidance had I requested it. Room and home are as described online. 
67099	6782993	10.0	9.0	40661231	Staying with Logan was wonderful!  She was so welcoming and so sweet.  The bunk beds were totally fine for my friend and I who were just staying there to sleep and using all the time out exploring Seattle.  It did not take long at all to get to downtown Seattle from Logan's place (we did have a car).  We were here for 3 days, and it was a perfect place to crash from our travels.  Thanks Logan!
67100	6782993	10.0	9.0	40872343	"Logan was a very lovely and welcoming lady, she made both of us felt at home. She is also very interesting and we have had a lot of fun talking to her and knowing more about the city. She shows great hospitality and we could say for sure it was one of the best experience.


The room is very clean, comfy and cozy. We had a very good nights sleep. The house was also very tidy and certainly welcoming. The two house cats were also friendly.

The neighbourhood was very quiet and felt safe and secure. There were some nice pubs just down the road with nice breakfast and food."
67101	6782993	10.0	9.0	41981706	Logan was incredible. Our group had some unexpected things happen and she was such a gracious host. Room was excellent, comfortable and functional, and the location was excellent as it was surrounded by shops that were within a short distance. Neighborhood was quiet, and easily accessed! But nothing beats Logan, who was exceedingly helpful and understanding! 
67102	6782993	10.0	9.0	42364078	This was my second time staying at Logan's and the room was great. It's great whether your out on the town or if you are spending the day relaxing inside. The host makes sure that everything is clean and makes sure you have what you need or helps you find it...the room and host made my seattle experience a postive one.
67103	6782993	10.0	9.0	42636108	Nothing but good things to say. Very affordable room with comfy bunk beds. Logan was super friendly and incredibly welcoming.
67104	6782993	10.0	9.0	42752682	"Unfortunately I couldn't make my reservation with Logan at ""Sunny & Simple in Seattle"".  Logan was very understanding & was ready with some fresh fruits for us which I look forward to another time!  Will definitely want to check out Logan's place for my next visit.   Tammy"
67105	6782993	10.0	9.0	44585452	Logan was a fantastic host. Her place is clean, quiet, and cozy. It was perfect for my recent business travel to Seattle. Would definitely recommend Sunny & Simple.
67106	6782993	10.0	9.0	45017214	Logan is a very warm, friendly, and welcoming hostess. The stay was very good. I will be back whenever I visit Seattle! 10/10 definitely!
67107	6782993	10.0	9.0	45882900	Logan was an absolutely fantastic host!  She was a pleasure to talk to and she went out of her way to make sure that all of our needs were satisfied.  The house was very clean, and the room itself had more than enough space for two people.  Thanks for a great and welcoming stay!
67108	6782993	10.0	9.0	46254299	Sunny and Simple is very apt - the room is nothing special but it is very comfortable and does the job very well. The neighborhood is pleasant enough, if a little far out of Seattle; if you have a car it shouldn't be any problem at all. Logan was very sweet and incredibly helpful, and she really helped make our trip a memorable one.
67109	6782993	10.0	9.0	51251964	This listing was exactly what I hoped it would be. My family thoroughly enjoyed our stay and Logan was the picture of hospitality and very warm and understanding when a sudden change in our plans came up. 
67110	6782993	10.0	9.0	52033729	This was my first time in the area and my very first AIR BnB experience. I felt right at home. Logan was an excellent host! She was so sweet, friendly and full of energy! Comfy pillows and blankets, heater, towels, everything covered. Absolutely perfect! The place was near the bus stop and a couple blocks from stores/restaurants. I would definitely stay here again.
67111	6782993	10.0	9.0	54681693	Just amazing!Logan hat uns sehr herzlich begr칲sst, wir f칲hlten uns sofort sehr wohl! Gem칲tliches, sauberes Zimmer. Logan stand f칲r Fragen jederzeit zur Verf칲gung und gab uns Sightseeing-Tipps. W칲rden es jedem empfehlen und auch selbst wieder dort 칲bernachten :)
