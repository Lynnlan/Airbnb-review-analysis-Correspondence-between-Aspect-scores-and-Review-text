3998	4138423	9.0	9.0	22906317	"Could not have been better!  The house was perfect for us and our two dogs.  Rob was very responsive and incredibly flexible with our changing schedule, as we have just moved from MN to WA.  

Being able to stay in this home was a great respite for us and everything we needed was available.  We cannot say enough positive things! Comfy bed, stocked kitchen, clean, safe and easy to get to many different locations.  We loved that it was on the Burke-Gilman trail as well; just about a half mile from the trail.  Awesome.  

We HIGHLY recommend this home as well as Rob & Molly--two most gracious and generous people.  

Thank you!!"

4002	4138423	9.0	9.0	24851041	Super cute little house in Ballard! It's a little older, so super modern amenities are lacking, but it adds to the charm of the house. Super comfy bed and the space is definitely accommodating for 2 adults. Parking is super easy and all the best eats are a short drive/uber away. Thanks for hosting us!
4003	4138423	9.0	9.0	25170028	Sunny Ballard Digs is all that it claims to be: darling, comfortable, and convenient. Rob and Molly seem like awesome people and were fantastic hosts. They left the house in good, clean shape for our arrival, a welcome note, and were easy and attentive to communicate with. 
4004	4138423	9.0	9.0	25682335	What a lovely little get-away! We had a wonderful week in our cozy home with retro furniture that was comfortable and fun. It's a quiet neighborhood and parking was so easy. We plan to return in warmer weather to use the lovely backyard! Thank you Rob and Molly for our week in Seattle. We felt like we lived there again.
4005	4138423	9.0	9.0	25826132	The house is in a very convenient location, and is just as described.  Very cute retro decor and super clean and pet friendly.  We never met the hosts but knew they were in the area and would be easy to reach.  
4006	4138423	9.0	9.0	25892133	The neighborhood was great! Close enough to walk to a dog park which was so nice for Charlie. The place looked exactly like the pictures and was a perfect place to stay for a few days. 
4007	4138423	9.0	9.0	26103930	I had a great time staying at Rob and Molly's place. Everything was clean when I arrived and they were very helpful with any questions I had. Nice place, cool neighborhood. 
4008	4138423	9.0	9.0	26200638	"Rob and Molly's place was the perfect home-away-from-home for our stay. Sunny, vintage, cute and comfy. Kitchen was well stocked! 

Ballard is a walkable distance and it was super easy to get downtown with the bus a block away. Rob was extremely communicative and helpful with our need for a speedy last minute reservation- and quickly resolved our small hiccup at check-in. Wonderful hosts, thanks again!

4011	4138423	9.0	9.0	26820353	This cute, unique house in Ballard is in a great location to get pretty much anywhere in Seattle easily. We enjoyed exploring the nearby  neighborhood of Phinney Ridge and the downtown Ballard area - both within walking distance. The house had pretty much everything we needed for a comfortable stay: from making coffee in the morning with the French press to enjoying a beer at night while watching a little tv. The bed was comfortable too!

4013	4138423	9.0	9.0	27062694	"Sunny Ballard digs was really a welcome sight after the ice in NC. House was cozy and comfortable and perfectly situated in Frellard (or Balmont). Parking was a breeze and the wireless speedy.

Books, beer, wine and daffodils ready to burst into bloom. What's not to like? 

And Sundays there are Markets year-round in both Ballard and Fremont."
4014	4138423	9.0	9.0	27229802	Rob and Molly were excellent hosts. They were quick to respond to any and all questions we had and mad sure to remind us to call on them if we needed anything at all. The space is beautiful with fun and quirky decor that made the place feel home. The kitchen was well-socked with cooking supplies and we enjoyed the local coffee that they had left for us. The bedroom was quiet and cozy and the blackout curtains made it all too easy to sleep in! The location can't be beat and we enjoyed walking to dinner and discovering new places in the neighborhood each night. We are excited to make our next visit to Seattle and will definitely be staying here again. I would recommend it to absolutely anyone!
4015	4138423	9.0	9.0	27334534	"Rob and Molly have the cutest place! It's the perfect size for a couple or 3 friends. The rental is a 10-15 minute walk from Ballard, a great neighbourhood with boutique shopping, hip restaurants and bars.

We were greeted with some local coffee, beer, and a bookshelf filled with quirky books. If you like retro furniture, reclaimed wood and old books, you will feel right at home. Thanks again for a wonderful stay!"

4027	4138423	9.0	9.0	41242146	We had a fantastic stay at Rob and Molly's apartment. The place was clean and beautifully decorated in a kind of funky old-school way. We loved browsing the record collection and the smart TV came in handy at times, too. There was even a toddler bed for our little one, as well as lots of little kids' toys, which was a huge bonus. Location was easy access to much of what we wanted to do in the city, and Rob was really responsive in our correspondence. Would definitely stay here again. 
4028	4138423	9.0	9.0	41691956	The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4029	4138423	9.0	9.0	44089903	Nice spot for a short trip to Seattle.  The 1 bedroom apartment was as pictured and was nice & clean.  Rob and Molly were responsive before and during the stay, and made us feel warmly welcomed.

4033	4138423	9.0	9.0	55435716	Great location near central Ballard and Fremont. The space was clean and comfortable and the hosts were responsive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again.
4034	4138423	9.0	9.0	56940910	My stay at Molly and Rob's quaint little house in Ballard was wonderful. The 50's, artsy motif was very cute and worked with the style of the house. Amenities were great and there were clear instructions on how to work the TV, stereo and the sound system. Even thou Molly and Rob weren't on hand they answered my inquiries right away. It was just what I needed for a little R&R.

It's not far from Seattle Downtown and it takes only like 20 mins to space needle and pike market. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. Thanks Blair for the arrangement.
4568	2039149	9.0	9.0	11173556	My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights and had a fantastic time. The house is comfortable, clean, and spacious.

4570	2039149	9.0	9.0	11693186	Our company frequently hosts out of town employees for summits and conferences, so we needed a home with multiple bedrooms that would be comfortable for a weeks' stay. Blair was an excellent host, very communicative and the home received rave reviews from our team. We will definitely go to Blair first the next time we have out of town guests! Thanks so much!
4571	2039149	9.0	9.0	11745207	Great location and the beds are heavenly! Blair was a wonderful host! Thank you!

4574	2039149	9.0	9.0	12828727	Great location, and a nicely appointed home base for our weekend in Seattle. Blair was great to deal with, responded to all inquiries promptly, and accommodated all of our needs.  
4575	2039149	9.0	9.0	13649013	We booked Blair's Ballard home for my family's trip to Seattle for our wedding. Booking was easy and Blair was always responsive to our questions. The family didn't needed anything during our stay, but it was great knowing our host was easily accessible. This house very comfortably fit seven guests and has great common area space. The patio got a lot of use! This house is a quick walk to many restaurants and coffee shops and an easy drive to the city's major attractions. Thanks so much for your hospitality! We would highly recommend Blair's home for your trip. 
4576	2039149	9.0	9.0	14077962	"Great house in a nice, quiet neighborhood with easy access to Ballard and Fremont. The house was clean, comfortable and all-around ""homey""! Definitely recommended for those who would like to explore Seattle's outer neighborhoods. "
4577	2039149	9.0	9.0	14400572	Blair was an awesome host. He provided us with all pertinent information about the listing and everything we needed to know about check-in/check-out. The home was very nice, equipped and furnished just like the description said. I would highly recommend to anyone who is staying in the seattle area and is looking for a spacious home in a quiet location within public transportation range of downtown seattle.
4578	2039149	9.0	9.0	14730282	I booked this home for family to stay at while visiting me in Seattle. It was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and close to many amenities, including grocery stores, restaurants, shops and the freeways. Plenty of street parking available. 
4579	2039149	9.0	9.0	15316190	We had such a great a experience staying in this house. A group of ten of us stayed here to celebrate a friend's upcoming wedding and we couldn't have had a better time! We especially loved the little back patio with lights strung overhead...perfect for a summer dinner party. Blair was an excellent host, very accommodating and responsive to my questions about the house before our stay.Though we never actually met, he was a pleasure to work with and I would definitely consider staying here again!  
4580	2039149	9.0	9.0	15491872	Blair responded quickly to my messages and was easy to communicate with. The house was pretty warm during the day because we happen to be there when it was quite hot in Seattle but we were out most of the time anyway so it wasn't too bad. It was cool at night so we opened the windows and there were several fans around which helped a lot. Other than that, the house was comfortable and clean. 
4581	2039149	9.0	9.0	15743999	"Nice comfortable home w good instructions 
although I am a dunce w Netflix. No screens and
No AC which I found out was norm in Seattle so
Watch for heat waves when you visit. Roomy
Place w great kitchen so you can really cook! 
Clean and nice beds too! "
4582	2039149	9.0	9.0	16419161	The host was great and everything was set up for us when we got to the property. The beds were incredibly comfortable and everything was wonderful.
4583	2039149	9.0	9.0	16467376	We had a great experience at this house! We stayed for one night for a bachelorette party, and the house was a great size for the 8 of us that stayed overnight. We enjoyed sitting out on the patio during the day as well. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody looking to stay in the Ballard area!
4584	2039149	9.0	9.0	17091263	Great place! Very comfortable, nice soft sheets, clean and more than enough room for our six-person family. The kids loved the little basement area. Ballard has become a really lovely neighborhood, too.
4585	2039149	9.0	9.0	17736501	"Overall we were very pleased with the house - it was clean and nicely appointed. Blair was very easy to communicate with.  Street parking was easy and it was located in a quiet neighborhood close to a grocery store and park.

The only downside was that it was pretty hot during our stay so we had to open windows and as previous reviewers noted there weren't any screens. 

I would strongly recommend this place to stay when visiting Seattle."
4586	2039149	9.0	9.0	17856925	"Blair was great! His directions and notes were perfect and the house was as described.
The neighbourhood was quiet and the backyard was a great place to sit and chat."
4587	2039149	9.0	9.0	17979117	The host was very helpful and provided timely replies. The listing was pretty accurate. The neighborhood is in a nice area and a 20 minute car ride without traffic. Would recommend this to others. 
4588	2039149	9.0	9.0	18229809	The house is very nice, clean and cozy. It has everything we need. The area is nice and quiet. We had a great time there. Blair is easy to work with and very quick in replying all emails. I would definitely recommend Blair's house to all my friends if they come to Seattle.
4589	2039149	9.0	9.0	18404497	The house was perfect! Especially if you love vintage charm. (Which I do).  There were 6 of us, so this place really had an unbeatable price when you consider what enough rooms at a hotel would have cost us. I highly recommend it. Also, prior to arriving, Blair graciously answered several questions on Seattle recommendations and we really appreciated that. 
4590	2039149	9.0	9.0	18707185	Perfect house for a group of 7 adults. Great location, great beds and good facilities in the house. When we arrived the house was not clean though (apparently a mistake was made in the cleaning schedule), but we were able to arrange everything with Blair, so it worked out fine. 
4591	2039149	9.0	9.0	18873535	The house was very clean and all set up for our arrival.  The kitchen was especially nice and a great place for us to cook up some breakfast.  Blair was also very accommodating of our relatively late changes in group size and responded quickly to our emails.  Overall, a great place to stay and a great host!
4592	2039149	9.0	9.0	20809518	I did not actually stay in this home; I rented it for my parents.  The home was lovely, although poorly cleaned upon arrival.  Guests arrived late that evening, well after check in, and the unit smelled overwhelmingly of smoke and had visible lingering smoke in the air.  The host apologized and did his best to accommodate the asthma sufferer by offering to allow her to stay in the neighboring duplex.  The host responded promptly to various requests made by the tenants during their month-long stay.  
4593	2039149	9.0	9.0	20931326	Blair's home is located in a quite neighborhood near University of Washington. Communication with Blair was fairly easy; home manual is detailed and easy to follow. However, we were disappointed to find the floor was not vacuumed and there were hairs found on the bedding so we were not sure if the house was cleaned fully before we arrived. There were also stains on the carpet down to the basement. We were surprised to find this top rated vacation home is not very well maintained on the day of our arrival. Overall, it was not a pleasant experience and we won't be coming back again. 
4594	2039149	9.0	9.0	21094027	Thank you Blair for providing a beautiful home for us to use while we were on holidays in Seattle.  Close to everything, very clean well kept home and you were very accommodating.  We'd stay at your home again anytime as it had everything we needed... al
4595	2039149	9.0	9.0	21280083	The home was as described and we had a good experience. The neighborhood was quiet. The location was excellent and located close to all of our functions. We would rent again if staying in the area.
4596	2039149	9.0	9.0	21750224	Blair was easy to get in touch with. House was roomy and fit 7 people easily, neighbourhood is quiet and safe, ~15 min drive to downtown Seattle.  There is a fantastic pizza joint is just down the block.  
4597	2039149	9.0	9.0	22022035	We loved our stay in Seattle. Blair was a great host, and was very easy to communicate with. We were able to check in late, which worked out perfectly for our group. The house was very spacious and the beds were comfortable. We really enjoyed Slate coffee which was only two blocks away. I would highly recommend staying at Blair's house!
4598	2039149	9.0	9.0	22642876	Our daughter was getting married in Seattle and our family flew in from around the country and shared this great house. There was plenty of space for us, and we had so much fun just hanging out in the living room, playing games and laughing. The location was perfect, actually just a few blocks from our daughter's home, and close to restaurants and shops. We would definitely rent this again.
4599	2039149	9.0	9.0	23006172	We were in Seattle for a week to celebrate our daughter's wedding.  Seven of us stayed comfortably in the home , six in comfy beds and one comfortably on the sofa due to an airbed issue.  The neighborhood is quiet yet only 2 blocks from a main bus line into downtown.  Blair supplied us with the things we needed in a quick & friendly fashion.  Free laundry was a bonus !  Very nice duplex home stay !  
4600	2039149	9.0	9.0	23357269	The house is great and so is Blair.  There is safe parking on the street in a nice neighborhood.  The kitchen is well equipped and stocked.  Had everything we needed for our stay.  Would stay again in Blair's place.
4601	2039149	9.0	9.0	23452853	"The house is well appointed with nice modern finishes and plenty of space.  We had 5 adults and we had more than enough room.  

We had a car so the location was just fine.  I wouldn't recommend it if you are hoping to walk everywhere (especially in the winter). There are a few walkable places but Ubering to Fremont/Ballard only cost about $10, so its a pretty central location.

We would stay here again if we needed another rental."
4602	2039149	9.0	9.0	23889873	Everything was as presented… house worked out great for us.  Location was close to family in Wallingford neighborhood, easy to find and lots of shops and nice neighborhood in growing Ballard community.  House was clean and everything worked out great.  Thanks Blair =)
4603	2039149	9.0	9.0	24106758	This a very beautiful house. Everything we needed was provided by the host. It was a reasonable price split among the 8 of us.

Communication with Blair leading up to the stay was great.  If we ever need another rental in Ballard for a group, this will be our first choice!
4605	2039149	9.0	9.0	24461819	Everything was as represented. It's a comfortable house in a good location. The house was clean and well-maintained. Up-to-date washer and dryer were appreciated. Parking was easy. The pizzeria at the top of the street is worth a visit, and the large pile of DVDs Blair provided had selections appropriate for everyone. 
4606	2039149	9.0	9.0	24803726	Blair was efficient, prompt and helpful. The house was great - nice linen and towels and matched the write up. It was nice and warm. The Xmas lights on all the neighbouring houses added to the feel.
4607	2039149	9.0	9.0	25050447	A girlfriend weekend in Seattle for the theatre.  It was a perfect place and we got to explore Ballard and all the cute shops.  The house fit our needs perfectly and it was so nice and roomy.  It was welcoming and charming.  All of us loved it.  We had 8 in our group!
4608	2039149	9.0	9.0	25312089	The home was very accurately described, and Blair has an excellent set of instructions to orient his guests.  Quiet, safe neighborhood. 
4609	2039149	9.0	9.0	25493439	Our host made us feel welcome by confirming our arrival time.  The house was located conveniently for our trip for our son's wedding.  The neighborhood was nice and the house was exactly as described on airbnb!
4610	2039149	9.0	9.0	25664925	This is a very nice 3BR home in a quiet & pretty neighborhood that is conveniently located.  The home was exactly as pictured. Everything was clean & ready for our arrival. Our stay went smoothly & I would recommend this listing to future travelers.
4611	2039149	9.0	9.0	25770113	Great home , exactly as described, clean, safe and comfortable. The basement area is pretty much a house by itself. 
4612	2039149	9.0	9.0	26208952	Everything was just as described. The place was clean and comfortable. It was a very convenient location for us near some local restaurants and coffee bars. It was great that our group could stay together in one house. 
4613	2039149	9.0	9.0	26387632	Everything was how it was described on the listing, and pictures were spot on. The place was clean and comfortable, and was the perfect spot to stay for a large family. The neighborhood was quiet and a close distance to coffee shops, grocery stores, bars and restaurants. It was also a short distance to major attractions within Seattle.
4614	2039149	9.0	9.0	26689012	The house was great.  Two good bedrooms upstairs, along with a living room and kitchen.  Downstairs was another bedroom with bunk beds (worked well for my kids) along with another living/siting area.  Fun neighborhood (we had good weather and walked to the zoo, which is about 0.5 miles away, up a bit of a hill).
4615	2039149	9.0	9.0	26788179	We really enjoy the stay in Blair's house, well equipped and modern style. Located in a quite community but still convinient to stores, supermarket by car. Definitely will choose here again next time.
4616	2039149	9.0	9.0	26979257	The house was exactly as described. Very spacious with a lower level additional bathroom, living room and bedroom with bunk beds. The neighborhood was super quiet and off street parking was easy. The outdoor space was a very nice feature and the location was perfect. We walked everywhere we went and Blair was nice enough to recommend a few breweries before our visit. I would stay here again. 
4617	2039149	9.0	9.0	27232901	Blair was such a great host,super easy to deal with.The house got everything I need and the location is good too.When I checked out,I forgot my laptop in the house,Blair was so patient to help me find it,I really appreciated that.One last thing,even with all the stuff done,I have not met Blair,so if you want privacy,this is the place to go.
4618	2039149	9.0	9.0	27284880	We had an excellent stay in this beautiful, roomy 3-bedroom house. The photos in the listing were spot on, but we were still pleasantly surprised by this charming space. It's located in a quiet, yet very accessible neighborhood. We would definitely recommend it for your next stay in Seattle.
4619	2039149	9.0	9.0	27351076	The house was perfect. Plenty of space for the seven of us. The back patio was a nice touch after dark. I would definitely stay here again. 
4620	2039149	9.0	9.0	27610860	Place was great. Exactly as described, convenient and easy to get in and out of town. Plenty of parking right at the house. Kitchen is great as well. House was very clean and the beds were comfortable.
4621	2039149	9.0	9.0	27647733	We enjoyed our stay in this cozy home and neighborhood. Since we had a large group and were planning for meals/sleeping arrangements, I asked Blair quite a few questions leading up to our stay. He was always very responsive and helpful. The house was clean and rooms were comfortable. Blair even made a special trip to the house to bring us a blender that was supposed to be there but wasn't. He worked hard to make things right and I would definitely recommend the house to any larger groups looking for a homey environment. 
4622	2039149	9.0	9.0	27737949	Hi Blair. Had a great experience with the house and so handy to get to the zoo and grocery shopping. Nice quiet neighbourhood. Couple of things I'd like to mention though. As discussed on the phone the blow up mattress had not been left at the house however; we made do. One thing that did frustrate us was the dishwasher was full of dishes and it had apparently been turned on but it was so jammed full that the majority of the dishes had hardened crusted food on them which required washing them in the sink before we could use them. Wherein laid another problem that there was not enough dish soap to properly clean the dishes. I would have thought that the cleaning fees we paid would have included emptying the dishwasher for the incoming guests as well as ensuring there was adequate supplies (dish soap). We noticed there was no bath/shower soap or shampoo that we usually experience when we do the home rentals. All in all though the he did meet our needs. Regards. - Phil. 
4623	2039149	9.0	9.0	27952032	The house was beautiful and the space was even bigger than the photos made it look. Blair had a sheet of paper with the house rules clearly written on it, along with WiFi password and location of other amenities. Very comfortable seating and bedding as well. Worth every penny!
4624	2039149	9.0	9.0	28081039	We enjoyed our stay at Blair's home in Seattle. The house was clean and as described. It was in a great location to explore Seattle!
4625	2039149	9.0	9.0	28256504	Beautiful house in a very friendly neighborhood! Bus routes and other convenience stores were very accessible. Comfortably fits a group of ten. Everything was clean and the advertising pictures were accurate.
4626	2039149	9.0	9.0	28361130	The house was great!  Everything was just as described.  Quiet neighborhood, close to downtown.   Lots of room, and extra bedding.  Easy parking in front of the house. Kitchen was well equipped. House was very clean and the beds were comfortable.  Thanks for such a pleasant experience!
4627	2039149	9.0	9.0	28604606	My family and I rented Blair's place in March for 3 nights. We all found his place neat, with ample space (there were 6 adults and 1 child during our stay and we all comfortably fit) and in a quiet, convenient location. Blair was very responsive. This is my second time to rent from him and it's always been a pleasure to do business with him. 
4628	2039149	9.0	9.0	28773811	This house is BEAUTIFUL. It was within walking distance to the store (Trader Joe's) which was very helpful. The kitchen had all of the necessities (blender, toaster, etc) and the couch in the living room was so comfortable. Blair was extremely prompt and helpful. Would stay here again if we ever find ourselves in Ballard!
4629	2039149	9.0	9.0	29541323	A very nice house in a great location.
4630	2039149	9.0	9.0	29820451	"I have spent a good amount of time thinking about this before I felt that I could make a fair honest review. Let me start by saying the overall experience was very good, however there are a few things about the property that I feel need to be mentioned just to make the description of the property a bit more accurate. Let me state again that I'm not trying to sway anyone away from this home, it was very nice, huge, and quite clean.

First and most important to me the walkability: yes it is absolutely walkable, however with the exception of a few close restaurants, most everything is at min a 20 min walk, including the closest grocery store. (Which on a side note ballard town and country market is a great store) This situation is easily resolved with a service like uber that is readily available in seattle, but I guess my point is that when walkable is in the title, I would expect to be a bit closer to the action. (In my opinion at least)

Second the amenities: now this was not really a big deal, and in fact  i'm not even sure how much the amenities were really touted on this homes description, but nonetheless I feel they deserve mentioning. our situation was admittedly a bit out of the ordinary. (one member of our group caught a cold en route.) As a result she was forced to stay inside for a couple of days and us with her for the majority of the time. We found that the main tv was a bit too old to plug in a chromecast to stream content, and the wifi was too weak downstairs to use the slightly newer tv. Once again not a big deal, but a minor annoyance for a semi/premium priced home.  

Also along the same lines, in most of the airbnb homes that I have stayed, the hosts usually stock the pantry with a few basic items, tea, maybe some chips, condiments, sometimes even a beer or two. that is not the case here so if you will be staying for a while you will need to purchase everything you need. Again its not much of a problem, but it would have been nice to have some tea around for our sick friend while I went to the store to get her some meds.

lastly if you didn't notice it in the pictures, this home shares a common wall with another home. Im not sure if its a rental as well or not, but it made me very conscious of every sound we made, especially later at night. I for one hate the idea that I might be disturbing another tenant, as I usually like to stay up quite late.

I just want to close by saying that it should show you something that I have to pick the place apart just to find flaws, overall this is a huge, beautiful, clean home. Thanks."
4631	2039149	9.0	9.0	30095750	Everything was fine. Apartment as advertised. Smooth checkin/checkout.
4632	2039149	9.0	9.0	30283362	"The house was perfect.  I was worried it would be too tight for 8 people, it was very spacious.  The unit was actually nicer than I expected, and the location was great!  Everyone was very happy with their stay and would highly recommend this option over local hotel choices. 
"
4633	2039149	9.0	9.0	30460635	The house was perfect for us. It was just as described and was very spacious. It was in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and was very convenient to what we wanted to do in Seattle. 
4634	2039149	9.0	9.0	30759038	The house was exactly as described! Lockbox was easy to access, lots of clean towels, really comfortable beds! Really felt like we had a cozy home of our own in Seattle for the weekend, and the neighborhood was beautiful!
4635	2039149	9.0	9.0	31599517	My family needed a place to live while we put our house up on the market.  The place suited my needs and is located on a quiet street.  Just to hit some of the other reviewers points:  Yes, it's a duplex with shared walls, but the walls seemed thick.  The closest grocery store is either Trader Joes or Fred Meyers (if you go to Ballard Town and Country, it will be a much longer walk).  Slate coffee house has great coffee (and pastry) just a couple blocks down from the home.  Unit is on the older side, but everything was in working order.  Blair had fast e-mail response time and was able to quickly fix a minor problem we encountered!
4636	2039149	9.0	9.0	31701518	Our family stayed here for 2 nights and the accommodations were just great for our group.  The house was clean and spacious, in a nice quiet neighborhood.  Blair was great to work with.  
4637	2039149	9.0	9.0	32037890	We were on a weekend trip in Seattle with a family of 6 and the house was perfect for that ! Everything was tidy and clean, with enough kitchen supplies to cook a homemade meal. The patio behind the kitchen was so adorable ! Defn a positive experience :) 
4638	2039149	9.0	9.0	32459802	We had such a great time at Blair's! The house was perfect! Amazing location and the house was clean and well taken care! Blair was very easy to communicate with and everything went flawlessly! Can't wait to come to back to Seattle and stay here!
4639	2039149	9.0	9.0	32931014	"This is a great house if you are traveling with family, it had plenty of space for the adults and we got a pack & play for my kid. Everything was super clean and the beds were really comfy (of so soft linen!)
It is in Ballard but not really close to the main cafes and restaurants and transit, you will need a car or do quite a bit of walking to get to places
Blair was really easy to reach out to and responded to our requests right away"
4640	2039149	9.0	9.0	33220423	The house was very nice and clean. Very relaxing.
4641	2039149	9.0	9.0	33611451	"We had a really positive experience here! The host communicated well and the place was excellent - clean, spacious, and well equipped. We slept very well as the beds are comfy and the neighbourhood is quiet. 

A car is needed to explore downtown, but the local breweries, cafes and shops etc are easily walkable, and really enjoyable! 

This was a perfect base for us, from which to explore Seattle."
4642	2039149	9.0	9.0	33684753	We really enjoyed our stay!
4643	2039149	9.0	9.0	34186482	It was my very first Airbnb experience. Great space for the entire family with everything you would need to have a relaxing vacation. 
4644	2039149	9.0	9.0	35193514	It was wonderful and spacious. We would love to use this place again in the future. 
4645	2039149	9.0	9.0	36223224	Blair was quick to respond to every e-mail / text.  The house is nicely decorated, clean and had everything we needed for our three-night stay.  We walked to the local pizza restaurant for dinner on our first night and on our second night, we took the bus to downtown Ballard and enjoyed dessert at Hot Cakes Molten Chocolate Cakery!  We especially enjoyed eating a few meals outdoors in the backyard because we got to appreciate the great 80 degree weather we were lucky to have while in Seattle!  
4646	2039149	9.0	9.0	36652231	This was the first time using Airbnb, so I didn't know what to expect.  We were quite pleased.  The house was spacious and well maintained.  The neighbourhood was good:  walkable and safe, near shops and restaurants.
4647	2039149	9.0	9.0	36888014	Blair was super responsive and the house suited our needs for a quick stay with 3 children on a road trip (they fought over the bunk beds downstairs!). We didn't get a chance to explore the neighborhood but it seemed nice. The house got a little hot in warm weather. 
4648	2039149	9.0	9.0	37286695	We were hosting a friend reunion here and had a nice stay! The key pick-up was easy and seamless and the outdoor patio was a really nice space for grilling and hanging out. We also enjoyed that the house was located within walking distance to a great coffee shop (4 min walk) and to the restaurants and shops of Ballard Ave (about 25 min walk). The main challenge we had, was in staying cool/circulating air in the house. We visited Seattle during an unseasonably hot week and the house gets a lot of afternoon sun beating in through those lovely windows in the front. Since there is no A/C, there were a few fans provided, but not enough for every room and the house just seemed to hold the heat (even with daily process of making sure blinds were closed, closing windows during the day, opening them during the cooler evenings etc...) Also, the windows didn't have screens on them, so there were some issues with bugs being attracted to the light from inside at night. We tried to make the most of it and realize the weather is not usually quite that hot, so its probably a non-issue most of the time. Other than that, we had a great stay! 
4649	2039149	9.0	9.0	37544829	"Neighborhood is very residential - about 15 minutes to Pike's Place, downtown etc.  Great book of local coffee, shops etc in the living room.

No a/c, so a bit hot in the current heat wave, but cooled at night.

Not fancy, but great amount of space for our family of four."
4650	2039149	9.0	9.0	37669372	This home was in a great location and was super easy to find. Everything was as described and there was plenty of space should you need it. Ballard is a super fun area to explore and this location is perfect to see all of the great neighborhoods around it as well!
4651	2039149	9.0	9.0	38102442	"The home was excellent!  I stayed there with a party of 9 and managed to fit everyone in comfortably.
There are a ton of great breweries, bars and restaurants within walking distance (or short Uber ride).
Blair was very responsive and accommodated as needed. I could not have asked for more."
4652	2039149	9.0	9.0	38612617	Whoa!  This place was a lot better than the pictures let on. I was just expecting a place to sleep, but the house was gorgeous, the basement was FANTASTIC!  The neighbourhood was lovely as well. And, whoa this might sound nerdy, but their kitchen sink is the sexiest sink I ever used. I could wash dishes all day in that sink.  Whoa!
4653	2039149	9.0	9.0	38977736	Blair was responsive and helpful.  My large family traveled from all over the US and arrived at different times, most by cab.  Since we could not check in early, Blair allowed us to secure our luggage at the home until we could check in.  He responded immediately to any questions or concerns.  We rented both sides of this duplex for 12 adults and we each felt comfortable and had plenty of room to relax and have our own space.  The beds were comfortable and clean, as was the whole unit.  (I am quite obsessive about cleanliness, so this is an amazing fact!)  The kitchen was well appointed and the linen was also clean and ample.  The whole experience was really great.  We were all very impressed.
4654	2039149	9.0	9.0	39205391	House was clean and exactly as described. I didn't meet the owner, but it was super easy to let myself in and lock up. Thank you!
4655	2039149	9.0	9.0	40295289	My friends and I were on a road trip ending in Seattle. We arrived earlier than expected and had to book quickly. Blair was extremely fast and flexible with us. The apartment was clean, quiet, and spacious. We really liked the backyard patio and the netflix in the living room. 
4656	2039149	9.0	9.0	40458725	The home is in a great location, a quick drive to Ballard and Fremont and perfect for families.
4657	2039149	9.0	9.0	42104516	"When we arrived we were very disappointed, the house was very dirty, broken glass was on the floor outside and in a bedroom, hair everywhere on the floor, in the bathrooms and even on the linens. We immediately told Blair who has been very reactive, very helpful and a perfect host. Thanks to him everything was settled.

The house is nice though we could not eat all together because we were 6 adults and two kids and the table in the kitchen is for four only. If you plan to have a family dinner it isn't really possible."
4658	2039149	9.0	9.0	42364601	Apartment was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay and we will definitely use it on our next trip. 
4659	2039149	9.0	9.0	42448339	The house was clean and accessible and met our needs very well. 
4660	2039149	9.0	9.0	42821867	Blair's house was the perfect accommodation for my group of 6. It was a close walking distance to the buses to take us into Ballard and downtown Seattle. We had a great time!
4661	2039149	9.0	9.0	43056153	Great house, great location and great host! The house is exactly as described. It was very cozy and fit our group perfectly. The big couch was great and made for a comfy and inviting living room. The outdoor patio was perfect for my girlfriends and I to sit outside, where we chatted and enjoyed a lovely Seattle summer evening. Bedrooms were clean and spacious. The house is very close to both Fremont and Ballard, and within walking distance to bars, restaurants and coffee shops. Highly recommend!
4662	2039149	9.0	9.0	45423000	Perfect location and very clean house.
4663	2039149	9.0	9.0	46260162	upon arrival, we contacted the host via email and he responded imediately. Great experience at Walkable in Seattle. It worked perfect for us. 
4664	2039149	9.0	9.0	47090779	"Blair’s place certainly meets the expectations of location location.
The house has all you need in terms of amenities and also Blair was great at communicating with us. Although we were not there very long, we enjoyed our stay."
4665	2039149	9.0	9.0	47632239	Very comfortable and clean. All amenities needed were available. Very roomy and comfortable beds.
4666	2039149	9.0	9.0	48440908	We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood! The house is cute, but super simple and without any extras so be sure to bring some starter items for the fridge, water etc. it was nice to have a pack and play there too, but the wood floors are super creaky so if you have a light sleeper bring a portable sound machine. Our host was responsive to feedback and responded in a timely manner. 
4667	2039149	9.0	9.0	48867753	Overall we had a great experience. The house was exactly as advertised and Blair was extremely organized and easy to work with. I would recommend the house to anyone looking to stay in the Ballard area. 
4668	2039149	9.0	9.0	49766187	The host's itinerary made it very easy to figure out how to get into the house and places to visit in the neighborhood. It was a great location, walking distance to many fun restaurants, shops and more.
4669	2039149	9.0	9.0	49994497	This was a great location. Easy walking distance to a great coffee shop and restaurant as well as the bus that takes you into downtown Ballard. We really enjoyed the space, which was comfortable and clean.
4670	2039149	9.0	9.0	51771048	The host helped us even though we forgot to look into directions provided to check in. The apartment is nice one and was good for four of us. 
4671	2039149	9.0	9.0	51966529	Great space for my wife's 30th birthday surprise. Relaxing evening overall in a comfortable space! Plenty of fridge space to make ourselves comfortable and supply what we needed.
4672	2039149	9.0	9.0	52062808	Blair was a superb host and allowed us to collect some items we had left behind in our rush to check out and go to our hotel accommodation. The house was beautiful and very well situated for easy access to downtown and other local shops. Try the giddy up burger 10mins walk away - they're awesome!
4673	2039149	9.0	9.0	52620971	Location and size of the house is great. Very quiet and situated neighbourhood. Wish could have spend more days.
4674	2039149	9.0	9.0	53144314	The house was perfect for what we needed and is as described. Blair was quick to respond to any questions and would stay in one of his properties again. The house was in a good neighbourhood and has a fantastic small coffee shop at the end of the street which did great espresso which Seattle is known for. Its a drive to Ballard area which has many top restaurants and bars.
4675	2039149	9.0	9.0	54845725	Nice quiet and safe location. Very clean. Great stay
4676	2039149	9.0	9.0	55352280	The home is in a great quiet neighborhood. It was easy to check in and check out and the place was immaculate. Altogether, staying there was a great experience.
4677	2039149	9.0	9.0	56118756	Awesome rental.  My family and I spent 5 days here and had a great stay.  This townhouse was in a great neighborhood with excellent pizza and coffee a few blocks away.  A short drive to great places to eat as well as Ala Mode Pie shop :) Definitely recommend staying here is you are traveling with children.  
4678	2039149	9.0	9.0	56514739	It was a very smooth check in & check out process. Blair explained everything prior to my arrival and helpful. the apt is very close to downtown seattle and lots of parking around the neighborhood. The apt had everything we needed during our stay. Would recommend!
4679	2039149	9.0	9.0	56997363	Great house. Blair was extremely helpful with all questions and difficulties.
4680	2039149	9.0	9.0	57044347	Blair contacted me before arriving that morning to tell me about check-in and to orient me to the house. The house was freshly cleaned and located in a cute neighborhood close to downtown Ballard. The beds are comfortable and the appliances are updated. Everything was a short walk or drive away. Overall, the experience was positive and it was a cozy house to stay the night.
6206	7430926	9.0	9.0	42907701	"We had a perfect vacation at Audrey's. She was so helpful when planning our trip and available to answer any questions. Definitely can go without renting a car if you're staying in the city. Uber rides are about $5-$15 depending on where you go and what traffic is like. 

The listing was accurate. The pictures don't do the apartment justice. It was so comfortable and cozy. It felt like going home, not to a rental. Audrey had great instructions for getting in and out of the building. She even had guide books for us. Our favorite activity was the EMP museum. We would absolutely recommend staying at Audrey's to anyone who asks."
6207	7430926	9.0	9.0	43398770	Our stay at Audrey's exceeded everything we had been hoping for. She was very accommodating and even periodically checked in on us via text to ensure that our stay was going well. She even left a bouquet of flowers for us upon arrival! The apartment itself was beautiful, modern, welcoming, cozy, extremely well-kept (and stocked with the necessary toiletries!), and true to its photos. I must also mention that the queen sized bed was one of the most comfortable that I have ever slept on out of all my times of travel. The location was ideal, as it was only about a 10 minute drive to many sightseeing locations. We are so thankful for her hospitality and hope to be able to stay here again during future visits to the beautiful city of Seattle. 
6208	7430926	9.0	9.0	44466775	A perfect first Airbnb experience. The listing was accurate and Audrey is incredibly organized. Check in and check out went smoothly and all instructions were very clear.  The place itself was exactly as described. It's small but a perfect home base when visiting the Seattle area. Didn't have any problems and would stay here again. Only thing is that you are required to wash all linens before you leave. Not a huge issue but you need to make sure you make the time to do it before you have to check out. Thanks so much Audrey!
6209	7430926	9.0	9.0	44729256	Clean, comfortable home. The directions to enter the actual apartment is very detailed as it is part of a larger complex. Audrey was responsive and took feedback about positively about a check out issue. Overall, a good overnight experience.
6210	7430926	9.0	9.0	44938383	"The apartment building was easy to find and street parking was available a short distance away. 
We found the apartment to be very nice, very clean, and everything we could have wished for was available. 
We even found a small Italian restaurant a short walk away. Access to public transportation is excellent and you are at the space needle in minutes."
6211	7430926	9.0	9.0	45190551	We enjoyed our stay at Audrey's place.  She was helpful and readily available to address any concerns we had.  Great location - would stay again.
6212	7430926	9.0	9.0	45677062	"Although we never met Audrey, she was an excellent host! She kept in contact to see if there was anything we needed or that she could help with. The apartment was better than described and the location was very good and within walking distance to some great restaurants/bars, grocery stores, and other attractions in Fremont. The bus stop is right outside and less than a 2 minute walk. The bed was super comfy and so were the pillows. 

We spent two evenings on the rooftop deck at the gas fire pit. One evening enjoying wine, bread, cheese, and fruit by the fire and another making S'mores. It was great! 

** TIP: The knob on the timer for the fireplace is stripped so it does not turn and only spins. Open the access panel, remove the knob, and use something thin to turn the post the gas timing knob sits on. Also the electric ignition didn't seem to work so match or some fire source would be handy**

My fiancé and I enjoyed an amazing week in Seattle together and would recommend staying at Audrey's to anyone we know. "
6213	7430926	9.0	9.0	46893612	Audrey made us feel very welcome, she was responsive and available if anything came up but we didn't even need to contact her because everything went very smoothly during our visit! The place was very clean and well maintained, the bed was comfortable and we were very pleased with our stay.
6214	7430926	9.0	9.0	47282669	Audrey was so sweet and easy to connect with! She was always available through text and/or email and answered quickly. The apartment was very clean and we loved the modern rustic look. The apartment made us feel at home during our stay. Audrey was very clear with check in/out instructions along with many resources for around the city. We would love to stay again! 
6215	7430926	9.0	9.0	47978487	Loved the opportunity to stay at this great condo!  The location is perfect for easy access to entertainment and freeway access.  The condo has great decor, nice and clean, and having the full kitchen (which is amply stocked) makes the space more welcoming.  We will definitely consider this space for future Seattle trips and recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful hotel alternative.  Thank you for allowing us to stay, it was spectacular! 
6216	7430926	9.0	9.0	48883564	Nicely decorated and comfortable apartment in a great location. Audrey was welcoming and helpful.
6217	7430926	9.0	9.0	49221114	The apartment looked exactly like the pictures beautiful and very stylish. The proximity to the space needle, downtown Seattle, trendy restaurants and shopping was all just a short distance away. I was here for work so it was convenient to the places that I needed to go in Seattle. All the amenities that you need are in the apartment. Just a few things to keep in mind: parking is challenging, you'll hear water from the upstairs apartment (shower, toilet flush, sink) gushing down the pipes in the bedroom wall, and (in my experience) the shower hadn't been cleaned thoroughly in quite some time. If you plan to bring a car parking is most difficult after 4pm. You can find a spot within 20-30 minutes other times. If you park on Dexter like the listing suggests, know that it's very busy street with multiple tow zones. As for the noise from water coming down the pipes, it is disruptive if you are a light sleeper (which I am). 
6218	7430926	9.0	9.0	49349047	Audrey thanks for the stay, it was simple and exceptional. I appreciate your flexibility with late check in time and checkout. I hope to come back soon!
6219	7430926	9.0	9.0	49642350	My elderly mother and I stayed here for two nights and found it to be a delightful place. The unit was very clean, which is the most important thing to us. A previous reviewer thought the shower wasn't cleaned, but I think it is just an older shower and is stained, but still clean. We didn't use the kitchen as we ate out for every meal, but it looked extremely well stocked. The location is very central to many attractions in Seattle. The only challenge we had was the parking situation. Audrey did let me know ahead of time that there was no parking available onsite, and that I would need to let my mom out and then go park and walk back. I think if you are used to city living and the idea of hunting for a parking space everyday, or if you don't have a car with you, then this place is perfect! As someone who has an attached garage, and lives in a small town, it was a bit of a pain, especially at night. However, we did manage to find a parking place each time, which was a relief! Audrey was a very attentive host via text, wanting to make sure we were comfortable and if we had any questions, which was really nice.
6220	7430926	9.0	9.0	49816897	Audrey's place was great. As advertised her place was in great shape and very convenient. I would definitely stay here again
6221	7430926	9.0	9.0	50074605	We enjoyed our 3 day stay in this tastefully decorated apartment. We made all our meals in the well stocked kitchen. We travelled by bicycle and the apartment was well situated with access to all parts of Seattle particularly downtown and the Fremont area. Our host contacted us several times to offer assistance. Much appreciated.
6222	7430926	9.0	9.0	50197971	We didn't meet Audrey but her place was nice. Everything was super clean and well decorated.
6223	7430926	9.0	9.0	50841715	The apartment was comfortable, modern, clean and tasteful.  We appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and the thoughtful touches such as a first aid kit.  It was a great base from which to visit Seattle!
6224	7430926	9.0	9.0	51281669	"Great place in a great location!
The condo was clean and nicely set up. The parking situation wasn't great but by no means a hindrance. The location was ideal if you want quick access to Downtown or Fremont(you could easily walk or bike to both) and being that close to the water made for great views in the morning. I have no complaints about our time spent at Audrey's place and I hope this helps others decide to stay there too."
6225	7430926	9.0	9.0	51470716	Audrey was a great host, and her place was perfect for us and exactly as described. Her instructions for checkin and checkout were clear and easy to follow and we really felt welcomed. Much better than a hotel!
6226	7430926	9.0	9.0	52702477	The apartment is really nice and in a great location. I spent most of my time in ballard and fremont and those are both very easy to get to from here. The bed was also one of the most comfortable I've stayed in.
6227	7430926	9.0	9.0	53248331	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Audrey's home! It is a wonderful little apartment with great amenities! She was very helpful and available to answer any questions that we had or to offer up recommendations! The building had a great gym and rooftop deck, as well as a good central location for exploring Seattle. This was our first Airbnb experience and we will definitely be back!
6228	7430926	9.0	9.0	53766640	Audrey's apartment is impeccable! It is like walking into a West Elm catalog. Extremely clean, and in a great location for getting around Seattle!
6229	7430926	9.0	9.0	53972362	This was our first airbnb experience and Audrey made it amazing! The apartment was pretty close to everything that we wanted to go to which is was very convenient. She had instructions for check in and check out and it was very clear and made things a lot easier for us. She was very accommodating and was there if you had any questions! We really hope to be able to come back to Seattle because this is on our list! 
6230	7430926	9.0	9.0	54611964	This apartment was in a good location in Seattle. It was a quick ride to any destination in the city.
6231	7430926	9.0	9.0	56050995	Great apartment! Nice and quiet. Beautifully decorated and everything we needed! Would definitely recommend. Never had any issues with parking once we got a hang of the neighborhood. Thanks so much! 
6232	7430926	9.0	9.0	57381436	Audrey did a great job ensuring our stay was comfortable.  She was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  Her place is very well kept and located in a great part of the city allowing for quick access to both public and car transport.  I would definitely recommend staying at her place... thanks again, Audrey!

6413	5310193	9.0	10.0	41731274	"Scott's house was clean when we arrived and decorated with fresh flowers. I learned that most houses in Seattle don't have air conditioning, and fans were included in the bedrooms to help with the heat (since we arrived during a heatwave).

It was located in a great neighborhood with restaurants and groceries within easy walking distance. Seattle Center (i.e. the Space Needle) was within walking distance, but required going up and down a pretty steep hill. Ubering to Pike Place Market and Safeco Field was around $10-$20.

Scott does have pets (both a dog and cat), though there wasn't visible pet hair downstairs. If you have allergies, you should plan accordingly."
6414	5310193	9.0	10.0	54021733	The house was in a great location and was nice and roomy. Entry via lockbox was seamless. The alarm code was tricky the first time and didn't work, which was a very loud experience. No problems after the first time. Unfortunately, the listing didn't show bedroom pictures. Two of the bedrooms had great beds, but the third was simply a mattress on the floor. There was pet and human hair on the sheets of this mattress. Cell phone reception was poor for T-Mobile and Sprint, but great for AT&T. Lyft drivers were available in abundance. 
6415	5310193	9.0	10.0	57668693	Scott was very responsive and provided all of the info needed to be comfortable in their home.  The house was exactly as pictured - it is very nice and had everything we needed to cook for/host 16 people for a family dinner.  It was a little tight, but fun!  The neighborhood is quiet and the location is great -  it is easy to get to attractions like the space needle, Pike's Market etc.  I definitely recommend Scott as a host and would love to stay there the next time we travel to Seattle.  
6508	1783382	9.0	9.0	9502573	"Emily was a great host. She showed her apartment .... has all the facilities you would need. Her place was neat and clean, the decor was elegant and overall the place was cozy.... it felt like home. The deck has a nice view of downtown Seattle! Also Emily gave a few tips for getting around. 
The location was great.... minutes away from the Space Needle!
Will not hesitate to rent again."
6509	1783382	9.0	9.0	11269978	We had a wonderful time in Seattle, in no small part because of the wonderful home base we had. Emily's apartment was perfect, as was the location. Parking could be a little tricky in the evenings, but we walked downtown for the most part. Would definitely come back and stay here again!
6510	1783382	9.0	9.0	11362347	Emily was an excellent host for her amazing condo. She was quick to give us many recommendations for food and coffee near by. Her place was very clean with a great view of downtown from the rear balcony. Very close to the space needle, chihuli garden, capitol hill, and pike place. My girlfriend and I left pictures behind at her condo after checking out, and Emily kindly offered to mail them back to us at home! Thanks Emily, you rock!

The location was good with excellent public transportation to various areas.  We also had to rent a car and parking was fine, even in the evening.  Emily was clear with her instructions for the place.  I had a question for her during our stay and she was quick to respond.  If we're back in Seattle, we'd love to stay at her condo again.

6520	1783382	9.0	9.0	41802016	Emily's place was fantastic! The apartment was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. She was very flexible with check in and check out times. The outdoor space provided a great view of downtown Seattle and was an added bonus. We would definitely stay there again!

8292	132120	9.0	10.0	324575	The mother-in-Law apartment was perfect for our little family.  Located a short walk from Greenlake and less than a block from coffee and a good donut shop, this place really had it all!  It was pretty easy to access the freeway as well as Freemont Street area.  The hosts were nice, responsive to our needs and respectful of our privacy!   Thanks for everything!
8293	132120	9.0	10.0	351817	Ralph and His Family were wondeful host. He was very helpful to know the neighbourhood. The apartment is very nice and well decorated with Ralph's sculpture. One thing, if I need to go back to Seattle I will go again to Ralph's apartment.
8294	132120	9.0	10.0	477143	Ralph was so friendly and accommodating before and during our stay. The neighborhood is fantastic, with lush Greenlake, local coffee shops and parks within walking distance. It was perfect for our stay with our 3-year-old. The apartment was clean and cozy, and the private kitchen and laundry facilities really came in handy! What an amazing location, too, so close to all of the things we wanted to see in Seattle.
8295	132120	9.0	10.0	558071	Great spot, very hospitable!
8296	132120	9.0	10.0	1309611	Ralph was amazing -- he's a really sweet guy, and his place is amazing. I would definitely stay here again, anytime!

8298	132120	9.0	10.0	2398152	Ralph was very accommodating and the place was lovely! We had a ton of fun. Being half a block from Tangletown and Mighty-O donuts doesn't hurt! My wife and I plus two small children and Mother-in-Law were able to stay comfortably (with some creativity). I'd definitely stay again.
8299	132120	9.0	10.0	2829805	"You just can't beat this location.
My wife, toddler daughter and sister-in-law stayed in Ralph's place for several nights this fall. It's roomy, cozy, has good natural light for a semi-basement space, and we all had a great stay. Ralph and his family are lovely too! "
8300	132120	9.0	10.0	3095541	Apartment had everything I needed for my two week stay.  Quiet neighborhood, yet convenient to restaurants, Green Lake area, and other businesses.  Clean and well appointed.  Host was very friendly and helpful.  Would highly recommend this location and plan to stay again on future travels.  Thanks, Ralph!
8301	132120	9.0	10.0	3896561	We had a great time in Seattle. Ralph was very friendly and the accommodations were very pleasant. The apartment was ready for our arrival. My only complaints were a broken coffee maker, and low water pressure in the shower which I told Ralph about. He said he would look into it. Over all a good experience
8302	132120	9.0	10.0	4945264	Ralph is a very friendly and helpful host. The apartment is spacious, clean, and homely. Unbeatable for the price! We will certainly stay here again when returning to Seattle.

8305	132120	9.0	10.0	6935567	This apartment is conveniently located to Green Lake, stores, restaurants and public transportation.  Ralph and his family were very nice.  My only regret is that the apartment is below the main house and the noise from the family above was loud, especially early in the morning and in the evening.  
8306	132120	9.0	10.0	7740864	Ralph was a great host, and apartment was cozy! Great location, very private, wonderful kitchenette and laundry! Spectacular overall, maybe bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper.
8307	132120	9.0	10.0	8468662	Very friendly and easygoing host. Apartment very well-situated (e.g.: Green Lake, a nice pub, a café, and a great sushi place as well as a Mini-Market are all a stone's throw away) and well-equipped. Enough really interesting art books to keep you in the apartment should the weather be less than enticing. Looking forward to our next stay! 
8308	132120	9.0	10.0	12791476	Basement apartment is spacious and has a washer and dryer which is great.  Location is excellent and good restaurants and a mini mart within a block or two   Apartment is a basement but has windows on three side which is nice

8312	132120	9.0	10.0	20790369	Ralph was a great host. He made sure I had everything I needed and was communicative. The neighborhood was great. There were some shops and restaurants close by and walking distance from Green Lake which I took advantage of on my sunny weekend stay. As my first visit to Seattle, I am happy I chose to stay here as the place had ample space for myself, comfortable bed, super clean, and had everything I needed. It felt like my own little apartment. I would definitely stay here again. 
8313	132120	9.0	10.0	21493675	Ralph met us at our arrival and was very helpful.  The listing is accurate and the location is wonderful!  The apartment was roomier than I imagined and had all the comforts of home!  Traveling with small children, we really enjoyed the nearby lake, walking path, park, and zoo.  Public transportation is close and accessible.  A quick bus ride to downtown Seattle and you have plenty to do and see.  I would definitely stay again!  
8314	132120	9.0	10.0	28747610	Ralph's apartment was our home away from home in Seattle. Great space for three people. Having our own kitchen made it convient and easy to make breakfast in the morning before going out to explore the city. There was plenty of street of parking for our car. The neighborhood and its sorrounding area was safe and welcoming. Ralph was quick to answer any questions we had and was very friendly the times we ran into him. He was there when we needed him and aside from that gave us our space and made the stay very comfortable. 
8315	132120	9.0	10.0	34214851	Enjoyed our stay very much! Appartment is very clean and spacious. Lovely quiet neighbourhood. Busstop is just around the corner. Ralph was very friendly and responded very promptly. Would recommend this place.

The kitchen is supplied with utensils, etc. and the bathroom has a supply of goods in case you've forgotten something. Great, quiet location within walking distance to restaurants, bus stops and the beautiful Green Lake. Plenty of street parking - most nights I was able to park right in front of the house.

The apartment and its furnishings and bedding were very neat and clean. The location of the place is just a few blocks from beautiful Green Lake, which has an excellent and busy walking path, and we loved having Mighty-O Donuts, Elysian Brewery and Zoka Coffee Roasters just a few blocks down the street.
8322	132120	9.0	10.0	45784916	Ralph was friendly and attentive. He had great restaurant recommendations, including a few which were within walking distance from the house, and was generally a great resource for getting to know Seattle.  The apartment was spacious and comfortable; everyday necessities that you may not think to pack, such as mugs or towels, were provided. The space was roomy enough for three adults and lots of luggage. All the amenities were in good working order. It was a great home base for us, and we would definitely stay again if the opportunity arose.

The place is very spacious, easy access to the UW as well as downtown. We rented a car and parking outside on street was always available.

We managed to cook the meals whenever we had time, and apartment is well furnished with all kitchen equipment, cooking vessels and crockery. Furthermore, Ralph ensured that basic supplies such as tea, coffee, sugar, salt, spices, cereals were in stock.

9893	4258762	9.0	10.0	22051552	Julia was a responsive and gracious host. Her apartment was just like the photos and proved a pleasant space to come home to.  I stayed here while in Seattle for work and the apartment was perfect with a large and bright kitchen and comfortable living spaces. Everything was clean and neat, and Julia's apartment is full of charm including original artwork and full of space and light. She was immediately responsive and helpful in making recommendations for the local area. I highly recommend this location. The Walllingford strip, QFC, shops and restaurants and farmer's market are all step away. It's central to everything Seattle and Julia's apartment is awesome.
9894	4258762	9.0	10.0	28065033	Julia was an amazing host. She made my boyfriend and I feel very welcome in her place. Her place is sparkling clean and a really nice space with lots of natural light and wood floors. I would definitely recommend it!
9895	4258762	9.0	10.0	28353002	Julia's apartment was great - clean, comfortable and a great location. Communication was easy and the check-in/check-out process was extremely simple. I'd be happy to stay here again. 
9896	4258762	9.0	10.0	28593925	Julia was. Friendly host! She was available to answer any questions we had via email, she was prompt and hosted us even though we submitted a request a bit last minute. Her home was wonderful and quaint with a lovely kitchen. The only draw backs were the lack of wifi and the neighbors got a little noisy at night, other than that a great listing and a nice place to stay while in Seattle.
9897	4258762	9.0	10.0	28676855	Julia was awesome. She let us check in early, gave us a quick rundown of the place, and then let us be. Her place is just as adorable as the photos and the location was perfect. Beautiful neighborhood and an easy walk to anything you would need. Julia was very easy to get a hold of if we had any questions. Would definitely recommend this place!!
9898	4258762	9.0	10.0	28846880	Julia's place is really bright, spacious, clean, and in a great neighbourhood with lots of good cafes and restaurants within walking distance.

If we come back to Seattle, I wouldn't hesitate to book this apartment again!
9899	4258762	9.0	10.0	29004468	"Julia was very responsive in all of our communications.  

The location was excellent, great restaurants and bus access.  We were going to visit UW and it was very easy to take a quick bus there from right around the corner.  The apartment was as it looks in the photos.  It's a pretty old building so don't expect anything fancy, but it's functional.

I never actually met Julia as she wasn't available when we arrived but she left the keys for us.  Unfortunately the two small problems we had she wasn't able to respond to quickly enough to resolve (wi-fi and a plumbing problem)  but I think that's just the way it is with AirBnb.  "
9900	4258762	9.0	10.0	30746622	Julia was a great host, clear and timely communication throughout. Check-in was made easy, her place was clean and ready and in a PERFECT location!  I highly recommend Julia and her Wallingford apartment, I'd definitely stay there again.

The location was just right, Wallingford is a fun area and close to many Seattle attractions. Transportation was easily accessible.

Without a doubt, I would stay at Julia's sweet apartment again.

"
9902	4258762	9.0	10.0	32944909	I got into Seattle very late but Julia had arranged for me to get into the apartment without any hassles. The apartment was great; very comfortable, clean and just a quick bus ride or walk away from the UW campus. Will definitely be looking to stay here again when I return to Seattle!
9903	4258762	9.0	10.0	34215997	Julia was a warm and friendly host :). The space was comfortable and bright, and the location cannot be beat :)
9904	4258762	9.0	10.0	34808385	"Julia was really accommodating and able to deal with my rather late arrival in to Seattle (which was made worse by Amtrak on the day...), and the apartment itself was exactly as pictured. In a lovely neighbourhood with rapid access to downtown via bus, it was also really nice and quiet off the main road. Had six excellent nights of sleep and the days full of seeing the sights.

Thanks Julia!"
9905	4258762	9.0	10.0	35820041	Julia was super nice! The apartment was clean and comfortable. The location was great -- lots of busses nearby made it easy for us to get anywhere we needed to go, and the apartment was close to a grocery store too. I definitely recommend staying here if you need to spend some time in Seattle!
9906	4258762	9.0	10.0	36228217	The experience of staying at Julia's was excellent. The unit is close to I-5 which makes going to other places easy. The unit itself is clean and homey. I would stay at Julia's again!
9907	4258762	9.0	10.0	36302342	Loved this top floor apartment in Wallingford, its charm and cleanliness were great! We were in Seattle during an unusually hot time and an open window breeze plus a fan Julia had set up were sufficient in cooling us down at night. Julia was also flexible with us when our arrival time was unexpectedly pushed back. Really responsive via text with our questions during our stay!
9908	4258762	9.0	10.0	36678741	Left a card, easy to get in touch with, very accomodating
9909	4258762	9.0	10.0	37852265	I stayed at Julia's apartment for two nights. The apartment was cute and sunny and perfect for what I needed. Julia was easy to communicate with very responsive. Thanks for a great stay!
9910	4258762	9.0	10.0	38629714	Julia's apartment is spacious and well located, just a short drive from Fremont, Downtown, Capitol Hill, and the University District. It's in a nice neighborhood, Wallingford, which has a good mix of shops, cafes, and restaurants. Julia met us when we checked in, and was friendly even though we arrived a little later than expected. She also gave us some helpful recommendations about places to eat in the area. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.
9911	4258762	9.0	10.0	39504269	"This was both myself and my boyfriend's very first air bnb experience and Julia made it quite wonderful. She was very communicative, warm and friendly, and eve recommended a brunch spot for us. The space was perfect, sunny, spacious and charming. Comfortable bed and easy parking.

We were so impressed and grateful that we were able to stay even though it was just for a night. Would definitely go back! "
9912	4258762	9.0	10.0	41093133	What a great experience as first time Airbnb users! Julia was so nice to work with. She was flexible with our arrival time and made us feel welcome. When I had a question she responded right away. The apartment was very nice, clean, cute and cozy. The week we were there was very hot. Julia had fans that helped keep the apartment comfortable. We would definitely stay there again. 
9913	4258762	9.0	10.0	42119923	"This was my first time ever visiting Seattle and also my first time using Airbnb, and both experiences were absolutely amazing. Julia made things so easy, and walking into the place for the first time was like walking into the pictures I had seen, so all the descriptions were definitely accurate. It really felt like I was coming home after having busy days of exploring a totally unknown city. The place was clean, had tons of sun, and was in a great neighborhood. It was within walking distance from views of the city, good restaurants, cool and unique shops, a grocery store, and bus stops to all over Seattle. 

Julia was great to work with over the phone, very friendly and knowledgable, and I felt the price was more than fair. I would absolutely stay at this place again and highly recommend it to others.      "
9914	4258762	9.0	10.0	42889113	"This was a great place to stay and the location was perfect- It was so close to the things we wanted to do.
My friend slept in the bedroom and I was comfy on the couch.
Julia was so helpful with everything. 
I would totally come back!
"
9915	4258762	9.0	10.0	44702679	It was terrific! Beautiful apartment and in a great neighborhood. Julia was super responsive and helpful!
9916	4258762	9.0	10.0	45511000	Nice big bright living room, however the kitchen and bathroom were a disappointment. The kitchen required a thorough clean.  The bathroom hadn't been cleaned for our stay, we cleaned away the surface dirt and hairs however it was badly stained and in need of replacement.
10449	2986056	9.0	8.0	22191686	"The place is great. Brand new, lots of working space a nice kitchen and good people. Bikes are free to borrow, and helmets are provided.
As a hack space it's only starting, but it seems that i'll kick off soon. "
10450	2986056	9.0	8.0	22805949	"The house is beautiful and very comfortable, I met great persons there even though summer was over. From the moment of my visit the house was still far from the concept of a ""hackers house"", there are no events and no special effort on achieving techie interaction. So in general I would try the other house next time, I was kinda disappointed on that perspective."
10451	2986056	9.0	8.0	44299851	I was not the one who lived in the hacker house but my sister. It was a great learning experience for her and it was a stimulating environment. 
10452	2986056	9.0	8.0	52725257	A comfortable house with friendly and interesting hosts. Would stay again!
10895	6655233	9.0	9.0	34595084	Shana is very friendly and a great host. The location is great. And the room / house are super comfortable. I felt right at home, and would stay there anytime.
10896	6655233	9.0	9.0	35255563	I could barely interact with Shana because I used to be busy with work and then crash after I returned, but her room mate explained me everything when I moved in. It is a nice big house, the room is clean and comfortable as well. The neighborhood is brilliant, a 10 min walk to GreenLake, which is a happening place with lots of restaurants and bars. I enjoyed my brief stay, and would recommend others to stay with Shana. 
10897	6655233	9.0	9.0	35706996	Shanas listing is just as described, we loved the breezy top floor bedroom in beautiful greenlake. There's a charming little desk, the bed is comfortable, and the neighborhood is quiet at night. There's also a cafe and nice pub a few blocks away, and the lake is walking distance.  Thanks for hosting us, Shana!
10898	6655233	9.0	9.0	35988923	Great location. It was in a great neighborhood we bars close and only $12 Uber ride to the city.  We had a great stay. 
10899	6655233	9.0	9.0	36432909	"The bed in the teal room was very comfortable. Shana was friendly and also respectful of privacy. The location was very very convenient for the University of Washington.
I had a relaxing and enjoyable stay."
10900	6655233	9.0	9.0	37998556	A lovely home in a great location near lots of things in Tangletown and on 65th Street - Shana is a terrific host as well.  It was a hot week but the room stayed cool, which was really appreciated.  Very good for my week-long stay in Seattle.
10901	6655233	9.0	9.0	38675634	I really enjoyed my stay in the Teal Room. Great house in a great location. Shana was away but her housemates were very friendly and handled everything very smoothly. Great coffee shop, cafe, and pub right down the street within walking distance. I'd stay here again.
10902	6655233	9.0	9.0	39069782	The room was amazing! I didn't have a chance to meet Sheena, however her boyfriend was very personable and welcoming. The room was amazing and I had easy access to the apartment. It was definitely an airy place and the smell of the fresh air every morning made the Seattle experience so much better. 
10903	6655233	9.0	9.0	39646203	Great room in a cute neighborhood.  Shana, was great when I needed help or had questions.  Next time I come to Seattle, would definitely stay again. 
10904	6655233	9.0	9.0	39830124	"Though I never got a chance to interact with Shana personally the Teal room was great. Very clean and neat sunroof to watch the rain fall over. Getting around Seattle from the listing was really easy and there's plenty of parking in the neighborhood.

"
10905	6655233	9.0	9.0	40667565	Cool, authentic feeling house and people! Enjoyed the time staying there, and it's not too far from Green Lake.
10906	6655233	9.0	9.0	41553303	The teal room was simple but clean. We ran into Shana in the morning and had a nice chat.
10907	6655233	9.0	9.0	43110412	Shana wasn't there, but Jesse was very nice and helpful. The place was quiet and clean, and the beds were comfy. 
10908	6655233	9.0	9.0	43973286	"Shana was out of town visiting family, but Jesse was very welcoming and kind to me and my sister for our short stay! He made sure to let us know to feel welcome, and we loved spending some time with their beautiful cat! 
The room itself was spacious and clean and the beds were very comfortable. We had some trouble with the windows, but it didn't bother us very much.
My sister, who has chronic pain, had some trouble with the stairs, but only slightly more than usual. The neighborhood and general area is very nice. We walked ten minutes and found a coffee shop to have breakfast before catching the bus downtown. Overall, I wish I could've stayed longer and would definitely recommend this place!"
10909	6655233	9.0	9.0	45132921	Great place to stay! Thanks Shana!
10910	6655233	9.0	9.0	47007246	Room was very comfortable, and Shana was a welcoming and friendly host. Would definitely stay again.
10911	6655233	9.0	9.0	47998565	House was big and open easy to get in with lock box. Friendly cat named Cougar. Overall a very good experience. Jesse, the manager is a very pleasant and nice person who brews a very good cup of coffee. I would stay there again.
12770	1483944	9.0	10.0	7050211	"Great place. Very close to all the buses needed to get around town: Greenlake, UDistrict, Capitol Hill, Downtown. 

Big and comfortable bathroom and bed. Very private. Betty cooked us a very tasty breakfast."
12771	1483944	9.0	10.0	8757118	This accommodation is as advertised-- peceful, clean,  spacious, and nicely decorated, making it a great value.  I loved the small living room outside the bedroom that was solely for my use.   Betty is a gracious, caring, and knowledgeable host, a world traveller, who will make you feel welcome and do her best to make you comfortable during your stay.
12772	1483944	9.0	10.0	9422866	A most enjoyable and peaceful stay. Thank you so much, Betty!
12773	1483944	9.0	10.0	10447026	A wonderful host with a great breakfast both days.  The room was clean, quiet and better than what the listing stated.  I would confidently send others to stay at this property and will ask to go back again when in Seattle.  I was able to easily get to the bus and downtown without any hassle.  Green Lake was fun to walk around and the restaurants nearby were great.  Thanks for a nice stay.
12774	1483944	9.0	10.0	10551174	Betty is the absolute best.  She was very accommodating when we needed to arrive a few days early and could not have been more helpful or kinder. She is also a fabulous chef and we really enjoyed our breakfasts and chatting with her.   The room was very comfortable and everything was spotless.  A great place to stay.  THANKS BETTY!!!
12775	1483944	9.0	10.0	10930365	I had a great stay and look forward to coming back. Betty was a gracious host. 
12776	1483944	9.0	10.0	11157802	Betty and her son, Frankie, were very gracious hosts.  The bedroom was large and cozy.  We had access to a large bathroom and sitting room.  Betty provided us with a healthy lite breakfast for each of the days that we stayed with her.  She was very helpful in sharing and recommending some Seattle sites for us to explore.  They were very easy to talk to and we enjoyed our wonderful stay with them.   They both truly made you feel at home!
12777	1483944	9.0	10.0	11460534	Awesome stay - private, comfortable, delicious breakfasts - all with the best hospitality!  Thanks for a great experience, Betty!
12778	1483944	9.0	10.0	12040449	Betty is very sweet and kind! I felt welcomed the moment I arrived, and she is conscious about the quality of food she prepares. I now have a really wonderful Friend and a place to stay when I travel to Seattle. Thank you!
12779	1483944	9.0	10.0	13169740	"Staying at Betty place was a real pleasure! She is a great host, really polite, and considerate. We were made to feel right at home. 

About the flat, it was tidy and very clean. Moreover it's a great location to explore Seattle. So, everything was perfect.

Well, we definitely recommend anyone to stay at this place, and meet Betty and his son!"
12780	1483944	9.0	10.0	13523248	Betty was a really nice host! The room was clean, tidy and private - everything you want! Perfect place to stay and if you want you are always invited to do stuff with the family.
12781	1483944	9.0	10.0	14690554	"Betty was a gracious host who made me me feel right at home.  The bedroom and sitting room were clean and roomy, as was the private bathroom.  I enjoyed the delicious ""Dutch Baby"" Betty served for breakfast, and appreciated her home's convenient location near many places of interest.  "
12782	1483944	9.0	10.0	15328081	Betty's place was wonderful. It was well organized, spacious, and quiet. Betty was the best host you could ask for. Her breakfast was tasty, and she was generous with her time and space. She made our fourth of July weekend so much fun!
12783	1483944	9.0	10.0	16508251	Our short one night stay at Betty's home was very pleasant. Betty was responsive and very accommodating to our late check-in and early checkout... She even had a healthy breakfast for us!  The home is in a safe residential neighborhood and conveniently located for easy freeway access!  
12784	1483944	9.0	10.0	16630355	"Betty is an awesome host, very kind and attentive to guest. The stay includes breakfast, which was cooked very well.
The room is very clean, comfortable, house has all the necessary amenities. So all in all I really enjoyed staying here."
12785	1483944	9.0	10.0	16892362	"A great base location for our sty inSeattle.  Betty was helpful with recommendations for places to eat ant things to see, as well as parking hints.  The room was comfortable and a nutritious and tasty breakfast each day was a real treat.  We enjoyed our morning conversations while Betty prepared our breakfast.  Be sure to ask her about a ""wheat grass shot"" or one of her healthy smoothies-- both were surprisingly delicious!"
12786	1483944	9.0	10.0	17594998	Betty was a good host and was willing to work with us on our travel time. We came into town for a late baseball game. The room was clean and inviting. She made a delicious breakfast in the morning for everyone.
12787	1483944	9.0	10.0	17647631	We had a wonderful stay at Betty's home. The bed was very comfortable, and she made us an AMAZING breakfast in the morning with delicious fresh fruit. We wish that we could have stayed longer!
12788	1483944	9.0	10.0	17780791	We had a great stay in Betty's house for 2 nights. Betty is so nice, her breakfasts are so wonderful. Betty's home is quiet and comfort. The room is very clean. The travelers we met at Betty's home are also very nice. It's really a beautiful memory in US. Thanks, Betty!
12789	1483944	9.0	10.0	18249421	This is the first real B&B that I've booked through airbnb, and it was lovely. Betty is generous and accommodating, and her home is bright and peaceful. We enjoyed getting to know Betty over her healthful breakfasts - a great way to start each day. We would stay here again.
12790	1483944	9.0	10.0	18596194	Our stay at Betty's home was wonderful. The house is located at the end of a very peaceful residential street. The room and bathroom were clean, well stocked and both the bed and the couch were very comfortable. And the breakfast! Betty is a superb cook and everything is organic and/or homemade. Do ask for her delicious chia porridge topped with homemade almond milk and a wonderful assortment of fruits and nuts! Betty makes you feel very welcome and it was lovely to chat with her over breakfast each morning. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
12791	1483944	9.0	10.0	18693178	Betty and her son were great hosts and the breakfast was awesome.  
12792	1483944	9.0	10.0	18846378	"Betty and her son were fantastic an gracious hosts. The room was great- comfy beds, big bathroom and lots of natural light. 

The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. Her place is easily accessible by transit that let's you get anywhere in the city in a quick manner. 

And her breakfast was delicious. She's a pleasure to chat with in the morning. I couldn't recommend her place enough!"
12793	1483944	9.0	10.0	19005914	Betty and her son were great hosts. They made me feel at home from day one. The room was spacious and very clean. Their lovely house is located in a residential area north of Downtown Seattle.  No need to rent a car. Public transportation is pretty reliable. I'd love to stay at Betty's again in the future.
12794	1483944	9.0	10.0	19182844	My wife and I wanted a place to stay close to all our favorite Green Lake/ Ballard stomping grounds before we relocate for work. Betty was quick to respond (same day) and host us for the weekend. As our first AirBNB booking, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and right off our room, and it was quiet so we got plenty of sleep. Being located at the end of a dead end made it safe and private but just minutes from the main roads. We would definitely stay again with Betty if we come to town for a visit. 
12795	1483944	9.0	10.0	19558069	I had a nice experience, never got the chance to actually meet Betty.  The room/bathroom were clean. The room was a little cold for my liking. 
12796	1483944	9.0	10.0	20571012	Listing was accurate, yes.  Neighborhood pleasant,  near North Seattle Community College and I-5.  For the recommended exit off I-5, do not find yourself on the express lane, however.
12797	1483944	9.0	10.0	21794388	Betty greeted me and showed me my room, bathroom etc. She was pleasant and welcoming and the bedroom, bathroom and common areas were clean and well kept.  I was just there for 10 hours so had relatively little interaction. Place was on cul de sac and in quiet, pleasant neighborhood.  Very easy to reach from I-5.
12798	1483944	9.0	10.0	21914544	Neighborhood was very nice, and location easy to find.  We found a wonderful Italian restaurant nearby to have dinner while waiting to connect with our host.
12799	1483944	9.0	10.0	23107834	"My husband and I stayed with Betty and Frankie for a month while work was being done on our house. She is friendly, communicative, and laid-back - I feel really lucky we found a place to stay nearby where we felt comfortable and could take the bus to work easily.  A month is a long time to be away from home!

Another bonus is that private room is quite and has plenty of storage space (which was perfect for our long term stay.) There is a large, bright kitchen for guests who may want to make their own meals. Betty is an excellent cook herself - I regret not being much of a breakfast person because I enjoyed what I did taste of her cooking/baking :)

I should also mention that the area is quaint and beautiful - I enjoyed several walks in the neighborhood. "
12800	1483944	9.0	10.0	23304694	Betty was a wonderful host and her place was lovely, clean, and comfortable! The location was perfect for us because family was just across the street. I should add that Betty's breakfasts were great and she was savvy about accommodating the needs of my gluten sensitive daughter without blinking an eye! We readily recommend this warm and friendly home. 
12801	1483944	9.0	10.0	23394695	Betty's hospitality started with checking for food/breakfast preferences prior to our arrival, and continued to accomodating our arrival and departure times. Her home was located in a quiet easily accessible neighborhood that was so convenient for the things we needed to do in downtown Seattle. Our room was lovely-clean, quiet, and comfortable and had everything we needed. I would definitely love to return if the opportunity arises!
12802	1483944	9.0	10.0	24434205	Very welcoming home and hostess! Super comfortable room and great breakfast. It's home away from home for me; have stayed twice now and will again.
12803	1483944	9.0	10.0	25516548	Home away from home...Betty is like family. It was our third stay there and we will continue to return.
12804	1483944	9.0	10.0	26576310	Betty was a wonderful host! Both her and her son were very welcoming and open. If we wanted space they would give it to us, but if we wanted to interact with them they were great conversationalists. And Betty's chia porridge was delicious, unlike anything I've had before. Overall great stay!
12805	1483944	9.0	10.0	27094041	"Betty's place was perfect. Exactly what I needed at the end of a busy day. Quiet, private and very comfortable. The room is spacious and bright.  Betty is a lovely person whom I regret I did not have enough time to spend chatting but she was very sweet to understand. 
She is a wonderful host and makes everyone feel at home.  I look forward to returning in June with my husband."
12806	1483944	9.0	10.0	28551872	Betty greeted us and provided the things we needed for a night there.  Her son actually originally let us in as she was at work, and he is very sweet as well.  After walking to find Green Lake on our own and failing, he helped us with the simple directions to it.  We totally enjoyed walking around the lake and having dinner at a local chowder house along the lake.  Very relaxing after a day of driving!  In the morning she made us and the other guest there a yummy chia porridge breakfast.  She was busy getting ready for the day making her raw foods and we felt like we got a great education in that as well.  Her sweet open personality and gracious hospitality just made us feel comfortable and cozy.  At this point we're thrilled to have found Airbnb and this way of traveling to see our sons.
12807	1483944	9.0	10.0	29249791	Wonderful place to stay - nice and cosy room and a great host! Betty, again many thanks for your warm welcome and the marvellous breakfasts you surprised us with every morning!! I do hope we'll be able to come back again!
12808	1483944	9.0	10.0	29986379	The listing was just as described by others.  It's a very comfortable home in a good quiet neighborhood.  Betty is a very good host.  She made a warm and healthy breakfast every morning for us.  It is a relaxed and warm home setting that we definitely recommend.
12809	1483944	9.0	10.0	30704754	The room was comfy, the bed more so.  Pillows are key for me and they were great as well.  My Daughter slept on the futon and like that as well.  Betty is very sweet and charming.  Enjoyed our stay!
12810	1483944	9.0	10.0	31263026	Quiet street, clean room. Keys where not where they were supposed to be at check-in. Spacious driveway area for parking.
12811	1483944	9.0	10.0	32252318	"We both consider this airbnb one of the best in North Seattle.  Our third stay here.  The host(ess) is warm, friendly, helpful, flexible.  She truly cares about her guests.  Breakfasts rate an A+, morning after morning.  Food is healthy and nutricious.
"
12812	1483944	9.0	10.0	32759386	Betty is an amazing and gracious host! She tended to all of our needs, especially with our 1 year old. The neighborhood is very quiet and within walking distance to shops and parks. We came at a beautiful time with all of the flowers blooming. We definitely recommend Betty and using Airbnb again!
12813	1483944	9.0	10.0	32949461	"Betty made it super easy for us to ""check in"" at the house even though we were unsure of what time traffic would let us arrive. We stayed in the room closest to the downstairs entrance, which was perfect since my roommate and I came home late from dinner. Betty is wonderful and very hospitable. She even offered to cook us breakfast! The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and super close to Green Lake, where there's a great walking/running path. Would definitely stay here again. "
12814	1483944	9.0	10.0	33509108	It was a great experience. Betty was so nice. She made delicious dishes for breakfast. The room was organized and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. In general, this place is recommended.
12815	1483944	9.0	10.0	34096915	The room is nice and the bathroom fine. Breakfast was great and Betty is easygoing and friendly. If you are going to bed before 10 or 11 pm, you should know that you can hear a lot of what is happening elsewhere in the house, including voices and footsteps.  We stayed with our baby so were in bed pretty early. Overall the experience was good. 
12816	1483944	9.0	10.0	34935884	Betty has hosting down to a science. We were very comfortable and the house is clean and lovely. But it is her sense of hospitality that comes through loud and clear. We truly enjoyed our stay.  Highly recommend this location which is a short walk to the lake and an easy bus ride to the city center. 
12817	1483944	9.0	10.0	37188864	"Betty was very friendly and sweet! We stayed for a week and she cooked great breakfast for us every morning, and they are so yummy! Betty was also very generous and would share a lot of stuff with us. The room downstairs gets a little hot as we were in ""the hottest summer"" in Seattle history, but if you open the window cool air gets in and that will make you feel comfortable. Best to have two people in this nice room.

I highly recommend Betty's place. Staying with a great host was a wonderful experience."
12818	1483944	9.0	10.0	37703554	Betty has a warmly heart,  and served delicious breakfast. The room was nice and clean, it was convenient to  take bus  to downtown and airport. We lived there for three happy days with betty, thanks.
12819	1483944	9.0	10.0	38200219	It was a very pleasant experience staying here. Everything is perfect and clean. The host will even prepare breakfast for us. We are very happy that we stayed here.
12820	1483944	9.0	10.0	39298920	"Betty gave us a warm welcome but gave us privacy when needed. The neighbourhood was quiet and had eclectic houses to look at.  The park nearby was great for walking, swimming, and we even saw a play. Because we had a car, and  she was conveniently located near two major arteries of the city,  we could get around easily. She provided travel information when needed and was kind and respectful.   At one point it was really hot and the air conditioning was a great relief.
Her breakfasts were something to look forward to.  Fresh juice, waffles, omelates, fruit and we learned about raw eating.    I  also liked the separate entrance and the bathroom to ourselves.  The room was clean and spacious.  It gave us everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.  "
12821	1483944	9.0	10.0	39949061	Betty was very friendly and helpful. She cooked some very good breakfasts and made us feel welcome. The location was great as we were able to catch a bus downtown so we could leave our vehicle at her place. We would definitely recommend this B & B!
12822	1483944	9.0	10.0	45365733	"My wife and I stayed at Betty’s B&B for the month of August. We stayed in the first floor bedroom, which has its own bath. She also has an upstairs room to offer. 



There are many good things to be said about this place, not the least of which is Betty herself. Like any good host, she is very helpful and hospitable. But more than that, she is unfailingly cheerful and friendly and does her best to accommodate reasonable requests. In addition, she prepares wonderful breakfasts for her guests, up until 8:30 AM. These vary from day to day but are always tasty and healthful. 



The house itself is relatively new, on a very quiet residential street and close to bus stops for buses (the 16 and the 48) that go downtown, to the U-District, Ballard or Wallingford. It is less than a mile walk from the north end of Green Lake.  



The kitchen, like the living room, is a shared room. It is well-equipped and roomy. If you’re planning a long-term stay, like we did, or plan to use the kitchen to cook in, you may find that you need to ask Betty to make space in the fridge and on a cupboard shelf for you. When asked, she was more than cooperative. Another thing about the kitchen, which is on the second floor, is that it is adjacent to a wrap-around patio. This is one of the nicest features of the house. There is a hot tub on the patio and numerous bird feeders. The house has a screen of trees most of the way around, which lends it a feeling of semi-privacy. 



The bed in our downstairs room was adequate. It has one window. It lacks bed stands next to the bed, as well as a TV, but one is available in the living room upstairs. There is ample closet space to hang clothes in and a good-sized chest of drawers. There were not enough clothes hangers, so we purchased some ourselves. The downstairs bedroom has its own bathroom but it is not en-suite. The bathroom has cupboard storage and a roomy shower stall but no tub. 



All in all, Betty’s house is a good choice for someone on a budget who wants to stay in a residential north Seattle neighborhood and does not mind using shared facilities."
12823	1483944	9.0	10.0	46002011	Betty was a wonderful host. We had breakfast our first morning and it was so good!  Easy walk to the express bus on Aurora which got us downtown quickly and cost much less than parking would have.
14151	2966415	9.0	9.0	12908724	Nicolas was great and a very responsive host.  He also seemed quite interesting so am sorry that we didn't have more time to get to know him (we were on a tight schedule)...  Re the space, our room and bath were quite clean, the bed comfortable, and we had full access to the kitchen to make coffee.  Nice morning light.  His duplex is on a steep hillside with a long outdoor stairway to reach the entry (no problem for us but  I mention since it might be an issue for some).  The neighborhood is central but quiet.   Restaurants and a bakery/coffee house nearby as was the Arboretum. Overall a nice place to be.
14152	2966415	9.0	9.0	13019271	Nicolas has a beautiful place in a quiet neighborhood only about twenty minutes by bus outside of downtown Seattle. I unfortunately didn't get to meet Nicolas during my visit, but he was very helpful in arranging my arrival and making sure I could access my room. The room is quiet and private and has both a private bathroom and closet. I hope to stay with (and finally meet) Nicolas again in the future. 
14153	2966415	9.0	9.0	13111353	Great location to walk to restaurants on Madison and Capitol Hill. The room was spotless, as was the rest of the apartment. The only negative is that the bed is a little small for 2 people, perfect for one.
14154	2966415	9.0	9.0	13290369	Nice, clean, and quiet house. The house with a long stairway on the hill has a good view. The guestroom and bath were clean. The bed in the guestroom was good to me. But, some basics such as soap, hand towel, hangers or dresser, and etc. were not prepared in the guestroom during my first stay. Nicolas is a nice and kind host. 
14155	2966415	9.0	9.0	13518460	My second stay in his house was much better than before since I already have an experience. The guestroom was more prepared with the basics. Nice, clean, and quiet house and guestroom. Nicolas is a nice and kind host. 
14156	2966415	9.0	9.0	13771560	Staying at Nicolas's was great! The room is comfortable with a queen bed. Nicolas is  vey friendly. The room is right by the door, so can go in and out freely. Would recommend 5/5!
14157	2966415	9.0	9.0	14288597	Everything about this was exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted. It was a great little guest room in a beautiful house just outside the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Also, parking was plentiful and the accommodations were very clean. (Be warned though that it's about four blocks down an ENORMOUS hill, so if you're unused to walking uphill this may not be the place for you.)
14158	2966415	9.0	9.0	14524855	Maybe we were just unlucky, but we did not have such a good experience staying with Nicolas. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned after the previous people, although when we met Nicolas he was extremely apologetic and immediately cleaned the bathroom for us. The room is private and whilst that suited us, it would also have been nice to feel more welcome, for example there was no welcome message and interaction with Nicolas was minimal. 
14159	2966415	9.0	9.0	15176600	Nicolas's house is clean and comfortable.  It is in a safe neighborhood and close to many shops and bus lines.  There was soap and shampoo available, and two large towels as well. I enjoyed my stay.
14160	2966415	9.0	9.0	15333343	Nicolas was a kind host in letting my boyfriend and I stay at his place during the holiday weekend while he was away. He even tended to an emergency situation that we were very thankful for. His house is very clean and the room he provides is very private by being on the bottom floor with its own with a bathroom. All the bedding and towels were provided. One small thing to note is that there is quite a long flight of stairs walking up to the home. As for location, it felt as if it were 10-15 mins from everything we went to go sightsee, including downtown, which was perfect for myself, as it was my first time visiting Seattle.  
14161	2966415	9.0	9.0	15820428	"Nicolas' place was perfect for our week-long stay in Seattle! The room is away from the rest of the living space and right next to the door so coming and going is very easy. There were towels provided. We were there for a week so we had to get some other necessities like shampoo and conditioner for ourselves but that was to be expected. We didn't get a chance to meet Nicolas but that's fine, we weren't around much anyways.

The location was very good for us; it's a nice, quiet neighborhood and is within walking distance of the Capitol Hill area and about a 10-15 minute car ride to downtown and a number of other areas. Other reviewers mentioned his place is down a very steep hill and that the place is up many stairs, they aren't kidding! You'll get a pretty good workout traversing the area on foot.

Overall our stay at Nicolas' was great and I would recommend it to anyone just looking for a basic private room and bathroom. "
14162	2966415	9.0	9.0	16506928	It was great to stay with Nicolas for four days. He was welcoming and accommodating  to my boyfriend and me. His house is beautiful and not too far from the main attractions. We took a short cab ride to most places. Nicolas allowed us to use the kitchen and living area. Additionally, he addressed any concerns or questions we had. I would definitely stay there again!
14163	2966415	9.0	9.0	17095549	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Nicolas' place. It was clean, comfortable and quiet.  Nicolas was also a very friendly host, although we didn't see one another very often due to both of our work and outside activity schedules. But he was nice and also helpful whenever I needed anything. I would highly recommend his place and will hope to stay there again the next time I am in Seattle.
14164	2966415	9.0	9.0	19100746	My stay with Nicolas was great! Private, comfortable, and accommodating. Great location too!
14165	2966415	9.0	9.0	19884262	I didn't get to meet Nicolas, but the room was clean and nice. And the private bathroom and entrance were great. The house is in a quiet neighborhood, but still walking distance from Capitol Hill. Overall, it was a perfect choice for me.
14166	2966415	9.0	9.0	32226101	The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14167	2966415	9.0	9.0	33028401	Nico provided a quiet and private room w/ bathroom. An excellent environment for my first week of a new job.
14168	2966415	9.0	9.0	35315393	Nicolas and Jeanna were perfect hosts for my trip to Seattle.  They communicated clearly and their property was clean and as depicted.  It's a great location in Seattle, central to just about everything.  
14169	2966415	9.0	9.0	35724998	On the whole journey, we didn't see Nicolas and Jeanna. However, when we texted him our request, they can satisfy our needs. But sincerely, the bed is not large enough for 2 girls. The accommodation is good but the location is not perfect if you don't have a car. 
14170	2966415	9.0	9.0	36198913	Everything was perfect; hosts were fine, accommodations were exactly as listed (with the surprise inclusion of a good upright piano!).  Comfortable bed, quiet, slept fine, etc.  Neighborhood is beautiful.  
14171	2966415	9.0	9.0	40214683	The room is nice, compact and very private. The bed is comfortable. I had a longer stay in the room (4 weeks) and Nicolas and Jeanna were very helpful at providing what I needed during my stay. The house is located in a quiet residential area in Seattle, but still in close proximity to supermarkets, bars and restaurants. It is well connected to downtown by few bus lines, but I also liked the picturesque walk through Pike and Pine street. Overall it was a great choice to stay here. 
14172	2966415	9.0	9.0	45403462	The room was perfect for what me and my friend were looking for. It was in a quiet neighborhood, had its own bathroom and felt very private and comfortable. It was also pretty close to downtown. I would definitely stay there again. 
14173	2966415	9.0	9.0	46212453	"Jeanna and Nicolas were lovely and gracious hosts.  I didn't see that much of them but when I did they made sure things were okay and that I had what I needed.

The room itself is very neat and very comfortable.  There was plenty of space for storage and a nice big bathroom.

The location is quite good too.  Close to two different bus routes as well as a night bus.  Even if you miss the bus, it's a short $10 Taxi ride from downtown or a 30-40 minute walk if you're feeling up to it.

I highly recommend this room for anyone planning on visiting Seattle."
14174	2966415	9.0	9.0	46947665	Great room.  As described.  I was out for most of the days there and didn't get a chance to meet Nicolas and Jeanna in person but they made arrival/departure very convenient.  
14175	2966415	9.0	9.0	48501123	"This is a lovely room, in a great location.  I came over from the UK for a week-long conference and had a great stay.

There's a good-sized closet for storing bulky luggage and hanging clothes, and the en-suite bathroom is a huge plus for convenience.

The room was clean and comfortable, and with a bonus piano (I don't play, but it made me smile).  It's a quiet location too, you won't have any problem getting a good sleep.

Up the (steep!) hill at E. Madison there are some coffee shops and restaurants, and a Safeway which is handy for any day-to-day stuff you might have forgotten.  There are buses from E. Madison to downtown, and of course Seattle has Uber.  I waited 4 mins max for any booking, it was super-fast.

I recommend this place - I'd stay here again if I was over in Seattle again for a conference.
"
14176	2966415	9.0	9.0	49746086	This place served its purpose. My husband and I wanted a quick weekend in Seattle and all we needed was a bed and a bathroom. It was nice to have a private entrance and get the key out of a lock and not have to wait for the host to let us in. They gave us towels, shampoo, conditioner, and provided water to drink. The place was clean and presentable. Wifi was unstable. 
14177	2966415	9.0	9.0	51815103	The listing was described accurately.
16425	1521633	9.0	9.0	6743851	The apartment is spacious and clean. It gets plenty of sun and feels really warm especially in the afternoon. Melissa is a great host. She went to shop for a new towel when I asked for one. It was also very kind of her to introduce me to other long-term properties when she knew I was looking for one. Overall, very happy stay! 
16426	1521633	9.0	9.0	6832652	"Melissa was very responsive and the apartment is in a great location. It was also clean and large...but not quiet (dump trucks in the alley early in the morning). We stayed there on a hot week in Seattle and the apartment was very stuffy. It's nothing fancy but worked for a cheapish stay in the city. 

We were only given one roll of toilet paper for three nights, which I unfortunately didn't realize until mid-night. Luckily we had toilet paper in our car that my husband was able to run down and get. Also, there were no paper towels to clean up messes in the kitchen. "
16427	1521633	9.0	9.0	17110158	"The apartment was clean, quiet and fairly large (400 square feet). It was indeed a 3 minute walk to campus as well as a major bus stop, the university restaurant scene and a Trader Joe's. The kitchen had basic pots and pans. I think this is definitely a better option than staying in the (overpriced) local hotels for people visiting UW.

There were a few (small) negatives. The apartment was not ready until an hour after I arrived. They were vacuuming (apparently there had been a power outage). The outside of the complex is a bit run down.  The kitchen could have been better appointed (I had to go and buy paper towels). There was no AC, but that is usually not a problem in Seattle.

But overall, a really solid experience. I would definitely recommend."
16428	1521633	9.0	9.0	17306643	Melissa was very helpful.  The place is comfortable, clean, and in a terrific neighborhood.  There's no A/C, which is not a big deal.  Also would be nice if there were an iron already in the unit.  But I definitely recommend renting this place.
16429	1521633	9.0	9.0	17423712	We stayed in Melissa's apartment for 1 night and although Melissa was highly efficient at communicating, for us this place was very much the epitimy of over priced mediocrity. The pictures shown did accurately reflect, however the complex was on an estate, the curtains didn't cover the entirety of the window space and due to the air con being installed so you couldn't shut the window we had to endure the noises of various people breaking glass rummaging through the outside dumpster all night. This is the first negative experience we have had, so writing a negative review is not something we do often.  However we do wish to stress that this might have just been an unlucky experience for us and the apartment may be in the process of being improved, if not then just be aware that it is in a good location but that comes at a price. 
16430	1521633	9.0	9.0	40973749	Apartment was exactly as listed. Nice location and Melissa was very accommodating!
16431	1521633	9.0	9.0	41637732	"My stay at Melissa's apartment was great. It isn't anything fancy, but it was spacious and a 15-min walk to the UW med school where I was attending a conference (and a short walk in the other direction to Trader Joe's). There are only very basic amenities so you'll need to stock up if you're staying longer than a couple days. There was some noise outside, but nothing that kept me from sleeping. The fan kept the temperature comfortable for the most part - it was kind of hot one day when it was over 90 degrees outside, but that's unavoidable in that kind of weather (my apartment in SF has the exact same problem). It's at the top of a 3-story apartment complex, so you'll have to hike up with your luggage, but it's in a corner and felt private even though there were often other people hanging around elsewhere in the complex.

I didn't really interact with Melissa much, because everything went smoothly with checking in, checking out, and everything in between. When we did talk, she was polite and responsive. Overall, I'd recommend this apartment as a good alternative to a hotel, especially if you're staying for long enough to want a place where you can feel settled in."
16432	1521633	9.0	9.0	49826335	The location is very convenient for going to UW, but we didn't get a parking place because the lots has all been signed. We had to walk a long way everyday just for parking. The living condition is fine but not high standard, but the apartment met our requirement. 
17093	6249536	9.0	9.0	53260226	Melissa Yao is a nice host who is really helpful and cares for the experience of your living. Besides, the apartment is clean and neat, highly recommended.
17124	8155710	9.0	10.0	56091202	It's a spacious and quiet place. Close to shops and restaurants. Nice stay.
17125	8155710	9.0	10.0	56861695	The host let me know what to expect on the day I arrive (eg: a hackathon) so there were lots of people around, which was cool. I was in and out quite a bit so I met up with the host towards the end of the day when I was all settled in. The listing is basically accurate, right by University of Washington and pretty much one of the more convenient/quiet locations.
17158	7809718	9.0	10.0	44048267	"Meg's home was comfy and kid friendly. You could tell it was under remodeling and a there were a few parts that weren't quite finished, but the important stuff was done. The parking is on a one-way street with a permit provided by Meg. I had no issues finding parking, but the home was on a one-way street so if you overshoot the home you might have a little walk or need to make a loop.  There was a sweet welcome basket and a guidebook waiting for us when we arrived. Plenty of towels to go around and space in the fridge for a few snacks or a beverage. The garden was flourishing with goodies, but I didn't get a chance to go out in the inviting backyard this time. Maybe next time!

Close to the highway and a short drive from the heart of Seattle. Meg was a delight to work with and very responsive making our trip to Seattle a delight."
17159	7809718	9.0	10.0	45211896	Both Meg and Max were excellent hosts. Our stay here was very comfortable and convenient. They had an accurate description of their home and its features. The location was very walkable to several attractions. It was especially nice that our 1 year old son had a room/crib all to himself. Furthermore, they were extremely flexible regarding our check out. I had an interview that ended up lasting much longer than anticipated, and Meg and Max were very accommodating. Overall, I am very happy with my experience. Thank you Meg and Max!
17160	7809718	9.0	10.0	49069710	"Meg was a wonderful host. I just finished the bottle of wine she had waiting there for us. 

Great location and great experience. 

Yaaaaaassss!"
17161	7809718	9.0	10.0	51967360	This was a wonderful home to stay in, especially great for our toddler.  We love the little nook under the TV with all of the toys to play with.  Even though they are living in the house, they did a great job of putting away/hiding their personal belongings.  It didn't feel cluttered, but still had all of the necessities we needed.  We enjoyed hanging out in the back yard, the spacious living room, and walking to Amazing Thai for dinner.  Thank you!
17162	7809718	9.0	10.0	53254128	"Awesome location, love the neighborhood, very kid friendly! 

Thank you for making our week in Seattle wonderful! I was in town for work and brought my 2 kids and my mom so that they could hang out with my sister and her 2 kids who live a few blocks away. The house was very comfortable, clean and PERFECT for the little ones. The toys and crib and kid friendly kitchen supplies were really helpful. The location was perfect and we walked to the University District Safeway to stock up on some food for the week and I loved being in a neighborhood. Meg met us at check in and was professional and kind. She left a great guidebook with some maps and clear instructions. We would love to stay here again!"
18321	444221	9.0	9.0	1593899	It was great dealing with Monika - she was very flexible and a great host - we hope to be able to work with her again with future employee stays in Seattle!
18322	444221	9.0	9.0	1642480	I had a fantastic experience in the Cherry Hill House! Monika was a very polite and thoughtful hostess, and she kept me posted with all sorts of useful information for my stay. Everything was very neat and clean, the appliances were working, and I loved the artistic touches throughout the house. All in all a great place to stay, highly recommended!
18323	444221	9.0	9.0	1658810	"Didn't meet Monika, but was very happy staying at Cherry Hill. It is well positioned - i really loved Seattle! - and everything was good. 
I wish i had been able to stay longer...who knows, maybe on the way home?"
18324	444221	9.0	9.0	1755996	I needed a place to stay in Seattle - cheap, close to downtown and Capitol Hill, and safe. Monika's place was all that. Great communication, great location, and very nice neighbors. I would stay with Monika again. Thank you!
18325	444221	9.0	9.0	1773230	Monika's place is quiet, convenient, and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay.
18326	444221	9.0	9.0	2099457	Monika is a great, responsive host.  Place is in a convenient location off street, so no traffic noise and very clean.  Other guests were friendly and quiet; making the experience even better.
18327	444221	9.0	9.0	2243244	"Great house and a great host. The location is pretty good especially for the price.

One thing to note is the house has cats, I'm allergic so normally that's a problem for me but the cats don't seem to spend much time indoors so I didn't have any problems."
18328	444221	9.0	9.0	2287914	Monika is really nice, the kitties are adorable. The room was clean and spacious.
18329	444221	9.0	9.0	2312763	"We loved our stay in this artsy house in a charming neighborhood.  Monica and her roommate were super flexible about check-in time.  The room was small but tidy and comfortable.  It's close to the kitchen that's used by the rest of the house, so if you're a sensitive sleeper and want to sleep late, you may want to use earplugs.  Also, there's 1 bathroom (with toilet, shower, and laundry) in the 3 bedroom house, so this is not the place for long luxurious showers if you're into that thing.
Monica provided us with a great manual with guidelines for the house, directions from the airport, and other useful information that made everything really easy.  She's also got bikes for rent, which we were really excited about, but unfortunately, the bike lock key had been lost so we were unable to use them.  Other than that, everything was great!  And you cannot beat that price!  I'd definitely stay here again!   "
18330	444221	9.0	9.0	2314868	Monika was great, the room was great, the bed was great, the vibe was great, the bus ride into town was full of insane people and students and professionals alike. I enjoyed coming and going from the house, it made this stay in Seattle a very happy memory! thanks Monika.
18331	444221	9.0	9.0	2944182	Monika did a wonderful job of working with me when I was trying to book this at the last minute...she was friendly, detailed and flexible! It is a great room with a desk, very clean kitchen, clean bathroom with cool clawfoot tub/shower, and nice people! It was like a small, tidy youth hostel.  I would second the earlier review that if you're a light-sleeper to bring ear plugs - sound travels easily through walls, but everyone was respectful of quiet hours so I didn't have any issues in this area. I will definitely stay here again!
18332	444221	9.0	9.0	3112401	Everyone was really friendly and welcoming. The walls have cool art on them. The cat was fuzzy and nice. The bathtub was really cool. Having a nice kitchen next to the room was super convenient. Within walking distance of lots of cool stuff. Good stay!
18333	444221	9.0	9.0	3176890	Very well located. You can take the bus downtown or even walk if you feel like it! The house was cozy and clean. Monika was friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place! 
18334	444221	9.0	9.0	3314913	My trip to Seattle was incredibly busy, and I didn't really get to meet Monika or Erin, but the room was excellent, and the house was really welcoming. The guide provided to get to the house, and the info provided was thorough and very useful.  I enjoyed my stay immensely, and would really recommend the Cherry Hill House!!
18335	444221	9.0	9.0	3324951	The accommodations were exactly as advertised! Monika was fantastic with getting back to me and answering my inquiries. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment to send guests her way. =)
18336	444221	9.0	9.0	3379103	My trip kept me pretty busy, so I didn't get a chance to chat much with Erinn or Monika, but the room and house were tidy, quiet, and comfortable; the cat was very sweet, and check-in and check-out logistics were prompt and smooth (helped out by the very helpfully detailed instructions for each). I would stay here again, and recommend it to others.
18337	444221	9.0	9.0	3422775	The room and house were great. Everyone there was nice and helpful. Its location is superb. For example, it's a few blocks away from Ezell's, which cooks Oprah's favorite fried chicken. Supposedly she has it sent to her in Chicago, it's that good. Besides the proximity to this institution, the house itself is great- a truly welcoming abode.
18338	444221	9.0	9.0	3512445	Everyone at the Cherry Hill house was wonderful and friendly and fantastic. The room itself was clean and cute, and the shared areas of the house had great vibes. It's in an excellent, laid back neighborhood, walkable, awesome takeout everywhere, lots of big sprawling gardens, etc etc. We were sad to leave and would recommend a stay for anyone taking a peek at this listing.

All coordinating factors were a breeze.
The room was cozy.
All around a welcoming, sweet experience!"
18340	444221	9.0	9.0	3586022	The room was great and the roomies were nice! Thanks for providing a comfortable stay!
18341	444221	9.0	9.0	3603199	Nice location, good bus access to downtown. Friendly people around and a quiet place for some sleep.
18342	444221	9.0	9.0	3729904	Great again, nice location, quiet and easy bus access. Thanks!
18343	444221	9.0	9.0	3742878	This was my first time using Airbnb, finding the Cherry Hill house was easy, the room was great, the people were awesome, and the cat was sweet and friendly! 
18344	444221	9.0	9.0	3797298	As always, the house in Cherry Hill was a wonderful place to lay our heads during our vacation. It's a no brainer for my friend and I to stay at Monika's - everyone we encounter at the house is friendly, accommodating and helpful, the house is clean and well equipped, and it's close to everywhere we want to go. I will definitely be returning!
18345	444221	9.0	9.0	4608336	"I stayed at Cherry Hill House for 2 months for an internship downtown and could not have asked for a better experience! The room was perfect for studying and having some privacy, but it was great to live in a furnished house and still meet other people while in town! Erinn and Monika were both great hosts- always responding quickly to questions and keeping the place tidy. 

Everyone that came and went during my time there were all very respectful of the house rules and keeping things quiet during the late p.m. and early a.m. hours.  I never ran into a problem with using the bathroom even with a number of people living there, and I had plenty of room to store my groceries in the kitchen.

I would definitely recommend this for an extended or brief stay as a student if you want to be within busing/walking distance to downtown, but want to "
18346	444221	9.0	9.0	4923705	It's a great place with fun people and a relaxed atmosphere. Although a lot of people are living there everything is very well organized. I did not meet Monika but her housemates arranged everything. The bed was comfy and there is a lot space to store your stuff.  
18347	444221	9.0	9.0	6282476	I had a pleasant stay for 3 nights at the Cherry Hill House while apartment hunting.  I did not meet Monika, but she was in touch before I arrived to make sure all my questions were answered and I met Erinn when I arrived.  The house is in a quiet area and close to several bus lines.  Overall a nice place to stay.  
18348	444221	9.0	9.0	6455893	This room and location were both great! Erinn was a gracious host. The neighborhood is a little noisy when you have the windows open, but all in all this was a great place to stay for the price.
18349	444221	9.0	9.0	6516684	I only stayed here two nights, but it was just what I needed- affordable room and close to the bus lines.
18350	444221	9.0	9.0	6573472	"This was our first experience with airbnb. A good place to lay your head to sleep. I was hoping and thought there would be more of a 'community' at the house as there were other guests, but did not see anyone until the last morning and they were a very nice couple. Sure wished they would have arrived earlier :)

My only disappointment was in a single bath towel being left in our room. One bath towel for two people for two days seemed a little skimpy, but we made it work.

Thank you Monika"
18351	444221	9.0	9.0	6587672	My girlfriend and I stayed at Monika's house on our trip to the Olympic Penninsula and we had a great time while we were in Seattle. It was confusing at first when we arrived, about how to get in at the residence. But we managed and had the best night's sleep in over a week.
18352	444221	9.0	9.0	6648800	Monika was out of town when we came through, but was very gracious to check in with us before hand, leave us detailed directions, and make sure her housemate knew we were coming. Unfortunately, there was a party happening at the house late into the night that we stayed there, happening right next to the room that we were staying in, and we were both wiped out from travel and wanted a good night's rest. I saw that the House Rules mentioned quiet hours following 10pm, so was not expecting this, and we were not able to fall asleep until after 3:30am. I was very disappointed and would recommend that anyone who is considering this place check in with Monika beforehand to find out if there will be any nighttime activities, if you plan on getting any sleep.
18353	444221	9.0	9.0	6693249	It was a pleasant stay convenient to down town Seattle, Capitol Hill and 1st hill.  I never met Monika, but I did meet with Erin.  There were a few guests staying there which I did meet.  The place was clean and the rules were easy to follow.  I would stay there again. Steve
18354	444221	9.0	9.0	6728369	"We had a good time in Seattle thanks to monika.
The room is clean and it's very easy to go the city with the public transport. The district is quiet."
18355	444221	9.0	9.0	6868473	The Cherry Hill House is a perfect place to stay when visiting Seattle. The Location is great - just a few blocks from Capitol Hill and the bus stop is right across the street. It is even possible to walk almost everywhere if you feel like it. Erinn and Monika are great hosts. There are always a lot of people staying at the house but everything is clean and all the guests were really considerate regarding other sleeping guests. We would definitely stay at the Cherry Hill House again.
18356	444221	9.0	9.0	7032650	We mostly were just at the house at night, but we slept well and appreciated the comfiness of the room! Thanks!
18357	444221	9.0	9.0	7098456	I stayed for 2 nights, I slept well and bathroom was quite clean. I would recommend Monika's room to everyone who want a cozy place with a low price. 
18358	444221	9.0	9.0	7491489	I was in Seattle for five days for the on-site portion of my first term for a graduate program at UW. I decided to stay here because it seemed close to the university and the room had a desk - it was perfect! I pretty much had the kitchen and bathroom to myself and the room was comfortable and exactly what i needed. The house is super centrally located - near several bus lines and it was a 15 minute ride to campus during rush hour. I will definitely be back.
18359	444221	9.0	9.0	7501396	The reservation was canceled 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18360	444221	9.0	9.0	7501398	The reservation was canceled 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18361	444221	9.0	9.0	7611723	"I spent just a few days in Seattle, but I had a nice stay at Monika's place. The room is really affordable, clean (well, if you don't search lost things under the bed... :-) ) and the bed is comfy (i just missed the white curtain on the second window, I can see it on the picture, but it wasn't there..). Monika is a nice person and I felt welcome when I arrived. There is a house manual, so it's easy to find all information, about which bus to take and where to find next supermarket and starbucks :)
thank you :)"
18362	444221	9.0	9.0	7777851	This room met our needs for a one night stay. It is located in close proximity to great vegan and vegetarian restaurants( bonus for us) museums, the international district, and some rad dive bars. I enjoyed the garden in progress and even got to taste a home grown tomatos.  For the affordable price this was a good place. Because there is an open room rental  attached to the common area quiet hours are strictly observed.  I think we will splurge a few extra dollars next time and get a private rental. Before we arrived I read the email which states two keys are needed, but no location was gave pre arrive as to where to find the keys. We looked around the yard for awhile, then text Monika, who plainly stated via text, that the location of the key was part of the informational e-mail she sent me. I reread the e-mail a few times and still no luck with entrance key location.  After about 20 minutes of trying to find the key  Erin(the person who lives in the main house) came up the walk, showed us where the key was located, and let us in. A drawback of this room rental is the proximity to the kitchen. It was located right next to the kitchen and opposite the bathroom. The room is plane, but has all the necessities.  
18363	444221	9.0	9.0	10306304	Monika's place is nice and quiet despite a heavy AirBnb guest presence. Monika takes a hands-off approach that is ideal for those wanting privacy; I personally prefer a warm welcome, but know that I am free to go elsewhere and pay more than $45 nightly for that. You do get what you pay for: $2 full laundry loads, hidden keys to find at the start and replace at the end, and strict cleanup rules come along with the cheap room pretty damn close to downtown Seattle.
18364	444221	9.0	9.0	10414700	"Great location and easy to get to. Kind of a weird set up with the roommate--she didn't make us feel very welcome. The room was as expected. Clean. A nice place to sleep. Only problem was that the bedroom was missing a curtain over one window--in the morning there were people walking around outside so we didn't have a lot of privacy. 

Overall, recommended as a place to crash, but ask for a curtain."
18365	444221	9.0	9.0	10445416	Comfortable quiet place to crash. Room does need a curtain for privacy. Good proximity to lots of stuff. Was a little confusing on check in times and where stuff was, apparently missed an e-mail. Other than that, pleasurable cost effective stay.
18366	444221	9.0	9.0	10686939	The room was clean and had everything we needed except the back curtain others have mentioned. Was never clear on whether I needed to share the heater outside the room with the larger living area. In future I guess it would be something to clarify ahead of time since Monika wasn't there, and I only saw Erin once. Check in was a night frought with some anxiety as the manual which supposedly had everything I needed, didn't in fact tell me where the key was.  In future I would be a little more insistent and questioning especially about the key location until precise instructions *beyond the manual* are given. And whatever other issues one is concerned about from past reviewers. Otherwise the location was easy to get to, I was there for a conference downtown so didn't get to explore things in the neighborhood much except the small store down the road. I would stay again if on a similar budget and type of trip.
18367	444221	9.0	9.0	10754470	A place to sleep for budget travellers. Basic amenities provided. Host was not around, but her room mates were present. They were friendly.  
18368	444221	9.0	9.0	10773253	Location was quick and easy from my job site. Arrived quite late, checked in took a hot bath and climbed into bed. Room was cozy, mattress was firm, house was very quit. I slept great and even enjoyed the background noise of trains! Will stay again!
18369	444221	9.0	9.0	10882388	"For the purpose of my stay, this place was ideal! Very low admin, easy to find, good instructions! Friendly house mates but not over bearing!

Thanks monika, i will definitely recommend you to friends!"
18370	444221	9.0	9.0	10973106	Another great stay
18371	444221	9.0	9.0	11097047	Generally it is great! The white curtain is missing ... Also there are other Airbnb guests living in other rooms and carbins attached with the house, so sharing the only ONE single bathroom with 5 to 6 people means relatively long waiting time, especially in the morning
18372	444221	9.0	9.0	11136998	By mutual agreement following a telephone conversation the day of arrival, I did not stay in the home.
18373	444221	9.0	9.0	11325723	Fine place to crash and rest up for adventures around Seattle! Shared the one bathroom with 4-5 other folks which was a bit of a dance but manageable. 
18374	444221	9.0	9.0	12336771	It was a good experience. The place is clean and tidy. I would highly recommend it for a budget traveller. 
18375	444221	9.0	9.0	13827638	I was only at the house for one night, but the house was exactly what I was looking for at the time: a good place to crash before catching an early flight. Totally recommend it. 
18376	444221	9.0	9.0	13850430	"The room was what I expected - simple, clean, very comfortable bed and the area was quiet.
The neighbourhood is well served by transit which is good - i also walked from the accommodation to Pike Market and it took me one hour - good walk.
Monika responded promptly and Erinn was very helpful.
I would definitely stay there again.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I will be using it again an again.
C Meyer  June 2014"
18377	444221	9.0	9.0	13979679	"The room was amazing. It was very spacious, and had great lighting. While I never got the chance to meet the host, her housemate was very hospitable and knowledgeable. Out the front yard, there are very cute sculptures that greet you. 

You don't need a car to stay here. It's a great neighborhood that's accessible to public transit, as two bus routes stop within a block of the house (although they have varying frequencies, especially on Sunday). However, the neighborhood is relatively far from vital goods and services, but can still be accessed by walking. 
"
18378	444221	9.0	9.0	50137135	The room was clean and the bed comfortable. Monika was very responsive and accommodating. Great place to stay for a night or two! 
18379	444221	9.0	9.0	50516034	The location of this place was fantastic! We had our vehicle with us but ended up walking almost everywhere. Great coffee, restaurants, and bars were only about 10-20 minutes away. The room was clean and comfortable, and both Monika and Ryan were very accommodating and friendly. We would definitely love to come back and stay with them next time we're in Seattle. 
18380	444221	9.0	9.0	51387536	Monika's place worked very well for my brief one-night stay. I only saw her briefly when I arrived. The home is charming, the bed comfortable, and the neighborhood provided some bars/restaurants in modest walking distance. It is important to keep in mind other guests may be staying in other rooms rented through Airbnb; I had no problems with this, but just something of which to be aware. All in all, Monika's place provided me an affordable, quick, and relatively convenient stay during my brief time in Seattle. I would recommend to others, especially to someone on a brief stay in need of an affordable room.
18381	444221	9.0	9.0	51935093	The Cozy Bedroom was clean and comfortable.  It had everything I needed.   Although the kitchen was available I did not cook.  The location was within walking distance to Seattle University, where I was visiting.
18382	444221	9.0	9.0	52158355	Monika was not there but her housemate was available by text to answer any questions.
18383	444221	9.0	9.0	52508061	Good neighborhood, walking distance to downtown and lots of shops and restaurants.
18384	444221	9.0	9.0	53093180	It's not bad. The garden outside is unkempt. The metal bed frame is horrible. The rest is ok given the price.
18385	444221	9.0	9.0	53254408	Staying at Monika's was great! She sent me a very detailed message a week or so before our arrival which covered all the bases (How to find the home, how to gain access, which room was ours etc.) The room was just as described. It was easy to get an Uber driver to take us downtown and back. Would definitely stay again.
18386	444221	9.0	9.0	53749350	Monika told me how to get to the house, some stores located around house very thoroughly in advance, so I don't have to look into it. Location was 30-40 mins from the downtown by walk. Personally, I love the location and I walked to the downtown every day. Although I couldn't have chance to meet Monika, Manager was very nice.
18387	444221	9.0	9.0	54206690	This Airbnb is an adorable hotel in a convenient part of town. Everything was spotless and the place is run like a well oiled machine! 
18388	444221	9.0	9.0	54716857	I met with Ryan who was incredibly nice and helpful. The room and house was everything that was described. Very cute and cozy! The neighborhood is very quiet, easy access to bus stops and downtown. 
18389	444221	9.0	9.0	55074705	Everything was nice, we had room inside of the house, 'couse there are some small houses outside. Only one thing was annoying it's bed because any of your move was accompanied by creaking of the bed :(
18390	444221	9.0	9.0	55755610	Nice stay, and the caretaker was v very kind. Would stay again
18391	444221	9.0	9.0	56085270	This was a perfect place to stay for a night visiting Seattle. Thank you!
18392	444221	9.0	9.0	56195519	Monika and Ryan responded promptly to my request and messages.  I definitely appreciated them being so accommodating with regards to dropping luggage off early. The room was clean and just like the photos.  It was also very warm and cozy because it has its own heater as well! Very convenient location for Swedish Medical Center and the Capitol Hill neighborhood.
18393	444221	9.0	9.0	56351116	I stayed at Monika's place for a couple of days in the room inside the house. Although the weather was a bit dreary and cold (as to be expected in the winter), the place was warm and toasty. She sent instructions a couple of days before the stay, which made the process of getting in and finding the place very easy. I had a great stay with absolutely no issues.
18394	444221	9.0	9.0	56375397	I stayed in the Cozy bedroom which is located inside the house. Monika communicated all instructions well before my stay so I didn't have to ask any questions. The bed was very very creaky! Anytime you moved throughout the night it woke up the other person due to the creakiness. My main complaint. You could also hear if anyone else was in the house and the door closest to this bedroom was used a lot so I kept hearing someone come in and out throughout the morning- however, it is an older house and not much you can do about this. Didn't see Monika but saw Ryan as I was leaving. Fulfilled what we needed- a place to lay our heads but again it would be nice if the bed wasn't so creaky.
18395	444221	9.0	9.0	56634374	Ryan the house manager was very friendly.  Everything was as described in the detailed house rules.  Very clean and convenient location.   Would stay again. 
18396	444221	9.0	9.0	56701408	Great room. Monica sent all I needed before arriving so no many questions asked. Very clean inside. Front yard needs some light but other than that, nothing to complain. 
18397	444221	9.0	9.0	56874812	Excelent place. Very well located. Easy access from Pioneer Station (14 blocks, some of them uphill). You can also go walking. Rooms nice, very clean and a good kitchen where you can cook lot of thing. Also a good washing machine. There is a grocery store 2 blocks far from there. A very nice zone (as all Seattle). I really recomend this house. It was a great experience for our first visit to Seattle.
21031	4061051	9.0	10.0	19448263	Jenny was a gracious host. Very clean, bright and modern home in the heart of Capitol Hill. Easy to get around by just walking or Uber. Thank you, Jenny!
21032	4061051	9.0	10.0	20477660	Jenny was a great host. Super accommodating and easy going. 
21033	4061051	9.0	10.0	21366444	Beautiful condo, great quiet neighborhood. With the tenant and her mother there, it was a bit noisy on Sunday morning when we had wanted to sleep in but otherwise a very peaceful stay.
21034	4061051	9.0	10.0	21994256	"My significant other and I were looking for a convenient and well appointed place to spend a romantic weekend in Seattle to attend a friend's wedding reception. Despite finding this to be a cool architectural and modern home, we were surprised by the degree of discomfort and lack of a amenities for our stay. 
The room itself was rather small. It was devoid of a dresser, night stands or any related furniture (only a small closet with too few hangers for clothes). The easterly facing windows had no shade treatment to block the morning sunlight or views from prying neighbors eyes (the bedroom is 15' away from the kitchen and living space of the house next door). The bathroom, while conveniently adjacent to the room had no towels and when asked, Jenny replied ""Oh, you need towels?""as if we should have traveled with our own. The towels we did finally receive were not fresh and had a sour smell from poor or neglectful laundering. And while I appreciate and respect the nature of this being a room rental in someone's home, we expect a similar mutual respect as a paying guest in return. To find a kitchen off limits due to the smell emanating from a sink full of dirty dishes and uneaten leftovers, an overflowing trash bin and multiple days of dirty pots and pans still on the stovetop from the previous few days, was appalling. And while Jenny respected our privacy with closed doors, we were awaken several times by her erratic schedule and heavy footfalls throughout the house and halls (as if a reminder that we were just guests, helping subsidize a mortgage payment and did not deserve the same care or respect one would show friends or family).

In short, we did not feel comfortable staying here and although the host was kind and friendly, did not provide the care, service or value for the cost. We would not recommend this listing and believed it to be far overpriced for what we received in return. Regretfully, a hotel would have been a better option."
21035	4061051	9.0	10.0	22637073	This is a beautiful house in a great location. Jenny was very professional and the stay was great. The mattress  is really comfortable. 
21036	4061051	9.0	10.0	35560027	Jenny did a great job at coordinating our arrival and having the place ready. Great location next to Cap hill and rooms were just as described. Had a great experience and would definitely recommend if looking for a comfortable stay near downtown.
22826	286712	9.0	8.0	1320925	Galina is very kind, friendly and flexible. She has a very nice place. It is very spacious and the townhouse was surprisingly very private feeling since it was off of the street and had a private fenced back yard. I would definitely recommend her place to future renters. It's a great deal and a beautiful home!
22827	286712	9.0	8.0	1453891	great place to stay close to downtown. groceries stores a block away. very clean place, lots of room for a family. loved the place. downtown is about 10 min driving & to take the bus is a block away. starbucks is very close. as a sport fanatic, is very very close to a mariners & seahawks stadiums. very quiet neighbors around the place. i really recommend this place for any occasion. 
22828	286712	9.0	8.0	1675297	The townhouse was clean, spacious, and perfect for the family members who came to for our wedding. The location was very convenient, as well. Excellent backyard and kitchen.
22829	286712	9.0	8.0	1827125	I chose this house for 3 reasons, it had plenty of bedrooms and bathrooms to accommodate my adult large family, it was close to the bus line, and it appeared to have adequate cooking and dining facilities.  The first 2 expectations were accurate, but we were disappointed to find that there was no dining table , and the kitchen area is much smaller than it appears in the photos, making it difficult for us to sit down for a meal together or use the table for group activities. People should be aware there is no television.  The garden in the rear of the townhouse is lovely!
22830	286712	9.0	8.0	1899319	Nice, well-kept, clean and completely as advertised.  Nearby Starbucks and grocery store was a plus.  Easy drive to Pike Place Market.
22831	286712	9.0	8.0	1920231	We had a great stay. When we had a late night question related to the townhome Galina responded to our telephone call promptly and was very flexible about check out times. Everything was clean and ready to go when we got there. Finding the door and entering the code at night was a little tricky, but aside from that everything went really well.   
22832	286712	9.0	8.0	2043907	Galina was great!  So sweet and the place was perfect for us.  Three of us stayed and we loved having our own bathrooms and a place to cook!  Luxury! :)  It was so convenient to have the keypad--I want to get one for my door!  It meant that we didn't have any problems with figuring out who should take the key and could come and go as we pleased. The only thing that was tough was having to do the laundry at the end. It took longer than we thought it would (we didn't want the red sheets to bleed onto the white, so ended up doing three loads the morning we were leaving).  With other hosts I've just stripped the beds and left the sheets, and wished we didn't have to do laundry at the end. 
22833	286712	9.0	8.0	2189973	"We had an awesome stay!
The neighborhood is quiet, the house was clean. We really loved the room layout, it was perfect for our group. Location was excellent. There is a small shopping area with a Starbucks in walking distance. And a bus stop with the 14 going directly into downtown/convention center.

Galina is a great host, always responsive, all instructions were spot on. "
22834	286712	9.0	8.0	2252287	Galina's place was wonderful for our group visiting Seattle for a wedding. The townhouse was perfect four the six of us. Access was super convenient and it was central to all of the places we needed to go!
22835	286712	9.0	8.0	2313262	"We had a bit of a mishap with Galina's place: her cleaning service didn't actually clean it before we arrived. There was a lot of rotting food in the kitchen, which was pretty unsettling. We called and messaged Galina and she was quick to respond, and sent her cleaning service back to check on the house later that day. They folded the towels in the living room but didn't remove any of the rotting food, yet she told Galina that she had already cleaned the house. We messaged back and forth, and the next day Galina sent a friend to remove a box a rotting bread sitting in the kitchen. She also offered to reimburse our cleaning fee and pay for half of the first night's stay, and she was very apologetic about the entire incident.

Other than that, the place was wonderful and perfect for me and my friends from college. There were 8 of us in the house and with couches, beds and floor sleeping, we all slept comfortably. She has a lovely modern kitchen and is close to the Captiol Hill neighborhood and downtown Seattle. Galina was courteous and prompt to respond to our messages."
22836	286712	9.0	8.0	2393577	"Galina's house was very clean and had plenty of extra towels and bedding for our large group.  Her home was as adverstised and as spacious as it appeared in the photos.  

Galina was a bit hard to get a hold of by email but was very responsive by phone and texting.  

Definately worth the cost.  "
22837	286712	9.0	8.0	2487748	"My friends and I enjoyed our stay for five days at Galina's place. The house was clean, nice, and well setup to cook. There is a grocery store and other shops within a close walking distance. Galina was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any of my questions.

The only issue we had was difficulty finding cabs in the area. The bus system ended up being easier much of the time. Using the Uber app to get a car was much more effective than calling Yellow Cab."
22838	286712	9.0	8.0	5117483	When we arrived the place was a bit of a mess due to some long term tenants not cleaning as promised. Though a bit of a disappointment, Galina was remarkable in responding quickly; she sent someone to clean the next morning, and even sent a (website hidden) delivery of supplies like sponges, soap, etc. The townhouse is lovely, with a cute backyard, easy parking, and enough space to sleep a lot of people comfortably. One of the bedrooms has a futon couch/bed which is as comfortable as to be expected. As long as you know, and come prepared for it, it's just fine. There is a grocery store and starbucks within walking distance, and a Trader Joe's an easy drive away. Overall a great experience!
22839	286712	9.0	8.0	5315882	For our group of 3 couples staying 2 nights in Seattle, this newish 3 story townhouse worked very well.  Two bedrooms (one Queen, one full futon) are on the top floor, one (Queen) is on the lower.  All have full ensuite bathrooms.  Kitchen, dining & living rooms, half bath + laundry occupy the middle floor.  The kitchen is compact but adequately outfitted for simple cooking. There is a full size refrigerator, gas range, microwave but no dishwasher.  Seating for 6 for dining: table for 4, plus 2 (email hidden)e one car garage was tricky to get into with our Kia Optima rental.  Street parking on the block was generally easy to find.  Grocery, drugstore, Starbucks, restaurants & bus stops easy to walk to.  We needed to contact our host two times about the rental:  3 days before we arrived to get the entry code, and at the property when we could not figure out how to lock the front door from the outside.  We were not successful communicating with the host by email; it seemed to work best to leave a phone message to which she responded promptly.  We would definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle.                    
22840	286712	9.0	8.0	5995280	The house was nice and clean when we arrived.  Galina was very responsive and answered all our questions beforehand.  Getting in and out of the place was easy.  One thing we didn't care for too much was paying a $150 cleaning fee when we had to do the cleaning of the towels and sheets.  That wasn't received very well from the parents.  Also the security code doesn't always get changed so if you are the paranoid type you may ask ahead to make sure it can get changed from the last people that stayed there.  Other than that we loved it.  It was very spacious and was in line with hotel prices around the area.  If you are okay with the things I mentioned I'd definitely recommend it!
22841	286712	9.0	8.0	6319050	"We were a group of six friends (2 couples + 2 singles) travelling to Seattle for four nights and were very pleased with our stay at Galina's townhouse. We would definitely stay there again! 

When we first arrived we were a little concerned about how far the location was from the attractions (Pike Place Market, Shopping District, etc) but it was a very quick cab ride - about $10-12 each way. There is a grocery store and Starbucks down the street which were very convenient. 

For the six of us, we thought the townhouse was enough space, though I wouldn't want to go with a bigger group, and we had only minor concerns: 
- Someone over 6' tall won't be too comfortable sleeping in the downstairs bedroom (the bed is a little short) 
- The kitchen is a tight to have two people cooking 
- It would have been nice to have a TV or radio, but we managed without 
- There isn't a toaster or regular coffee maker but enough variety of pots & pans for the cooking we did 

We enjoyed sitting in the backyard (there are only three lawn chairs in the downstairs closet though) and having the code lock was very convenient because when someone wanted to go back to the townhouse we didn't have to coordinate who would have a key.  Also, the three and a half bathrooms were awesome for our large group. 

A note on other reviews: 
- We didn't notice the airport noise mentioned by another reviewer 
- The large capacity washing machine and dryer made laundry very quick 
- There is a dishwasher 
- We fit a Ford Escape in the garage 

All in all, we thought it was a great place to stay. I would recommend it to anyone travelling to Seattle."
22842	286712	9.0	8.0	6367900	"My real rating for this place is a 3.5, but you can't do half stars on Airbnb...

A little bit about our party - there were 6 of us, a mix of immediate family, cousins, and Uncles/Aunts, adults and young adults.

Pros
- The house is located a little over a mile outside downtown Seattle with a bus route nearby (though we ended up walking/taking a car in each time)
- Galina's house is clean and extremely modern with granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances
- There are 3 bathrooms (two of them have showers), which was really nice in the morning while we were all getting ready
- Galina is quick to respond to any issues or questions. For example, the air mattress at the place had a huge hole in it. After I called her about it, she had a replacement dropped off the same day for us.

Cons
- The place says it sleeps 9 people, but I find that to be a bit inflated. There are 3 full/queen beds, 1 queen blow up air mattress, and a couch. To fit 9 people you would have to have 2 people on each bed, 2 people on the air mattress, and 1 on the couch. With 6 people it was even tight, just because there was only one couple in our party and it wasn't really appropriate for the others in our party to share beds.
- If you do have to blow up the air mattress, you will lose the functionality of the living room, as that is the only room with ample space to fit the blow up.
- The driveway and garage are really tight. We had a rental minivan and it wouldn't fit in the garage.

For the most part we had a great experience, but the deceiving sleeping accommodations were unfortunate. I would say this place could comfortably sleep 4-6. But only do 6 if there are multiple couples in your party. "
22843	286712	9.0	8.0	6556241	"The house is smaller than it looks, but OK for 4-6 people. The bed quality is poor except the one in the master bedroom and the neighborhood is not as nice as some other affordable places in Seattle.
This said, the biggest problem is SEATAC airport close approach: be prepared to count planes at the rhythm of one every 60-90 sec. In the silence of the night, these planes are very noisy and since the windows are not double-glazed ...
Brief, we are far from the promised ""great location"". "
22844	286712	9.0	8.0	6853206	Great location. Close to all Seattle sites. We had sufficient room for 9 and having three bathrooms was great. Very clean and ready for us. Thank you.
22845	286712	9.0	8.0	7005598	"The space is much tighter then anticipated. Though it is possible to house up to 9 tenants, but in my opinion I believe that it would be much more comfortable with a maximum of 6 (We had a total of 8). Small cars should be able to fit in the garage, did not wish to attempt with our truck to confirm however. The street is fairly tight and crowed during most of the day, but there usually is at least some places where you can park otherwise.
The location of the townhouse is a little bit hidden as it is behind another townhouse, so it is not easily noticed at first from the street. Like noted by previous tenants, it is fairly close to a small shopping area where you can purchase groceries, go to Starbucks, restaurants and cafes, and various other small stores. Please note that if you do wish to go to larger shopping areas that you will need to either drive or taxi around. 

My party and I found our stay to be decent, though we found that the place was not as cleanly as we had expected it to be. One of the major areas was the bathroom, as we needed to buy drain-o, as a large majority of the drains were clogged prior to our arrival. "
22846	286712	9.0	8.0	7755057	Place is great, very modern, and clean. We slept 5 very comfortably. 9/10 would stay again
22847	286712	9.0	8.0	8100874	We had a really nice time there. The house was very clean and looked really nice. Although it was a bit small for 8 people, we enjoyed our stay. The garage is pretty small but you can park on the street in front of the house. 
22848	286712	9.0	8.0	8381467	"Galina was very pleasant and the experience, overall, was good. The condo is much smaller than you might think; that's not a bad thing, just don't think you can easily sleep 8. Unless your group is filled with couples, don't expect more than space for 4. The neighborhood is fine; don't let people scare you off about it. 

The bottom line is: the place is fantastic for the price, the owner is kind and helpful, and if you're visiting Seattle to explore and discover (ie. not spending the majority of your time inside the place), I couldn't suggest it any higher than I do. "
22849	286712	9.0	8.0	13569672	Had a wonderful stay.The house was very clean. It was also in a nice walking distance form many different things.
22850	286712	9.0	8.0	19785701	"The house was exactly as described. Galina was awesome about responding to any questions quickly.  The place was very clean and we found it slept nine quite comfortably (one was on the couch).  Although we had four couples, so sharing beds wasn't a problem. 

The kitchen is a good size and has everything you need, and the three levels made it feel like we all had our own space.

The location is nice, close to public transit (which was needed to get downtown), and there is a large supermarket and pharmacy really close.  The area feels safe as well.

There's no TV, not that we had much time to watch one anyway."
22851	286712	9.0	8.0	21801662	Galina was very responsive, and access was easy.  The home was neat, clean and well furnished.  Great to have three separate bedrooms with their own baths.  The home is on a nice block that feels safe, although the broader neighborhood is very urban and varied.  Worked great for three colleagues on a business trip.  We'd do it again.
22852	286712	9.0	8.0	21970726	Galina made it super easy to come and stay at her place.     It was a comfortable standalone carriage house, well located to access the many cool areas of Seattle.  It was maybe a little tight for nine of us (but, seriously, what place wouldn't be!).  And it was a great, affordable way to be able to stay in one place with other friends attending a wedding.  
22853	286712	9.0	8.0	22291342	Galina's place was very beautiful and clean. It accommodated all 9 of us perfectly, although we did bring an extra air mattress that we used. Her place was only 10 minutes away from downtown. I would highly recommend staying with her.
22854	286712	9.0	8.0	26241468	Host was easy to communicate with-very nice and accommodating. We stayed for 6 weeks with 2 kids and it was a great temporary stay set up. Large enough space and rooms for all 4 of us. Location was central and easy to get around from.
22855	286712	9.0	8.0	32009919	the place was in an excellent location, and everything was neat and clean. the backyard was nice as well. the host was also very accomodating and flexible towards our arrival times!
22856	286712	9.0	8.0	41914964	The house that we stayed at this summer was amazing, it definitely matched the picture description that we were given and the location was accurately described. I stayed with 3 other people for about 3 months and the place was definitely homey and big enough for all of us. Galina was a great host and if we ever had any issues, I could just text her and she would come to the house and take care of the problem. I would definitely recommend staying here if you want to be close to downtown!
22857	286712	9.0	8.0	42575653	"The townhouse was very spacious and comfortable and comfortably slept all 8 of us during our stay. The location was perfect, 15 minutes from downtown Seattle, 20 minutes to downtown Bellevue and there are grocery stores and restaurants nearby.

Galina was a great host and she was very responsive with all my questions.

The townhouse does have a quite a few steps, the living room is situated on the second floor and all the bedrooms require walking two flights of stairs. So it was not as accessible as we would have liked for my grandparents.

Overall, the place is very well furnished and a great place to stay for a visit to Seattle!"
22858	286712	9.0	8.0	43952420	Galina's house was great for me and my coworkers. Quiet, clean, and convenient; I would absolutely stay here again!
22859	286712	9.0	8.0	45243674	"Very clean.  Seemed Quiet.  Close to downtown. There are 3 floors, lots of stairs, would be difficult for the elderly.  The garage is a little difficult to get in and out of due to the lay out, so street parking is preferred.  The Townhouse is hidden behind another townhouse.  Her number on airbnb was wrong, it was to some company called ""Pillow"" that used to own this listing.  She was very accommodating once we were able to get a hold of her.  There are 3 double real beds and 1 double inflatable bed.   We brought 2 extra air beds and were able to sleep 8 people with only 2 people having to share a bed and one on the couch.  The wifi has a difficult time handling 8 people trying to stream stuff at once since there's no tv."
22860	286712	9.0	8.0	46147293	Great house for our group.  We had two couples and two single friends heading to the west coast for a wedding.  Having 3 bathrooms was a huge help when everyone was getting ready.  Galina's house was in an easy location to uber around the city and out to points east (wineries!).  The house is clean and modern and had everything we needed.
22861	286712	9.0	8.0	46942203	Wow! I cannot say enough good things about Galina and her beautiful home! The townhouse is actually quite spacious and very easily sleeps 9 people with the really nice air bed. The location is amazing and the neighborhood is quiet and right around the corner from shopping, coffee, and restaurants and about 5 minutes to freeway access. The property itself was great, but what really made our stay was what an amazing hostess Galina was. She always replies to any questions very quickly and has excellent communication. She went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. When someone accidentally turned on the heater and we couldn't figure out how to turn it off, she came by and did it for us. And then, when our weekend event went longer than expected she accommodated our team by allowing us a later checkout. Polite, friendly, accommodating, and an A+++ hostess! Would recommend to my friends and stay with her anytime.
22862	286712	9.0	8.0	47962621	We had a fantastic stay here! The space was clean and spacious and our party of 9 fit perfectly! 
22863	286712	9.0	8.0	51569553	Working with Galina was a good experience.  She was very responsive and helped answer every question we had.  We liked the location and the neighborhood.  It was very clean and comfortable.  I just wish it had a TV for relaxing in the evenings.
22864	286712	9.0	8.0	53559925	"We never met Galina. The property is managed by TurnKey. Which was confusing. They asked for me to send a photo of my drivers license for verification even though i am verified through AirBnb with several reviews and references. 

Initial confusion aside, the neighborhood is quiet with ample parking. The house is nice, they fit a lot of stuff into a small space, which is impressive; there are 3 bathrooms! The small yard out back was a nice retreat.   "
23235	8221520	9.0	9.0	49675606	"The communication from both Airbnb and Pillow was really good. Everything was simple even without the host actually being there. The house was ideal for our group of 6 with room for the kids to get away and the grown ups to enjoy some tunes played on vinyl - a real blast from the past.
The location is great and the property is first class - we really enjoyed our short stay and visit to Seattle.
Dave & Robyn - Brisbane"
23236	8221520	9.0	9.0	50598156	"I rented this house for me and my five friends. The house was really big and everyone had private space. Rooms are spotlessly clean and large enough to feel yourself comfortable even for a long stay.
We would like to mention that every detail and every corner of the interiors and exteriors are built with love and perfect taste.
The location is very close to the downtown (about 7 mins drive ) and still very quiet.
This is a great place to stay, and I can't recommend it highly enough."
23237	8221520	9.0	9.0	54204497	The house has a lot of appeal.  Clean, nicely decorated, good natural light, some nice city views and spacious.  Parking is easy and it is a short distance to downtown, though not walkable. 
23238	8221520	9.0	9.0	54656524	Stayed here while on a business trip. The house was exactly as expected and just as the picures portray. Very nice. Beautiful view of the city. Plenty of space.   There are quite a few stairs just in case this is a concern for someone. The location was perfect for us. Literally took 10 minutes to get to downtown. There was a very nice grocery store very close.  If you care, the only thing they don't provide is hand towels and washrags but I believe they are available for an extra charge. They provide plenty of bath towels and have everything you could possibly need if you are interested in cooking a home made meal. Definitely would stay there again! Thanks Daniel! 
23239	8221520	9.0	9.0	54906042	It was really happy staying at Daniel's house. The house is clean and big, and it has everything you need. Easy access to downtown and major attractions, easy parking in the garage. The communication was great too! Really good experience.
23240	8221520	9.0	9.0	55210190	This is a really lovely home in a convenient location. We enjoyed our stay, the house was big enough to accommodate me and my family on our holiday visit and we loved the turn table! The hosts were responsive when we needed anything. 
23241	8221520	9.0	9.0	55515772	The fireplace was lit and there were lights on! He had a vintage record collection and a turntable! Enjoy this house immensely clean modern, loved it!
25260	9389755	9.0	10.0	55144715	This was a great AirBnB experience, Garrett was super responsive and went out of his way to make sure we connected when required. The unit was private, quiet and just what I needed for my time in Seattle, it's a handy location for the lake, and all the best parts of Seattle it's near to the bus (which I tool to Ballard) and just a short stroll away from the train to/from the airport. Wholefood is just a few blocks away so you can set yourself up with food pretty quickly and easily. The place was clean, warm and the bed was VERY comfortable. I had all I needed to wash and dry my clothes and make basic meals, Internet was reliable and fast, nice TV (with basic cable)  All in all another great AirBnB and I'll look this one up if I'm coming to work in Seattle again. Thanks Garrett!
25261	9389755	9.0	10.0	55301274	"Garrett's place was fantastic! It was exactly how pictured and felt more like a hotel than any other airbnb I have stayed in. Check in was was easy and he was very accommodating by allow us to check out later than expected. The kitchen has anything you could possible need and was very organized. He has created a binder that explains the neighbourhood, building amenities and  lists the tv channels. Would stay here again and would recommend to friends. 
"
25262	9389755	9.0	10.0	55875237	Great communication - Garrett was there waiting for us when we arrived to show us around and help with anything we needed. Location was perfect for us as we were working an event just a few blocks away. View from the roof deck is beautiful - make sure to catch the sunset!
26170	9863484	9.0	10.0	56572621	perfect little place, clean and warm, just perfect for crashing after a rainy day in this beautiful city.
26171	9863484	9.0	10.0	56975808	Great experience! Although kind of last minute, still good choice. Joy was great, very comforting presence. Great location for anything near downtown or the space needle. Recommend to any visitor of the Emerald City. 
26762	19611	9.0	9.0	31048	"We had a fabulous time. #338 Urban Oasis is a great unit for four or fewer people. I traveled with my two daughters and a friend and it worked out great. The unit is nicely decorated and the kitchen has all of the utensils and pots/pans we needed (we made chocolate linguine from Pike's street market and put it over Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from the grocery just down the block . . . absolutely delicious). The unit is within walking distance of great shopping (Norstrom Rack, H&M, etc.) and the secure parking is a great feature. We hope to stay there again in the future and may even try to figure out how to ride the bus in the ""ride free zone."""
26763	19611	9.0	9.0	131119	Everything was wonderful and comfortable.  We had all we needed to have an enjoyable time. Fully stocked kitchen and a nice welcome package. The bed had a temperpedic topper that was very comfortable. Directions to the apt were clear and the bus line was just outside the door.  The area was a little down but not enough to be afraid of our safety.  My only complaint and it wasn't with the accomadations  The fees that Air bnb charges was not clearly stated and the cleaning fee wasn't included in the price of the apt.  I spent closely to 200 a night so that should have been absorbed.  But over all I was very pleased with out time there. 
26764	19611	9.0	9.0	168876	Lovely apartment, great kitchen, amazingly quiet given the sometimes bustling street scene outside. We appreciated the laundry facilities after a few days on the road. Our party of four was a bit crowded but comfortable. Proximity to transport, entertainment, markets, shopping and eating was excellent. We really enjoyed it. Thanks for a wonderful stay in fascinating Seattle. 
26765	19611	9.0	9.0	445563	Very comfortable unit. Convenient location with an easy walk to Pike Place Market or Downtown for some endless shopping. Checking in/out was a breeze because the instructions were so clear and concise and the welcome package, which included a map of all sights in Seattle, was a nice little touch. I thoroughly enjoyed the balcony overlooking 3rd Ave. It was a little noisy when the windows/balcony door was open because there is a bus stop directly in front of the building, which is actually a positive for those without a rental. We had a rental so it was nice to have secure parking in the building. The rest of the amenities of the building were amazing. I absolutely fell in love with the rooftop deck. My only complaint about the unit was that there was a strange smell possibly coming from the garbage disposal, which may have been from the tenants before us. We also had some difficulty with the wireless but immediate help was just a phone call away. Overall we had a positive experience. Until we meet again, Seattle. 
26766	19611	9.0	9.0	678527	"we were just moving in from France. first 15 days in town !
very good experience
all was very well at Darik's place !
near everything downtown"
26767	19611	9.0	9.0	898126	Nice place.  Great kitchen, but who needs a kitchen in this neighborhood?
26768	19611	9.0	9.0	1126845	"We had a lovely stay in Seattle and the Oasis was in a perfect location for our brief trip. The room was comfortable, clean and well-decorated. We took advantage of the kitchen with its fully-stocked supplies & utensils and made a dinner fresh from Pike Place Market. The condo is located in the center of Belltown and within blocks of the market, many of Tom Douglas' wonderful restaurants and several department stores. 

If you have a couple days to sight-see, I highly recommend a Savor Seattle food tour of Pike Place Market, a quick drive up to Kerry Park for a phenomenal view of the skyline and a day-trip to Everett for a whale-watching tour. 

We had a great time in Seattle and would stay at the Seattle Oasis again without hesitation!"
26769	19611	9.0	9.0	1266214	 Never met our host but the instructions on checking in was very clear so no problems there.  It is a great place to stay!  You can get anywhere within 10-15 minutes by foot if you're just planning to stay downtown.  The room is very clean and has almost all of the amenities that you'll need.  Highly recommend!
26770	19611	9.0	9.0	2946508	Good flat, good location, everything went smooth.
26771	19611	9.0	9.0	3193151	We had a great time, and the apartment was perfect for the two of us.  Great location for walking around the city, and nice, clean accommodations.  
26772	19611	9.0	9.0	3310926	The apartment is fantastic, very well decorated, comfortable and clean. You feel like you're living in a model apartment, designed and decorated by a professional. The host was very gracious with the instructions on how to arrive, park the car, reach the apartment, etc. The building was also nice and we regularly used the gyms in the morning (it was mostly empty). The location was a plus and a minus for the apartment: for day attractions, you're blocks away from the Space Needle, many museums and coffee shops, about 15min walk to Pike Market, so no complaints there. During the night, though, if you walk in the wrong direction the neighborhood can get pretty sketchy - don't try walking to Pike Place Market at night for dinner or you'll cross some strange, strange intersections. Luckily there were a few nice restaurants for dinner just a few blocks way on 1st and 2nd avenue.
26773	19611	9.0	9.0	3331867	"This was my first time having a GREAT AirBNB experience. I had booked once before and was horrible experience so I was hesitant to try again, but so glad I did. 
This was a great property that truly thought of everything for the guest and was super easy process. The unit had everything one needs: kitchen with all appliances, utensils and even bakeware.  Also had sponges and dish soap and dishwasher too. The stacked washer and dryer was so convenient and even had detergent and fabric softener. 
Welcome kit had all instruction details for unit, coffee, microwave popcorn and 2 bottle each of sparkling and still water. SUCH A NICE TOUCH!
Place was a little noisy being at a bus stop, but can't beat location so was worth it and there is no where else in city where you could park for free in secure covered spot. 
Can't say enough good things. Would highly recommend!"
26774	19611	9.0	9.0	4183467	This was an amazing space and location.  Darik was awesome.  I would recommend this or any of his properties to anyone.  I truly felt at home.  
26775	19611	9.0	9.0	7296702	We stayed here for  two days while we explored Mount Rainier and Pike Place. The condo is nicely decorated but had a hotel feel to it which we were trying to get away from by using AirBnB. It was well stocked and centrally located. We liked the secure parking. My issues would be that the condo was unbearably hot and has no air conditioning. Being on a very busy street you can't open the windows and get a good nights sleep so for that reason I would not stay here again. Another small issue is that I was charged a cleaning fee yet I was left with instructions to take my garbage out, wash my bed linens and towels and start the dishwasher all before I checked out. 
26776	19611	9.0	9.0	7988223	Good location, we'll equipped lovely little place, no hassle to check in. Was quite warm at night but overall ideal for our mini break
26777	19611	9.0	9.0	9978971	My family and I greatly enjoyed Darik's condo. The check in and out procedures where clearly described via email. I was not in personal contact with Darik since check in and check out was automated. The room was clean, had a well equipped kitchen, and had all the conveniences of home. The neighborhood was lovely. I would stay here again.
26778	19611	9.0	9.0	10717187	Very clean and comfortable, felt right at home. Excellent location. Couldn't have asked for anything better!
26779	19611	9.0	9.0	11090466	great spot! clean, well decorated and stocked. would stay here again in a second! 
26780	19611	9.0	9.0	11162190	"The location and roof top deck with spectacular views and great outdoor furniture make this a really super downtown rental.  You can walk everywhere from here - we left our car in the underground garage the whole time.  The kitchen is well stocked - better than I have experienced in any airbnb to date and the bathroom comes well supplied with loads of towels.  

We missed the personal airbnb touches (meeting the hosts or emailing with them) but did find everything went very smoothly from booking, to checking in and checking out.  

We did find the master bedroom a bit noisy at night  from outdoor traffic and pedestrian noise (we had the window closed) and the apartment/building was on the warm and stuffy side.  It is on the small side as well…too small for our family of 4 …but would be a great size for one or two.  The bathroom door is a sliding door which isn't the most private (it has privacy gaps on the sides) and it slipped off the hinges a couple of times.  The apartment, appliances and contents were very clean and tidy.

All in all a professional rental."
26781	19611	9.0	9.0	21442244	This is very much a corporate housing type of Airbnb. The apartment is nice and appears as the photos but is quite a lot smaller than one would expect. It was easy to gain entry and nice that they had a small welcome basket. Unfortunately some parts were not functioning such as the sink which was clogged the entire time. If you're looking for somewhere that is nice for sleeping and in a close proximity to downtown this works.
26782	19611	9.0	9.0	23643728	"We checked in late around midnight. The instructions were super detailed and we found everything with ease. It was extremely cold that night and our heater wasn't working. We ended up sleeping without the heater and coming from California, it was unbearable. We called the number provided and the lady was instructing us to locate the breaker and make sure everything is on. Well, being 3 girls, we didn't know very much about circuit breakers. We ended up turning off all lights except the bathroom and kitchen lights and had no power anywhere else. We eventually gave up and just went to sleep. Also, we didn't have parking pass in our apartment like the instructions said we would. Everything ended up getting fixed the next morning and they made it up by giving us a $20 gift card to a local bakery.

The apartment does look smaller than in pictures but the appearance of everything was on point. The kitchen is fully equipped, plenty of towels and blankets. The towels feels extremely soft! 4 toilet rolls were provided. Care package was also provided which included 2 bottles of water, 2 Perrier, some green tea packets, york chocolates, popcorn, other snacks. Location was PERFECT. Close to many restaurants and grocery stores. Couldn't ask for a better stay. "
26783	19611	9.0	9.0	23896232	I liked that they called me when they haven't heard from me. The place is easy to get to and easy to get to the parking garage. However, the suite was smaller than I expected. The curtains were of poor quality and kept falling off every time I opened the window. The bed was very comfortable, but I agree with everyone else that it gets really stuffy in there and there's no AC or ventilation. If you do open the window, expect a lot of street noise. The bathroom door is horrendous. It's just a sliding Japanese door and doesn't close all the way. If you're staying with other people, don't expect any privacy. The kitchen was well stocked. The living room is in dire need of a coffee table. Anything with a flat surface would've been great actually. They had two ottomans but you can't put anything on it without it falling over. They had these individual fold-able tray tables, but I find that cheapens the place even more. The worst part about my stay is that they had given me an expired parking pass and I ended up getting a ticket for parking in their garage. Even though it was resolved quickly, it just seems like an inconvenience of my comfort and time. 
26784	19611	9.0	9.0	28699616	The apartment is cute, clean and pleasant. Both the bed and the pull-out couch bed are large and comfortable. I really appreciated the kitchen, which has pots, pans, knives, pretty much everything you'd need to cook—but bring your own bottle opener, I couldn't find one! There were 4 of us staying here and it was perfect for us. I would say that if you're traveling with people who aren't your close friends, this apartment might be a little difficult for 4 people. It is on the small side and as other reviewers have mentioned, the sliding doors on the bedroom and bathroom really don't provide privacy. That said, we had a great time there and loved exploring the surrounding neighborhoods.
26785	19611	9.0	9.0	31867961	"A standard vacation rental in the heart of Belltown. The pictures are accurate. Close walks to Pike Market and Spaceneedle. Yummy restaurants and coffee shops all around. Its a great deal for what you pay. Even if the reviews are correct- it gets a bit stuffy in the apartment with no AC and the street noise is significant if you need to have the windows open.
Overall a very enjoyable 2 weeks in one of my favorite cities!"
26786	19611	9.0	9.0	46155706	Fantastic location in Belltown! Everything (sights, restaurants, bars, etc) is within walking distance. Great apartment for a weekend getaway. We loved the rooftop patio as well!
26787	19611	9.0	9.0	53743517	Although we never met, Darik (and Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals by extension) made us feel very welcome. The rental, however, was a different story. It's a lot smaller than the pictures let on, the cleaning crew was not done by check-in time, and there's cosmetic damage to the paint and furniture that resulted in paint chips on the floor. If this is your first time in Seattle, this location is fantastic as it's within walking distance of a lot of big downtown Seattle attractions (Pike's Place market, Space Needle, Starbucks Reserve Tasting Room, several bars, underground tour, etc.)
28768	4242626	9.0	10.0	26870881	Very professional and welcoming.  Highly recommend.  Awesome apartment too!
28769	4242626	9.0	10.0	32518718	This was an excellent apartment, centrally located in Belltown. It was walking distance to the Clipper, Space Needle, Whole Foods, parks for the kids, and shopping downtown. It is also close to bus lines direct to the baseball stadium. The view was outstanding, the apartment clean and nicely decorated. Sea to sky property management were very helpful resolving issues in a timely manner. Overall, an excellent place to stay! 
28770	4242626	9.0	10.0	55793127	Great experience, great location, would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.
33136	654734	9.0	10.0	2613239	Grace was extremely hospitable, providing us with everything we needed for a comfortable stay, including towels and toiletries, simple cooking ingredients for the kitchen, and even a queen size air mattress to accommodate our 4 guests. The condo was in a perfect location, too. Walking distance to anything you'd need to get to in Seattle. Highly recommended. 
33137	654734	9.0	10.0	2752735	This is a great pad in a great neighborhood in Seattle. While I regretted not bringing my own bar of soap, this condo had just about every amenity you could wish for, including snacks and maps! Make sure to walk up the street and check out the oyster bar!
33138	654734	9.0	10.0	3369950	The reservation was canceled 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
33139	654734	9.0	10.0	4528529	I highly recommend staying in this apartment. Grace met us for our week-long visit, showed us the apartment and neighborhood. We stayed in the corner apartment on the 14th floor. It has fantastic views of the city to the west and south. There is a basic grocery store one block up Pike St, and great restaurants on Melrose Ave. We were in town for a convention, and the Center is right across the street. You can look right into the registration area in the south side of the Center. The apartment is comfortably furnished, internet, TV and a great bed. Laundry is available on the 2nd floor in the apartment complex. There is no air-conditioning in the apartment. Ordinarily this wouldn’t be an issue in Seattle, but the week we were there the weather was clear and temperatures were in the high 80’s. Interstate 5 is right below the apartment to the west, so if you open the windows to cool down, you’ll get a lot traffic noise. We loved staying here and would do so again.
33140	654734	9.0	10.0	5035480	Grace is a wonderful host. We stayed in two of her apartments for a total of four weeks. As we were travelling with a baby, Grace kindly upgraded us to a bigger apartment without charging extra. We stayed in this larger apartment in the same building for two out of those four weeks. Grace responded to questions I asked her over SMS or email usually within minutes. She even asked if there was something we wanted to see that was hard to reach with public transportation and offered to take us there with her car! When we left the apartment and prepared our way back home, Grace again asked if she could take us somewhere. As a host, Grace went way further than the proverbial extra mile. We're glad that we stayed in her apartment and will be happy to do so again on a future trip to Seattle.
33141	654734	9.0	10.0	5162355	"I stayed in Grace's downtown apartment while in Seattle for a conference and it was even better than we expected! My husband and 2 YO daughter were there with me and it was probably the best trip we have taken with her. If you are travelling with a small child this is the way to go! Grace was so nice- she met us when our flight got in, let us check in early, and even helped with our luggage! We were upgraded to a bigger corner unit without even asking and weren't charged anything extra. Grace even provided a Pack n' Play for us. The unit was very nice, clean and had everything that we needed. Even the appliances were nice and there was a great TV with cable. The location was perfect- closer to the convention center than ANY hotels and close to parks, shopping and anything downtown.  

We would 100% stay here again and hope that it is available the next time that we are in Seattle! Thanks Grace!"
33142	654734	9.0	10.0	5292118	"Grace was very helpful in allowing us to check in a few minutes early.  She walked us thru the place and let us know she was available if we needed anything (I called her twice and she always picked up and was helpful).  Grace has two one-bedroom rentals in the same building--my mom and I were surprised to find that the apartment we booked online was not the apartment we got.  Apparently, she could not tell which apartment we booked thru the online system so definitely keep that in mind when booking (maybe describe the space as they look very different).  She told us that the unit we got was better because it usually cost more and had a sofa bed.  I was bummed to find that the price listed on Airbnb was actually the same for both units and that both had a sofa bed.  I am sure it was a simple mistake but we really would have preferred the other unit--made the best of our stay regardless.  Here is the link to the unit I am reviewing here: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1043194.  
The Elektra building is in the process of being updated so while we were in town one of the two main elevators was out of service and water was turned off for a portion of one of the days.  No big deal really but definitely made getting in and out a bit more time consuming:)  Nothing Grace could do about this of course but just an FYI that there are updates being made. The location was perfect for us--we had a conference a few blocks away near the convention center and it was great to have a kitchen to cook in.  Excellent restaurants and cafes nearby: Tango (get the El Diablo dessert), Melrose Market, Victrola Cafe, Blueacre Seafood etc. The unit does not have air conditioning but lots of windows. Also, the in-unit washer/dryer was no longer available for guest use--have to do laundry on the 2nd floor instead. The sofa bed mattress is quite comfortable:)  The neighbors are also very nice and helpful. If you want a bright and colorful space with ample views of downtown, this spot is for you.  Just be sure the apartment you want is the apartment you get when booking and you will have a great stay!"
33143	654734	9.0	10.0	5691428	Clean and tidy apartment and a great host. Would recommend.
33144	654734	9.0	10.0	5905767	Grace was extremely kind and hospitable.  We even hired her daughter to babysit our kids one night!  This is a very convenient location for getting around.  The apartment itself is somewhat small for those traveling with kids but would be perfect for a couple.  While the unit itself is very clean, the building could use some work and the lower floors reek of old cigarette smoke.  But this is not Grace's fault, of course.  So yes, I would rent this place but with these caveats in mind.
33145	654734	9.0	10.0	6272092	"*Coming from SeaTac airport? Light rail is $2.75 and an hour to Westlake Station on Pine Street; a short 5-8 minutes walk one street over from Grace's place off Pike.*

We stayed for a week in the alternate unit on the 14th floor and it was great. Clean, well stocked apartment with bathroom (tp, shampoo, soap, towels, sheets and pillows and blankets) and kitchen essentials (cookware, seasoning, dish towels) and fans and air conditioning. We were able to host a spaghetti dinner for five one night. Grocery store is a few blocks up and provides paper bags with handles for walking transport.

Five minutes up from the Victrola coffee roasters for great coffee every morning; ten minutes from the heart of Pike Market; ten minutes from the gay clubbing district of Capitol Hill. Chinatown, EMP/Sculpture park/Seattle Space Needle all with 30 mins walk. Taxi rates really reasonable if your feet hurt from hilly climbs.

Grace made sure we knew where the supplies were, major sightseeing areas, and how to lock up. As an AirBnb hostess and better yet, traveller, she anticipated our needs. If you need a local number, she also offers a prepaid phone for your convenience at a daily rate. Recycling is a must in Seattle, so don't forget to separate. Wash and dry are $1 each a few floors down in a dedicated washer room. 

Would return again. Great place to come home to end of night and relax. Thanks so much for offering your place."
33146	654734	9.0	10.0	6623465	Grace was great and greeted me when I arrived.  She was able to accommodate an early check-in when my flight arrived slightly ahead of schedule.  The unit I got was an alternate unit, but still bright, clean and spacious.  Grace took the time to tour the building with me and answer any and all questions about the unit, building and the surrounding area.  The extra touches, like the stocked coffee maker and easily accessible, extra bed linens were appreciated.  I highly recommend this place without hesitation.
33147	654734	9.0	10.0	7370251	"I am very satisfied! We were able to take the light rail from the airport to the condo for a couple of dollars.  Grace was really nice and welcoming. We really appreciate the fact that she was able to accommodate early check in. She also made sure we were ok and didn’t need anything. She gave us her number to call her if we had any questions or needed anything. We asked for permission to order something on paper view and she nicely said yes as long as we paid for it. 

The place was clean and cozy! The location is perfect! We were able to walk to the downtown area for shopping, Pike Market, and Space Needle! We had a fun and enjoyable stay and would come back to Grace’s apt! 
"
33148	654734	9.0	10.0	10374813	I decided to attend a conference the day before it started. Grace was very accommodating. The apartment was a 1 bed, 1 bath. It was clean, the bed was comfy, and had good water pressure. I didn't use the kitchen but was pleased to see Sriracha in the fridge. The location was great, right between downtown and Capitol Hill.
33149	654734	9.0	10.0	10673665	If you are staying at the convention center, this place is about three minutes away. It's quick. It's easy. And it's nice. Cheaper than the conference hotel and bigger by far. Plus a rooftop deck. Yup. I'd stay here again.
33150	654734	9.0	10.0	11996356	"This was my first time using airbnb, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Grace was excellent and very accommodating to me. She was quick to answer (or call me back) when I called and asked her some questions. 

Very, very nice place and perfect distance from the convention center, which I where I was attending an anime convention. I stayed with some friends and the pullout bed in the sofa is amazingly comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. Only thing, you might want to leave the bathroom door open a crack because there isn't a fan and it can get really hot. Also, the residents in the building were nice and smiled when I saw me and acted very welcoming."
33151	654734	9.0	10.0	12274735	This is perfect place to stay when attending a convention next door. The first unit I saw in the listings was booked so I opted to go with another on the 14th floor. Although the decor was not as nice as the original listing, the accommodation was comfortable, safe, and very convenient. Grace was also so nice to let us check in earlier. I'd recommend this host.
33152	654734	9.0	10.0	13208826	The apartment was lovely, and perfectly situated next to the Convention Center - as well as being within walking distance to Seattle's main tourist attractions. Grace was incredibly friendly and able to accommodate a late checkin. I couldn't recommend this condo highly enough.
33153	654734	9.0	10.0	13400416	Grace was a perfect host -- super responsive, available, and so nice! The apartment was ideal for being close to our downtown conference. Four of us fit pretty comfortably and we all slept well. Grace provided all the amenities, including really nice shampoo and conditioner. One of our favorite things near the apartment was Juicy Cafe in the Convention Center next door -- we started every day with smoothies and oat balls. Overall, it was a great stay, really easy and close to lots of fun Seattle stuff downtown and in Capitol Hill. Hope to stay again someday -- thanks Grace!!
33154	654734	9.0	10.0	14820800	Great location, and great place to stay.
33155	654734	9.0	10.0	15530814	We stayed there for five nights, the condo was great. We did not meet Grace in person but she was very caring and helpful on the phone. The kitchen was well equipped, which is good for us to prepare baby's food. High chair and baby cot were also a big plus! The condo is spacious for a small family like us with two little kids. The parking space was also very helpful, especially parking in downtown is really expensive. The location was great. It is all walking distance to downtown and waterfront area. Highly recommended for staying in Seattle! 
33156	654734	9.0	10.0	18870172	My friends and I stayed at this apartment for 4 nights. I arrived really early in the morning, and Grace allowed me to check in before the normal check in time which I am so thankful for. The condo is located really close to the convention center. The apartment is way larger than your average hotel, and probably more comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.
33157	654734	9.0	10.0	20013904	Best first Airbnb experience. It was super easy to get around the this location. Downtown is just a 4 min walk and Pikes Place Market was about a 10-15 min walk depending how fast you walked. The condo was very neat and orderly. It felt like home when we arrived. It's a very quite place to stay at. This experience made my wife and I very happy that we rented the place from Rachel and Grace.  We would definitely stay at this location again.  
33158	654734	9.0	10.0	20618869	Great condo in great location. My hosts were perfect.
33159	654734	9.0	10.0	21222134	"My stay in this condo exceeded my expectations. The condo itself is clean, spacious and warmly inviting. The bed was comfortable. The shower head is high pressured unlike the ones you experience when staying in hotels. It was surprisingly quiet considering its proximity to Pike St (a busy intersection), the I-5 and a medical center right around the corner. Restaurants, bars and grocery stores are within a quick and safe 5 minute walk from the condo. I stayed here during the weekend so there's a lot of people walking around, enjoying and partaking in the casual and laid-back nightlife (I come from NYC and LA so I'm fairly confident with this observation). 

As for my interaction with Rachel, she was very welcoming, friendly accommodating because my flight landed early and I was given the option to check in earlier than 4pm. She's also attentive and immensely helpful in terms of giving instructions and answering any questions I had. Conclusively, I highly recommend this lovely condo and would definitely  stay here again when I return!  "
33160	654734	9.0	10.0	22488478	My stay was great.  The location was perfect for attending a conference at the convention center, you couldn't ask for a better location.  I wasn't in the room much, but it was perfectly functional for my needs.
33161	654734	9.0	10.0	28356688	Always our home away from home! Thank you Rachel & Grace:)
33162	654734	9.0	10.0	28575834	We stayed four days in Rachel & Grace's place. Everything is perfect here. It is about ten minutes walk to downtown and the public transportation is convenient. The place is secure and clean, having everything you need to live for a few days. I like cooking and the kitchen is great. I also liked the Ralph Lauren blanket in the living room--it is so comfortable. It is just my dream apartment. Thank you Rachel and Grace!
33163	654734	9.0	10.0	28861757	"Me, my wife, and some friends stayed at Grace and Rachel's listing during our visit.  We were attending Emerald City Comic Con, so we were looking for something in close proximity to the Washington State Convention Center, without breaking the bank.  It doesn't get any better than this! Here's why:

1.) A 3-minute walk to the convention center. It was great having our place so close when we needed a breather from the con.

2.) Proximity to Capitol Hill. There were a ton of bars and restaurants, all within walking distance.

3.) Grocery store right up the street.

4.) Comfortably fit 4 people.  My wife and I stayed in the bedroom, while our two friends slept on the couch and on the floor.  No complaints here!

We enjoyed our stay in Seattle, and would definitely consider staying at Rachel & Grace's place again!"
33164	654734	9.0	10.0	29909690	Easy and convenient. Great proximity to the Convention Center, just a few minute jaunt to Capital Hill, Downtown, or the water front. The place was pretty much as described, clean, and comfortable.
33165	654734	9.0	10.0	31875574	Very convenient location to the Washington State Convention Center  (closer than many hotels) and it was any easy process to get the keys. The condo is as described, nice and clean, however, the pull out couch was not very comfortable. Probably best for 1-2 people sharing the main bedroom. I would stay here again.   
33166	654734	9.0	10.0	33666777	"Host was nice and responsive in when getting in, the listing description was sufficient, and we were right next to the convention center, which was very convenient for us.

On the improvable side, the apt was a bit smelly when we got in, only improving somewhat after we left the windows open for a full day. There were no sheets for the extra beds, only comforters (not very hygienic), and most importantly, the fold-out bed was busted. We called the host and she said they'd take a look, but after 5 days there nobody showed up, and so the experience was quite uncomfortable.

In addition, despite the location being optimal if you are attending the convention center or wandering around downtown, the unit is quite pricey if compared to hotel rooms.

"
33167	654734	9.0	10.0	34731807	"It's a very cozy accommodation, very close to the city center.
When I arrived Seattle and try to contact the host but no one answer at first, let me feel worried. However they called back soon.

33168	654734	9.0	10.0	34980955	Excellent location and apartment condition. Would definitely stay again!
33169	654734	9.0	10.0	41925205	Great experience with my stay. Rachel and Grace we're friendly and helpful and the space was everything we could have wanted! We are already considering staying here again next year.
33170	654734	9.0	10.0	46147910	This was our first trip to the wonderful city of Seattle. Grace and Rachel's place was perfect. (Lovely and the location was awesome) Our host was so very hospitable and very helpful with area information . 
33171	654734	9.0	10.0	51576212	Rachel and Grace were great!  We booked last minute (not how I like to do things, but it happens)  and they were very accommodating.  We flew in after my parents did and they were worked with us so they were able to check in way early so they didn't have to drag luggage all over Seattle. Great location-great accommodations. The only down side was that the carpets were pretty stained in the entryway and down the hall.  
35744	7828222	9.0	10.0	44220978	"The room is simple and the neighborhood is quiet, it's 10 mins walk to downtown, very convenient!
Lubna was amazing, never get to meet her since she's out of the country, but she checks on me to make sure everything are well, great communications!  "
35745	7828222	9.0	10.0	44366506	Nice and friendly hosts. The place was very spacious and cozy too. Great location. Recommend!
35746	7828222	9.0	10.0	48543086	Lubna's place was great! Very centrally located, enough room to sleep and relax, and very clean and tidy. We were able to get around very easily, walking to Capitol Hill and Downtown and using Uber and Lyft to get up to UW for a football game. She met us at the apartment and even drove us to dinner on the first night! Thank you so much!
36638	6882518	9.0	10.0	44262463	This is a great apartment at a great location, close to the action in Capitol Hill and downtown, but tucked in a much quieter block. The apartment has a very modern feel, clean and without clutter.  Reginald made the stay easy and relaxed. Very much appreciate the availability.
36639	6882518	9.0	10.0	44718767	"Reginald was extremely accommodating with my check-in time and the place was extremely clean and well appointed. The location is incredible, though parking can be a bit a steep on the street. A few blocks North right off Pike has some free street parking, though it can be a hike. 

Overall though this place was spot on. Comfortable and clean. There is no TV or AC, though we didn't spend enough to time in the apartment to warrant them. Would definitely recommend, particularly at this price point."
36640	6882518	9.0	10.0	45420553	"A+
Apartment is fantastic, neighborhood is fantastic, and the host even left me with a complimentary bottle of wine! 

I loved this AirBnB and you will too!  Definitely stay with Reginald! :)"
36641	6882518	9.0	10.0	48233573	"Nice location. Apartment is simple, and equipped with the bare minimum, yet functional. Not much light though, and the photo description must be taken from the rooftop of the building: you don't have such  a view, the apartment being within the first 5th floors of the building (not giving up the exact floor of rprivacy purpose).
All thing considered, I would consider getting back there when staying in Seattle, since location is quite convenient, and price is a bargain."
36642	6882518	9.0	10.0	48796659	Reginalds flat in Seattle couldn't have been in a better location. We were able to walk everywhere. In less than 20 minutes you can reach Pike Place Market, the Waterfront, Seattle Aquarium, etc. We were in town for a weekend getaway and found this place to suit our needs perfectly. Reginalds friend Heather was incredibly flexible and able to meet us at any time to show us the flat and give us the keys. This flat is exactly as pictured and there were even two small bottles of red wine waiting for us to enjoy during our stay. The only cons I have are the smell of the building; the hallways had a very pungent smell. Also, being in the city I had hoped to have some sort of allotted parking space, this was not the case. Seattle is ridiculously expensive when it comes to parking as well. Overall I highly recommend this place and will keep it in mind the next time I'm in the area. 
36643	6882518	9.0	10.0	49264802	"The apartment worked perfectly for my trip.  It's located in a quiet area and everything I needed was within walking distance including downtown, Pike Market, and the Conference Center.  The apartment was spacious and modern feeling. Reginald was great to deal with - quick to respond and accommodating with check-in/check-out times.

36644	6882518	9.0	10.0	49507300	Apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. Location was perfect, walking distance from everything! Host was very hospitable and nice. Definitely recommend a stay here!
36645	6882518	9.0	10.0	51802929	"Reginald's place was great. It was in a good location. Within walking distance from all the major touristy spots. It's right near Broadway where a lot of the stores and restaurants are. Parking can be a struggle. I parked in a parking garage two streets down from His place.
It was $15 for all day but it'll only give you that option in the day time. If you're parking there in the evening, you can get 10 hours for $3. The apartment itself was nice and neat. No tv or anything but there is wifi. If you're on a mission to see what Seattle is all about, you won't need all that extra stuff. Seattle has a lot to offer...even if your visiting on the weekdays. It can get a little noisy especially since it's right near two hospitals. I didn't mind it much though. Rain or shine. Go up to the rooftop and check the view out. It's amazing! I would definitely stay at Reginald's place again. "
36646	6882518	9.0	10.0	52262711	"I stayed at Reginald's place for a weekend in October and it was a delightful experience! The location is great: a pleasant to walk in neighborhood with a bike station two blocks away. The bikes make it a breeze to get to Pike Place Market or anywhere else you want to get to (there are plenty of stations around). The apartment is very charming and specious. The kitchen is stocked with all the tools and utensils you may need -- we cooked in once to take advantage of all the seafood Seattle's fish market has to offer.
Would definitely stay again."
36647	6882518	9.0	10.0	52643623	This is a great location for getting around the downtown area of Seattle. His friend Heather greeted us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment. Everything was clean and easy to find. The only amenity that ran low was shampoo/conditioner but that was pretty easy to get ourselves. The roof has an amazing view, and I definitely recommend going up all times of the day to get some great shots of the city. There was an odd odor in the hallway that someone else commented on, but inside the apartment was fine. Lots of kitchenware if you feel like cooking but also a lot of great places to eat around the area as well.
36648	6882518	9.0	10.0	52998516	My host was always attentive of my needs and was aware of my arrival and return .
36649	6882518	9.0	10.0	54402307	Our trip was great. The apartment was in an excellent location, and when we arrived there was a bottle of wine waiting for us. Reginald was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed, and we will definitely come back to his place when we come to Seattle. If we had any notes, I can't think of any right now. We loved it. 
36650	6882518	9.0	10.0	54654450	Fantastic experience.   Great apartment, great part of town, great host.  
36651	6882518	9.0	10.0	55254119	Reginald's apartment has perfect location and great environment. It takes about 20 minutes walking to pike place market, and 30-40 minutes to space needle tower. If you take Uber or drive, it would be only 5-10 minutes. Also, the apartment is clean and comfortable. I must say that it's a good choice in Seattle.
36652	6882518	9.0	10.0	56885420	Nice, spare space convenient to downtown Seattle.  Good value.
36653	6882518	9.0	10.0	57594062	Reginald's place is very cool: Convenient location, clean apartment, and gracious host!
36889	6226666	9.0	8.0	36234702	My wife and I stayed for four days in this great home. It's easy to find, and checking in was super easy with the key made available in a lockbox. Our host was rapidly responsive and everything was just an Uber away. Most importantly, the place was very clean with fresh towels and toiletries left for us. Would definitely recommend it for others!
36890	6226666	9.0	8.0	37792973	The ad reflects this condo exactly. Nice building, great neighborhood. Condo was very clean and the clean towels were appreciated. Kitchen was very functional and the bathroom was as well. Thank you very much!
38478	6412566	9.0	10.0	36461622	The place was great. It was easy to find, close to the airport and all of the attractions in Seattle and the view is even better then the picture. It was quiet and we felt safe. Would love to come back again if ever in Seattle again. Very nice indeed.
38479	6412566	9.0	10.0	37177412	We loved staying at the Sunset Grotto! The rooms were very nicely decorated and Krystal was a great host. She is very prompt with all questions and concerns. The location of the Grotto can't be beat- close to the beach, the Junction, and a short car ride to downtown.
38480	6412566	9.0	10.0	37812290	"Amazing location, amazing place. 
everythings are ready for the guests.
I would traveling Seattle again for just stay in this place."
38481	6412566	9.0	10.0	38674661	The place had amazing views and was in a great part of West Seattle!  It was definitely functional for our quick trip to Seattle. 
38482	6412566	9.0	10.0	38764073	Great communication before arrival, nicely labeled entrance and parking spot, clean, nice view. No complaints
38483	6412566	9.0	10.0	39050821	Krystal was a great host and we enjoyed our stay at the grotto.  Great location.  Convenient to restaurants on California Ave.  Good view of the Sound.  The grotto is comfortable.  we slept well on the bed.  shower was solid.  The communication on entry was clear.  All around great experience for those seeking a quiet place to say when enjoying West Seattle and the surrounding area. 
38484	6412566	9.0	10.0	39311633	"Krystal was most accommodating and Sunset Grotto was  true to the description  put forth.
A  colorful sunset view and a good night's sleep was  a fine start to my Seattle visit."
38485	6412566	9.0	10.0	39706919	Our stay was very enjoyable and had all of the amenities we needed including a comfortable couch and large screen TV. The apartment is the downstairs level of a family home with a private entrance from the backyard and a parking spot in the back alley. Check-in was very easy and Krystal was prompt in getting back to us whenever we had any questions or concerns. The location was great and very close to Alki beach. 
38486	6412566	9.0	10.0	40805578	This is a both a terrific space and location. I rented the lower level of the house, which consists of private entrance, bedroom (real bed), living/family room, kitchen area w/full size fridge, utencils, plates, glasses, etc., plus bathroom. Very comfortable and clean.  Also a welcome letter from the host, which made it clear how to reach them with any questions or trouble.  Location is close to the beach, downtown & Freeways, plus neighborhood shopping.  This was a good experience and I would both recommend this listing to others, and come back.
38487	6412566	9.0	10.0	41790093	The place delivered everything that was promised. Parking was great, proximity to the beach and the city was perfect. This will be our first choice when we visit again!!
38488	6412566	9.0	10.0	42865178	Krystal was a great host. She is very friendly and easy to communicate with. Always texted me back within a couple of minutes. The grotto is very nice and comfortable and in a beautiful, safe neighborhood. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I definitely want to go back next year if my relative still lives in Seattle. 
38489	6412566	9.0	10.0	43423335	The Grotto was all ready for us when we arrived, after a looooong delay at the airport! We were so happy with the accommodations and the location is close to the most wonderful bakery on California Street.  Krystal gave us our privacy, which was much appreciated. 
38490	6412566	9.0	10.0	43729374	Great appartment in a quiet neighborhood, located only 15 minutes (outside of rush hours) away from Pike Place Market, Olympic Sculpture Park and other fun Seattle attractions. Krystal was very accomodating, easy to communicate with and replied to all our questions super fast. Our only complaint would be the bugs: we spent very minimal time in the grotto- literally left around 8-9 am and came back around 10-11 pm at night - but we still had an encouter with 4 big spiders on the bedroom wall...so if spiders are not your fave, bare that in mind!
38491	6412566	9.0	10.0	44837279	Krystal was great and supplied an extra cot and sheets for us. The apartment was awesome! The restaurants near the Alki beach were fantastic and the view was amazing.
38492	6412566	9.0	10.0	46178472	We had a wonderful time in Seattle, the place was just what we needed with a little extra. It was spacious and clean. Krystal even provided clean towels and soaps. We were given ultimate privacy and left to explore the city. She was quick and fast with a response to text. I would definitely stay again if I travel to Seattle anytime in the future. 
38493	6412566	9.0	10.0	46431393	Krystal's property is an incredible place to stay and has quite the view of Seattle from Alki Beach. I will recommend her place when asked always. Krystal was also very inviting and helpful in assisting us with our needs while visiting. 
38494	6412566	9.0	10.0	47375945	Neighborhood is nice. View from front window great. Garden path confusing after dark!
39020	86185	9.0	10.0	256950	We had a nice room at Jane's place and  it just happened to very close to were we wanted to be, it is in a very nice part of west Seattle and the walking is great to the beach, we will be staying there again if they will have us.
39021	86185	9.0	10.0	294570	This was our first AirBNB experience but will not be our last.  Jane was a great host who respected our privacy but was always available to us when needed.  The accomodations were very comfortable, clean, and quiet.  Great location and neighborhood.  Enjoyed our walks.  The snacks were an extra nice touch. We enjoyed our stay and hope to stay with Jane again soon.  A great experience and we highly recommend Jane's a a place to stay.  Can't say enough.   
39022	86185	9.0	10.0	312143	Jane's room was comfortably furnished and even had a gas fireplace.  She was thoughtful in putting out muffines, fruit, snacks, and coffee.  I did not see her except for the initial check in, when she was helpful.  The house was quiet and in nice neighborhood.
39023	86185	9.0	10.0	342744	"Jane's basement room in West Seattle was the perfect quiet and cozy getaway I needed from the hustle and bustle of NYC.  The bed is comfortable, snacks are provided, and Jane offers great tips and thoughts on the city and the neighborhood.  The house is also easy walking distance to Alki beach, where you will have beautiful views of Elliot Bay and the city skyline.  I hope to be able to stay there again!

Brian"
39024	86185	9.0	10.0	358917	This place was perfect for our time in Seattle. It had all the basic essentials - a cozy bed, a dresser, outlets for plugging in phones/electronics, a faux fireplace that my boyfriend loved, and a shower room with some toiletries provided. The hosts also left breakfast items, sodas, and other snacks for the road, which we appreciated immensely! Besides our check-in, we didn't see them at all; but our schedules were rather different. My boyfriend and I enjoy sleeping in until around 10am and exploring the sights until well past midnight. In this way, the privacy afforded to us was greatly appreciated. Only one thing to note: If you are a light sleeper and you sleep late in the morning, you can hear footsteps above you in the main part of the house. This didn't bother us because we tend to sleep rather heavily, and the place exceeded our expectations in other ways. Overall, great experience, and we would definitely go back here! Thanks.
39025	86185	9.0	10.0	390497	I enjoyed my stay in West Seattle!  Jane was a very accommodating host.  The room was comfortable and secure.  It was a good location to walk to Alki Beach or take the water taxi to downtown to take in the sights. Jane left some lovely snacks and coffee etc. which was great.  She also allowed me to use her washing machine for my sons soccer gear which was much appreciated. Overall a great place to stay.
39026	86185	9.0	10.0	457797	My husband and I really enjoyed Jane's place. She treated us with unexpected hospitality and was very generous in helping us plan our trip. The room was private, cozy, and the bed was comfy. We would absolutely spend time there again and will definitely refer our friends to her!
39027	86185	9.0	10.0	486824	"We really enjoyed our stay at  Jane's ""West Seattle Cool"". For privacy and seclusion, it can't be beat. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. Jane went out of her way to provide us with delicious, muffins, fruit, yogurt and great coffee with fixings. We plan on returning and will be using ""West Seattle Cool""."
39028	86185	9.0	10.0	522637	"Wonderful space and Jane is an excellent hostess.  Comfortable, clean room; fruit, muffins, coffee and snacks left for us; tons of local tourist information displayed on coffee table; and books, DVDs, and TV for entertainment on rainy Seattle days.  The location can't be beat--minutes from California Ave and Alki Beach.  We had a fabulous time! 
"
39029	86185	9.0	10.0	538434	Jane's place is a wonderful place to stay. It was quiet, comfortable and very cozy! It's close to the beach and walking distance to shops and restuarants. I'll be looking forward to staying there again!
39030	86185	9.0	10.0	699625	Jane has a great place! It's private, spacious, cozy and comfortable! It's within walking distance to the beach, shopping and parks! We had a great assortment of breakfast foods and Jane is a wonderful host!
39031	86185	9.0	10.0	891413	Jane is a wonderful host! She always checks on what we would like for breakfast. The room is very clean, comfortable and cozy! The bed is wonderful and the apartment is within walking distance to the beach and shopping. We love it there!
39032	86185	9.0	10.0	1583664	My girlfriend  & I stayed with Jane on a 7 day trip to Seattle.  It was our first time using AirBnB and I can't think of a better first experience.  From the beginning, Jane made sure we understood how the reservation policy worked right down to the last day where she made sure that we had had everything we needed.  Jane is great and she is a great host.  She was very helpful as well as allowing us our privacy at all times.  The place was wonderful and exactly as described.  Everything was nice and clean and my girlfriend swears that it is one of the most comfortable bed she has ever slept in.  Needless to say, we really enjoyed our experience.  Lastly, Jane is quite a knowledgeable woman if you need any tips on anything in the area.  She constantly steered us in the right direction.  I can't say enough good things about Jane or our first AirBnB experience, so I will stop before I ramble too long.  Thank You Jane.  Great place and great location!
39033	86185	9.0	10.0	1663383	Great stay in the perfect location for us.  Everything in the suite was just as described and exactly as expected.  Would recommend this place and would gladly stay here again.
39034	86185	9.0	10.0	2018227	My husband and I were in West Seattle to do child care for our grandson (7 months old) so we wanted to find a place nearby. Jane's place was perfect for us -- great location (near Aldi Beach too), and we enjoyed the sitting room with the TV (we brought DVDs) and sofa. Even though it is in the basement, it's light and cheerful with the windows opening up to the front yard. Thanks to Jane too for all the goodies she left out for us and in the refrigerator -- coffee and muffins, fruit, etc. The bed is very comfortable. We would stay there again..
39035	86185	9.0	10.0	3179812	Jane was so kind to let us stay with her Christmas week while we visited our daughter who lives nearby.  The location was perfect for us.  Had the weather been better we could have walked to lots of restaurants and to Alki beach. The room was cozy and the bed ultra comfortable. Jane is very thoughtful, she left us a coffee pot, coffee, muffins, yogurt and other goodies which we were happy to have. You have complete privacy, like your own apartment. We would stay with Jane and Dave again. 
39036	86185	9.0	10.0	5975612	We had a great time at Jane's place in Seattle. She was such a lovely host - even allowing us to start our time there while she was away. We found the house easily with her directions and were all set up with maps, suggestions, and LOTS of snacks upon our arrival. She also let us use the laundry, which was a godsend after all of our traveling! The room was comfortable and had everything that we needed. We were walking distance to Alki Beach and a short drive from the water taxi which was very easy and reasonable. I would highly recommend staying at Jane's place - it feels like you're in your own place and is the perfect location!
39037	86185	9.0	10.0	6269121	"Our stay was amazing.  Not only was the location terrific, Jane is an incredible host.  

She provided us snacks and beverages in our room and we had access to a fridge and coffee maker. She also ensured that the ground level was completely ours which was wonderful privacy.  

I would recommend that anyone stay with Jane if going to Seattle as the neighborhood is great and the drive into downtown is simple.  Hopefully we will be back again soon and thank you Jane for a great experience."
39038	86185	9.0	10.0	6791568	"We highly enjoyed our stay in this cozy getaway. The bed and couch were extremely comfortable, and the snacks were icing on the cake. 

The location was great for walks to the beach, local Safeway, and restaurants. There was a stand right on the beach where we could rent stand-up paddles, kayaks, and bikes. 

Jane was a great host who provided batteries for a flashlight and hand soap immediately after contacting her. 

Overall, a great place to stay."
39039	86185	9.0	10.0	7220443	This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a success! I booked this space for my Dad who was visiting me in Seattle and it was perfect for our needs. Jane was very responsive, thoughtful, and easy to work with both before and during my Dad's stay.  My Dad said it was a great location and hosted by very nice people. The room was nice and very private allowing him to come and go as he pleased. It was like having his own little apartment with access to a fridge and some snacks and such provided- anything that you need is right there. He also mentioned a few times how comfortable the bed was! We were both so pleased with this space and thank Jane and her husband for sharing it!
39040	86185	9.0	10.0	15780714	This was my first time using airbnb and my first time in Seattle. I stayed at Jane's with a friend and the space was perfect for the both of us. There were breakfast foods, snacks, and wine waiting for us when we got there which was late at night. She stayed up and showed us around and was there when we needed her. She offered me wine one night when I was off to get dinner and I ended up having a nice conversation with her and her friend. Perfect distance to the beach for a nice run and close enough to shops and food to walk to if you don't have a car. She even drove me into the city herself when my friend was busy. I would definitely recommend Jane to anyone visiting Seattle!
39041	86185	9.0	10.0	16499611	Our experience at the Admiral in West Seattle was fantastic. It started weeks before our arrival with our communication with Jane who was absolutely hospitable and quick to respond to messages and questions. When we arrived there was wine, snacks, coffee, cold beverages and other amenities like internet and maps of Seattle. Very quiet location and easy to find outside of downtown Seattle. We would definitely visit again and we enjoyed every minute of our stay!   
39042	86185	9.0	10.0	17054113	This was our first Air bnb experience and it was a great one. Jane was very responsive throughout the process. She was out of town when we arrived so we did not end up crossing paths in person but she was welcoming and her generous touches were evident throughout our stay. The air bnb is very private (separate entrance and space) and it is comfortable and very near to Alki Beach (highly recommend). 
39043	86185	9.0	10.0	18441173	We really enjoyed our stay here. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and snacks. The room is nice, well appointed, and we had the entire basement to ourselves. The house is located in a great, quiet neighborhood, close to stores, restaurants, and Alki Beach, not to mention the gorgeous backyard (who is the landscape architect anyway?). It worked well for us visiting our daughter and her husband in West Seattle, since there are very few hotels in that section of town. I would recommend this to a friend, and would stay here again. 
39044	86185	9.0	10.0	19912257	Staying at Jane's in West Seattle was a great choice. The room was large and comfy with plenty of extras. Fruit, snacks, coffee, milk and muffins. A short ferry trip to the CBD was easy. Go to Dale Chihuly glass exhibition, amazing. 
39045	86185	9.0	10.0	20127955	Jane's place provided the perfect spot for a quick  3-night weekend trip to Seattle. It's like having your own private apartment. Very comfortable. She was very communicative and quick to respond in regard to all of our booking arrangements, but left us to do our own thing once we were settled.
39046	86185	9.0	10.0	20468727	"We had a very comfortable stay at Jane's. We received a warm welcome when we arrived, and made us feel right at home! Our room was very cozy and private. To get into Seattle we walked about 15 minutes to Seacrest Park to catch the water taxi. 

Jane was a wonderful host and I definitely recommend staying with her!"
39047	86185	9.0	10.0	27066945	I had a good weekend at Jane's--I enjoyed the very comfortable bed and the biggest tv ever. It was very convenient to my friends in West Seattle. I appreciated Jane's interest in what I like for breakfast and finding it there waiting for me upon my arrival.
39048	86185	9.0	10.0	37537838	Jane was the perfect host. Available and around, gave my family a lovely stay. They are vegan; vegan pastries and fresh fruit and nut bars in the room. Seltzer water in the fridge. Jane was so accommodating that instead of coming to my house after my roommate was out of town: they decided to stay with Jane.  She made us all feel so welcome.  
39049	86185	9.0	10.0	39288226	Great experience and recommendations! Loved the food and bottle of champagne
39050	86185	9.0	10.0	40956797	"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed staying at Jane's Airbnb. She owns a charming house in a beautiful area of West Seattle. (Safe area, short walk to the beech) Jane gave us plenty of delicious snacks and drinks. 
We had a few short and sweet interactions with Jane and her husband. One night, I was about to rush out to a local grocery because I forgot to pack a toothbrush. Jane's husband caught wind of this and gave me a brand new toothbrush.  "
39051	86185	9.0	10.0	43272110	Jane's mid-century modern home is a wonderful place to stay. The landscaping was our favorite part with the paver stones and beautiful design of plants. Jane provided us with snacks, wine and more to make our stay even more comfortable. The location is just a few blocks from the beach where you can enjoy delicious food, fishing, kayaking and jump the ferry to downtown! I highly recommend Jane's home to anyone making a trip to Seattle.
39052	86185	9.0	10.0	46192333	"Jane's place was exactly as listed and very clean. I was very happy to be able to spend a couple nights at her place. She was nice enough to answer the door after I got to her place late. She is very hospitable and laid out snacks for us, even spending time to suggest places of interest and tell us a little bit about herself. This made me feel safe with the knowledge that I'm actually staying with a really nice person.

Don't worry if the neighborhood is dark at night, the people there just love the peace and quiet. If you need to pick up anything, there's a good number of shops just 5 minutes away.

Overall, if you are looking for a quiet, clean place to stay outside the city but still just 10 minutes drive from all the hustle and bustle, then I'd definitely recommend Jane's place!"
39053	86185	9.0	10.0	48919736	"Jane was the sweetest person, very welcoming and accommodating.  My girlfriend and I much appreciated her flexibility and assistance settling in.  The room was comfortable and had an awesome big screen TV, I got to watch some football on.

The beach was a little bit more difficult to get to than I had hoped, (hills and curved streets... ect) felt like more of a 1-2mile walk, better to just uber.  Another downside was the location of the room (next to the garage and under the living room) we woke up a few time to footsteps above and or opening garage/car starting in the early morning.

Big plus was Jane referred us to a local spot for breakfast called the ""admiral Bird"" that was awesome and soon became our go to place in your morning."
39054	86185	9.0	10.0	51308744	"Jane was wonderful, quick to respond, and very accommodating. My parents needed a place to stay near me, and her house was perfect. 

She had left goodies ( fruits, coffee,yogurt, and granola) and even a generous bottle of wine.The location was very convenient because it was close to me, easy to locate and in a very unique Seattle neighborhood. 

The room is very private, which  my parents enjoyed since they needed a little retreat and quiet as they just wanted a relaxing weekend Seattle getaway. "
41215	2134911	9.0	8.0	14753347	The Studio at Mibbett Hollow was everything promised from the advertisement and very comfortable; the location and view were even better! I was a first-time boat dweller and I loved it. Princess, the cat, is a sweetheart and Lynne is a delight to get to know. Everyone at the marina was friendly; the location is safe and convenient. 
41216	2134911	9.0	8.0	15078535	"Had a great visit with my son and stayed on Lynne's great houseboat. She was there to share info as needed, pick up milk for my morning tea and was a good unobtrusive host. We chatted in the evenings briefly if we were both around. The studio is comfy and princess the cat is a nice occasional visitor : ) Easy to get to, onsite parking, comforts of home away from home and anticipated boat facilities. I will surely be back now that my son is a Seattle transplant. 
"
41217	2134911	9.0	8.0	16169810	Lynne was a wonderful host. She welcomed me and told me everything I needed to know, she even took me to the grocery I needed to get to! The place was cozy and comfortable and her cat, princess was precious.
41218	2134911	9.0	8.0	16368611	"Lynn was gracious and helpful. It was a great time to stay on a Seattle house boat.
It's great to see the boats go by in the morning, right out the window."
41219	2134911	9.0	8.0	19377114	Lynne was a very gracious host, she met me at the houseboat the first day and went over everything I needed to know.  I had a magical experience on the water in her home, I will gladly visit again.  The location of her home is very close to the Ballard & Fremont neighborhoods, which was a perfect location for my trip. Thanks again Lynne for your hospitality!
41820	479653	9.0	9.0	1862440	The house was great, clean and well-kept, with plenty of room for the 4 of us! Patricia was a wonderful host, extremely friendly and accommodating to all of our requests. Great location, easy access to public transportation. Next time I visit Seattle, I would definitely stay again!
41821	479653	9.0	9.0	2160470	"My friend and I rented this house for a month while we went apartment hunting downtown.  It was very clean and Pat addressed the few things we mentioned very quickly.  We mentioned that the wireless was difficult to connect to and she immediately bought a range extender that solved the problem.

It has easy access to I-5."
41822	479653	9.0	9.0	2338629	Patricia was a great host!  The house was very comfortable and well-stocked, conveniently located, and perfect 
41823	479653	9.0	9.0	2418510	I rented out Patricia's house on Beacon Hill for my family during their visit to Seattle.  The house is very comfortable and in a nice and quiet location.  Patricia was very friendly and even had some juice and snacks for the children.  I would definitely recommend staying here.
41824	479653	9.0	9.0	2754816	This sleepy little home in Beacon Hill was great! It was the perfect retreat for the 5 of us after long days of exploring (email hidden)e house is conveniently located a block or two away from the 36 bus (which we took directly downtown) and the location was quiet but not too removed from the city.   Pat and Al were so accommodating and responsive from when we booked the place to our actual stay. They even left us some treats to eat in the morning! I would highly recommend staying with Pat and Al if you're planning a trip to Seattle.
41825	479653	9.0	9.0	3232304	Pat and Al were awesome to us. We were 4 adults and 2 toddlers from Vancouver meeting in Seattle for New Years. The Sleepy on Beacon Hill was perfect for our family reunion. The house was very clean and spacious. Its not too far away from downtown (maybe 15 mins by car). It was a little chilly during our stay but Al was prompt enough to come and fix up the heating. We even got some complimentary firewood to use in their lovely fireplace! We would definitely recommend this space to anybody travelling to Seattle.
41826	479653	9.0	9.0	3427002	I enjoyed to stay in Pat house for the last 04 weeks. However, the  rental price keep increase  after  each time  that I  change the day of leaving ( 03 times)
41827	479653	9.0	9.0	3507373	We rented this lovely home for three of our staff members who work long hours in an intensive residency program. It was conveniently located, immaculate, cozy and such a restful place for them throughout the week. The hosts are wonderfully gracious and responsive to every need. Thank you!!
41828	479653	9.0	9.0	3707310	"This is a guest house, not anyone's residence, so it has the impersonal, minimally decorated feel of a hotel room. That can be nice - sometimes you just want to stay someplace where you feel like it's effectively your place for the weekend, rather than feeling like a guest in someone else's home.

The beds were comfortable and everything that we used (dishwasher, fridge, etc). worked perfectly. The living room was comfy for us to sit around and chat in. I liked the breakfast nook very much as a spot for morning reading and cereal (although it's only big enough for two). 

Pat and Al's communication was totally excellent; whenever I contacted them through airbnb they got back to me very quickly. We needed to check in a little early on the first day, and Pat and Al were flexible and nice about that.

There were four adults in our group - three slept on beds, one on the living room sofa, which she said was quite comfy - and I believe a couple of our group are planning to contact Pat and Al again for a future stay."
41829	479653	9.0	9.0	3828683	Pat and Al's house on Beacon hill was wonderful! It is perfectly located minutes from from everything you need to see in Seattle. Pat welcomed us with a bottle of wine and some fixings for a nice salad. Definitely recommended.
41830	479653	9.0	9.0	3989179	This was our second time staying in this house, and I'm looking forward to coming back.  Patricia was friendly, helpful and gave us all the information we needed. the house was super clean, and we all appreciated having a comfortable, quiet place to relax after a long day of convention work.
41831	479653	9.0	9.0	4121163	There were three of us staying at the Seattle Sleepy; my brother, my husband and me.  We had plenty of space, and never felt we were on top of each other.  We cooked dinner in the well stocked kitchen, and made good use of the wifi.  I really appreciated how easy it was to get to various places in Seattle, the ample parking, and the proximity of the Red Apple grocery store.  My brother would have liked having a television, but other than that. It was perfect for us.  Also, Patricia, the owner was very friendly and helpful to us.  We felt like welcome guests.
41832	479653	9.0	9.0	4412214	We very much enjoyed staying at Patricia's place! There was initially a minor issue with the heating system, which was taken care of promptly and without stress. One thing I will say - Patricia is amazing! We asked for a blender on Day 2, on a whim because we wanted to make fresh fruit smoothies from the fruit we bought at Pike's Place Market, and she delivered one within 20 minutes!  Nothing beats that kind of service. Her home is lovely, well cared for, clean, and spacious. This place is also family-friendly, so if you have little ones, this place is A-OK.
41833	479653	9.0	9.0	4735231	"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle, and the accomodations at Seattle Sleepy on North Beacon Hill made the trip even better! Patricia and Al were wonderful hosts, and they made sure we had everything we needed in the house. They were always available to help if needed, and answered all our questions promptly. Fantastic communication via e-mail and phone.

During our stay,  we loved the sun room and the light-filled breakfast nook! Our children had a great time playing in the spacious and well-maintained backyard.  There was plenty of space for our family to unpack and relax...and it really felt like our home away from home! The house is very close to all the sites in downtown Seattle, and the Beacon Hill neighborhood is full of wonderful things to see and do. It is a safe, quiet neighborhood, and a great retreat from the busy downtown.  I plan to come back next time I travel to Seattle.  If you are looking for a great place to stay while in the city...you've found it! "
41834	479653	9.0	9.0	4791564	We had a very pleasant stay at Patricia's place on Beacon Hill. We initially felt that the house was not warm enough (we come from a tropical country near the equator so we are not used to cooler temperatures). But they were quick to help us warm up the central heating and also unlocked the controls for the heater in case we felt too warm later. Rooms and beds were nice. House was spacious and clean and tidy. Free laundry is really convenient. I'd stay here again.
41835	479653	9.0	9.0	4868412	Patricia's place was just lovely and perfect for our family get together, the place was very neat, and Pat had taken the extra mile to stock up with essentials and even Mac n cheese when she heard that we have a couple of kids. Pat was very responsive to our requests for adjusting thermostat and hair dryer, which was very sweet of her. The neighborhood was great, calm and pretty close to both airport and Seattle center. The kids loved the connecting pathway from living room to kitchen and bath, and the men loved the den with the recliners. I would recommend this place strongly, Thanks Pat, for your great hospitality :)
41836	479653	9.0	9.0	5100400	We had a great stay in Seattle!  Patricia was attentive and the home was clean and cozy. The location was perfect for traveling to and from downtown. Thanks Patricia!
41837	479653	9.0	9.0	5273163	We had a great stay at Patricia's Seattle Sleepy on North Beacon Hill. The house is clean and comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked with dishes and cooking items so that we were able to prepare many of our meals there. We had 5 people staying in the house and we were all very comfortable. Pat is the best kind of host in my opinion, quick to respond to any questions and other than that she left us to ourselves! All of our interactions with her were friendly and helpful. This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great start. 
41838	479653	9.0	9.0	5363622	"Thanks Patricia!
We had a great stay at your home. Thank you for being so comfortable and accommodating our whole family. Patricia was so thoughtful and brought us out a toddler bed for our little girl.  It was a great trip for our friends from Minnesota! The home was clean, well stocked and organized. We loved the easy access to mass transit. The little girls (4 and almost 3) got to ride on the light rail, tram, and street car and thought this was the highlight of their trip! "
41839	479653	9.0	9.0	5460171	We had a great stay here.  The house is roomy, sunny, and comfortable, with lots of privacy and a nice backyard, and a great little breakfast nook area.  Pat communicated quickly and clearly on everything, and our stay here was comfy and smooth.
41840	479653	9.0	9.0	5633848	"
We very much enjoyed our stay. The house was very clean and the garden was well tended. And it is ideally located between the airport and Seattle. Patricia was a wonderful host! She is a warm person, and very quick to respond to any concerns one may have. I would encourage anybody to stay here!"
41841	479653	9.0	9.0	5703346	When booking Patricia's replies were speedy, helpful and efficient. We are a large party which didn't faze Patricia in any way, in fact I would say Patricia went out of her way to accommodate us and make us feel at home. The house was well stocked, with all the necessities and then some. The cookies went down a treat with my children on arrival. There was an information area in the lounge which provided us with invaluable informative information. The house is located in a lovely quiet area, and a short distance into the city. We found a great store on 4th called Red Apple which had all we needed. There are other stores within walking distance from the house. While there, we got a city pass, which we found value for money (4adults 5 children) as it meant, everyone in our party was entertained. You get 2 trips on the space needle ( 1 you have to do after dark), aquarium, argosy cruise, science centre, museum, and choice of zoo or flight museum ). We were there 3 days and it was tough going to fit it all in, so we were fully entertained. If we ever get back to Seattle we would without hesitation book with Patricia again. Many thanks for a lovely stay.
41842	479653	9.0	9.0	5781500	Private, comfortable, homey; feels like you're a real resident of Seattle, not a tourist; close to major thoroughfares, but no traffic noise; private backyard with birdviewing opportunities; loved cooking, laundering, ironing with provided appliances and utensils; strong wifi; Pat and Al we're wonderful, responsive, genuinely concerned that our visit would be enjoyable; we will definitely stay here again, looking forward to our next visit.  Kay and Larry
41843	479653	9.0	9.0	5938078	"We ate a lot of the macaroni and cheese out of the cupboards. We did not get a chance to grill on the indoor fire pit and that makes me sad. There were lots of towels that is nice. We kept looking for a TV but could not find one. I think if they chopped the tree in front of the house down, it would be a good idea. There were lots of spiders around, but I think it was just spider season. There was ""lots of curls"" hair gel in the bathroom which is my favorite gel. There was also lots of body wash that we could use, but we brought our own. The house is very sturdy, it is made out of bricks. There also was no stereo but I brought my own speakers so we could have music. That made it less awkward. We sang loud and no cops came so that was nice. Nobody touched our cars or stole them, I was worried because it is a big city, but we did not have any problems. I bumped my head on the ceiling in the room in the basement, but I am taller than normal humans, so that probably was just my problem. I had the small people stay in that room. I'm pretty sure the Seattle Sleepy on North Beacon Hill experience cost me more than a hotel would, but it was nice to pretend that I had a house. I felt like a family man. The gas station closest to the house is owned by a grumpy man, and they don't have hot morning coffee there, or much else like fresh food, but they do have some things. It is not an am/pm. You cannot get corn dogs or potato wedges or chicken tenders there. They are not a deli. They are a gas station. They played Christian music inside though, and the grumpy man was humming along so I think he loves Jesus which is good. I wanted to plant something in the indoor garden too, but I also did not have time for that. There were many things that we wanted to do like sit in the front lawn in lawn chairs and wave at people driving by, but we actually were gone all day and only came back to sleep pretty late at night. I am afraid we did not get the full experience, but that is also my problem. There is also a table outside with an umbrella that we sat under to protect us from harmful UV rays of the morning sun. We could have had hamburgers there but we did not have time for that. There was plenty hot water to shower in, I do not like to shower in cold water. Even though there is only one bathroom, that is not a problem if you take turns. It is strange to me that the photo has a big tree that is hiding the house. That is funny. "
41844	479653	9.0	9.0	6066232	Patricia place was great, it felt like a home( our home) It was easy to get downtown via bus and quick via cab. It was a nice quiet street and allowed for some nice relaxation. Only issue was were weren't there long enough to fully enjoy it. Would love to stay again for longer.
41845	479653	9.0	9.0	6222815	Our kids absolutely loved staying in the spacious 3 bedroom house after staying in 2 queen bed rooms during our vacation.  It was great being able to cook breakfast and just relax.  Pat was wonderful.  Very responsive and wanted to make sure we were comfortable or know if we needed anything.  We would definitely stay there again.
41846	479653	9.0	9.0	6452908	"What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle!. We were here with 5 adults for a wedding in Seattle and stayed 3 nights.  It was easy to get into downtown by car or light rail and an easy ride from the airport. The house with 3 bedrooms ( all with dressers and closet space) easily fit our family.  The house was immaculate and well stocked with dishes, pots and pans, appliances all in excellent condition. The kitchen cabinets were stocked with tea, oil, and lots of instant meals.  We loved eating out in the yard. It felt like a home away from home.  So much better than staying in a hotel!
Patricia lives next door and stopped by to introduce herself and make herself available if we needed anything.
We would recommend this house and hope to stay here in the future.
Thanks, Patricia.
"
41847	479653	9.0	9.0	6556517	Nice home in a quiet area south of Seattle, but be aware that planes going to the airports fly nearby on a constant basis and this can be annoying if the windows are open.  Home was equipped with nearly everything we needed.  Patricia made sure that we had plenty of beds to sleep all of our kids and had everything ready upon our arrival.  She is quick to respond to emails and I know she would have been happy to help us with anything while we were there.
41848	479653	9.0	9.0	7199576	Really nice house, very clean, big rooms, nice living room, great patio I will recommended to my friends 
41849	479653	9.0	9.0	7349884	The reservation was canceled 70 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
41850	479653	9.0	9.0	7554369	"Patricia was an amazing host (she even came over to turn the heat up when it got a little chilly in Seattle!) The house was large, clean, well-kept and and in a quiet neighborhood.

Overall wonderful experience!

41852	479653	9.0	9.0	7869983	"We had 6 of us stay at the house. we thought it was perfect. Dog friendly,elderly friendly! We were surprised by the TV. It was funny how I BBQ in the bedroom, but food was great! Coffee pot was broken and she brought one right over to us! Great location for the freeway and downtown! Thank you we would love to stay again!
"
41853	479653	9.0	9.0	10551116	"Pat and her Beacon hill residence are both perfect. We stayed in Pat's home on our recent trip to Seattle and we couldn't have asked for more. Huge home, well furnished, clean and has the best host possible.
Pat's place has absolutely everything you need for a home away from home.  Will be staying here again and would recommend to anyone! 
This is one of the best on Airbnb"
41854	479653	9.0	9.0	10717603	My family and I had a lovely stay at Pat's Beacon Hill home while in Seattle for my son's wedding.  The house is very comfortable and spacious.  Pat greeted us the first day and was very helpful with recommendations for our shopping needs.  though we had a lot of family members come and go we managed quite well with the one bathroom.  The neighborhood is quiet, charming and convenient to the light rail and stores.  i highly recommend  Pat's Beacon Hill House.  
41855	479653	9.0	9.0	11402109	This house is perfectly located close to the freeway. Easy to get to and not too far from the city core. Patricia was a fantastic host. Great communication. She called to check in with us upon arrival. I will definitely keep this listing in my back pocket for future use.
41856	479653	9.0	9.0	12366626	"This place was perfect for us and our extended family after three weeks on the road in campervans. Although it usually only sleeps 8 Pat was very accommodating and allowed us to fit 14 people in (6 adults and 8 children) and we were still very comfortable. 
The house is spacious with a large yard for kids. It qas easy to get into town to see Seattle and there are plenty of interesting places close by in Columbia City too. And if you don't mind a bit of a walk you can easily get too and from the airport on the light rail for $2.25!
Pat was a very kind and helpful host. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle, especially families. "
41857	479653	9.0	9.0	13486930	Our stay was pleasant, we enjoyed the location, which was near enough downtown city center. Quiet neighbourhood. Beds and bedrooms were comfortable and we were warmly welcomed by Patricia and her husband. However, we were slightly under prepared with toiletries, as we thought it would be adequately stocked. All in all, a good stay. Kitchen is well-stocked and lots of appliances to use.
41858	479653	9.0	9.0	13952140	Patricia was very friendly, had a very nice home, and a well-kept yard. It was nice to have a bedroom for each of my family members. The kitchen worked well to get us started on our day. The home is in a nice quiet neighborhood and within 15 – 20 minutes from downtown. I would recommend this place to any group of people visiting Seattle.
41859	479653	9.0	9.0	14969343	"We had eight people stay over three nights at the house and everything went very well. The house was large and accommodating, and even though there was only one bathroom we had no issues with making up a schedule. Pat was wonderful and stopped by on our second day there to say hello and make sure everything was going well. The house is also close to quite a few decent restaurants including an awesome karaoke place we went to late Friday night.
We had a large dinner party Saturday night and the kitchen worked perfectly for our needs (we baked a 12 pound ham!) There was someone doing yard work for while we had our dinner party Saturday night which was a bit distracting, but yardwork needs to get done at some point! The place was lovely, close to amenities, and quite comfortable. Would love to stay there again."
41860	479653	9.0	9.0	15212547	A wonderful place for a family to stay. We are a family group of 7.  Everyone had a bed.  There was enough space for all.  The kids had so much fun running and playing in the back yard. The kitchen had stainless steel pans and a crock pot.  The washer and dryer was so convenient for us.  There is a costco 3 miles away and a little grocery store 1/5 miles away.  The house worked great for us.  Thank you
41861	479653	9.0	9.0	16608892	The house was a great place to stay. It was very clean, spacious and kid-friendly. The house had a very comfortable vibe and was located in a family oriented neighborhood. Overall the experience was very positive and we would definitely stay here again.
41862	479653	9.0	9.0	20892426	"This pretty house is in a quiet, safe and friendly neighborhood. Lots of room to spread out and hang out. It has all the comforts of home plus a large backyard. We had several family parties there with no problem.  
Pat welcomed us with herbs from her garden and a big warm smile. She lives next door and is available when needed without being intrusive or nosy. We like to cook and requested a few additional kitchen items, which she quickly provided without questions.
We particularly enjoyed the Chief Sealth trail a half block away, with walking, pet-walking and biking in two directions through interesting neighborhoods, ending in a Japanese garden at one end and near the waterfront at the other. 
Another big plus for us was access to the main Beacon Hill bus line, #36, which runs every 10 minutes most of the day and into the night. It goes directly past the new metro station, which has access south to the airport and north to downtown Seattle. The #36 bus also goes to the International District, downtown to all the tourist attractions, and  then through the downtown bus tunnel with its connections to northern and southern parts of the city. We left our car in the driveway a lot and took the bus instead...even at night. With freeway I-5 nearly always gagged up, public transport was a huge bonus.  
We'll definitely book here again when we return to Seattle."
41863	479653	9.0	9.0	21335378	Patricia was an absolutely wonderful host- welcoming and helpful.  The house exceeded all of my family's expectations.  It is clean, spacious and very comfortable.  The outdoor seating area gave us a wonderful place to relax and spend time together.  The neighborhood is very safe and pleasant.  Thank you, Patricia, for making my family's trip to perfect!
41864	479653	9.0	9.0	22074929	The listing was just as I expected...very spacious with all amenities (wifi, towels, sheets, extra pillows, blankets and a nicely stocked kitchen).  Pat and Al were wonderful and responded to every question I had in a timely manner. 
41865	479653	9.0	9.0	22297894	"Patricia is a lovely host. She lives next door so if you need anything, she will be right by to help you out. She even let us stay past our checkout time due to conflicts of our bus schedule.
The house was amazing for our weekend trip. It's stocked with just enough to get you started. (coffee, sugar, even some pasta!) The charming rooms are great and beds are sooooo comfy. We fit 8 people comfortably here. If you wanted to fit more, that's no problem because there is space on the couch.
The only thing to keep in mind is that there is only 1 bathroom. We initially figured this wouldn't be a problem but with 3 girls who take 2 hours to get ready, it's our fault! "
41866	479653	9.0	9.0	22680576	Pat was a wonderful host to my friends and I! She came over to make sure that we had everything we needed and very easy to talk with and open. We had a fantastic time staying at her place and look forward to staying there again in the future!
41867	479653	9.0	9.0	24283053	"Patricia is such a nice host. She is so nice and make us feel like being home. She provide us all the useful informations about exploring the neighbourhood and the city. 
Her house is so cute and clean. The most impressive part of her place is the kitchen. Every thing is so clean and she has even prepared us neccessary seasonings and food. 
I feel so lucky to have such a chance to stay in Patricia's place with my friends. And I will definitely go back to her next time I visit Seattle."
41868	479653	9.0	9.0	24844807	We had a lovely stay. Patricia met us at the door and showed us around and pointed out the features of the property. This was our first airbnb experience and it was definitely a success. 
41869	479653	9.0	9.0	25176505	Pat made us feel welcome and was very responsive to any questions we had. The house was super convenient for our purposes--a nice big space, a short drive from the airport and downtown. It being Seattle in January, we didn't take advantage of the nice back yard, but we definitely would have in warmer months.
41870	479653	9.0	9.0	32225714	The host canceled this reservation 74 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
41871	479653	9.0	9.0	34622488	We had a great stay at this house in Seattle.  It was just as pictured and the host, Patricia, was easy to reach and helped us with all of our needs.  We were in town to attend a graduation at UW and had three couples and two children.  We enjoyed the stay and would return anytime.
41872	479653	9.0	9.0	38989168	We had a great stay in Seattle. The house was clean and inviting. There was plenty of space for us all. We were in Seattle for a family wedding so it was great to have such a wonderful house to accommodate us all. I'd stay here again no problem. Thanks Patricia for your hospitality and your amazing house! 
41873	479653	9.0	9.0	47679519	Wonderful rental!  The house was clean, organized, and very comfortable.   Patricia was incredibly kind and made sure everything was perfect for our arrival.  We had a fantastic stay!
41874	479653	9.0	9.0	49615520	Mrs. Pat is a awesome host. We were in town for a wedding and the house met our needs. It was in a nice quiet area, grocery store is not far from the house. Mrs Pat stopped to talk to us briefly and even brought over a extra fan for us to use because all of us sleep with one. We had no problems checking in and out of the house.  We had a great time!!!!!!!!!!
41875	479653	9.0	9.0	51433742	We enjoyed staying at Pat's house. The location was perfect for our needs.  the house was accurately described and well stocked. 
41876	479653	9.0	9.0	57038114	Loved this place! Close to everything downtown and a Safeway close by. My family, my parents, and my sister and her husband stayed here comfortably. Patricia and Raphael were great! Came over to help us get settled. Would definitely stay again!
42141	573942	9.0	9.0	2048835	Angielena was a most courteous and helpful hostess.  The atmosphere of the building was totally interesting.and I would recommend this to anyone. The residents are artists and each one I met was a pleasure.    The neighbornood is in an old part of Seattle that has been renovated and filled with shops, restaurants, and bars- all inviting and fun.    I do not have anything on the negative side to add, as I have been in rooms all around the country and this is right at the top.                 
42142	573942	9.0	9.0	2184268	"Angielena is such a sweet lady... She was very accommodating and checked in on us regularly to be sure we were making out OK.  The location of this building was ideal for us as we were attending MLB and NFL games and it is literally less then 5 minutes away.

The inside of this building is undergoing revitalization that we weren't really aware of, so it was dusty and the room had a slight musty smell.  I think once the inside is finished, this building will be a gem.  Our room was very small and was not the room in the photo/booking, but  we were comfortable nonetheless..

The bathroom in this building was a pleasant surprise just as the photo shows. The shower is beautifully done and is all tile with numerous shower heads and glass walls.  It was hard to monitor your bathroom time because you won't want to leave.

All in all we had a pleasant stay with Angielena and we thank her for her accommodations."
42143	573942	9.0	9.0	2291453	Great place and very hospitalize. I love this neighborhood and the history there. 
42144	573942	9.0	9.0	2402986	"Our stay with Angielena was great. When I booked our room, the room  that I had initially wanted was already booked. Angielena upgraded us to the Madame Goldie room (no extra cost). This is truly the artist living experience. The rooms are in a artist space with lots of art work to check out explore. There is a small kitchen that should be suffice for your basic cooking needs. The bathroom really is the highlight of the accommodation. Brilliant. 

If you are looking to be off the beaten path but still very close to the inner parts of Seattle, Georgetown is a really cool place to stay and check out. There some really interesting galleries, record stores, eateries and a local brewer to check out. 

The pro and con of this stay -  this is an smallish neighborhood with one really fabulous street. So that means all the pubs and excitement are really close as well. If you are looking for a quite place with crickets and a hooting owl for your R&R, this might not be the place for you.   

Overall, I had a great time and would stay here again. "
42145	573942	9.0	9.0	3345549	"George Town is by far the coolest spot in Seattle. The bohemian grassroots DIY vibe of imaginative and dutiful restoration is perfectly complimented by the creative artistic style and flair of the residents and entrepreneurs. On top of the list would be Angielena and her grand vision of what George Town can be. She's off to an even better start than when I last saw her with the George Town Arts and Cultural Center and the wonderful rooms she has to offer~! While in the area I was lucky enough to attend the local George Town Art Walk where I met many talented artists and saw hundreds of great pieces. Some by Angielena as well!
The room is comfortable and cozy and the location is perfect!  A great place for a wandering soul to lay down and explore Seattle to it's fullest. 
Thanks again Angielena for such a lovely stay!"
42146	573942	9.0	9.0	5219556	Angielena was a very accommodating host! She was responsive, attentive to our needs, and made sure we knew all the neighborhood had to offer. A great place to stay if you want to be right outside the city, but in a place that has a flavor of its own. 
42147	573942	9.0	9.0	5766742	"Georgetown is great!! We came down for the Subpop Festival and had the pleasure of enjoying the neighbourhood the Friday night before all the festivities kicked off. Some really fun and CHILL places to go. Have spent quite a bit of time in Queen Anne/Ballard/Fremont/Capital Hill areas -  Georgetown is now, by far, my favourite. My bf even went back a few days later to pick up a guitar from the local music shop he couldn't stop thinking about!

Angielena was a great host. The building was really cool and our room was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed ourselves and would definitely stay there again. :)"
42148	573942	9.0	9.0	5853968	"Overall, Georgetown is a great area, very easy to get downtown. Its a 20 minute easy flat bike ride.  The bus is also available and convenient.  Its a twenty minute bike ride up to Beacon Hill or over to Columbia City is 30.  The local bars offer a good array of really good food and drinks. I would recommend staying here. Its a beautiful building, its very clean. The shower is RIDICULOUS and the ambiance is professional. I was able to store my bike safely and walked around totally comfortably in the evenings. Its delicious. 

That said, if you're looking for a bed and breakfast this is more of a bed. Its a remodeled hotel, so you're not in someone's home. If you're looking to get to know the host or to chat with people when you get home at night, this isn't for you. Generally in the evenings there isn't anyone around and it wouldn't be uncommon to literally not see anyone and if you need something it can feel a little like you're imposing to ask (because you have to call or email, rather than poke your head out). It can be a little isolating. Its also in an airspace, which makes it cool - the Boeing field is awesome, but you can hear the people in the room next to you...and you can hear the planes. So if you don't sleep heavy, just be advised. 

I would do it again. i was there for work for a couple weeks, so I didn't necessarily want to chat but if I was there for a shorter time, perhaps I would have. Just an adviso for personality type!

"
42149	573942	9.0	9.0	6053474	Angeliena made us feel very well at the studio.  We checked in early from our vancouver trip and she allowed us to see the room while it was being flipped and kept our luggage in storage so we could go see the city.  When we came back the room was put together so nice!   The 106 or 124 bus will take you directly into town (century link field, safeco, pioneer square) within 10-15 minutes.  The location is a great and upcoming art mecca for Seattle.   Also the guest bathroom shower is to die for!  It is so beautiful and has many shower heads on the walls.  
42150	573942	9.0	9.0	6119886	"I loved the people of Georgetown.  Had such a fun trip.  Angielena was very accommodating.  Everything was conveniently located.  My room was clean and the other ""tenants' were pleasant.  For a simple, uncomplicated accommodation, it was very nice.  Couldn't ask for a better stay for the price. 
Thank you for having me.   "
42151	573942	9.0	9.0	6401570	"Our stay with Angelina was great, and I would definitely stay there again. She is very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. 

The building is in a great location, right above a nice little pub and a soon-to-be-opening coffee shop, with the Georgetown Trailer Park Mall in the back parking lot, as well as being very close to the I-5 freeway. 

Just down the street within a 5-minute walk are numerous bars/pubs, a diner, coffee shops, and cafes. If you stay, I would highly recommend walking down to the Hangar Cafe and getting breakfast/lunch -- they do a bunch of delicious sandwiches and savory or sweet crepes. 

The building was very nice and clean, though it definitely can trap the heat during the summer, but AC units in the rooms take care of it, and I can't imagine that being much of an issue the majority of the year.

The only reason I didn't give five stars is because of a few minor things:

--- The blackout curtains mentioned weren't present in our room,
     and it got very bright in there at night, as our window was
     facing a hallway which had a light on 24-hours. 

--- The bed was fine, although it might be too small for taller folks
    (my boyfriend is 6' tall and his feet were pushed up against the 
    bed frame when he lay down), and it was very, very firm. People 
    with back pain might have a hard time. 

--- The breakfast provided was more of just coffee and a french 
    press (which we had to look up how to use since we've never
    owned one), tea, yogurt, and some bagels. 

--- We couldn't reliably connect to the wifi from our room; 
    my phone would connect every once in a while for a few 
    minutes, but my boyfriend's phone and our laptop weren't ever 
    able to connect unless we went out into the hallway across 
    from the room. 

Any other issues we had were resolved quickly and professionally."
42152	573942	9.0	9.0	6518257	I would highly recommend staying in this lovely Georgetown room.  The building is located in the center of Georgetown on a street with great restaurants, bakeries, shops and bars.  Georgetown is a great area that most visitors don't think to explore.  
42153	573942	9.0	9.0	6571471	Angielena's place is awesome. Great mix of artist studios and guest rooms with a really creative vibe to it. It's located in Georgetown, a very cool neighborhood with a lot of nice restaurants, bars and shops just around the corner and a short bus ride (about 20 mins.) away from downtown. Angielena was a lovely host, she had great recommendations and suggestions for us. We would definitely stay there again (And, yes, the shower is insanely awesome.).
42154	573942	9.0	9.0	6646226	Angielena provided us with a wonderful environment for our stay in lovely Georgetown, Seattle.  A fun and hip neighborhood to boot!
42155	573942	9.0	9.0	6717855	"This is the perfect place for art-lovers, free spirits and those looking to stay in a non-touristy part of town.  Georgetown, I was told, is an up and coming district and it has its own unique flavor and microcosm of businesses to explore over and above the usual spots in Seattle. I found it a wonderful home base to come back to every night and easily developed favorites among the coffee shops and bars.  

The Vintage Room was funky, clean & comfy.  It's spare, but it's got everything I needed - including a beautiful lowboy, and the shared kitchen and amazing bathroom bested any hostel I've stayed at.  The balcony out back, though, is the cherry on top of this place.  If I hadn't wanted to explore so much, I would've spent even more hours enjoying it and the unique trailer park park mall that's open on the weekends in the parking lot below it.  The vintage furniture and billowing fabric blowing in the breeze are a bit magical.

Angielena is a wonderful hostess and clearly takes pride in what she's created.  The whole building is full of artist studios, which she went out of her way to tour with me.  She was always available to answer questions & had a lovely, open personality I felt very comfortable engaging with.  (This was my first airbnb experience, so that was a bonus or me!).  When I get back to Seattle next, I'll hit this place up for a bed first!  "
42156	573942	9.0	9.0	6769329	Angielena is the perfect host with several great funky rooms in an artists' coop. Lots of simple, creative touches in the rooms and all around the entire building. It's eclectic, low key and really a pleasure to be part of Angielena's entrepreneurial vision in Georgetown's renaissance. Wishing you much success!
42157	573942	9.0	9.0	7043501	I really enjoyed my stay at Angielena's place. She was friendly, easy to contact and gave me some great tips for places to visit in Georgetown. The room was comfortable, good value for money and the shower was incredible! I would definitely stay with Angielena if I return to Seattle in the future. 
42158	573942	9.0	9.0	7265750	The vintage room in Georgetown, Seattle was perfect for my short and sweet stay in my favorite city. The space is clean, quaint, romantic, artful, and quiet. The host of the space is kind and resourceful, and she is attentive to the small details that create the sense that her guests are not only welcome, but appreciated. I would, and likely will, stay here again, and I'd recommend it to friends and family. Two thumbs up and five stars!
42159	573942	9.0	9.0	7589022	This space is fantastic! Personally, I don't like staying in a room in someone's home- it's weird and I don't always feel like seeing someone else when I get home. The Georgetown b&b is perfect- you can be social if you want to, or come home late from work (or the bars) without walking through your hosts' living room Netflix session. I'm a business traveler- but a cool one!- and this place offers everything I need to work, go out, and chill. I'll be back!
42160	573942	9.0	9.0	8005094	I highly enjoyed my stay with Angielena! The building is artsy and rustic (matching the town), the room is absolutely gorgeous it fits the pictures to a T. It's clean, quiet-of course there is the outside murmur but it's really not so noticeable when you're inside. There is soft lighting throughout the building, it's a great place to excite thoughts, relax-especially on the back patio. Anyone I ran into that either worked or stayed in the building was very friendly and polite-nice to chat with. You're left to your space, free range to cook in the kitchen, come and go as you please without feeling like you're interrupting anyone's moment or activity. Angielena left a wealth of info to travel around the city with, she's very supportive and attentive.  I would go back for sure
42161	573942	9.0	9.0	8064513	"Our stay was amazing. The host was incredibly friendly and welcoming, the room was cozy and we are at a loss for words for the ""Barry White"" bathroom.
The Georgetown area is fun and lively, and access to downtown by bus is directly across the street.
Overall, we are incredibly happy!"
42162	573942	9.0	9.0	8240030	We loved staying at Angielena's Vintage Room in Georgetown! The room was cozy, warm, and in a cool arty building in a fantastic part of town with excellent bars and restaurants. The bathroom with the crazy showerheads was to die for. Angielena was a perfect host - once we had trouble with wifi and texted her and she magically appeared at our door in about 3 minutes fully dressed in costume. Probably the highlight of our stay! Loved Georgetown, loved Angielena, loved the stay. Would definitely stay with her again! Thank you! 
42163	573942	9.0	9.0	8933206	I stayed during a business trip and the room, building, and experience was exactly as described. I would stay here again if I'm back in Seattle on another short term trip.
42164	573942	9.0	9.0	9817924	My friend and I had a wonderful stay here! The building is extremely charming, including a clean kitchen (with an wonderful tea selection), a balcony with a view, and a practically royal shower. We felt quite safe and enjoyed reliable communication with Angielena. In my experience, the building has a good balance of privacy and quiet, and occasional art events that provide a sense of life and energy. There are plenty of coffee shops and diners nearby and the buses to downtown depart from right outside the door. Whether you're there for a few days or a few weeks (as we were), this bnb is highly  recommended!
42165	573942	9.0	9.0	10187980	Great time and a great price. Host is very responsive and all your basic hotel type amenities are provided. I recommend it. 
42166	573942	9.0	9.0	10471627	I absolutely loved my stay at Angielena's art residence! It was comfortable and cozy, the Barry White bathroom was beyond compare, the back deck was great for chilling out and the artists I met during my stay there were all really cool. Definitely one of the most interesting places I've ever stayed & I would come back in a heartbeat... 
42167	573942	9.0	9.0	10578668	I had a great stay in the vintage room. My awesome host Angielena was very kind and accommodating. This historic building is filled with art and artists and has such a unique charm. I highly recommend Angielena and the b&b. I'll be back.    
42168	573942	9.0	9.0	10973098	What a unique Air BnB experience! To be completely honest, I booked for the 9 headed Mexican tile shower (completely met my expectations!) and didn't even realize I was staying inside such a cool multiuse building in the art district!!! I was only there for 2 nights on business and was completely bummed that I couldn't explore the area :/ parking is great, bed was comfortable and clean, kitchen accessories included a French press (my fav!), and it was quiet despite being in top of a bar ;) it is certainly the most eclectic place I have stayed... Angielena was so kind and helpful!
42169	573942	9.0	9.0	11075032	"We were thrilled to stay with you. So many wonderful experiences. I can still recall all the beautiful artwork. The place was so quiet, and we so enjoyed our room. We'll definitely be coming back soon. Best regards always.  Dan & Julia
"
42170	573942	9.0	9.0	11413704	"To be honest, I didn't read the description when booking so I was a bit surprised to find myself in an art center. However, it did turn out to be a quiet and relaxing place. The room had vintage decor and furniture but the bed seemed to be brand new - very good sleep! The shower is impressive and, seriously, a bit excessive - you'll see. All-together, a nice place for a few night's stay but for longer term, there are some things to consider (I stayed there for over two weeks). I wish the wi-fi was more reliable and the kitchen is rather small, there's an electric stove which I planned on using but eventually did not. With that said, I'm glad I didn't go and stay in some guy's living room on a couch for the same amount of money. Really. 
Btw, 15 min bus ride to downtown, and there are a few bars/cafes just down the block. That's pretty convenient if you ask me."
42171	573942	9.0	9.0	11800173	"If you're in the Georgetown area, and you're looking for a killer place to stay, please consider one of two of Angielena's places!  They are super cute, comfortable, and are in a GREAT location.  We walked all over Georgetown and instead of having to hail an Uber or a cab back to Capitol Hill or Queen Anne, we just walked right over to the Star Brass Lounge, grabbed a drink, then walked up the stairs to our little abode.  Might I add there's an 8 head shower as well.  I'll let your imagination run wild with that one.
Seriously, stay here.  IT'S AMAZEBALLS."
42172	573942	9.0	9.0	13120183	"Wonderful stay
In every way 
Nothing more to say. 

David "
42173	573942	9.0	9.0	13260276	"If you do not mind staying a little further away from downtown then this place is ideal. The bus stop is literally at the door and in 15 minutes you're already in downtown. 
The room is very warm and the renovated bathroom a must see! 
Angelina is super friendly and helpful. She prepared a selection of guides and maps for her guests, so sweet. 
The days I spent there were super sunny and maybe that's why I did not meet many artists. How Angelina said, everybody was outside! "
42174	573942	9.0	9.0	13428247	It has been a great experience staying at Angielena's place! Not only you are surrounded by art and artists, but the whole neighborhood, Georgetown, has been an amazing discovery thanks to our host reccommendations: the crepes at the Hangar Cafe, the beer at the Machine Brewery, ... And everything at a short bus ride of Downtown, having the bus stop just at your door. I would definetely stay there again. Thank you, Angielena!
42175	573942	9.0	9.0	15040600	Angielena is a very good host, she is considerate and always be there to help. My son has a good time living there.
42176	573942	9.0	9.0	16330012	We've had a wonderful stay at Angielena's Bella Vitale in Georgetown! Angielena was a great host and recommended the hair salon Spectrum house downstairs where we both got a very cool haircut and color. Georgetown is a beautiful, creative and friendly and historic neighborhood with good cafes, restaurants, nice shops and bars. We wish we could stay longer and if we return to Seattle we would be very happy to stay there again!
42177	573942	9.0	9.0	16588646	"We had a great time staying with Angielena! The room's bed was a bit smaller than we expected (full bed, not queen), but it was comfortable.  The air conditioner was also very helpful to have in the room because the building keeps the heat in very well and we were there during some very warm days.  

Angielena is a great host and very generous.  It was my first time booking with airbnb and I had a lot of confidence in the security of the building and my host.  She has a beautiful soul!

Although there are other guest rooms in the building, we never had to wait for a shower or a bathroom to be free.  Also, the house is very conveniently located to buses downtown and it's located next to Ellenos greek yogurt (which was my favorite treat during our stay).  We never ended up using the kitchen but it seemed to provide everything one would need."
42178	573942	9.0	9.0	16860438	Angielena was a great host. She was accommodating with our travel delays coming from the islands (plan early for ferry delays).  The room was small and comfortable, and in a fun artsy building close to a tasty mexican restaurant and coffee shops. The rain shower bathroom was amazing, and definitely a pleasure after a long day.
42179	573942	9.0	9.0	17059056	Angielena offers up a unique and comforting experience at this airbnb.  I was impressed not only by the shower but the whole feel of the building.  Everything is explained very well and there were no issues staying here.  The room had great air conditioning and enough space for two people to sleep in.  Thank you again!
42180	573942	9.0	9.0	17222715	Angeielena treated us quite well and we appreciated a nice stay in Seattle.
42181	573942	9.0	9.0	17838944	I have a great time staying here. The room is small, but very comfortable, with period furniture consistent with the vintage of the building, which is an interesting piece in itself. Quietest art studio building I've ever been in, it was shockingly easy to sleep here. There was live music downstairs on Saturday, but it didn't run super late, and there was no rowdiness during my stay. The neighborhood is busy and fun all the time, with loads of great places to eat, and drink. I was able to go downtown on public transit and by car very easily, so I got to see the things I came to see, and experience Georgetown, instead of a gloomy hotel in a commercial district, which was perfect. The shared bathroom was actually pretty nice, not at all squicky like shared johns I've dealt with in the past, so I was glad I didn't let that deter me from staying here. Angielena was an attentive, detail oriented host, with very well dressed dogs, and it was great meeting her. Soon this place will be the Madonna Inn of the Northwest, I'm sure.
42182	573942	9.0	9.0	18591174	What an excellent trip!! I was traveling alone, and I got lost (driving down from the great white north). Angielena checked on me, waited for me and was completely amazing!!  The room was excellent, homey and so welcoming as was the building. This area was so perfect and I wish I could have stayed another 4 days. Angielena explained everything so well  gave some great tips on where to get coffee, food and just made me feel totally at home.  The coffee shop close by Two Tartes had the best raspberry scone, and great coffee. The bar downstairs has a great burger and the Mexican restaurant was definitely a must. Am going to highly recommend this stay...oh yes, the bathroom is delightful! Thanks!
42183	573942	9.0	9.0	18947247	Angielena was an awesome host! She is very accommodating. She took us in and gave us the tour of the place earlier than we were supposed to check-in. I love the rustic feel of the building. The shower room was amazing! If you're driving, there's a big parking lot and Georgetown is a short drive to downtown which is very convenient. The neighborhood has a lot of restaurants, bars & food joints to choose from nearby even walking distance. This was our first trip to Seattle and a successful, fun trip at that, big thanks to our wonderful accommodations! We're very satisfied! 
42184	573942	9.0	9.0	19658408	Our experience here was very calm and accommodating. Angielena met us when we arrived and gave us a complete tour of the space. This building is full of character and very comfortable, a nice change of pace from downtown. The neighborhood has plenty of delicious and friendly places to eat and drink if you don't want to venture too far. We did this trip using car2go which was always close to the residence and allowed for quick trips into downtown/Capitol Hill/etc. I highly recommend taking advantage of the Barry White shower, especially the waterfall shower head. We had a wonderful time in Seattle, and Angielena's space and Georgetown were definitely highlights to our trip. 
42185	573942	9.0	9.0	20115509	"My host Angielena was incredibly welcoming and very amenable to my arrival schedule.I immediately felt like I have made a friend and I am excited for her to visit my hometown.She gave me maps and guides for all the different Seattle neighborhoods and also, most interesting to me, a history of the building and the area of Georgetown/(email hidden)is neighborhood was fascinating to (website hidden) is the oldest neighborhood in Seattle and it was exciting to still feel that frontier energy.Artists,musicians,creative people and working class make up this neighborhood. As an artist,I felt right at home and met many people at the various restaurants and (website hidden) is a very friendly area.The building itself was a former rooming house and brothel, so the layout is perfect for Airbnb guests.The bathrooms were numerous and all the plumbing was updated and able to handle the building's multiple (website hidden) was very clean and I appreciated the addition of soaps and shampoos and other free -for everyone to use -products,since I had managed to forget a few items.The bathrobe was a lovely touch.The room was quiet, clean and the bed incredibly comfortable.Other lovely perks, the back balcony with the outdoor curtains and tables and chairs was the perfect place to watch the sun go down.The bar below was super friendly and the noise did not affect my room.The bus line downtown is directly across the street.Everything was convenient.I will stay here again and again!

42186	573942	9.0	9.0	20227200	My boyfriend and I had stayed at the vintage room for 3night. we loved to stay there and felt very comfortable. people in there were kind, and Angielena gave us explanation and suggestions of neighborhood when we arrived. she is a nice person and willing to help guests. the place is artistic and there are a lot of fun. we were happy to be there and had a sweet time in Georgetown. thank you so much Angielena
42187	573942	9.0	9.0	20937961	First I have to say a big thank you to Angielena! She's been amazing and helped us on all fronts when we needed some help and gave us all the information we could have asked for! Big up! Her rooms are also lovely, very special surrounding with the art studios! The shared balcony was a great place to sit in the sun and relax or enjoy the view on the probably hippest spot in town! There are direct busses to downtown and capital hill leaving pretty much at the front door! But Georgtown is so cool, who wants to leave it anyway!? Thanks again to Angielena and her artists for having us! We'll be back!
42188	573942	9.0	9.0	25215403	It was a quite interesting stay since the building has a unique structure and are full of artists. Although it has many rooms like 20, the place was very quiet all day. Airplanes might be a bit of disturbance to a light sleeper during the night, but in general it's a very nice place to stay. People were gentle and respect one another. The shared kitchen was right next to my room and easily accessed, and the newly renovated bathroom was a state of art. The very pretty host, Angielena was welcoming and gave a lot of details about the area and tips around there in a warm and kind manner. I really appreciate it. Thank you! 
42189	573942	9.0	9.0	25642096	Angielena was very accommodating. The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable.
42190	573942	9.0	9.0	25815325	The listing description was accurate.  It was a beautiful space in a great neighborhood and was perfect for our needs.  Angielina was super friendly and helpful.
42191	573942	9.0	9.0	27218627	"This room, this building, and all the people inside, were fantastic. It fit all my needs. It was close to where I was taking a workshop in georgetown, close to public transit, full of character and art, and I got to talk to so many lovely creative people. Angielena is an incredibly accommodating host.  

I spent a good portion of my time on the lovely balcony, watching the planes (and some georgetown drama unfold). The rest of the time I spend enjoying the neighbourhood. It is a little rough around the edges, but has a lot of charm and very good people. 
If I go back to Seattle, I will stay here for sure."
42192	573942	9.0	9.0	27396313	what a great neighborhood and such a cool building!  So many great places to eat and drink within walking distance.  Or have an early morning cup of coffee on the really cool porch out back.
42193	573942	9.0	9.0	28837044	I had a lovely weekend staying in Georgetown at Angielena's beautiful and charming airbnb. Cool ambiance in a nice neighborhood and accessible to downtown, just a bus ride away. Thank you for being such a great host and for being so welcoming! 
42194	573942	9.0	9.0	30793828	Nice, well-located, and inexpensive lodging option. Everyone was really nice.  There are pubs, restaurants, and shops within the immediate neighborhood district. 
42195	573942	9.0	9.0	32646983	"100% positive experience staying here! Upon arrival, we were greeted and given a tour of the space by Angielena who made us feel comfortable and excited about our stay. Loved the vintage feel of the room! The bed was very comfortable with the light, down comfortable. 

This was our first time visiting the Georgetown neighborhood and would definitely visit again! Really great restaurants, coffee shops and amazing antique decor stores just down the street. Our stay was over the weekend so we got to enjoy the Georgetown Trailer Park Mall that is located right behind the building! So fun. Thank you, Angielena!"
42196	573942	9.0	9.0	33477267	"An affordable accommodation in a very arty neighborhood with a good selection of restaurants. Also, you can get to Downtown surprisingly fast. (We did it by car, but there is a bus station right in front of the house.)
We had some trouble getting in the building for a few minutes but it turned out that Angielena was just making sure everything's clean and couldn't hear her phone meanwhile. She was cleaning the awesome shower, which I would so love to have at home! :)

Once we were in, we meet Angielena's lovely little dog and she gave us a good tour of the whole place. Impressive building with a cool history!

We were a little surprised that the room didn't look like the one in the listing, but that apparently happened by accident: wrong room posted as available, while the it was already occupied. I guess there wasn't a big difference between both, so we didn't really care.
Note though, that the place feels somewhat like a hostel with private rooms, so if you are looking for a more close-up relationship with your hosts, this might not be perfect.
On the other hand, if you are looking for something affordable in a unique neighborhood, then this might be perfect for you!"
42197	573942	9.0	9.0	33729115	Really enjoyed my stay here. The room was very comfortable, located in an amazing old building right in the center of Georgetown. Angielena was a great host, easy to communicate with, and gave me lots of information about the neighborhood (there's a ton of stuff within easy walking distance).
42198	573942	9.0	9.0	36163173	The host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
42199	573942	9.0	9.0	36868428	Angielena, Savie, and the handful of resident artist are all wonderful, warm, and welcoming. My room was clean and cozy, the common areas were tidy, and any concern was addressed promptly. Georgetown is a funky neighbourhood with good restaurant and bar options. Getting groceries and doing laundry were a bit of a pain as a trip to adjacent Beacon Hill or West Seattle are necessary. Loved it though, highly recommend it.
42200	573942	9.0	9.0	37895203	"Ok sometimes you come across such kind people that light up a room and you automatically like them so much! Angielena was that person. She welcome us with a smile and showed us so much of the building we were staying in. The building is probably one of the COOLEST airbnbs places ever. I mean artists are there creating art. The whole place feels so creative. It was such a great environment. And very clean. Angielena show us around and gave us the story behind all the little details of the georgetown building. Im a lover of vintage, and the room was called ""Vintage room"" Everything was just so quaint and cozy. The bathroom was state of the art. Pretty cool. The balcony was heaven. I sip my tea enjoying the nice breeze. Angielena thank you for being so kind and trusting. And making us feel right at home! :)"
42201	573942	9.0	9.0	38296481	Going to Georgetown for the Art Attack and staying in the lovely vintage room was an adventure. Angieliena gave a warm welcome and showed me around the place to see the room, the luxurious bathroom and the guest's kitchen. Each place afforded comfort, beauty and sometimes excitement. I slept well in the comfortable bed and liked most of all the shadow on the wall that the chandelier cast of a nine foot candle. The spacious marble shower has eight different shower heads. The kitchen was a fun place to meet other guests which turned into an impromptu Trader Joe's run. The Art Attack event is worth seeing with all the friendly artists selling their wares. It was a fun stay in an interesting arty area of Seattle that was away from the heavily trodden tourist spots and filled with fun, very open and friendly, funky, arty types.
42202	573942	9.0	9.0	38887504	"Our stay in Georgetown was amazing and beyond my expectations! I'm incredibly happy I got to know this little part of Seattle because of Airbnb, otherwise I'd have no idea about this hip part of town. Angielena was super sweet, nice, and accommodating. She greeted us with her Jack Russell, who we adored. The tour and history of the building was informative and teaching us how to use the AMAZING 10-head shower was imperative. 
The was a mishap in which our Georgetown room was given to another guest so we got the Toulous Lautrec room instead. We got dinner so Angielena could have some time setting up the room. It was perfect for a couple, red and romantic. I highly recommend that room for couples! 
Angielena was super caring and responsive but can be hard to reach via call sometimes. We were stuck outside for a while before a resident let us into the building and informed her of our arrival. I also wish I would have gotten to know her and the other artists as well but my interactions with the ones I did meet were splendid!
The kitchen is super small and cozy. I only used it to heat up food and make tea (she has a neat collection). 
The Georgetown Trailer Mall is right behind the building. It's an amazing little place and I got my new favorite vintage purse from there :)
She also let us but our bags in her studio on the last day since we had a late flight! I didn't need to lug around my 50-lb backpack thank god. 
All in all, a great stay and I hope to stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle!"
42203	573942	9.0	9.0	39219463	Awesome place and awesome hostess! Georgetown was our favourite area of Seattle. Angielena's building is in a really cool street with the best Mexican restaurant a street corner away. The building is a fascinating place filled with cool people. My girlfriend and I totally recommend it.
42204	573942	9.0	9.0	42579913	Angielena was a very helpful and friendly host. The neighborhood is really fun and funky. I loved the vintage-y old hotel vibe and all the fantastic art. 
42205	573942	9.0	9.0	43355187	Great location in Georgetown, with a lovely old-timey, artistic vibe. Angielena was an awesome host, very accommodating and helpful. The room was cozy and had air conditioning and the bathroom was DELUXE. Overall, it was a great stay. Thanks, Angielena!
42206	573942	9.0	9.0	43979179	"Angie Lena was a charming host. The rooms are above an artist enclave and it has a very 'Hostel' feel to it. There are lots of stairs, so be sure not to pack a huge suitcase as I had, because lugging it up the stairs was cumbersome.  

The room we reserved was quite small,  although I did expect it as the picture of the room seemed accurate from the site.  As much as Angielena was an exceptionally kind host and the tour was quite extensive, I would make a few suggestions that may make for a more pleasant stay:

1. New towels. The towels provided were so thin and scruffy, one could see through it.
2. Memory foam mattress for bed topper.  The mattress was extremely hard and uncomfortable. 
3. New Pillows and bed linens, plus duvet. The bed linens felt tired and old.
4. New paint in room. It would be the best  bang for your buck to give the room a bit of a facelift:).

Now, as a Co host for airbnb, I so understand the expense of these items, as she has many rooms, 10 or 11 I think. But perhaps one room at a time to 'upgrade' would make a world of difference. 

The area has lots of funk and color to it, and that's why I booked it. I would happily stay again if these changes I humbly suggest could be made in the future."
42207	573942	9.0	9.0	44689041	"Angielena was a great host. She greeted us with a lot of information that was very useful to tour the Seattle area. The room was a quaint room with a lot of personality. The bathroom was around the corner from the room but it was marked ""private for guest only"", so it was available any time we needed it and it was clean and had many products for you to use if needed. Our room was also next to a small kitchen area which was great for a morning coffee or (website hidden) there is allowed, however I preferred to try the yummy eateries around town. The building itself has a great history to it which is great for the artist in all of us.
The town of Georgetown has great places to eat, good beer breweries and its close to downtown (where all the touristic things are). It's the oldest town in Seattle and its got a great vibe to it."
42208	573942	9.0	9.0	45007312	Angielena took such good care of me! Her warmth and knowledge of the building and neighborhood made me feel right at home.
42209	573942	9.0	9.0	45248491	The vintage room was a small cramp room next to the communal kitchen. Poorly ventilated and noisy. Some people managed to start making coffee and cooking in the middle of the bight! The building is an old industrial site from 1904 with wooden floors and stairs in a 'hip' neighbourhood with lots of bars and activities. There is a wonderful bathroom, but there are also two filthy bathrooms. In our room there was no possibility to hang our cloths or wet towels. Not a place we'd choose again. Besides, we stayed for 2 nights and never met our host!
42210	573942	9.0	9.0	45550397	"Angelenia was so welcoming from the moment she met us outside her apartment. She gave us a great tour, so we could ask questions and learn some history of the surrounding area. 

It was lovely to be able to use her kitchen and she made us feel very welcome to help ourselves and enjoy the space like it was our own.

A great stay if looking for something unique with independence- An extra perk were the great skyline views if driving the easy 10 minutes into the city! 


"
42211	573942	9.0	9.0	46520556	Amazing spot in a great neighborhood. The building has a lot of character, is clean, spacious, and has the friendliest people running it. Thanks Angielena and Fred. There is no better place to stay in Seattle as it has the best combination of neighborhood, culture, value, building charm, and people. I highly recommend it!
42212	573942	9.0	9.0	48220310	Room was exactly as expected, with a wonderful bathroom in the building, and Angielena was more than welcoming as a host. I felt instantly at home, and the new memory foam mattress-topper was a welcome plus. I would recommend anyone staying on the Seattle outskirts to stay here :)
42213	573942	9.0	9.0	49915821	A completely wonderful stay in the Georgetown neighborhood. Several restaurants, bars and most importantly coffee bars within short walking distance. Our host was so welcoming and made us feel at home. I loved sitting out on the balcony drinking coffee and eating scones. Easy 9-10 dollar über ride to all the main attractions! 
42214	573942	9.0	9.0	50934186	Angielena was a wonderful host. I loved all the little details and extras that made me feel welcome during my visit to Seattle. The space itself was very cool and unique, and Georgetown is a funky little part of town that I wish I had more time to explore! I would definitely return to stay here again.
42215	573942	9.0	9.0	54857093	Our host greeted us at the door and was happy to see us since it was a return visit. She had just gotten back from Europe but still was positive and friendly, even with little sleep and jet lagged! We love Georgetown. It is historic, the oldest settlement in Seattle, and everything is a few steps from Angielena's door.
42964	4111954	9.0	10.0	23396035	Teresa was out of town, but her husband Mike was very accommodating. He even called us enroute to let us know that Snoqualmie Pass was closed due to an accident and suggested a place for us to purchase chains for our vehicle. Mike also was very fun to talk to about his travels. Mike helped my spouse work on our daughter's car, which was way beyond the call of duty. The queen-size bed was quite comfortable, and the apartment was located close to coffee shops and restaurants. 
42965	4111954	9.0	10.0	25263853	"The hosts, Teresa and Mike, were great, especially considering that they were handling the visit remotely, since they were in Peru. They were very responsive via email, and they had deputized a neighbor in the building to help with keys, etc. She was also friendly and very responsive. In fact, one of the great virtues of this stay was the community of neighbors; I also got to know Rula, who runs the restaurant on the corner with her husband, and she was wonderful.

The neighborhood in general, Greenwood/Phinney, is one of Seattle's best neighborhoods: vibrant with a wealth of restaurants and boutiques, eminently walkable.

The apartment itself is comfortable and attractive--quite spacious. I loved all the windows onto the street and did a lot of work at the desk. Overall, I'd highly recommend the experience!"
42966	4111954	9.0	10.0	25681901	Mike and Teresa were wonderful hosts, even from across the world (they were spending time in Peru while we stayed in their apartment). To start, they were flexible--we changed our check-in date a few times before arrival, and that was no problem. Their neighbor let us into the apartment and gave us the keys--we had no problems at all. The space is big and in a great location, and you can't beat the price. 
42967	4111954	9.0	10.0	26214467	My roommate and I really enjoyed staying at this apartment. Mike and Teresa were in Peru during our stay, so we were able to stay in touch via email. We stayed here for two weeks while looking for our own place to rent. It was a great way to get to know the neighborhood, as the apartment is right on a street lined with restaurants and small businesses. There is a Safeway grocery store within walking distance as well. The kitchen was stocked with nice knives and cookware. We cooked almost all of our meals while staying here. Overall the apartment was very cute and welcoming. Prior to arriving we spent a week in the car on our road trip, so the yoga room was amazing for stretching out. There is also a nice desk to work at and a quiet little porch to sit on. The bed was very comfortable and the heated blanket was a great surprise. We would definitely recommend this Air BnB :)
42968	4111954	9.0	10.0	46601259	My mom and I had a very pleasant stay at Teresa's and Mike's place. They have a lovely home and we felt very welcome. During our stay, Mike was in town and staying in the office. And even though it is always nicer to have the place to yourself, Mike was very friendly and made us feel very welcome and comfortable at his place. Other perks: everything is very clean and organized, and the neighborhood is great as you have easy access to plenty of restaurants, beautiful Green Lake, shopping places, and groceries stores. 
42969	4111954	9.0	10.0	47100089	The house was awesome. My husband and I felt welcomed immediately after our arrival. Mike was in the apartment during our stay. He is a nice guy to talk to. But he also made sure we had lots of privacy. I hardly could tell he was at home. The location of the apartment is very good too as it is on the bus line that goes very often. The neighborhood is very nice as well. I highly recommend you to stay in Mike and Teresa's (website hidden): The bed and pillows are super comfortable. :-)
42970	4111954	9.0	10.0	48078600	My mother and I were very happy to have stayed at Teresa's and Mike's place, it was exactly what we were looking for! We felt very welcomed and comfortable during our stay and would recommend anyone to stay at their place!
42971	4111954	9.0	10.0	54605889	Michael and Teresa's Apartment was an Amazing experience. We especially loved the neighborhood and how close it was to pretty much everything. Our host Michael was really cool and had really cool stories about his travels through the Amazon River. Overall a 10 out of 10.
42972	4111954	9.0	10.0	55293718	"It is a nice, clean apartment with off street parking. It is on a city bus route, but I did not hear any street noise. Restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores are nearby.

It is well furnished and has fast wireless internet.

I highly recommend it!"
42973	4111954	9.0	10.0	56178393	Our host made us most welcome & had help provided during our week's stay.    The neighbourhood is friendly & safe with nearby shops & eateries & bus & taxi at front door.  We would be more than happy to stay here again.     Ted & Ursula Hurley, Dublin, Ireland
42974	4111954	9.0	10.0	57997071	"The apartment was just as advertised.  Spacious,  inviting and had everything yiu might need. Bus stop right in front of the apartment.  Coffee shops,  restaurants,  grocery store and other shops right in the neighborhood.  

The host,  Mike and Teresa were amazing at communication, despite being out of the country.  

Would definitely stay here again. "
43225	4854767	9.0	10.0	24317228	I loved my stay at this house! It's very comfortable, spacious, and has great character. Also, the neighborhood is excellent! It's the perfect mix of a few useful chain stores and then a myriad of small boutique businesses, art galleries, restaurants and bars! There was even an art walk going on in the Greenwood neighborhood one of the nights I was there, and we hit up four different galleries (including Urban Light Studios!) which were right in walking distance! Really neat area, great house, and very accommodating host. Thanks, Libby!
43226	4854767	9.0	10.0	24793867	Libby's place is the cutest, we called it the smurf house. Some good friends and I stayed the night only for New Years, so we weren't there very long. I would definitely stay there again, great locations and Libby was super helpful.
43227	4854767	9.0	10.0	25818462	Libby was a very flexible and accommodating host even though we never met in person.  Quite affable and quick to respond to inquiries.  She and her friend Prashanti, who provided on the ground service in light of Libby's absence in LA, were quite gracious.  The house itself was perfect for what could turn into a long-term stay in a dynamic Greenwood neighborhood.  Highly recommended!  
43228	4854767	9.0	10.0	27924909	Libby was a great host! She was very accommodating with a request to extend at the last minute. If you like to cook, her kitchen will delight you!
43229	4854767	9.0	10.0	28516589	Libby was a wonderful hostess for my family! Being able to stay feet away from us in Libby's home made their trip very nice and convenient. The accommodations were comfortable and just what they were hoping:) A great spot and super convenient location! I would highly recommend Libby's place.
43230	4854767	9.0	10.0	32696348	"Libby did a terrific job of hosting us! We were in town for a friend's wedding at nearby Urban Light Studios and Libby's location couldn't have been better. When my dress ripped at the wedding, my boyfriend was able to run back home and get dress #2 without missing more than a song or two! Her place was just as we expected- cute, clean, and cozy. We enjoyed having the whole ""smurf house"" to ourselves, and found her suggestions for local eateries and coffee shops were wonderful. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone wanting to explore the Greenwood area.

43231	4854767	9.0	10.0	34383821	"Libby was really Johnny on the spot for me, i inquired the night before i wanted the house and did not complete everything until the morning of the stay and she pulled it all together, the house was clean and cozy
and there was plenty of info in her book to help with our stay. thanks Libby"
43232	4854767	9.0	10.0	34658157	Great stay in a lovely part of town! 
43233	4854767	9.0	10.0	35080304	"Libby's cozy house was just what we expected. Adorable little home in a quiet neighborhood. Close to stores and restaurants. Would stay again when I'm in Seattle. 
Luann"
43234	4854767	9.0	10.0	40563328	Libby was quick to respond and extremely easy to communicate with. The house was exactly as represented in the pictures, and the neighborhood was lovely, lots of things to do, restaurants, and grocery stores nearby.
43235	4854767	9.0	10.0	40966018	"We had a great stay at Libby's clean and cozy house in the similarly cozy Greenwood neighborhood. Libby had some great tips and recommendations which were very helpful when looking for good food and getting around using public transportation. She was also very accommodating with regards to working around our odd arrival and departure times. Great stay!

Extra bonus surprise: Amazing muppet poster in the kitchen. "
43236	4854767	9.0	10.0	41450243	This was our first experience with Airbnb and Libby made it a personal and positive experience. From her smiling picture with Elmo, to our written contact, to the pick-up of the key at a friendly local coffeeshop, we found ourselves becoming excited about our stay in ways never experienced by the usual hotel booking. The house itself was cute and homey, reflecting the artistic temperament of it's owner. We were sorry to leave, as we felt we had gotten to know a new friend; more than a business transaction. A lovely experience we will repeat on our next visit. A great location to visit the city, around the corner from the bus direct to downtown. Nice neighbors, lent us a bike wrench; Libby had a bike for us to use which was nice. Thanks for a great stay!!!
43237	4854767	9.0	10.0	42000662	This place had all the basics - enough space for a few guests, a clean kitchen and bathroom, and access to public transportation - plus it was located in a very cool neighborhood. And Libby was friendly, accessible, and accommodating.  However, a few aspects of the listing were a tad misleading:  the bed in the second bedroom is a mattress on the floor and not a real bed as it appears in the photo.  Also, the house is described as having lots of old-school charm but I found several things not charming but in poor condition, including a faucet that was loose and a bench/shelf that broke when I sat on it (I was fine; it was a low bench/shelf for holding shoes and I mistakenly sat on it while I was putting my shoes on). Still, this place was a good deal for what it offered, and overall it was a good experience.
43238	4854767	9.0	10.0	43396655	Our host was super easy to communicate with and open to solving coordination issues with chek-in and check-out. Great neighborhood!
43239	4854767	9.0	10.0	43566229	Cute house with character in a great neighborhood. Amazingly quiet at night and super close to tons of great places to explore, eat, and drink. 
43240	4854767	9.0	10.0	44131988	Libby was great to work with - quick and thorough in responding to email. The neighborhood was a lot of fun - plenty of coffeeshops, vintage/consignment stores, book store, and restaurants and bars in walking distance. The location was great for exploring other neighborhoods too - we had a car, but I noticed several bus stops close to the house, if you choose to use public transportation. 
43241	4854767	9.0	10.0	45298120	Libby was very helpful and kind throughout, giving us quick feedback and customized recommendations. We stayed in the little blue house while apartment hunting in the area and were very grateful for its convenient location to many places we viewed. It's a great neighborhood, too! 
43242	4854767	9.0	10.0	48442852	"I booked Libby's place for my employee Jeremy who LOVED it. His words:
""Great little house in a quiet neighborhood. Libby was very communicative and gave great recommendations in the neighborhood. I was able to walk everywhere I needed to go and had no trouble with the check-in/check-out. Would definitely stay there again."""
43243	4854767	9.0	10.0	57201706	"I stayed at Libby's charming house for three months. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. 
The house is as described, though it's hard to give a sense of how adorable it is in words alone. The kitchen is spacious with great appliances, the lounge is cozy and relaxing, the bedrooms are soothing sleep caves, and throughout the house there are delightful artistic decorations. 
From the first contact, Libby was wonderful hostess. She made the effort to find out what I needed and would like to know about as a newcomer to Seattle, and provided very useful and extensive tips and advice. She was very responsive and helpful whenever I had a question throughout my stay.
The area shows the best of Seattle. Greenwood is very artsy, fun,  and varied. Within a few blocks lie a 'Space Exploration' store, a theatre, a creative reuse for artists, coffee shops and a second-hand bookstore. The area is close enough to downtown via bus or excellent cycle routes for easy commuting in around 30-45 minutes.  
Libby's house lies on a charming street away from the area's main avenue, and is blissfully quiet. I was studying intensively during my stay and being able to retreat to the house for quality rest and sleep helped get me through the work. I can't recommend the place enough. 
I found Libby to be conscientious, helpful and incredibly amiable. She's a great hostess and her upbeat and good nature was evident in every communication. I thank her for a marvellous time in Seattle. "
43763	4825472	9.0	9.0	34661658	Our host Nora was very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. She made us feel very comfortable and at home.  The room was clean and suited us nicely.  The location was great.  We were close enough to everything and had no parking problems like we did in the city.  Nora had shared with us some tips rare finds in the city that only a local would know.  Great trip, thanks for your hospitality.  
43764	4825472	9.0	9.0	39407365	Staying at Nora's was wonderful! She was flexible with our arrival and provided us with lots of information about Seattle and her neighborhood. She gave us advice on bus lines and showed us schedules. The room was lovely and clean. The neighborhood is great. We loved staying here!
43765	4825472	9.0	9.0	40244882	Enjoyed my stay here and the cute retro styled room.  Nora is friendly and generous with her home.  The room is quiet and neat with convenient location to fun shops and restaurants in Ballard!
43766	4825472	9.0	9.0	40856330	Nora was very welcoming and friendly. Her house is tidy and inviting. We had a great stay!
43767	4825472	9.0	9.0	42159603	"Pros:
- Nora was a wonderful host! She was very welcoming and helpful, even giving me a little tour of downtown Ballard! It was also very easy to schedule arrival/departure times with her.
- There's a bit of painting/construction in the living room, but the room I stayed in was nice and cozy. 
- The location is pretty convenient, with a close bus stop (28) that goes straight to downtown. There are other bus lines nearby, although these lines aren't really suited for walking to and fro if you're carrying luggage.
- The neighborhood felt very safe and tranquil. There wasn't any loud traffic in the middle of the night to disrupt my sleep.

Cons:
- The only thing that bugged me was the lack of internet access. Yeah it's in the description, but I overlooked it -_- It's okay if you're content with surfing the net on your smartphone, but it might be unsuitable especially for foreign visitors with expensive/restricted data allowances."
43768	4825472	9.0	9.0	42773405	"We really enjoyed our stay here; the only downside was the distance to the heart of Seattle. Takes about 4- minutes on the bus to get to downtown. The place itself is a very comfortable, well furnished house. The room is especially lovely with pretty old furniture -  extremely comfy memory foam pillows were a nice touch. The bed is a little bit shorter than most, which would only really be a  consideration if you're 6ft or over. Seems like a very safe area, pleasant tree lined suburban street, peaceful and quiet. Nora herself was a kind and helpful host, she gave us some good reccomendations for cheap drinks and neighborhoods to visit, very happy for a chat and very welcoming. This is a nice place to stay if you're visiting Seattle.
"
43769	4825472	9.0	9.0	43275153	"Nora was an amazing host, a very nice person, and a fascinating Seattle native. 

We loved staying at her place. It has a very comfy bed (lots of extra blankets for us non-acclimated people from Hawaii), and it's such a cool house which is located in a very convenient location. Nora has created an Oasis in Seattle for herself, I'm so glad we got the opportunity to share it with her.

Oh, and just forget about Google, Nora has everything you need to know about Seattle. 

It was our pleasure staying there.

43770	4825472	9.0	9.0	44183250	Great for what we needed! A place to lay our weary heads between busy days. We rented a car, so it was easy for us to get around. Nora was very nice and helpful!
43771	4825472	9.0	9.0	44862940	Nora was a very hospitable host! Her home was welcoming and cozy. I especially enjoyed staying with her, listening to a few of her stories, and advice on where to roam about in Seattle. 
43772	4825472	9.0	9.0	46792366	Nora was an exceedingly gracious host, I greatly enjoyed her cosy house and yard. She had excellent knowledge about what was going on in her neighborhood and made my stay incredibly comfortable.
43773	4825472	9.0	9.0	48444972	I had a great stay with Nora. She was very accommodating!
43774	4825472	9.0	9.0	48734118	Both Nora and her place were great! She made us feel very welcome. The house is unique and charming and the bed was quite cozy. Highly recommended and we'll definitely be back again!
43775	4825472	9.0	9.0	50513380	"Nora was welcoming and gracious!  She was generous with her house and kitchen, and had a trove of stories to share from her long history in Seattle.  Her house is super lived-in, and littered with collections of upcycled items.

Unfortunately, she is also self-employed and juggling countless responsibilities; in 2 weeks I only got to talk to her a handful of times."
43776	4825472	9.0	9.0	51795980	Nora was very nice and has a wonderful home. She even offered to send me my T-shirt after I left it in the room. Thanks Nora! 
43777	4825472	9.0	9.0	55584353	It was a very chill time in Nora's guest room!
46215	6716620	9.0	9.0	34836174	I had a great time glamping in the city! Perry was very accommodating and told me about some great local spots and transportation tips. It was very close to pikes place and only about 2 miles from 3 really good breweries within walking distance of each other.  I wish all my city experience's were this pleasant!
46216	6716620	9.0	9.0	34927093	This was a different experience from any other. Perry was very hospitable and has plans of upgrading the backyard glamping. It was fun and comfortable and I had everything I needed!
46217	6716620	9.0	9.0	35050775	Perry pulled out all the stops to make sure that our urban camping experience was as fun and comfortable as possible. The tents were comfortably set up and we definitely felt at home. The rubber duckies in the hot tub, extra towels and complimentary breakfast were all nice additions. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who, like myself, doesn't need a hotel bed to enjoy their trip.
46218	6716620	9.0	9.0	35442541	"I had a great time staying at Perry's. I was on a camping trip and opted to stay in my own tent, so I can't say much about the provided tents — from a brief look, they looked fine to me.

Perry was one of the kinder Airbnb hosts I've stayed with, providing fruit, drinks, and coffee during the two days I was there. We also spent about 30 minutes together talking, which I really enjoyed.

This is a place for casual Airbnber's. There's a dog in the yard, you go through an office to get to the bathroom, etc. None of these affected the quality of my stay (the dog was a bonus, actually), just letting you know what you're in for :)"
46219	6716620	9.0	9.0	36441020	Perry was extremely accommodating to me while I stayed. It was easy for me to come and go as I please which I needed for this trip. I would stay again if i went back to Seattle.  
46220	6716620	9.0	9.0	38059739	"Enjoyed my stay.
Perry was very hospitable. I arrived a little late, and everything was already set-up for me. The dog was very friendly. 

The house is on top of a steep hill, so bike-riders beware - you may have to push it up.

The air-mattress was very comfortable. I had to sleep with earplugs because of the frequent aircraft flying overhead. So, keep that in mind. Bring earplugs."
46221	6716620	9.0	9.0	39846768	FIrst time glamping so had no idea what to expect. Perry was super welcoming and showed us around when we arrived. Didn't really take advantage of the hot tub or drinks because it was cold and rainy and because there was another couple staying in the second tent so it felt a little awkward. Didn't try the outdoor shower since the other couple was sleeping right next to it and didn't want to disturb them. All in all a fun, unique experience though. 
46222	6716620	9.0	9.0	40530705	"Perry is the most friendly host! His backyard is beautiful and close enough to walk anywhere you want in Seattle. We loved this space and would stay here again anytime! 

THANK YOU PERRY!!!!! "
46223	6716620	9.0	9.0	41297152	"everything was as described, the laid back atmosphere was great.

was fun  to stay in a tent but have all the amenities."
46224	6716620	9.0	9.0	41497622	Perry's place was perfect for my one night in Seattle - it was close to restaurants and bars, and was the most affordable place I could find. The tent was very comfortable and I slept very well. Perry was very welcoming and I had a nice time chatting with him. I would definitely stay here again when I pass through Seattle. Walter the dog is a sweet old man and I loved hanging out with him!
46225	6716620	9.0	9.0	41550230	Extremely friendly host. Very accommodating. Nice set up and neighborhood.
46226	6716620	9.0	9.0	41707443	"My buddy and I were spending a Friday night in Seattle and didn't want to dish out $300 for a hotel room downtown. Perry's place was perfect as it is a short light rail ride downtown. Perry was really friendly and helpful and pointed us in the right direction when it came to bars and restaurants. 

The tent and air mattress are what you'd expect - but you probably wouldn't be looking at this page if you had a problem with that. Perry makes an effort to make sure there is water, coffee, and beer and wine. He also put out some muffins in the morning. Our experience was made more memorable by staying here."
46227	6716620	9.0	9.0	41909842	"I had a great experience in Perry's backyard! It was easy to get to via light rail from the airport. Perry was a great host, fast with communication beforehand and very accommodating. Had beers out on ice, access to hot tub (didn't use it due to late arrival), and coffee and muffins in the morning. Nice cool night for glamping. 

Planes flying overhead were very loud, but I got used to it and slept fine. Just something to consider for light sleepers. 

Thanks Perry!"
46228	6716620	9.0	9.0	44087878	Perry was quick to respond and very thorough in instruction on what to do. It was comfortable and a fun experience. Communication was great and his dog Walter is a joy. I'd definitely stay again next time I'm in Seattle. 
46757	8409975	9.0	9.0	50137623	"It looks like the photos, it's very clean and comfortable. There is a lot of space to hang out but also your own room for privacy. In the morning we had breakfast for free and we could use the big kitchen. 
It is a little bit out of downtown, but the bus station is very close (6min walk) and you will need 45min to get from there to the city."
46758	8409975	9.0	9.0	50974533	This was my second stay at Dario's place. The experience is more like staying in a small private hotel more than a persons home. Which I like. There are several Airbnb rooms so the house is setup for guests with common areas and kitchen access. Bathroom is shared by several people, but there was never a problem with wait time. I will be returning.
46759	8409975	9.0	9.0	51100914	This place is great. There's a lot good that could be said but for brevity...comfortable bed, great breakfast options, nice location a quick bus hop from downtown like strips, peaceful neighborhood, and really friendly hosts. This is a SOLID option for travelers looking for a comfy environment. 
46760	8409975	9.0	9.0	54621512	"I never met the host but the room was really nice and comfortable. We had a good time. 
Mahalo "
46761	8409975	9.0	9.0	55236991	My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights while visiting his brother who lived nearby. The instructions for getting in and out were crystal clear, thanks to Alessandro. The front door is code operated, and super convenient. We met a woman when we first came in, and it was a little confusing at first as to who she was. It turned out that she was the manager of the place. She briefly showed us around and quickly disappeared. We didn't get to meet either Alessandro or Dario. The rooms and bathroom were clean, we stayed in one of the downstairs bedrooms. The radiator worked great, the mattress in the Carousel room is super soft, but comfortable. The downstairs is overall kind of dark, with mostly IKEA furnishings and kitchenware. There is plenty of breakfast options that they provide, which was really nice. Having access to the kitchen was a bonus. The other housemates were generally really quiet and respectful, we didn't have any trouble falling asleep, although footsteps overhead can be heard. Overall, we had everything that we needed, and it was a good base camp with all the conveniences. But if you're looking for a place with more life, love, and human interaction, this would not be my top choice. 
46762	8409975	9.0	9.0	55582733	Dario is very proactive, responds quickly and is clear with information regarding a stay at his house.  The room and the whole house were clean and having use of the washer and dryer are really great perks.  Would love to stay here again!
46763	8409975	9.0	9.0	56289336	The host was amazing! We felt right at home and everything was as we expected it. 
46764	8409975	9.0	9.0	56412729	This host and accommodations are highly recommended for avid and new travelers alike. The Carousel room is cozy and inviting. The home is spacious, well kept and well stocked. If you approach with a good disposition meet new people; this place is a nugget of gold.  
46765	8409975	9.0	9.0	56582745	Clean convenient and good amenities. 
46766	8409975	9.0	9.0	56689646	The house was very clean and overall accommodating.
47698	6557297	9.0	9.0	33558788	Shannon and Ben are easy going folks who made me feel very welcome in their home. Which is large, like a castle built into a hill. Room and bath are accurately described, bed was super comfy! In addition to receiving a delicious homemade cookie, I was invited for dinner and impromptu breakfast. Highly recommended. Most honorable mention: Muggsy the cat! 
47699	6557297	9.0	9.0	33638686	Comfortable, convenient place especially if you have to be close to the airport. There's an adorable cat. Shannon wasn't home, but her husband Ben was there to welcome and settle me in. Lovely host and we had a wonderful chat before I had to turn in for my morning flight.
47700	6557297	9.0	9.0	34106678	AmaIng hosts! Shannon and Ben made us feel right at home and even have us cookies! Also muggsy (the cat) is as friendly as can be. Would definitely recommend.
47701	6557297	9.0	9.0	34184165	"Me and my girlfriend stayed just a night. Shannon and Ben welcome us even though we were late the check in time. It was 11pm... 
We really really really enjoyed and happy because the room is better than fancy hotel. And very important thing is people which is their personality. What can I say... Just they are great people!! 
"
47702	6557297	9.0	9.0	34374020	Shannon & Ben welcomed us  with fresh baked cookies even tho we arrived quite late. Their hosting and travel experience were obvious as they were spot on for making it comfortable for us. Wish we could have stayed longer. Really nice, interesting people. Beautiful house, wonderful view of Lake Washington.  
47703	6557297	9.0	9.0	34602416	Shannon was very good at communicating with us prior to our arrival. Her place is very accommodating and close to the lightrail which meant that we could leave the car to go explore the city more freely. The cat is lovely too!
47704	6557297	9.0	9.0	34742184	Shannon and Ben were amazing hosts. They welcomed me with open arms into their home. Along with their adorable cat Muggsy, they made our stay in Seattle comforting and awesome. I would definitely recommend others to stay with Shannon and Ben as well as bring my business to them again anytime I return to Seattle.
47705	6557297	9.0	9.0	35006204	Very welcoming and lovely couple. Close by to supermarket,restaurants and a nice walking trail. 
47706	6557297	9.0	9.0	35149894	Shannon and Ben were excellent, accommodating hosts. My friend and I had a wonderful short stay with them, and they were very helpful in giving us recommendations for nightlife and helping us feel at home in a new city. Their home is lovely, the bed was comfortable and we enjoyed cereal on their balcony before setting off. Definitely encourage others to stay with them.
47707	6557297	9.0	9.0	38298322	Shannon and her husband were out of town during our visit, but we did meet her husband on our last day. He was super nice and respectful. We had everything we needed and more. The patio was such a nice touch for evening wind down. Thanks so much for everything! P.s. fell in love with their sweet kitty :)
47708	6557297	9.0	9.0	38607093	I stayed in Seattle for 2 Nights for sightseeing during my Roadtrip. As i had a discribtion how to get to Shannon's house it wasn't difficult to find. Shannon was super nice and had a big smile in her face when she opened the door. I felt like coming home, really comfortable and welcome. The room was clean and comfi, i had a hugh bed, a table and a bathroom just for me. Shannon also prepared some prospects and a map so i was able to prepare my sightseeing trip for the next two days. I was positive surprised by Shannon and also her house and my accomodation. Thank you for that Shannon.
47709	6557297	9.0	9.0	39065725	The hosts made our arrival easy and the house was clean and comfortable.
47710	6557297	9.0	9.0	39700971	My stay here was great. Easy location to get to, and very friendly hosts. The room had everything I could need as well. Highly recommend. 
47711	6557297	9.0	9.0	39819160	"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it worked out great for us.  We stayed one night in order to be in walking distance from friends we were visiting.  We came back late and were easily able to access the room without disturbing anyone.  The hosts were friendly and helpful.  

I highly recommend checking out the Japanese Garden in the neighborhood if you stay here."
47712	6557297	9.0	9.0	39953412	"We arrived late and left the following morning so we didn't really get know Shannon but she seems friendly enough and was definitely very easy to get in touch with.
The room itself is ok and so is the bathroom which has everything you may need and more. Both could do with a little dusting though.
Finally be warned that the house is within walking distance of a link light rail station but up a fairly steep hill so probably not the best option if you're wheeling a lot of luggage.
Overall a pleasant airbnb experience."
47713	6557297	9.0	9.0	42153568	"Wonderful room and wonderful people hosting said room. Everything was clean and our needs were well attained. Extremely good for the price, Shannon and Ben were very nice people as well.

Their cat Mugsy was very friendly and a joy to be around too. 

Thanks for the experience guys!"
47714	6557297	9.0	9.0	42757666	It was my first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic! The hosts, Shannon and Ben, are helpful and friendly. We enjoyed everything that they provided. The location is near Rainier Beach Station, which is convenient to downtown area. Ben even gave us a free ride to the airport at the last day. Thank you Shannon and Ben, you two rock!
47715	6557297	9.0	9.0	44145824	"My girlfriend and I are from San Diego and we were traveling back from Alaska (1 week vacation). We were looking for a quiet place in Seattle to spend the weekend (instead of doing a 2 hours layover at the airport). 

Shannon was very nice and flexible. She gave us clear directions and it was very easy to get to the place from the airport through the trolley (we didn't rent a car for this weekend). She was out of town this week end.

It was our first time with only a ""private room"". Usually, we book a whole place. The others guests were pretty loud and not really considerate so we ended up leaving to spend the 2nd night in a hotel downtown. That was not a good experience but I will not put that on our host, I guess that's part of what can happen when you share a place. I feel it would have been easier if Shannon was there to talk to them. The others guest were 6 young guys, pretty drunk. I just didn't think a calm and constructive discussion with me would have led us anywhere. So we just left . 

We paid for the two nights of course. "
47716	6557297	9.0	9.0	44647999	It was such a relief to get to this oasis the night we arrived.  We had a long day of traveling the day before and a flight to catch the following day.  We were so thankful to have the friendly welcome and the wonderful hospitality that they showed.  Our only regret is that our schedule and tired bones prevented us from meeting these lovely people.  We would highly recommend this spot to any traveler, and would welcome these two in New York should they ever need a calm in there traveling storm.  
47717	6557297	9.0	9.0	49496316	The best thing that has happened to us was the place where we have been staying. Surrounded by trees, lake Washington and beautiful parks made our Seattle experience unforgettable!
49994	2016613	9.0	8.0	9525200	We really enjoyed our time in Seattle.  The house is nice and comfortable so we could totally relax and feel like home in there.  Rick is very thoughtful for our family.  He prepared everything we need before our arrival.  He also provided any information that we might be interested.  The house is close to the city and convenient to food stores and supermarket.  
49995	2016613	9.0	8.0	9564465	Rick was an awesome host, very responsive and accommodating. The house was even better than the pictures show! Extremely spacious with great views of the surrounding areas! I rented this home for a New Years Eve get together with friends it was it perfect space for entertaining and we had plenty of room for all the guests. 
49996	2016613	9.0	8.0	11636136	Rick's house is great and communicating with him was easy.  The home is clean and well-appointed.  The kitchen is top-notch.  The house located about 4 miles from downtown.  We will contact Rick again for other trips to Seattle.
49997	2016613	9.0	8.0	11806756	5 stars!  Rick was such a great host!  My family of 6 stayed for 5 nights and couldn't have asked for anything nicer.  Very nicely decorated and the hot tub was so relaxing after a day of trekking around downtown Seattle (less than 5 mi / 15min drive away); very Zen!  The area has a very rustic feel and surrounded by foliage while still conveniently located in the hip/gentrified Columbia City district of Seattle with shopping and dining only minutes away.  The kitchen was just amazing and fully appointed with all the tools a gourmet chef would need.  I would not hesitate to stay at Rick's home again when in Seattle.
49998	2016613	9.0	8.0	15300323	Beautiful home and furnishings. The owner obviously took care into making it a luxury vacation feel. The unique rugs & flooring along with the many balconies gave us a beachfront feel.   Louis
49999	2016613	9.0	8.0	15666761	This was our first Airbnb experience.   We could not be happier.   The accommodations were even better than promoted.   The host was fantastic.  Communications were timely, house preparations were unbeatable, and overall provided a feeling of being at home.   For all future travels to Seattle, we will pursue this rental and airbnb, before looking into hotels.  
50000	2016613	9.0	8.0	16733377	"House was perfect for our needs and exceeded our expectations. We had a group from Portland going to a concert in Seattle at safeco field and didn't want to drive back late. Ended up getting a limo, but it's not to far away. Also, I would highly recommend Amy's limo service. She accommodated our last minute needs when another company tried to pull a fast one.

The house was clean. Rick left the keys in a lock box so we were able to arrive at different times without issue. Parking was a little tricky, just b/c I drove my big work truck. In the end it worked out. I would recommend it to anyone, family or groups looking to be in Seattle without being downtown. He also gave recommendations for some local restaurants."
50001	2016613	9.0	8.0	16889818	"Rick was gracious, responsive, and very easy to work with.  The home is beautiful -- all the essentials, lovely landscaping and views, and lots of space for our large group of adults to spread out! 

(Note - It is a 3-story home in a very hilly neighborhood, so I would only recommend this home to those with good mobility.) "
50002	2016613	9.0	8.0	41404175	"We stayed in this house for four nights and we really felt comfortable and like home. The owner had really put a lot of attention to details and everything was as described in the listing.
The house is over three levels and allowed our group to have enough to space to rest, read, barbecue, play, and sleep. 
I had forgotten couple of items when we left the house and Rick kindly sent them back to us. 
Thank you very much for a nice prepared and welcoming house. Our trip to Seattle was a good experience and the house was an important part of it."
50003	2016613	9.0	8.0	43073659	We had a great experience dealing with the owner, Rick. The house work great for my family. Definitely recommended.
50004	2016613	9.0	8.0	43978644	"Staying at Rick's house in Seattle was incredible. It has ample space for a lot of people and the house is set up in a really cool way, with lots of balconies, living rooms, patios, and common space. The house is also beautiful and has everything that you'd want. Check-in and check-out was super easy and Rick was responsive to any questions we had, including allowing us to check-out super late. 

It looks like it would be pretty easy to get to a train line, and there was a grocery store and a few restaurants within easy walking distance. 

Fantastic place and great value for a large group. We would really recommend this house. "
50005	2016613	9.0	8.0	47048917	Rick was very nice and welcoming.  The house was wonderful and a quick shot to downtown Seattle.  Would recommend to a friend.  Everything posted is accurate. 
50006	2016613	9.0	8.0	49895772	"Rick is a very good host.  He was responsive, with a very detailed check-in packet, and was very flexible on our arrival and departure times.  He even had some breakfast treats waiting for us at check-in.

The house location was very nice.  Without traffic, you're within 15 minutes of downtown, and you're also within a short drive of many other parts of the city (as well as 2 hours from Mt. Rainier NP, with an easy exit from the city during AM rush).  Beautiful sunrise view from the kitchen and dining/living room, looking out to the mountains over the eastern part of the city .

The kitchen was very well appointed, and there is ample seating for meals (and there are both good grocery and carry-out options nearby).  We had a very easy time preparing dinners at the house.  The house has lots of room, and is certainly well-sized for a larger group.  If you plan to use more than two bedrooms, though, it should be noted that the other two bedrooms and three beds are futon-cushion fold-downs, rather than traditional mattress/box-spring beds.

Agree with another reviewer that good mobility for guests is a must.  Zero issue for us, but the house and the walk from the street parking to the front door include a number of steps."
50007	2016613	9.0	8.0	51473348	My girlfriend and I had an amazing stay here with my kids. The home is beautifully decorated and very well-maintained. Rick is a great host; he met us at the property and gave us a thorough tour of the home.  There is plenty of room, very comfortable beds and a fun hot tub!  
50008	2016613	9.0	8.0	55008592	We arrived later than anticipated so we did not get to meet Rick. But our exchanges with him were all friendly and helpful. The home is a very nice home. It sleeps 6 comfortably, with the other 2 on futons in the basement, which tended to be chilly at the end of Nov. There is some minor TLC needed to the hot tub area but overall the property is beautiful The neighborhood is no the nicest but dining, shopping and entertainment were very close (walking distance). That said, this house provided a great venue for a wonderful Thanksgiving with friends. 
50009	2016613	9.0	8.0	55428617	"Great house!  Good walk to nice restaurants and easy walk to Light Rail - which made life really easy as we were there for a Seahawks game!
Loved the number of bathrooms, easy parking out back, good system for security and kitchen well stocked!!"
50857	2520890	9.0	8.0	13126464	"We sent Amie a booking request while driving down from Vancouver and had received a response and confirmed the details before hitting the border! Amie was there to meet us when we arrived and had taken care of everything. 

The room is amazing, lovely lighting with plenty of windows and our own private bathroom and temperature controls. The bed was nice and comfortable with plenty of blankets, we slept really well and didn't wake up till late. The location was easy to get to from the I-5 and seemed close to lots of attractions, it is a quiet neighborhood so sleeping in was not an issue.

Amie was happy to recommend a local cafe for breakfast, Both Ways Cafe, I would eat there every day if I lived in Seattle.

Overall it was a 10/10 experience, great hospitality, great room.

 "
50858	2520890	9.0	8.0	13260858	Amie, Owen and Elza (what a cutie-pie!) prepared a fantastic getaway for us. From the sweet little vase of roses and apples in a bowl, to the coffee and tea - with organic stevia available! - and fluffy towels. I especially appreciated the clean sheets, towels and bath products without scents and chemicals, and the bins for recycling and compost. Such rare finds! There were books about Seattle trees, local hikes and foraging at the bedside. Many thoughtful touches and ideas for tiny house living. Amie was a delight to communicate and visit with, too. A great private retreat in the heart of a diverse Seattle neighborhood - we highly recommend it. 
50859	2520890	9.0	8.0	13384497	Amie was super gracious when my reservations needed to be changed. I look forward to booking with her in the future! 
50860	2520890	9.0	8.0	13497840	Amie was a kind and generous host and the apartment warm, cozy and private.  Sleeping with the night breezes wafting in and waking to the murmur of the chickens was a treat.  I would happily stay at Passiflora Farm again.
50861	2520890	9.0	8.0	13827198	"It was truly a blessing to have found Passiflora Farm and its beautiful inhabitants, hosts, Amie & Owen, Elza their one-year old, whose very presence lit up my world, Felix the gentle house cat (don't rev up your motor engines - it terrifies him), egg laying chickens that announce their egg delivery, almost instantly, and the great hospitality and warmth encompassed in this urban farm-like setting.   Amie was most helpful sending me website links prior to my arrival, which helped me prioritize my 9-day stay in Seattle an interesting, productive one.  Without her help, I might not quite have succeeded in accomplishing my primary goal of visiting the Hoh Rainforest on the Olympic Peninsula.  Owen had picked up bus schedules to ease my travel, and by the way, Passiflora Farm is very accessible to downtown and most places of interest. It is walking distance to  the grocery with interesting restaurants close by, and on clear days, you can even catch a view of the majestic Mt. Rainier riding back home on the very frequent bus #7.  

The private accommodation was ideal with its attached bath and the necessary comfort to find peace and respite after scouring the city sights.  Don't mind the chickens when they announce the egg(s) delivery, which also means it's time to get up to start the day for another adventure.

From the day I arrived, having been picked up with a truly warm welcome by Amie and Elza, who incidentally had been roused from her nap, yet wearing that most delightful, heart-melting smile, to the day they saw me off heading to the airport, my fond memories of this visit to Seattle will be etched as evergreen as the state of Washington.  It was worth the trip!"
50862	2520890	9.0	8.0	14130690	"Our experience with the host is biased just a little.  She is our daughter, and the mother off our newest grand daughter who turned one over our stay. Need we say a lot more.  It is all perfect.
My wife and I appreciate the privacy and intimacy of the room and surrounding common room as well as the casualness of the gardens of native flowers as well as cactus gardens she cultivates in an urban environment.
We know Seattle well and the proximity to the busses, light rail and major arterials make the location ideal for staying and playing anytime."
50863	2520890	9.0	8.0	14446371	I LOVED my stay here. If you don't mind walking, there are many things less than a mile away. Downtown Seattle was very easy to get to via the train, which is about a 10-15 minute walk away. The room was great and private. Amie was very accommodating. Due to my schedule, I didn't see her much, but when I did, she always asked how I was, how the room was, and how my trip was. I would recommend this to any one of my friends and anyone who reads this. You won't be disappointed. Also, try to make Elza laugh, it's one of the best things ever.
50864	2520890	9.0	8.0	15082928	Amie and family provided a delightful retreat, marred only by our not being able to stay longer. The guest room is in peaceful garden surroundings, with a fascinating neighborhood just around the corner.  We hope to return soon, and highly recommend this haven.
50865	2520890	9.0	8.0	15693921	We stayed for 3 nights at the Passiflora Farm Guest Room. Amie is a thoughtful host who is quick to respond to messages.  The room itself is quite cozy and comfortable. I loved that it was very airy and that the windows let a lot of light in.  The chickens are so cute, and they didn't make any noise (at least while we were there).  There is a cute sitting area in front of the guest room and the grounds are very peaceful. The location is great and we liked the fact that it was very close to some wonderful eateries - we had a delicious brunch close by in Columbia City. 
50866	2520890	9.0	8.0	15887179	We very much enjoyed our stay. Our host was very accommodating as we had a late arrival and departure. She was extremely responsive to any questions we had. And, we enjoyed the use of organic products used throughout the guest suite. 
50867	2520890	9.0	8.0	16067239	This was our first time booking a place through airb&b and our first time taking our 8 month old on a trip to Seattle. I picked Passiflora farm because it looked family friendly and sweet and it was close to our friend's wedding. We were so happy to find that not only was Passiflora farm beautiful but super cozy & comfy too. Amie & her family are lovely & thoughtful hosts. She even left our baby Henry a play crib to use with toys & a beautiful quilt just for him, so sweet! We were only in Seattle for one night but my husband said he would have loved to stay the week and I agreed. We'll be back for sure. 
50868	2520890	9.0	8.0	16417554	Amie was such a kind and welcoming host.  She has a beautiful family!  The farm guest room is just as it is described in the picture... we even met her 4 chickens on our way out.  It is private.  I would highly recommend Amie as a host, but the space itself had some issues.  I would be lying if I didn't mention that we felt limited to only our bedroom once inside.  The space itself is much larger but not fully finished to allow us to really enjoy the larger living area.  Our other bigger gripe just had to do with cleanliness and the layout of the bathroom... the toilet is in the shower!  This is a bit of a design flaw in our opinion as one person couldn't shower while the other was in the toilet, nor would you really want to shower after someone finished their business in there.  The water from the shower head goes directly to the toilet... so it's also entirely wet afterwards.  Other than that, the place is welcoming (books and organic shampoo/conditioner) and close enough (15 min hike) to the link rail stop.  Not the safest looking neighborhood, but a nice walk nonetheless.
50869	2520890	9.0	8.0	17511726	We loved our stay in the Passiflora guest room! Amie was such a genuinely kind and generous person who went out of her way to make our stay as comfortable and easy as possible. Communication with her was excellent and she provided us will all necessary information. The room itself was very adequate for myself and my two small children (ages 1 and 3). Amie provided us with a pack n play as well as a beautiful handmade quilt, toys, and books. Amie's little girl is just delightful and charmed all of us. The bathroom is a really interesting design and great for long showers. The organic amenities were greatly appreciated! We spent time outside either using the table and chairs, observing the chickens, or smelling the herbs. The neighborhood is full of diverse restaurants but also convenient for grocery stores, etc. It's also a quick and easy ride up to Capitol Hill. Overall, I highly recommend Passiflora Farm as your place to stay in Seattle!
50870	2520890	9.0	8.0	19104343	"It was pretty late in the evening, when We knocked at Amie's house. She was very kind and took us to the apartment. We really liked  it. It is cozy and cute, surrounded by trees, in a very good position: Downtown is only ten minutes driving.
The bed is comfortable.
The day We left Amie gave us some information to continue our trip.
A pretty nice experience."
50871	2520890	9.0	8.0	19287647	I booked this  for my father who was visiting us from out of town. Amie was easy to connect with and made Dad feel welcome, as did her partner. My dad was happy with the room, the privacy, the yard, and interested in the solar and chickens. He enjoyed his stay. Thank you!
50872	2520890	9.0	8.0	19707322	"Amie and Owen are excellent hosts and a very creative couple. The room is very comfortable (especially the futon bed) and beautifully decorated.
The location is slightly out of the center, but for this you get a unique farm-like experience in Seattle. Highly recommended!"
50873	2520890	9.0	8.0	19754183	Wonderful place to stay! Everything was just as described, if not better. Amie was a great host. Delicious complementary coffee as well. Only wish we stayed longer!
50874	2520890	9.0	8.0	20854437	Amie and Owen were excellent hosts! They were quick to respond to messages and very attentive during our stay. The farm was the perfect setting for our stay in Seattle, and we can't wait for our next chance to spend time here! The beautiful pictures in the listing only show a taste of how great this space really is. The guest room was well stocked and immaculate, and the farm itself always had interesting things to wonder about. Amie and Owen have created an urban oasis that shows they are very conscious, intentional individuals.
50875	2520890	9.0	8.0	25948616	Amie made us feel quite welcome despite our arrival in the dark. She gave excellent directions. Directions were important as there is an easy to unload entry, and then separate parking zone with steps to the location. The room was comfortable, we had hot pot, coffee, and fridge for our left overs! The combo shower toilet was of interest to us so we were fine with that, besides, the shower had in-floor heat which was so nice! The room was as described, separate yet inside a larger old garage that has been updated for various uses (artists, builders take note!) The extra space outside the enclosed bedroom was so helpful as my husband and I were at the end of our trip and needed to package up lots of goodies to ship out! Their internet worked great considering the room is a separate building from the main house. The garden was lush, even in January- rosemary and lavender, mmmm! Being a gardener myself, I wish I had more time to spend with Amie, but alas, so much to do in Seattle! The neighborhood is full of international food and easy to navigate to other parts of the city. It was also fairly quiet for being urban. One note to lighter sleepers, two blocks away is a Dairygold plant and distribution center. The trucks come and go all night and once I realized what it was, I rested well. (side note, their cream is great, just cream and milk, no extra thickeners!) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an easy going, garden in the city, decent parking, and homemade custom remodel experience. Amie and her family have some talent!
50876	2520890	9.0	8.0	31983257	Amie was super friendly and helpful with great suggestions on where to go. Enjoyed meeting Owen and cute Elza, too.  The Garden Guest Room was cozy and comfortable with many nice touches, including a heated bathroom floor.  Lovely patio and gardens just outside the room, too.  Within walking distance of many great Columbia City restaurants/cafe's.  We had a wonderful time!
50877	2520890	9.0	8.0	34787573	Amie was a wonderful host. She was very thoughtful in picking us up from the Starbucks located near her house. The room was exactly as described. Beautiful and comfortable. The heated floor in the bathroom was inviting after a day of sight seeing. She had replaced the futon with a very comfortable bed. Amie was great at sharing some of the highlights Seattle Has to offer. Link rail and public transportation was easy to master to navigate Seattle.  We would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to our friends!
50878	2520890	9.0	8.0	36239435	We had a lovely stay! The room was just as described and an added bonus was the anointing space with sofas and space for our toddler to run around. Perfect! Amie very kindly left out some toddler books and toys for our daughter. Our car broke down and Amie's husband came to the rescue and got us back on the road! Such a lovely family! 
50879	2520890	9.0	8.0	37209717	So this was our 1st AirBNB experience and we weren't sure what to expect. SOOO glad we did it and stayed here! They were amazing in every way. First the private room & shower; very easy to get to, very neat and clean, and SUPER comfortable bed. The shower was really nice with a heated floor too. The best part was that we could come and go anytime without disturbing them because it's a separate building right of their house. They have a fridge and microwave in there as well as some really good coffee & coffee pot. While we were there they said if we needed anything they would help out, or if we want to be left alone, they would give us space. We sat and talked for a while a few days. I would highly recommend staying here if you come to Seattle. They sure made us feel comfortable in every way and we would come back again.
50880	2520890	9.0	8.0	39634684	Amie and Owen are very warm and hospitable hosts. They are very friendly and very helpful on the logistics of getting around. They are full of great ideas of things to do and see in and around the Seattle area and beyond.
50881	2520890	9.0	8.0	41618724	This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldn’t have been better. The room is great, and the privacy of having the entire barn to ourselves was an added bonus. The bed was very comfortable and large enough for two tall persons. Amie was a great, kind and helpful host. It also was quite easy to get to downtown Seattle with the train. A huge supermarket and Lake Washington are both within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again.
50882	2520890	9.0	8.0	42411167	"I stayed in the Passiflora Garden Guest Room while attending a conference in downtown Seattle. 

I didn't rent a car, and so relied entirely on public transit. The nearest light rail stop to the room is the Columbia City station; it's a hilly 0.8 miles to the room from the station. The light rail gets you to downtown or to the airport in less than 20min and trains arrive frequently. I also rented a bicycle from (website hidden) (highly recommend, their rates are good and they deliver/pickup).

The neighborhood is nice enough. There are a lot of restaurants in walking distance. It's not too far from the water.

The space is lovely. It's in a barn with a couple couches and plenty of open floor space. The room itself is just off the main barn room. It has a bed big enough for two, a mini fridge, a coffee maker (I think there was coffee in the fridge), and a bathroom/shower stall. The floor of the bathroom is heated, which might be a nice thing in the colder months, but isn't super useful when the weather is really warm. The toilet is located in the shower stall, which I guess might make some things more convenient and some things less convenient. 

My interactions with Amie and Owen were minimal and pleasant. Their wireless router went down shortly after I arrived and they made sure I had access to an alternate network for all of my netflixing needs.

The only gripe I can come up with is that, because the room catches the afternoon sun, it gets fairly warm in the evenings, and while I saw what looked like a little heater in the room, I didn't see an AC unit. Not a huge issue though, especially in the cooler/cloudier months of the year.

I would definitely stay there again."
50883	2520890	9.0	8.0	43255295	It was a really lovely place to stay at. Good access to various transportation. I would recommend to stay at Amie's place if anyone is visiting in Seattle. 
50884	2520890	9.0	8.0	45325028	It was really easy to get the keys (zero interaction with owner), so that was great.  I should note that the house number is printed on the mailbox outside the place (I had trouble finding it initially).  Very interesting decorations inside the place too.
50885	2520890	9.0	8.0	46176949	Your place worked perfectly for us. Very convenient location for all the business we had to do. Comfortable and relaxing while we were there. Sorry that we never actually got to meet you. When in Seattle would like to stay again. 
50886	2520890	9.0	8.0	47073347	We had a fantastic stay in Amies garden guest room. It's a very beautiful and spacious room and our hosts were nothing but helpful, generous and kind. 
50887	2520890	9.0	8.0	50657628	"Amie and her partner were excellent hosts! Amie welcomed us and showed us around when we got there and was always in communication with us if we needed anything. 

The room was clean and cozy and perfect for the two of us (especially after a long day of exploring Seattle)! It was in a great location: close to the airport and within easy access of the freeway (perfect for our adventures to the - relatively local - national parks).

We would certainly stay again the next time we travel to Seattle!"
50888	2520890	9.0	8.0	54287336	Exceeded expectations. Really very comfortable and cozy, all you need. We especially loved the recreational rock wall and super yummy tea choices! Only a couple blocks to the Lightrail was wicked convenient. Very quiet and private. 
51870	1416763	9.0	9.0	6315170	The location is great- right down the street from Seward Park. Darren is friendly, very committed to making your stay wonderful. Any little issues that came up- he took care of them right away. I think he is the process of posting pictures of the downstairs that you are renting.  I would definitely stay here again. 
51871	1416763	9.0	9.0	6930250	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
51872	1416763	9.0	9.0	15474556	We had a wonderful stay in Darren's apartment which is attached to the main house where he lives. It's completely private, but he is as accessible as you need him to be. And a more gracious and accommodating host you won't find! We were delighted when we arrived and walked in and found everything to be spotless, attractive and very comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet, the view of the lake and Mercer Island spectacular, and beautiful Seward Park just 3 blocks away, with hiking trails throughout. Quiet, peaceful, yet close enough to bustling Seattle --a retreat we will certainly return to again. 
51873	1416763	9.0	9.0	16204061	"Host made me feel welcome and was very accommodating. He even went out of his way to provide an additional air bed and blankets. 

Overall very pleased by the experience. Thank you. "
51874	1416763	9.0	9.0	16922549	"Darren is one of the best hosts I've ever seen. He made us very welcome in his house. Everything was clean and ready before we come in. 

Place was bigger than we expected, it was also very comfortable.

Place is located at a very nice quiet neighborhood, we didn't have any problems at all. We didn't need to use public transportation but as far as I heard there is a bus stop right next to the house which can take you downtown."
51875	1416763	9.0	9.0	18805740	Darren was an amazing host and the place was perfect for a few guys in need of comfortable living arrangements where we could also get work done.  Location on the lake was beautiful and great for running and getting some exercise.  Darren exceeded all our expectations and made damn well sure we had the most comfortable stay possible!  Highly recommend.
51876	1416763	9.0	9.0	22625893	I had a great stay in Darren’s apartment and he was a very good, friendly host.  There are really nice views of the lake and Mt. Rainier from the living room and dining/bonus area, which makes for a relaxing stay.  It is located in a quiet neighborhood outside of downtown and within easy walking distance of Seward Park, which has some great trails.  The house is less than 1 mile from a good natural foods store and just 1.5 miles from Columbia City, which has nice, quaint restaurants and shops.
51877	1416763	9.0	9.0	25827928	Visited with my husband and our one year old son, and really enjoyed staying here! Darren is a wonderful host - so nice, and made sure we were comfortable. He was available in case we had any questions, which I appreciated. You can tell that he is meticulous about the cleanliness and maintenance of the apartment. The views are stunning, and the apartment is really huge. Dedicated laundry and a huge TV with all DirectTV channels were huge pluses for us.
51878	1416763	9.0	9.0	28475914	Darren was a great host.  The house was just as described and very spacious.  We especially liked the awesome view and the outdoor deck.  The location could not have been better for us, near our family and 15 minutes from downtown.
51879	1416763	9.0	9.0	29451599	"Darren was an excellent host! The house is awesome and has an amazing view of Lake Washington. The pics do not do it justice. Short drive from downtown Seattle and about a 15 minute walk to a great organic market, coffee shop and burger joint. 

Darren was very accommodating with a couple of last minute changes we asked for. Couldn't have had a better experience. I plan on utilizing his space on my next trip to Seattle. Highly recommended"
51880	1416763	9.0	9.0	32035780	Darren was incredibly inviting right from the start. My friends and I were looking for an event venue and had originally booked another AirBnb. When they cancelled last minute we were stressed to find another place and Darren came to our rescue. When we met he gave us a tour of his place and even gave us ideas on how to best use it for our event. Not only was our event a success, Darren was an absolute delight to work with and I would definitely be a guest of his in the future - whether just for a stay or another event.
51881	1416763	9.0	9.0	33338004	Love this house. Second time staying and already planning a return. Darren is the best. Very accommodating with a couple requests we had. Couldn't ask for a better host. 
51882	1416763	9.0	9.0	33747783	Please see previous review as we extended our stay-- the home was awesome!
51883	1416763	9.0	9.0	33972885	Darren is a wonderful host! He was very accommodating he let us come a night early AND he even let us use the entire house. His home is fabulous! It is very spacious and the kitchen was great! The downstairs man cave stole my sons father the entire time. The views are absolutely stunning- what a beautiful way to start the day. Definitely recommend staying here! 
51884	1416763	9.0	9.0	34172486	Very lovely!
51885	1416763	9.0	9.0	35075636	Darren was pleasant and very attentive to our requests.  Unfortunately, we had many requests because the house was in need of attention and repair.  We experienced plumbing problems (1/2 bath toilet not working which left 1 bathroom), 2 major appliance malfunctions, and felt the house was sparsely furnished. We asked for more chairs so we could enjoy the beautiful view from the living room and deck, as there was one couch and no patio chairs.  Darren responded positively and found us a few odds and ends.  The two inflatable camp beds supplied in two of the bedrooms weren't as comfortable as a real bed.  Seward Park was nice, and a short drive down the hill.  Due to traffic, our commute to Seattle center was 30 to 45 min.
51886	1416763	9.0	9.0	35596461	Host responded immediately to any questions and was very helpful with his suggestions. The setting is magical and living space is more than adequate for a family. Safe neighborhood with parking and very convenient to shops, restaurants and public transportation. 
51887	1416763	9.0	9.0	35920653	Home was a great location for easy access to the city as well as points south (Tacoma,etc). Darren gave us a quick tour when we arrived to show us around the house and was attentive when we needed extra linens. There are 4 bedrooms and more than enough room with a nice covered outdoor deck. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because two of the beds were air mattresses. If you don't mind then you really can't beat the price for the amount of space!
51888	1416763	9.0	9.0	36122093	Once again Darren takes good care of my group. A+++
51889	1416763	9.0	9.0	38112572	Great house! Amazing views!
51890	1416763	9.0	9.0	38612473	Amazing view of Lake Washington and Mt. Ranier.   Darren was very flexible with our late arrival and check-in.   
51891	1416763	9.0	9.0	40724858	Darren greeted us as we arrived at his home. He was an excellent host and was not only very responsive to questions but also extremely proactive with providing any assistance we needed. Would definitely recommend this home and Darren's excellent hospitality. 
51892	1416763	9.0	9.0	42737153	"We were having our house painted so we needed to a place to stay that was kid and dog friendly for our family. The place was perfect for our little ones, close to the park, near great restaurants, and lots of bedrooms and space for the kids to run around. 

Darren was very accommodating and stayed very connected. The only con that I had was the the AC was broken during our stay and it was one of those unusual hot weeks in Seattle so the kids were a bit uncomfortable but we managed to make it work. Plus Darren provided lots of fans. 

The place was clean and tidy and overall we had a great time in the indoor and outdoor spaces. 
"
51893	1416763	9.0	9.0	44442312	Darren's home was wonderful and honestly bigger than I thought it would be.  The picture of the view can't do justice to the experience of sitting out on the porch looking out over the lake, it's beautiful and very refreshing.  Darren was very helpful and friendly.  We highly recommend staying at his home.  Thanks Darren!
51894	1416763	9.0	9.0	50897452	Home was great.  We would definitely go back.  The covered deck had great views and we thoroughly enjoyed eating breakfast out there.  Location couldn't have been better for us.  It was within walking distance of lovely Seward Park and the bus stop is right behind the house providing us an easy way to get to downtown Seattle and the airport without a car (after connecting to light rail).  The only issue we had was the place was not as clean as we would have liked.  Place definitely needs to be dusted more often.
51895	1416763	9.0	9.0	53804163	The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
51896	1416763	9.0	9.0	56185823	Due to a last minute scheduling conflict, we weren't able to stay at the house, but Darren rectified the situation.
51897	1416763	9.0	9.0	58024541	The house is perfect for a family to stay, with ample space, gorgeous views and a huge kitchen and dining area. Nothing in the house is too precious, so it has a lived-in feeling which made me comfortable having my kids ( 2 and 6) there without monitoring their every move. Darren is very available and kind. We had a perfect stay. 
52671	486344	9.0	9.0	1576215	The room is perfect and clean, and the traffic is also very convenience! I would like to go again if have chance!
52672	486344	9.0	9.0	1645241	Lara and David were very kind, fun, easy to get along with and hospitable. They gladly left the key for me to in a hidden location so that I may access the house while they were not home upon my arrival. The room was cozy and adequate for a short stay, and the house was very clean. They even have a dog, so if you're a dog lover, then you'll enjoy staying here!
52673	486344	9.0	9.0	1699607	My stay was pieceful and comfortable, although I only stayed two nights, and didn't get to see much of the city.  If your stay is brief, and you want to see the more diverse parts of Seattle, I would recommend chatting with Lara or David first - they are very friendly.  The 120 bus outside takes you straight downtown.  I would recommend using a bus tracking site to determine the arrival time, since it arrives once every 20 - 25 min.
52674	486344	9.0	9.0	1721631	I was in town for a Wedding and needed a place to crash for the night. Ashley's basement room was perfect, and a great deal. Nice people to stay with!
52675	486344	9.0	9.0	1800127	"The room was very nice - the bed was comfy and cozy, and Lara was very friendly and made things easy on me (let me do a load of my laundry, keep things in the fridge, etc).  The hosts were out a lot - which made me feel like I often had the place to myself, which was great. 

It's a quick & easy bus ride into downtown, or to Alki Beach.  It's also very easy to take the lightrail & bus to/from the airport to the house - which can save you about $35 in cab fare.  I would definitely recommend this place to others. "
52676	486344	9.0	9.0	1838958	I was in downtown Seattle for a conference this past week, and I was able to stay here for 5 days for the same price a hotel would have cost for one night. The house is 3 stories, clean and quite cool; the bus stop is a 30 second walk away and will get you to downtown in 15 minutes. Lara helped me get settled very quickly and helped me navigate Seattle (and the public transit system) throughout my visit. This is a great place to stay for anyone visiting the Seattle area. 
52677	486344	9.0	9.0	1919785	I had a great stay with Lara and David in Seattle for 3 days, with a car you can reach downtown in 12 Minutes. A good seperate room, interesting talks in the evening, I defenitly would come back. Thank you. 
52678	486344	9.0	9.0	2011213	Lara and David were friendly and helpful.  Their place is delightful and clean - a 3 storey townhouse in West Seattle.  It lived up to its description and photos and is situated in a pretty, pleasant and quiet part of Seattle.  There are bus stops to downtown almost at the front door and Seattle is easy to nvaigate by foot and public transport.  It is easy to get to their place from either the Greyhound terminal or airport by public transport and quite inexpensive.  The waterfront and anywhere near the water in Seattle is beautiful and there is much to see and do.  Their place was quiet and due to their working odd shifts, they were not often there.  Even when they were, they spent most of their time on the third floor, so the place was always very quiet.  I have no hesitation in recommending their place to anyone who wishes to visit Seattle and if I ever returned, I would want to stay there again.
52679	486344	9.0	9.0	2058950	Great quiet location, nice dog,  was there for three nights.   The dog owns the couch, but he'll share. 
52680	486344	9.0	9.0	2153448	I stayed three days at Lara's place. The room was very comfy and it was a pleasure to talk with Lara.
52681	486344	9.0	9.0	2440429	I stayed at this cute townhouse for a week. The room is small, but I don't really need much space either. Parking on the street, close to downtown and alki beach. David and Lara are very nice. The dogs are super sweet. The only thing that was a little disapponiting is the shared bathtube was clogged during the whole time I was there. It was really incomvenient. 
52682	486344	9.0	9.0	3459550	I just needed a simple room for 2 weeks when I moved to Seattle,  and Lara's place fit the bill perfectly. The hosts were gracious, and I can unreservedly recommend this place if you need a no frills place to lay your head.
52683	486344	9.0	9.0	3597836	My trip to Seattle was very short notice. I was literally at the airport trying to find a place to stay. Lara's place was a great find. Affordable, quaint and cozy the room is separated from the rest of the house, so I could come and go as a pleased without having to worry about disturbing anyone. (The room also has its own thermostat, for those chilly Seattle nights) Lara and David were also very nice and respectable. The bus stop was half a block away. The ride into downtown and all the tourist attractions was just 15 minutes. Highly recommended. You must be a dog lover.
52684	486344	9.0	9.0	3810623	Lara and David are great. Photos and description are very accurate. The room was perfect for my needs. 
52685	486344	9.0	9.0	4788017	"When it came to move 700 miles away to Seattle, I stumbled into this room offering while my own rental opened up.   Great location right in West Seattle with easy access to the freeway (and to top it off there's a great local coffee shop very close by).  
The house and neighborhood were very quiet, I never had an issue getting a good nights sleep (and this is over the course of 3 weeks).  The 2 pups are well behaved and friendly, and while the room is not as large as some, it's plenty big enough and cozy.

Lara and David were great to rent from, was a great experience."
52686	486344	9.0	9.0	5227227	The room is nice and quiet as its description. Lara and David are really nice and it was pleasant stay.
52687	486344	9.0	9.0	5888858	Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.
52688	486344	9.0	9.0	6056037	Lara and David were excellent hosts. I stayed in their private room for 7 days and it was everything that I needed. The location is great, close to downtown, a block from direct public transportation to anywhere you'd want to go, and West Seattle is a nice little area to explore as well. The room was clean and large enough for my needs. No need to think twice about staying with Lara and David in West Seattle! 
52689	486344	9.0	9.0	6122205	David was a fantastic host; the accommodation was very welcoming! Perfect position to visit seattle; easy ride to towndown (15min); awesome coffee and muffins are guaranteed in the neighborhood cafe  :-) everytime again!!
52690	486344	9.0	9.0	7609339	Lara and David are such awesome and chill people. Very accommodating and super friendly. The place is at a great location if you need to commute to downtown Seattle by bus. And not to forget their awesome dog, Carlo! 
52691	486344	9.0	9.0	7855678	I was very pleased to stay with Lara and David in North Delridge for about 10 days.  Their location is about 20 minutes from either downtown Seattle or Burien depending on which way you choose to go on the 120 Metro bus.  Within short walking distance, I could reach either of two coffee shop, two mini-markets, and a well maintained Vietnamese restaurant.  As for my room, I found it to be very adequate for my needs.  It was quiet and easily warmed up by using the wall thermostat.  The WiFi did need to be restarted occasionally but this was easily achieved by unplugging the router upstairs.  I was especially impressed by Scarlet who occasionally came to clean the apartment.  She was very thorough.  
52692	486344	9.0	9.0	8753736	My stay went well.  I was only there in the evening and all was very quiet.  I missed getting to meet Lara.  It is in a residential area, a distance from resteruants and stores...a car would be helpful but the bus is nearby.  
52693	486344	9.0	9.0	16754469	"Amazing amazing amazing place to stay for nights!!
The place is so clean and comfy!
Check in was easy , and they have a lovely dog!!
Totally recommend it !"
52694	486344	9.0	9.0	18725855	Clean, comfortable, good hosts. Great location for commute downtown.  Quiet neighborhood. Good experience for my first airbnb.
52695	486344	9.0	9.0	19042664	Lara and David were very nice, helpful, and welcoming. Lara communicated well beforehand. Carlo, the dog, is a love. A half hour trip to downtown but bus service is good and close. Interesting to be in a real residential neighbourhood. Bed is good- slept like a log.
52696	486344	9.0	9.0	23189050	Had a great time at Laura-Ashley's place and everything went smoothly. Dog is super nice. :) 
52697	486344	9.0	9.0	28622629	Immensely enjoyed my time with Lara and her roommate. The house is very nice, they're very friendly and quiet! The room is advertised and the bed is as comfy as you could imagine. Also, Carlo (their dog) is amazing! Would definitely recommend. 
52698	486344	9.0	9.0	29075241	Lara-Ashley was a wonderful host. The room was cozy and quiet and the bed was comfortable. The toilet was right at the top of the stairs on the second level. The full bath was on the third level. I would definitely stay again and I would highly recommend it for others.
52699	486344	9.0	9.0	29715280	It was a great time! Lara and David were very cool! Just nice people. The room was great, it was all I needed. Thanks guys!
52700	486344	9.0	9.0	29897019	What a great experience! Laura and Dave are super cool people, very laid back. Carlo the dog is sweet. The room was perfect and comfortable. It was all I needed:) I highly recommend!
52701	486344	9.0	9.0	30163230	I had to come in very late and Lara was very accommodating. My trip involved early raising and late nights. So really I just slept there. That being said, the room was well taken care of and quiet. I would stay there again. 
52702	486344	9.0	9.0	30346954	Another great experience, would stay again for sure! Thanks guys!
52703	486344	9.0	9.0	30432023	Another great experience! Thanks guys!
52704	486344	9.0	9.0	30651105	It's a great place to stay. Would stay again. Very comfortable with amenities.  
52705	486344	9.0	9.0	32259468	Pretty comfortable room
52706	486344	9.0	9.0	32442049	"Lara was very welcoming, friendly and just a perfect all around host. My first experience and won't be my last. Place was very clean and organized, cute friendly puppy and easy to get to. The day bed is large (I'm 6'3"" and fit just fine) and comfortable. Highly recommended for staying just outside the city only 5 min from downtown. You'll definitely see me again :)"
52707	486344	9.0	9.0	40671666	Lara was kind and welcoming; she answered all my questions and made me feel at home.  It was bonus having the half-bath upstairs to myself (had not expected that!).  The room is small but comfortable and conducive to a good night's sleep; I do wish there had been a desk lamp for the desk, however.  There are little fans that help keep the room fresh & airy.  Parking is good, the apartment is easy to find, and the wireless connection easy & seamless.  Lara was really nice & lent me her travel iron; also I was able store my food in her fridge, which had plenty of space.  The Ritz it ain't, but quite OK for my needs & the price is certainly right.  Thanks Lara! 
52708	486344	9.0	9.0	44634868	The listing was accurate, my room is very peaceful and I have a lot of privacy to myself. The sheets and covers are better looking than in the picture. It's very convenient to commute from this place, at least I find many major bus lines that run through right in front of this house. The kitchen is huge and you have your own bathroom (with no shower, however). Shower is shared. Their dog Carlo is extremely friendly and it was a good stay.
52709	486344	9.0	9.0	44970582	This was quite a nice visit. The home was easy to find, and more importantly, very comfortable. I was welcomed upon arrival, and shown around. The room was situated in the home such that I came and went without much hassle and any thought of bothering the hosts. The dog was quite large, yet very friendly. If you are looking for a quiet, nice place to stay while in Seattle, I highly recommend this listing.  
52710	486344	9.0	9.0	45348306	Nice place to stay. Great price for close location on bus line to downtown Seattle. Thanks
52711	486344	9.0	9.0	46084379	Great room with easy access to West Seattle. Felt very comfortable from the moment I got there.
52712	486344	9.0	9.0	47793365	This was my first Airbnb experience, and a great one. Lara was super friendly and accommodating. The room is quiet and comfortable.  And if you happen to like dogs: they have the sweetest one!
52713	486344	9.0	9.0	48934754	Lara Ashley's place was great! She was quick to respond to any of my questions and made the check in process super fast and easy even though I got in late at night. The room as well as the rest of the house were nice and clean and just as described. The bus stop was less than a minute walk away so that was really convenient for me since I didn't have car around. Overall a great place to stay, I would recommend it to anyone traveling solo to Seattle!
52714	486344	9.0	9.0	49374834	"Lara was so friendly and welcoming! The room was very nice and I had my privacy since the main living space was upstairs. She had everything provided and the bus stop is only half a block away from the house. Not a bad commute to downtown Seattle if you're looking to live in a cheap place close to the city. Only thing to note is that you should load up your Orca card (public transport) since there aren't any locations nearby and the website takes at least 24 hrs. 

Overall, I'd definitely stay again and would recommend Lara and her beautiful house!"
52715	486344	9.0	9.0	50052456	Laura was east to reach once we got in touch, quick to respond. The place was nice, clean and private being on the first floor. Had everything I needed. Carlos the dog was really chill. It was a quick and easy bus ride into downtown, also was able to walk a ways (nice neighborhood walk) to get to some good food and music. Great view of the city from the top of the hill a couple miles out. 
53025	3124383	9.0	9.0	16715645	"I am at loss of words for my stay at this wonderful home in Maple Leaf, Seattle. Me and my girlfriend had the pleasure of staying with Jodi for a month, and we felt right at home throughout our stay. The day I stepped in the house, I had no doubt that we'd be really comfortable. And, by the time we left, I had this sinking feeling of leaving behind a lifelong friend.

We got to stay in a wonderfully decorated room. Like the rest of the house, the room was adorned with different things from Jodi's travels - and she has traveled a lot. The bed was comfortable to sleep in, and the sheets were magically changed every 2 weeks. The closet had ample space to keep the loads of things I had. In fact, I had more stuff than what could fit in the closet, but Jodi found me a place to tuck away my things. The washroom was next to the room - and like other things, it was also fashioned with memorabilia from Jodi's travels. Also, it was stocked with everything from towels to shaving foam. The bottom line was that she made sure that both of us were always comfortable.

I did a lot of cooking while staying at Jodi's. I had some things to cook with, but being in Seattle for only a couple of months, I didn't feel the need to buy every pot and pan. Everyday when I was missing a mug or peppers or plates I wanted, Jodi insisted on me using hers, saying that I didn't need to ask for permission. It felt more like cooking at my parents' place. And, she graciously set aside a lot of room in her fridge for us.

Ever day when I came back from work, we sometimes talked to her for a few minutes and at times for a couple of hours. But, the discussion always was far from being banal, and more about sharing our experiences. So if I was looking for a sympathetic ear, I knew I didn't have to look  for long, since Jodi was there. 

If I come to Seattle again, I wouldn't think twice about staying Jodi's place. I already miss her, and I hope our paths cross again."
53026	3124383	9.0	9.0	17211250	"Jodi made us feel very welcome.  Her home was very lovely and comfortable.  She made us banana bread one day and shared fruit with us.  Coffee was wonderful!  She let us leave our little dog there one day while we explored Seattle.  This is my first trip to use airbnb and 2/3 of our experiences were wonderful. I would love to stay with her if we return to Seattle.  I plan to look up her other listing when we go to Mexico.  She was very informative about the area and we asked a lot of questions since we are considering a move to the PNW.  

I was very impressed with how she had her travel momentos displayed throughout her home.  I also appreciated how cool it was even though it was warm outside.    "
53027	3124383	9.0	9.0	32127797	I had a wonderful 13-day stay at Jodi's house. That was such a good place to live in in Seattle. The room is nice and clean, and I had full access to a private bathroom, kitchen and living room. Jodi always being nice to me and I really appreciate the coffee made by Jodi in the morning. What's more, one thing I really appreciate is that, Jodi always left a light for me every night in the kitchen, which makes me so comfortable and welcomed when I came back late each night. : ) I also enjoyed a short and brief talk with Jodi every morning, sometimes with Jodi's families as well. I will definitely chooses to live in this place next time visiting Seattle, and I will also recommend my friends to stay in Jodi's house if they need some place to live in in Seattle. Thanks a lot, Jodi. Miss you~ 
53028	3124383	9.0	9.0	32291342	"The bedroom is located in a cozy apartment, 2nd floor. Private bathroom and both bedroom and bathroom are driectly at the entrance. Jodi tries her best to make your stay as comfortable as possible. We got fruit and her amazing bananabread for breakfast! 
"
53029	3124383	9.0	9.0	33118653	Jodi is an extremely welcoming and pleasant host who goes above and beyond. There was a lovely homely atmosphere in the apartment and it was a brief walk to the local amenities.  A wonderful place to stay in a tranquil leafy neighborhood!
53030	3124383	9.0	9.0	34024931	Jodi was a wonderful host and is a great lady. She was very informative about the area and we had some great discussions during my Stacy She is very generous and offered what she had.  Her banana bread was amazing and she knows how to pick out great fruit. The room was comfortable and the bathroom was clean; and the location was great for me, close to shops, groceries, and a gym.  The #77 is real close and got me downtown in under 20 minutes. I hope to book again soon. 
53031	3124383	9.0	9.0	34447543	Jody was very welcoming. The place was exactly as described. Our bedroom was quiet and comfortable and very clean. Our dedicated bathroom was nice with a good shower and also very clean. Jodi welcomed us by offering food and conversation. She invited us to sit on the deck to enjoy the evening breeze. The room was not noisy and the mattress was comfortable. One of our best AirBNB stays!!!
53032	3124383	9.0	9.0	35230236	"Jodi is very kind and friendly. She checked in with me before I arrive and immediately responded to my call when I arrived. She showed me the place and gave me the keys.
The room is nicely decorated. It is almost convenient because both the room and the bathroom are close to the apartment entrance, so I did not have to bother Jodi when coming/going.
The building is old but comfortable. There was some noise during my stay but I was mostly out so it didn't bother me that much."
53033	3124383	9.0	9.0	37081088	Jodi was such a welcoming and accommodating host! Her apartment was stuffed with books and photos, all to my taste, and a brief visit with her family warmed me. All that on a hothot Seattle holiday weekend in preparation. I enjoyed my weekend with my daughter, and, was grateful for the graciousness of Jodi. 
53034	3124383	9.0	9.0	37458243	Jodi is really enthusiastic and kind host that I've ever met! Her tiny little apartment is such warm and comfortable! I really highly recommend Jodi's airbnb and her as to be a nice friend.
53035	3124383	9.0	9.0	37928432	This was a delightful stay - and a lucky find, as it was a last-minute reservation.  Jodi is a 'together' person, and therefore someone who is easy to be around.  Felt a friendly presence form the start, and it grew over the short two days I was there.  Hope to return if/when in Seattle again.
53036	3124383	9.0	9.0	38196962	The house of Jodi was comfortable,clean and in a quite and safe zone.Jodi is very kind and it 's a pleasure  to talk with her
53037	3124383	9.0	9.0	39044131	Jodi is a very kind and gracious host and my sister and I had a wonderful time staying with her. She was very accommodating, even when we were a little late checking in, and made us feel welcome in her home. The banana bread she made for breakfast was super delicious! We really enjoyed our time here and highly recommend it!
53038	3124383	9.0	9.0	39815396	This is my first time using Airbnb, and staying at Jodi's definitely helped leaving me a great impression of it. Jodi is super hospitable, very warm, and easy to get along with. In addition, the bed in our room is quite comfortable. We rented a car when we were in Seattle, and judging from my experience driving from/to Jodi's place, the location of her house is quite convenient. Also the Italian restaurant downstairs is pretty good. Will definitely stay at Jodi's again next time when I visit Seattle!
53039	3124383	9.0	9.0	40796254	Loved this location. Jodi is great and the area is very beautiful. Highly recommend.
53040	3124383	9.0	9.0	46004719	Jodi was a wonderful host. She was easy to communicate with when we needed to be flexible with our schedule. She had coffee ready to go each morning. The place was clean and very inviting. We could have spent hours looking at her art work and books. Our only regret was not being able to visit with her more. 
53041	3124383	9.0	9.0	48121496	Jodi was a gracious and attentive host. The room and bathroom were beautifully decorated and spotless clean. Her place is amazingly cozy and her warm personality will make you feel right at home. 
53042	3124383	9.0	9.0	48991884	Jodi was a wonderful, accommodating, friendly and very welcoming host. Before my arrival, she gave me information about how I would get there by public transit (since I didn't have a car). And when I arrived, she helped me figure out which bus to take to the University. Her space is very warm and lovely. It was a huge plus to have access to your own bathroom since I was an early morning riser and didn't want to disturb Jodi. I will highly recommend Jodi's Place to friends who plan to visit Seattle in the near future. 
53043	3124383	9.0	9.0	50107711	"Very happy can meet you in Seattle, your home is a collection of art, every details reveal your heart, is very pleasing. Room is very clean and warm, I heard that I want to buy some things for me to write down the address in detail the patient tells us how to go. We have prepared many food breakfast back. You are super kind and nice man. Our trip to the United States is a perfect full stop. Sincerely wish you a happy and healthy happy over each day. Hope we have a chance to Seattle. Bye. More hope one day you come to Beijing a guest, and we welcome you very much.

很开心在西雅图可以认识你，你的家简直就是一个艺术珍藏馆，每一处装饰细节都透露出你的用心，都非常赏心悦目。房间非常干净和温馨，听说我要买一些东西帮我详细写下地址耐心的告诉我们如何前往。早餐还给我们准备了许多食物。你真是超级亲切又善良的人。为我们的美国之行画上完美的句号。真心祝福你开开心心健健康康快快乐乐的渡过每一天。希望有机会我们西雅图再见。更希望有天你来北京做客，我们非常欢迎你。"
53044	3124383	9.0	9.0	50769241	"Jodi was very helpful and welcoming. Accommodated our late arrival time graciously. Bedroom and bathroom satisfied our needs. Had an opportunity to meet her lovely family and she very kindly let us prepare dinner in her kitchen one night. 

Great location. Easy parking in front of the complex with a coffee shop and gas station within walking distance. 

Wonderful experience."
53045	3124383	9.0	9.0	51446848	Staying at Jodi's place is like staying with family, except without any of the awkwardness or obligation. The place itself is extremely warm & welcoming, as is Jodi. She's full of great tips and recommendations, and regularly has delicious home-baked goodies on-hand. Super comfortable room with private bath, this exceeded my expectations. I can't recommend her place highly enough!
53046	3124383	9.0	9.0	55603274	Staying with Jodi was a joy; she is warm, loving, generous, and helpful. We felt like family from the moment we met her and it was much easier to share the space with her than I would have guessed. Moreover, the apartment was very well located for our needs and though we had to use on/street parking,it was always available right across the street. The only problem, from my point of view, is the age/quality of the building. The building is relatively new, but not in my view, especially well kept up. There does not appear to have been any attempt to update or renovate any of the spaces, public or private, and the deterioration shows. Also, the room is smallish so that there is no space for an easy chair in it should a guest wish to relax in privacy. That having been said, the positives will far outweigh the negatives for many, if not most, people. FYI, my husband and I are 76 (almost 77) and 71 which may explain my issues. But one could not ask for a more lovely hostess.
53263	7952930	9.0	10.0	44073097	"Space worked out great for our family.  We were a couple with kids and the extra space vs a hotel was welcome.  Place was clean and well appointed. Nice kitchen with full fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, etc. They left out coffee and cookies for us which was nice touch.  Living room with couch with TV with Netflix and table with 4 chairs. Carpet is not perfect, but overall place was clean.  There is toys on the shelves for kids to play with which was nice for us.

Bed was comfortable and clean. They set up inflatable mattress and porta-crib for our kids which was great. 

Bathroom was clean and towels were nice and soft.

Location is quiet on side street with designated off street gravel parking space.  Short walk down side of house to back yard.  Back yard was nice with a swing, kid's playhouse, and patio furniture. 

Two potential negatives:
1.  Walk down to back yard could be a problem for someone who is mobility challenged.  Not an issue for us, but if this is a concern for you probably not the best location.

2. There is some musty smell.  It is a basement apartment in Seattle, so this is to be expected, but if you are sensitive to this it could be a problem.  We opened windows and it was less noticeable each day.

Besides that, we enjoyed our stay.  Location is nice and quiet and close to I-5 which let's you get around town quickly.  Family lives upstairs, but is quiet and respectful."
53264	7952930	9.0	10.0	45324978	"Megan was a great host, very pleasant and communicative! The house is in a great location, if you are headed into Downtown Seattle in the mornings and back in the evenings this is a perfect spot to catch the express lanes. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the WSCC during 8AM traffic!
The ceilings are a bit low for anyone over 6'1"", I'm 6'3"" and my head brushed the ceiling in a few places. but other than that it is a nice place to rest after a long day at a convention.

They were very accommodating on our arrival time, and during our stay provided communication that the weather had knocked out the power and updates as to when it came back on.

We would definitely stay again if our paths headed that direction again!"
53265	7952930	9.0	10.0	45541932	The actual experience was better than expected. The space is quite large, easy to find, and private. There is easy parking too, which is rare in Seattle. Being able to have dogs is  major bonus. The yard is a nice size, fully fenced, and my dog was happy to meander about. Megan's place is a great bang for the buck.
53266	7952930	9.0	10.0	46194087	Megan and her husband greeted my friend and I upon arrival, and gave us a tour of the place along with all the necessary instructions. The place was great and cozy. We really enjoyed all the amenities their place offered and absolutely no issues on the noise. Would highly recommend and love to stay their again!
53267	7952930	9.0	10.0	46547302	Megan and her husband were helpful, prompt, and accommodating. The space was perfect for what we needed, and a great value considering it's  essentially an entire private apartment. Great location and clean. The family loves upstairs, including little ones, but they're very quiet. Would absolutely stay here again.
53268	7952930	9.0	10.0	46770192	"Megan did a great job accommodating a delayed arrival with issues on our end.  She was quite flexible in allowing us to show up and the place still felt cozy and inviting once we finally got in.  Easy parking that she kept open for us the entire stay.  The basement had way more space than we needed, it was good to be able to spread out and relax.

The bathroom has a low ceiling, but we were ok (at about 5'11"").  If you are 6'2"" or more you might have a problem.  Otherwise, this place worked out well.  

If you want a cozy, off the loud street, easy in-and-out type of place, then you should consider staying here."
53269	7952930	9.0	10.0	48810370	We missed each other on arrival, but once we were in, the bed was very comfy and it was a quiet space to sleep.
53270	7952930	9.0	10.0	49355167	We definitely felt welcomed by Megan. When I messaged her she was quick to respond, nearly within the hour each time. She made getting in easy and her communications were thorough.
53271	7952930	9.0	10.0	49678541	We loved our time in Seattle and it was nice having a great place to rest up before the next day. The apt was much nicer than we expected. Thanks so much. 
53272	7952930	9.0	10.0	50113678	"Had a really nice stay at Megan's place! A few friends from California came to visit me and the space was more than enough for the three of us for the few nights we booked. Megan was also flexible with our check-in time which was a relief since we arrived late in the evening. 

The neighborhood is pleasant and close to the freeway. The space itself is clean and spacious, with a private entry and a nice outside area. 

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone coming to visit! "
53273	7952930	9.0	10.0	51156280	We had a wonderful stay! yeah! 
53274	7952930	9.0	10.0	53385373	Megan's place is exactly as described in the ad and on the pictures: large, cozy and comfortable. It's a basement but it's fairly quiet. It can fit 4 people very comfortably. Thank you!
54549	6629278	9.0	9.0	34587647	Kathleen is a very good host, very helpfully. I really liked to stay there. 
54550	6629278	9.0	9.0	35151489	"Thank you for Kathy's warm treat and careness. Living here is just like home and you can feel safe even I am single woman travel by myself. She gave very clear guidance of transportation and sometimes she was going out, she would take you a ride to downtown. Lovely morning coffee is served, you also do laundry. We do share good times together.

Regarding the transportation, you could take only obe bus #72 eady to go the Washington university around 15mins or downtown, Pike matket place by 30~40mins, Fremont by 25~30 mins as well. If you like walking, you can also walk to Green Lake, my favorite sightsering. 
You could get a bus transit reciept to transfer any metro bus you need. 
It's also convenient of airport transportation by bus #72 to International district and Link light reil to SEA.

The room is with a small bed indeed. That would more suitable for a single woman. I also spent one night to be used to the air bed which is the first time expetience for me. Everything is settled by Kathy, you have private bathroom with towel, hair dryer, washing gel, etc. and WiFi, Cable TV. It's just like you live at hotel comfortablely.

Note on the dogs live in this house. Kathy keeps them from my room and she keeps house cleaness without the dog hair.

Welcome to come Kathy's house"
54551	6629278	9.0	9.0	36308449	Kathy is very attentive and nice. Always willing to help and share, from car trips to local tips, and clear about requests/rules. Two smaller dogs with the larger one very well behaved and trained. The location is quiet, and complete TV, entertainment center in your room. 
54552	6629278	9.0	9.0	38045959	"Kathleen was an absolute dream of a host! We felt completely welcomed from the moment that we arrived and were so glad to have had such a wonderful experience in Seattle. Kathleen was incredibly accommodating and helpful; she even offered to help with anything since we were so busy during our visit. She is also very well-read and knowledgable and I wish we had had more time to get to know her and hear more about her travels!

The room we stayed in was small, but the perfect size for two people. The air mattresses were incredibly comfortable and we slept remarkably well each night. The bathroom we were provided was clean and the shower did not take too long to warm up! Kathleen has two adorable dogs who were very friendly, but did not enter our space without invitation. She kindly provided breakfast options that were both delicious and organic, which was much appreciated!

This location was absolutely ideal for the two of us and we were glad it was in such an excellent location to access the many neighborhoods of Seattle. We plan to stay here again on future trips to the area and cannot recommend it enough to anyone looking for a place to stay. "
54553	6629278	9.0	9.0	38906532	Kathleen was a very gracious host.  The space was very nice and clean.  Kathleen welcomed my friend and I and made us feel at home as neither of us were familiar with the Seattle area.  She was very kind and even offered to drive us to various places.  She knows so much about the area and had good recommendations for things we could do.  Her dogs were wonderful, they love to hang out but are very well trained and will give you space if you need it.  The neighborhood was also great and it was easy to get to the UW area or downtown via bus.  A very positive experience!! Thanks again Kathleen!
54554	6629278	9.0	9.0	39665819	"Great host! The room and the entire home was clean and
very comfortable ( even aTV in your own room ). Had a very pleasant stay. Kathleen was also very knowledgeable in providing information of getting around the Seattle area( bus routes...etc). Thanks Kathleen!


"
54555	6629278	9.0	9.0	41236814	"Kathy is one of those super hosts you hope you meet in your journeys on AirBnB. She is a phenomenally intelligent and well read lady who has great experiences to share about he life. It truly is great spending time with her.

The room is private and clean. Has its own bathroom and is in a nice quiet part of town. Very accessible to the entire city.

I have nothing but gloqiny commendations. Stay here for a Greta hospitality experience"
54556	6629278	9.0	9.0	45286138	"Miss Kathy is a wonderfull host ... she makes you feel home .. listing description accurate.
she has two lovely dogs that makes you feel safe."
55816	486829	9.0	9.0	1440770	this was my first time with airbnb. i made a last minute reservation with lisa and michael and they were very quick to respond. they were very accomodating and helpful and had some good advice for me since i'm new to the area and was looking for a home for me and my dog. their little dog jesse was very cute but didn't seem to want a big dog in his home. (i think he was happy to see us go) and the cat was never around.
55817	486829	9.0	9.0	1458896	"Lisa and Michael were amazing and gracious hosts.  The bedroom was clean, comfortable and the queen sized bed gave us three nights of great sleep.  The internet connection worked well.

The bus stop for line 65 is directly across the street to the east of their home.  We enjoyed their dog Jesse and cat Jacques as well.  

We felt that we had made some wonderful friends and would love to stay with them again if we visit Seattle."
55818	486829	9.0	9.0	1552034	"It was a delight staying in the Cascadia Room! Lisa Michael were out of town that night, but they were more than willing to make it work. They're located in Bryant, which is very close to the neighborhoods I wanted to be in (Fremont, U District, etc). Self-check in and out was very easy; Lisa was very clear in her explanation of where things were and how they worked. 

I would recommend them to anyone visiting Seattle!"
55819	486829	9.0	9.0	1618154	My brother and I make a trip to Seattle once a year to catch a game at Safeco field. This was our first time using airbnb to make accommodations and it was cool! Lisa and Michael were great hosts and did their best to be sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed, including making up an extra bed on the couch so we could each have our own place to sleep. Michael even offered to come pick us up after the game...what a mench! I would recommend them to any other airbnb user.
55820	486829	9.0	9.0	1670528	"We really enjoyed staying at Lisa and Michael's place.  They were wonderful hosts.  Although they were very busy getting packed up and ready for their own upcoming trip they took time to help us figure out what to see in Seattle.  The only downside is that we didn't get to hang out with them more!  The room is beautiful.  It is in a great, convenient and safe location.   
"
55821	486829	9.0	9.0	1831433	We were in the area for a rather stressful family wedding.....couldn't have picked a better place to stay to feel at home, relaxed, and made welcome!  Lisa & Michael put us immediately at ease, and the house and our room were clean, comfy, and peaceful.  Had time allowed, we'd gladly have extended our stay!  An amazing array of breakfast items were available, and we enjoyed the entertainment from the wee pets. 
55822	486829	9.0	9.0	1878781	Lisa and Michael were both gracious hosts. We saw each other a couple of times a day, and they were always happy to chat and help. Nice touches included snacks in the kitchen and fridge, great location (5-min drive to U-district; 10 sec walk to Burke-Gilman Trail; 5-min drive to I-5 and the 520 toll bridge; 2-min drive to shopping mall and supermarkets), and the adorable cat. The room has a very comfortable bed (great for sleeping off jet lag!) and a writing desk, plus a closet for storing my luggage. Easy free parking right outside the door. If you are looking for a convenient and comfortable place in Seattle, definitely consider the Cascadia Room!
55823	486829	9.0	9.0	1920399	Michael and Lisa were amazing hosts, and made us feel at home after a long flight. They gave us a ton of suggestions about unique things to do while we were in Seattle as well as other cities we were visiting on our trip. Their apartment was very convenient (close to the University District and Fremont, walking distance to an outdoor mall, and a 10 minute drive into the city). The room was comfortable and clean.  They have two cute dogs and an extremely friendly cat.  We highly recommend staying with Michael and Lisa for a great place to sleep while you are in Seattle.
55824	486829	9.0	9.0	1937329	Lisa and Michael were wonderful!!  They were very helpful with directions, even printing them for us.  On two occasions they went out of their way to drive us downtown and to the Pike Place Market.  There is a bus stop just across the street.  They are very easy going, warm and friendly.  The room is comfortable and clean.  They were extremely flexible regarding check out which was of great help to us.
55825	486829	9.0	9.0	2031776	Clean & confortable room + super nice host = Lisa & Michael's Cascadia room. Nice neighborhood + unbeatable price. I highly recommend this bnb to everyone!
55826	486829	9.0	9.0	2359600	I had a great experience staying in the Cascadia Room!  I moved to Seattle in August and stayed in the Cascadia Room for an entire month while I looked for a place of my own.  Lisa and Michael were wonderful hosts who made me feel comfortable and welcome the entire time.  They are friendly, approachable, and very knowledgeable about the area.  They even helped me in my search for an apartment by offering advice about the different neighborhoods in Seattle.  They are aware of their guests' needs, offering them the privacy and space needed to feel at home, while still providing a friendly environment.  I really felt like I made a little home within their home for the month that I was staying there.  The room is very nice and offers a large closet and flatscreen TV.  It was also fun to hang out with their very cute pets.  If you are looking for safe, relaxed, and comfortable place to stay while in Seattle, I highly recommend staying in the Cascadia Room!
55827	486829	9.0	9.0	2873340	We were looking for a one night stay in seattle saturday night, since all hotel rooms were booked, i turned to airbnb. Lisa was very friendly, place was clean and bed was comfortable. We had a good amount of privacy too. Great price for the room and very convenient to downtown if you are driving.
55828	486829	9.0	9.0	2893800	"Lisa is a really nice host, We book the room at the date we are going to stay and she respond and accept us very quick.
the room is nice and she has a cat is really cute. dogs are friendly too.
we would like to stay next time."
55829	486829	9.0	9.0	3892507	This room is in a convenient location for U district business or pleasure.  It is easy to find and in a fairly quiet neighborhood.
55830	486829	9.0	9.0	4326638	Wonderful place to lay your head near the University of Washington! Lisa was a terrific host, gave a great coffee shop recommendation and directions (even shared some pancakes she had made for breakfast). Very friendly and welcoming environment. Cannot beat the location right next to the Burke-Gilman Trail and the U Village shopping center. 
55831	486829	9.0	9.0	4718512	Lisa was very kind and was quick to help for anything! Her place is in a beautiful neighbourhood, with a great coffee shop and some delicious food! I had a workshop in the area, and the cascadia room worked out well! :)
55832	486829	9.0	9.0	6208208	We moved into the Cascadia room after a two night stay in the Olympia room. Again, Lisa was so kind and laid-back we really enjoyed our stay while looking for apartments here in Seattle. Just like the Olympia room, the bed was great and the room was spacious; Lisa even let us keep our belongings in the closet, which was great since we had a lot to bring with us on our road trip. We would gladly stay with Lisa again and certainly recommend any of Lisa's rooms to say in while visiting Seattle.
55833	486829	9.0	9.0	6232894	Lisa's place is in a great location! Downtown is easily  accessible by bus and the UofWashington is within walking distance. The room is clean and the bed is comfy. Lisa was very sweet. Would highly recommend!
55834	486829	9.0	9.0	6312988	Lisa's place was everything we could have wanted and more. She's the perfect host - is kind, welcoming and available - but just let's you get on with it. She's thought of everything a guest could need, going above and beyond with little things left in the room. Her place is easy to park at, and literally 5 seconds from the awesome bike trail that whizzes you to East to West across Seattle, and easily connects with going downtown. The bed is extremely comfortable and all rooms are neat, clean and tastefully decorated in cool, calm colours. Thank you very much Lisa! It was great to meet you and kick-start our trip. 
55835	486829	9.0	9.0	6521328	Oh what more nice things can I say that hasn't already been said about Lisa. Lisa was an amazing host that kept great communication right up to the minute we left and arrived as well. Her beautiful home is cuddled up by the university district in a safe, quiet, and calm neighborhood. Transportation wise, there are bus lines outside of her home that go into the main university (where most of the campus attractions are) and take you into downtown as well. When my friend and I arrived we were greeted by Elise, another great and amazing co host that helped us settle in and meet Lisa's cute doggies. The room itself provides an awesome sleep away to heaven bed with utilities such as wifi, tv, personal refrigerator (thank you Lisa for the water and snacks btw!), microwave, couch, closet, and such. Our night was very pleasant in meeting Lisa, Elise and the pups for our first night in Seattle, we could not ask for anything more. This home provides more than just your typical bnb, it goes far and beyond! Thank you Lisa and Elise for providing such an amazing stay, Hope to see you both in the near future!    
55836	486829	9.0	9.0	6551448	The room was clean and comfortable with an excellent location. Lisa was very helpful helping me find my way around the local area. This is a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it. Certainly if I was in the area I would stay there in the future.
55837	486829	9.0	9.0	6576997	"Lisa was a very nice host and the location was perfect for us.
I was thankful for the ear plugs in the room and the fact that
we could stay 1 night only to visit our son on the way to B.C.
Thanks Lisa
 "
55838	486829	9.0	9.0	6640511	"Lisa is a wonderful host. Throughout the booking process, she was extremely helpful and responsive, even providing us with great suggestions about what to do in the area. She was very accommodating with regards to our arrival time and made the check-in and check-out process painless. 

Lisa's house and the Cascadia Room were comfortable and inviting. My friend and I looked forward to returning every evening after our daytime adventures. It was a great knowing that we'd be coming back to a comfortable bed, internet, and TV. There is even a small refrigerator in the room, which came in handy for the fruit we brought.

Booking our stay with Lisa was a great experience from start to finish, and I highly recommend her place to anyone looking for an Airbnb in the Seattle area."
55839	486829	9.0	9.0	6718409	"Lisa is a wonderful host.  She really makes you feel at home. Her home is tastefully deteriorated.  The beds are very comfortable, I've been there twice.  I highly recommend her home as a place to stay in Seattle.
Floyd"
55840	486829	9.0	9.0	6774853	Lisa was super accommodating even with our last-minute reservation request and late arrival. Comfortable and clean place for us to lay our heads!
55841	486829	9.0	9.0	6831233	This older house is in a nice neighbourhood in University District, and close to Downtown Seattle and other tourist attractions. Cascadia room has a queen bed, TV with cable, microwave, fridge, and other niceties you may expect from a B&B.
55842	486829	9.0	9.0	6883668	Perfectly located for where we wanted to be. Right on the Burke Gilman Trail, which supplies easy walking and biking to grocery stores, shops, the university and hospitals. The room was clean and nicely decorated, as was the bathroom and rest of the house. Directions/instructions were clear. Key was provided for anytime-checkin. Would stay here again in a flash! Thanks.
55843	486829	9.0	9.0	7735338	Lisa was an absolute great host.  She was very accommodating and often went above and beyond to make our experience in Seattle great!  She was easy to get ahold of at all times and always promptly answered questions.  She really made us feel right at home.  She even cooked for us!!!  I can't say enough about her hospitality.  Additionally, the location was great!  Several close bus stops to get you anywhere you need to go in Seattle.  I would definitely recommend the Cascadia Room or any other room hosted by LIsa.  I can assure you, your experience will be better than you expect!
55844	486829	9.0	9.0	9778512	This was a great spot to stay. Lisa was very friendly and really helped us out in learning more about Seattle, and what was to offer in the area. Super bed, quiet room with some extra commodities. Thanks for the Kona! Will stay again when we come back through.
55845	486829	9.0	9.0	9811043	Wonderful to have a safe, comfortable, last minute housing option in Seattle. Lisa was quick to respond, incredibly friendly and flexible to accommodate our arrival. We found it very easy to take public transit from the airport; there are two grocery stores within walking distance from her home; and the home is a 30 second walk from the Burke Gilman Rails-to-Trails walking/running/cycling trail. What a way to start our time in Seattle!
55846	486829	9.0	9.0	9919903	"The most comfortable bed I've ever stayed in. Luxurious.  Nice, private spare room conveniently located in walking distance of Children's Hospital and a very nice grocery store. Not far from the interesting University things. Public transport appeared to be convenient (but I did not try it this time).

Room has fridge, hot water maker and microwave, and hostess shares her Keurig.
It was very quiet and private. The dogs do bark when you enter, but soon settle down."
55847	486829	9.0	9.0	9988278	Lisa was very flexible about our nighttime arrival, and was very relaxed about letting us use her kitchen. The room was very comfortable, and the snacks and drinks she left for us made it feel like a bed and breakfast.
55848	486829	9.0	9.0	10094863	Wonderful stay! This was my first time in a bed and breakfast, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I am so thankful I found Lisa's place. I was hoping for a quiet, comfortable, clean place that was near things to do...and Lisa's house provided that. I was not familiar with the area, so having Lisa help me with bus schedules, location, information, and local shops really helped ease the stress of an unfamiliar area. The house was cozy, clean, and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. Lisa is a cute, helpful, and gracious host. I would definitely stay with her again. 
55849	486829	9.0	9.0	10302704	"Great location and VERY comfortable bed.  The house is very close to Children's Hospital and has easy access to local restaurants, etc.

"
55850	486829	9.0	9.0	10406837	Lisa is a very gracious host. I am very grateful and thankful that she allowed me to stay in her Cascadia Room for my brief stay in Seattle. The room was very nice, and I felt very comfortable.  I slept very well each night I stayed. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Lisa’s Cascadia Room, and it was a blessing having the opportunity to meet at talk with Lisa.  
55851	486829	9.0	9.0	10485231	Lisa is a wonderful host and has a charming house in a centralized location. The room is homey and well-suited for my purposes. 
55852	486829	9.0	9.0	12391202	We stayed at Lisa's place two months during spring. Our room was well equipped, with a TV, microwave and even a small fridge&freezer combination. Lisa was a very nice host and even bought us an extra electric heater during a cold week. The kitchen was well equipped although it was a tiny bit cramped. Lisa has two small dogs, and they got used to us right after we started playing with them and gave them a few snacks. I would suggest this place for anyone wanting to stay in a quiet neighborhood of Seattle that's quite close to the University of Washington. We had a good time and it was a very convenient location too.
55853	486829	9.0	9.0	14104712	The house was in a great neighborhood close to Children's Hospital, a bike path and shopping. My communication with my host was clear and prompt. All expectations exceeded. Couldn't have asked for more. 
55854	486829	9.0	9.0	14589234	"So, this was my first time using Airbnb, and I would definitely used it again because Lisa made the experience great. First, she was very professional and thorough in providing me with information about the location and surrounding areas--even going as far as to provide detailed bus routes and maps. 

The place itself was very well kept and comfortable. She also spent some time with me explaining how everything worked. 

The neighborhood was also outstanding. As a law transfer student to UW, I found easy access to the places I needed to go. 

I highly recommend this place for old and new Airbnb'ers alike."
55855	486829	9.0	9.0	14665532	I just stayed only one night there, though, she was very kind to me and showed her good hospitality. 
55856	486829	9.0	9.0	14674289	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
55857	486829	9.0	9.0	15636781	"Having another sleep option at my sister's house, we decided not to stay in the Cascadia Room, as the bed surface was very high off the ground, too high for my wife's comfort. 

The listed room amenities included breakfast. My wife was told breakfast would be an energy bar. Maybe Airbnb should have a few breakfast categories under Amenities to provide more detail to potential guests.

Perhaps I'll have an opportunity to stay overnight in the future and provide a comprehensive review. "
55858	486829	9.0	9.0	15738155	The bed was super comfortable, the house very nice and well-located, and Lisa was just a great host! She was very laid back and gave me everything I needed. She even lent me an iPhone charger since I forgot mine! I totally recommend staying here. 
55859	486829	9.0	9.0	15899064	Lisa was great and the place was great, too.  We felt very welcome and Lisa was very friendly and helpful.  She even gave us a little gift bag of souvenirs when we left.  We would be happy to stay with  her again.
55860	486829	9.0	9.0	16213426	Lisa was a great host. We weren't around that much as we had a lot planned for our time in Seattle but all the times we did interact she was very friendly! The room was exactly as described and the bed was really comfortable! 
55861	486829	9.0	9.0	16670301	"Lisa's place is really nice. The bedroom is full equipped, there is a microwave and a refrigerator; just say that the bed is pretty high -we didn't have any problem but maybe this may be a disadvantage for some guests-. Also she allowed us to use all the facilities of the house (kitchen, washing machine, dryer). The house is located in a quiet area close to the university. She has been really helpful to us. We really enjoyed our stay!

"
55862	486829	9.0	9.0	16871307	Lisa is a great host. The room was so comfortable and the location was great. Very quiet neighborhood and nice neighbors as well. I felt very welcome and relaxed.
55863	486829	9.0	9.0	18497299	I'm an inexperienced airbnb traveler but have done a fair amount of Hospitality club and travel in general.  Lisa is definitely one of the best parts of this particular experience.  She will interact with you as little or as much as you want.  She's laid back and friendly but not in an intrusive way.  Her home and Cascadia room in particular were very comfortable for me.  You can treat this like a hotel room and close yourself up in your room and watch tv, read, or play on the internet when you are in your room. The television has cable and a Rokuku attached to it with access to Netflix.  The bed is high as others have said but I'm tall and it was fine for me.  Part of what makes it tall is a very thick foam topper which makes it more comfortable than many hotel beds I've slept on.  There's a microwave, fridge in the room and helpful dishes like cups and paper plates.  The neighborhood was easy to navigate with a bike/walking trail directly behind the property.  I loved the little vegan bakery down the street and walked to it several times.  Also, within walking distance are a couple of grocery stores in both directions.  The University if you don't mind a longish hike (over a mile) can also be walked to as well.  I had a car and tended to drive more often than walk.  There are buses that go by the house.  For those with a car driving to/from downtown is almost 5 miles but it's definitely heavy traffic to get there if you pick rush hour part of the day.  I also drove out to the Snoqualmie waterfall which was about 45 minutes away.  University Village is  about a mile away and worth hanging out for some shopping.   Her two cute chihuahua's are part of the experience.  She keeps them locked up when guests are around but will introduce them to you if you are open to dogs.  The bathroom is shared but she has a nice, neat orderly system for her guests where things stay nice and tidy.  After staying at Lisa's place I moved into a downtown hotel for a conference where I get the privilege of paying $26 a day for parking at Park Place (more at hotel) some fee for internet which ended up being completely down the first day and enormous throngs of daily traffic and people.  I already miss my airBnB home!
55864	486829	9.0	9.0	18639188	Nice quite, neighborhood. Very welcoming host. She makes sure you feel as comfortable as you would feel in your house.
55865	486829	9.0	9.0	18845163	It was very nice! Bed was comfy and Lisa is easygoing! We enjoyed our stay there :)
55866	486829	9.0	9.0	20100505	I had a great 10 day stay in Lisa's house in the Cascadia room. The room was comfortable, with a large king size bed, and well stocked with various amenities. I also had essentially  unimpeded access to the kitchen. Lisa was a great host: friendly and helpful in many ways, and now we've become good friends. Will definitely consider staying here again, and strongly recommend her to other AirBnb'ers looking for a place to stay in Seattle.
55867	486829	9.0	9.0	21947100	Lisa is great - she is a true gem! She has two small dogs, who although not harmful, do bark a lot - so keep this in mind and how this will be for you. I had lots of access to the kitchen for cooking up food. Lisa was so kind to even have made us Pho soup one night. 
55868	486829	9.0	9.0	36756554	I've got everything important for me: house facilities including kitchen, laundry room, rest room with shower - all worked perfectly! The wonderful little garden was an excellent place to spend time at the morning with cup of coffee and in the evening with self cooking dinner. I received all help and advices from very kind attitude hostess.   
58958	9016362	9.0	10.0	53945835	Dereck and his Roommate Were very welcoming and helpful for our trip to Seattle. The apartment is right in Capitol Hill; we walked to a few bars very easily. They were very friendly but also gave us enough space and privacy.
58959	9016362	9.0	10.0	54569446	Dereck and his roommate Colby were great. Dereck was quick to respond and kept me informed of what was going on throughout the day. When Dereck had to work he promptly informed me that Colby would be meeting with me to provide me a key and answer any questions I may have.  Colby provided me with basic navigation of Capital Hill, ideas of places to eat, drink and see.  Both of the guys offered their cell phone numbers in case i got lost.  This was my first airbnb experience and so I wasn't quite sure how it all worked. Dereck promptly answered all of my questions and couldn't have been nicer throughout the whole process. The room was as advertised and the whole place was tidy and clean. The views from the apartment are fantastic and the building is close to anything you could possibly want to do on Capital Hill.
58960	9016362	9.0	10.0	55708060	Dereck was quick to respond, a really nice guy and so were his two other room mates. They keep a pretty clean house and the room has a beautiful view of Seattle and a nice balcony. It's centrally located and easy to get to. Enjoy your time with Dereck. 
58962	3803212	9.0	9.0	17425652	The reservation was canceled 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
58963	3803212	9.0	9.0	18823919	Everything was great, got the keys easily. The place was nice and clean, no complaints!
58964	3803212	9.0	9.0	20144470	Great space and location! The apartment was comfortable for three guests (four might be pushing it) and looked just like the photos. Minh was super friendly and always available to answer our questions, from the time we booked until our check out. I would definitely recommend his place to anyone visiting Seattle!
59512	8053921	9.0	10.0	45207722	Sandy was an amazing host! She was very accommodating to all our needs, right down to sharing her coffee in the morning. The neighborhood she is located in is great but what put it over the top was her knowledge of the goings on in the area. The apartment is exactly as billed, very spacious, especially the bathroom. Sandy also responded to our requests, even when we required an extra bed. Would highly recommend!
59513	8053921	9.0	10.0	45870639	Sandy is such a down-to-earth, honest, thoughtful host. My boyfriend and I loved hanging out with her and are so grateful for her hospitality and accommodations! She's got a great space, and sectioned off part of the main living room space of her apartment just for us as her visitors. Her apartment is pretty centrally located too - an easy walk to fun coffee shops, ice cream/restaurants, nightlife, etc; and then there's a bus stop a short walk around the block where one can hop on for an easy ride into downtown. We definitely look forward to staying in touch and visiting with her again soon!
59514	8053921	9.0	10.0	46953601	We were originally a bit hesitant that this Airbnb would be kind of awkward because it's in her living room, our views quickly changed once we saw the place and met our hostess! An impeccable designer and truly welcoming host, Sandy managed to transform the living room into a private, fun, boho style room that felt like we had walked into an Anthropologie store. Stylistic bonuses aside, Sandy is a very fun and helpful host, with pamphlets for local area attractions, maps, bus routes and personal recommendations for great grub and fun pubs. This Airbnb was in a great location, for a great price and had an even greater host. Thank you so much for letting us stay, Sandy! 
59515	8053921	9.0	10.0	48056179	I had a great experience staying with Sandy. She was friendly, very accommodating and super clean! Also, I felt safe and secure throughout my entire stay. Her location is ideal with amenities (supermarket, bus stop and a coffee shop) all within a couple blocks. I would definitely like to stay with Sandy again the next time I'm in Seattle. She is an awesome girl who is extraordinarily artistic and creative. See you next time Sandy!
59516	8053921	9.0	10.0	48564213	Three of us came to Seattle to attend a 5 day music festival. Sandy was very accommodating and understanding of our irregular schedule. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood within blocks of great restaurants and a bus line. All in all a great experience, thanks!
59517	8053921	9.0	10.0	49073646	Sandy is such a lovely host! Not only is her place is quiet, clean and in a central location but she had great recommendations for places to eat and took some time to hang out with me in the evening. Overall a great place to stay!! 
59518	8053921	9.0	10.0	49492030	Great space, great host, great location! Sandy was super-flexible and accommodating when I wanted to add a day and a guest to my reservation. Her canine roommate was very respectful and polite, didn't make a fuss or a mess, and slept in his room most of the day - this may be valuable information to those who don't love dogs as much as I do. Overall, Sandy was great company, with great information on local attractions and transit (she can get you hooked up with the app for Seattle's bus system). 
59519	8053921	9.0	10.0	50087282	Sandy and Dexter were awesome hosts. Easy instructions, good communication, and a mellow place (in a great location!) combined for an excellent stay.
59520	8053921	9.0	10.0	50333782	"Staying at Sandy's apartment in Capital Hill was incredible. Her apartment is extremely spacious and in an awesome location. Despite the fact it was a ""shared room,"" I never felt as though we were in each other's way, and really appreciated the privacy curtain Sandy built in the living room.  This was my first Airbnb , and I really couldn't have asked for a better host or place to stay. Sandy was welcoming and friendly, and gave me some awesome places to check out while in Seattle. Her dog is really sweet and quiet too! 
Thanks for everything, Sandy! "
59521	8053921	9.0	10.0	51748131	Sandy was a wonderful host! The air mattress was quite comfy and the space was perfect for me to crash after a long day. Shout out to co-host Dexter for being a cool dog!
59522	8053921	9.0	10.0	52772825	Sandy was amazing and the rooms were as described. First Airbnb experience and it's been a great moment.
59523	8053921	9.0	10.0	53148253	Sandy and Dexter were awesome hosts! Even though you're sleeping In the living room, she has done a great job of making it feel like your own space. She offered refreshments and snacks during my stay and did a great job of making sure I found the place ok. Parking is a bit of a hassle of you get back later in the day, but there is overnight street parking. Sandy herself is awesome and did a wonderful job of making me feel welcome. Highly recommend! 
59524	8053921	9.0	10.0	53263388	While I didn't get to meet Sandy (or Dexter! Sad face!) because we left so early in the morning, she made sure that we had clear instructions on getting into the apartment and everything was set up and ready for us. She was just a text away when I had  question and answered promptly. Parking can be a bit tricky but if you have patience or don't mind paying, it's not a big deal. We were able to find a spot only a short walk away. The location is great, easy walk to shops and restaurants. The only downside to the stay was the common areas in the building (NOT Sandy's place itself) had a pretty cloying smell of air freshener/scented candles to it so if you're sensitive to smell, walking in and out of the building can be a bit rough. 
59525	8053921	9.0	10.0	53897657	I had a great stay at Sandy's place. It really is quite spacious and located near lots of interesting restaurants and bars. Would definitely recommend for people looking to explore Seattle.
59526	8053921	9.0	10.0	56238314	Sandy's place was a great Basecamp for exploring Capitol Hill and Seattle downtown. We were able to easily walk/uber where ever we needed to go and sandy was a great host. She even provided us with some vouchers for the activities we wanted to do. We highly recommend everyone check out the EMP music museum, we had the best time there. 
60505	2418658	9.0	10.0	10699461	Rebecca's apartment made for a stylish, comfortable home base during my weekend in Seattle. Check in/out was easy even though I wanted to check in early on Friday. The location could not be better. Downtown and the Convention Center are within walking distance, as are the restaurants, shops, bars, and parks of Capitol Hill. The building is a classic and Rebecca's place is tastefully decorated with vintage art and furniture. I loved coming home here!
60506	2418658	9.0	10.0	10870214	Rebecca's place was great- easily accessible, clean, comfortable, and just an overall awesome place to stay.  Getting keys was easy, Rebecca was nice enough to suggest restaurants in the area, and she was flexible and a clear and friendly communicator.  I would absolutely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others!   
60507	2418658	9.0	10.0	11098840	Rebecca's apartment was fantastic! The location was perfect - Starbucks right across the street, a ton of bus routes close by, and lots of restaurants, cafes, and shops less than a five minute walk away. The apartment was the perfect size for 1-2 people and we felt very comfortable there. If you're thinking about watching her cats, do it! They are both very sweet and easy to care for. My boyfriend, who's not a cat person, fell in love with both of them on the first day. Rebecca was a fantastic host too. She always responded immediately to emails and made sure we had everything we needed. I would 100% recommend staying here. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood and Rebecca's apartment is the perfect place to experience it.
60508	2418658	9.0	10.0	11192363	I spent a long weekend here and it was lovely! Rebecca's place is in a great location to get to all kinds of things, and it's surrounded by tons of fantastic places to eat or grab a drink. Great views out of the windows!
60509	2418658	9.0	10.0	11311091	Rebecca's place is lovely. Very charming, comfortable, and quiet. I wanted to take the pillows home with me. Rebecca was very communicative and friendly. Check in and out were a breeze. Great location. Lots of good food nearby. Be sure to go to Le Bete and the Monday night Mexican dinner at Sitka & Spruce. 
60510	2418658	9.0	10.0	11619868	We stayed in Rebecca's place for a week and really loved it there. The location is perfect, with lots of nice cafés and restaurants just around the corner. The apartment is beautifully decorated. I would come back there anytime. 
60511	2418658	9.0	10.0	11847832	"Rebecca's apartment is lovely and the night I was there I was treated to a beautiful sunset view. She was super easy to communicate with before and after my trip; and during the time I was there and she was camping she had me in touch with a neighbor who helpful and easy to reach. I chose the ""with cats"" option and recommend it if you'll be missing your own cats while you travel and want the company.  "
60512	2418658	9.0	10.0	12342968	Just lovely. Rebecca's place was just what I needed for a vacation in Seattle: comfortable, quiet, super convenient and charming. Rebecca has killer taste and if you find yourself spending an afternoon or evening in (not out of the question on a rainy night), you are in for a treat—the mood of the place is really something. Rebecca herself is sweet natured and communicative. 
60513	2418658	9.0	10.0	12704935	rustic relaxation in a classic apartment building. perfect for chefs, couples, thrift store junkies. lovely. 
60514	2418658	9.0	10.0	12939699	Rebecca is fast to respond and the place is very charming.  
60515	2418658	9.0	10.0	13219126	"Rebecca was very welcoming and flexible as I planned my stay with her: she arranged to let me use her neighbor's WiFi and she left plenty of good coffee, tea and fresh 1/2 & 1/2.  We had a little snafu with the keys when I arrived but she was very responsive and the issue was fixed quickly. 

It's a lovely apartment: bright light, very comfortable bed, plenty of hot water. The neighborhood is fabulous: lots of restaurants and coffee shops and it was less than a 10-minute walk down to the convention center. 

I wasn't able to get on the WiFi for most of my stay, and while this was a bummer, Rebecca did everything she could to troubleshoot the issue and she even left me a gift card for Starbucks when I ended up going there to connect (it's right across the street).   "
60516	2418658	9.0	10.0	13493196	My husband and I came to town for a wedding we only stayed one night at Rebecca's but loved it:) the building is absolutely charming I loved all the vintage charm everyone we saw was friendly and welcoming it was the perfect end to our stay in Seattle. We also had the cats stay who's personalities were comical they are very inquisitive loving and personable. We have dogs  and my husband has always said he's not very fond of cats but for one night it would be fine, well they became fast friends and cheep entertainment for me;) stopped in at glos coffee shop for breakfast and it was delicious great shops in the area will have to come stay again with more time to look at them all. 
60517	2418658	9.0	10.0	13686608	Rebecca was incredibly easy to coordinate with.  Her apartment is great and just as she describes.  The location is perfect and there are a lot of nice cafes and bars in walking distance.  
60518	2418658	9.0	10.0	13968056	"I stayed a total of 3 nights at Rebecca's apartment. I had an early arrival time and a late departure time; she was able to accommodate both. I never met her in person but she left very detailed instructions that were extremely helpful. The apartment has an amazing view of Capitol Hill. It is fairly small but I never once felt cramped, it was very cozy. The apartment building is beautiful as well.

I chose the option to watch her cats and I'm so glad I did. Lonnie and Peanut are the best. They are soo entertaining and friendly. 

This was my first time using airbnb and it could not have gone any better. Thanks Rebecca!"
60519	2418658	9.0	10.0	14234064	We had a fabulous time in Seattle. Sharing the space with the cats was greatly entertaining and helped us not miss our own as much. The place was as described and Rebecca left straightforward instructions for us and was easy to contact if needed. The building and neighbourhood is fantastic and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to visit.
60520	2418658	9.0	10.0	14473806	Rebecca extremely helpful and prompt with replies to questions.    The flat was charming, with good light from the windows, and airy views.    We absolutely loved the neighbourhood - short walk to interesting area and lovely economical places to eat.   Local shops (3 within 2 mins) are great for the basics and friendly people.   We had a great time. 
60521	2418658	9.0	10.0	14786065	Rebecca's apartment is great and it is in a perfect location to explore Seattle. We have never met Rebecca, but she was very quick in responding to our emails during our stay - and even around to bring some stuff to the flat that we needed. Unfortunately, we did not notice before that the flat does not offer Internet, but Starbucks is just around the corner :) We also enjoyed Lonnie and Peanut, Rebecca's two cats, which are very friendly and easy to take care of. During the night, they share the bed with you. We can definitely recommend Rebecca's place when you are about to explore Seattle.
60522	2418658	9.0	10.0	14894007	Perfect location, beautiful vintage furniture and if you like listening to records, you will appreciate the record player and her record collection. Rebecca was quick to respond to our messages and made the check in and out very easy. We stayed for 2 nights and chose to look after the cats that was fun. They both are very affectionate and sweet, however, they did wake us up at 5am every morning asking for food. Apart from that, it was a very pleasant stay. 
60523	2418658	9.0	10.0	15101032	"What a great place! Loved the vintage decor and the cool old features of the building. The neighbourhood was great, lots of good food and some shops close by. Rebecca left a detailed map and suggested some of her favourite places. (I highly recommend coffee and breakfast at Arabica just around the corner- delish!) Also, a fairly quick walk to downtown. 

We opted to have the cats around and totally fell in love with them! Watch out for Peanut's crazy shower-curtain-attacks when you're sitting on the toilet though ;) Lonnie is a big snuggler... I miss him!

Note: Rebecca doesn't have wifi (which is mentioned in her ad, but I overlooked it), but Starbucks is right next door with free wifi. 

I would definitely stay here again, and will recommend it to friends. Thanks Rebecca!!!"

60527	2418658	9.0	10.0	15497251	Rebecca's apartment is pure magic - with a lovingly curated vintage vibe within and gorgeous views over Seattle beyond. It was also close to lots of cute restaurants and cafés. Had a great time! Rebecca was super flexible and let us check in earlier too, so massive thanks for that!
60528	2418658	9.0	10.0	15768302	"Rebecca was a great host. She left specific details about her cats and how to take care of them (which is an easy job), as well as specific information about her favorite places in the neighborhood (we loved Melrose Market and Stumbling Monk the most!). Capitol Hill is just as she described: progressive, artistic, vibrant. There are a ton of places to eat and have drinks just steps away from her apartment, but we also easily walked downtown to Pikes Market, Pioneer Square, and Belltown. 

If you choose to take care of her cats, they are very sweet cats. They will come sleep with you, even if it is a warm night :) They did wake us up pretty early in the morning to eat, but once they are fed they settle back down. The kitten Peanut, is especially playful, so be ready for an energetic pet!

I recommend Rebecca's apartment, especially if you want to experience life in this very unique neighborhood!"
60529	2418658	9.0	10.0	15891759	A+ ! Great interior vibe, with a great attention to detail in providing a neighborhood map & suggested visits. The kitties do rise early, but they are sweet so it's all good. :) 
60530	2418658	9.0	10.0	16043832	The host was super responsive ahead of time and great about checking in; the apartment was beautifully decorated, and Rebecca had left little instructional notes everywhere. Plus the cats were fun (although quite rambunctious into the late hours, maybe a problem for some) - of course there is also the option not to take care of the cats if this is a concern for you. Overall great stay!
60531	2418658	9.0	10.0	16083719	"We were really excited to stay at Rebecca's apartment but ended up going out to Bremerton that evening to stay with some family. Rebecca was quick to respond to messages and was even going to pay us to feed her cats.
Maybe we can stay at her place the next time we pass through Seattle. "
60532	2418658	9.0	10.0	16145879	"Rebecca's apartment was in a perfect location . I was able to walk from the downtown light rail right to her door. It was also close to some really great cafes. 
The space itself is nicely designed and feels spacious. The views are lovely as well. 
She was always reachable and was nice enough to be flexible with my check-in time. I will definitely stay here again. "
60533	2418658	9.0	10.0	16467170	"We loved this place! Rebecca had a map of all the best ""local"" spots, ranging from coffee to food to the atmosphere of the local bars. The house was as advertised, great views and exactly what we expected. Will be using this place again on our next adventure. Thank you, Rebecca!"
60534	2418658	9.0	10.0	16790103	Rebecca was very communicative and left specific instructions for how to use everything. The apartment was airy, comfortable, and quiet. The neighborhood had loads of coffee shops, bars, and markets. Tuning into the radio rather than TV and WiFi was actually a nice respite. A good base in the heart of Seattle.
60535	2418658	9.0	10.0	16964814	Rebecca was friendly, responsive, and a lovely host. Her apartment's described well in the listing – and is very nice! – and we found the location quite good too. If you're looking for a temporary home in Seattle, I'd recommend her Capitol Hill apartment.
60536	2418658	9.0	10.0	17050314	Great location, adorable cats, awesome coffee. Beautiful plants everywhere. Awesome attention to decoration detail. Old building. Cool neighborhood.
60537	2418658	9.0	10.0	17484234	This is a very stylish apartment. We love it! Rebecca is a very accommodating host and leave us detailed house instructions/local guide (also very stylish, hand-written with hand-drawn map). Very easy check-in and check-out. The house also has a record player and a good collection of records. Prime location in Capital Hill. 
60538	2418658	9.0	10.0	17605086	Great location. Vibrant neighborhood on a late Tuesday night. Good value. 
60539	2418658	9.0	10.0	18071707	Rebecca's place was beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and had an amazing view of the city. It was in an ideal location and her hand drawn map with suggestions made our stay in seattle so great. I would love to stay there again!
60540	2418658	9.0	10.0	18206303	"We had a nice night in Rebecca's place. It's a fantastic location, and the sixth floor views from up on the hill are very nice. The apartment felt very comfortable, Rebecca was very responsive to communication... it was all good!

We agreed to take care of Rebecca's two cats. They were sweet little guys, but we followed the feeding instructions and it left them very rambunctious. Like, waking us up at 5:30 AM type of rambunctious. We fed them one can of food the evening we arrived (around 6pm) but clearly they weren't satisfied by that. We didn't want to overfeed them, but probably just should have as they quieted right back down when we gave them their second feeding at the crack of dawn. We were able to get back to sleep after that... but consider how much babysitting you want to do if you agreed to help with the cats. They were more of a handful than we were expecting.

Great place and great host though! Thanks again Rebecca for having us!"
60541	2418658	9.0	10.0	18277682	Nice apartment in the perfect location for my husband and I on a quick trip. Everything we needed was within walking distance. Rebecca was a great host too. We chose to watch the cats and they were a bonus.
60542	2418658	9.0	10.0	18596567	Great neighborhood, beautiful brick building, vintage elevators. Fresh towels, clean sheets and single use toiletries were waiting for us upon arrival. If you choose to take care of the cats - they are very friendly, had no problems with them. There's no wi-fi in the apartment and sadly all neighbors have their wi-fis password protected :) There's a Starbucks across the street with a free wi-fi though.
60543	2418658	9.0	10.0	19290459	Rebecca lives in a beautiful building in Capital Hill.  I appreciated how easy she made it to check in - she left lots of handy information about her apartment, parking in the area, and recommendations for restaurants.  
60544	2418658	9.0	10.0	19353154	Rebecca was such a great host! I felt welcome immediately and she left out a little hand drawn map of the areas with points of interest. Her place is clean, beautiful, and the location is very ideal when coming to Seattle. It's exactly as described, very comfortable, and I enjoyed the lack of internet and TV. If you're on vacation and don't need these amenities for work, then I highly recommend her place! Her cats are very sweet (and a little rambunctious) and the record player adds a charm to the stay, giving an old world feeling that I really liked. Thank you for letting me stay at such an awesome place! Next time I'm in Seattle, I will stay here again!
60545	2418658	9.0	10.0	19390939	"Rebecca worked hard to make sure the logistics work out perfectly.
The room is perfectly located, and is clean and welcoming. It looks just like in the photo. Rebecca left very useful notes including various shops and restaurants in the area. Leaving spare iPhone charging cables was a great touch. It saved my day, really.
The cats are super sweet, too.

Highly recommended."
60546	2418658	9.0	10.0	19977914	Super cute apartment in a great neighborhood.  Check in was easy and Rebecca left a fantastic hand drawn map with neighborhood recommendations.  We watched her kitties and they were so much fun-both of them are super sweet and snuggly.  I highly recommend Rebecca's place!
60547	2418658	9.0	10.0	20062808	The apartment was as advertised, located centrally within the great Capitol Hill neighborhood. Rebecca was a wonderful host and super responsive leaving very detailed instructions on the apartment and suggestions for the surrounding area. Would happily stay again! :)
60548	2418658	9.0	10.0	20106828	"Rebecca was responsive with answering our questions during booking and left a welcome note and a great little map with recommendations of places to check out in the area. She was also generous enough to offer us a discount even though her cats were staying elsewhere since we'd agreed to care for them. Rebecca left sets of clean towels for my husband and I and there was nice shampoo and conditioner in the shower. She also provided creamer for coffee. The decor was artistic and eclectic.

However, our stay wasn't a very pleasant one. The apartment wasn't clean and we felt more like we were crashing at a friends place than paying to stay at a nice apartment that had been prepared for our stay.

Also, I love animals, but be prepared that you can tell that cats live here even if there's not around. Aroma and cat hair on the shelves and sofa give it away. There was a nice scented candle on the table that Rebecca lit before we came back to the apartment which was helpful.

We were also disappointed that the room wasn't ready upon arrival around 7:30pm, even though we'd communicated we were coming in from a long flight from Iceland and given an estimate for our arrival early on when asked. So we got to meet Rebecca and her boyfriend while they were putting on clean sheets. They were extremely nice, but this apartment would need to be taken up a notch before we'd return."
60549	2418658	9.0	10.0	20220329	Rebecca's apartment was centrally located and hospitably appointed. She left a series of helpful notes about the apartment and the neighborhood, all in handwriting that has to be seen to be believed.
60550	2418658	9.0	10.0	20323249	What a nice experience. Rebecca' has a wonderfully designed space in a very convenient part of town. I couldn't have been more pleased!
60551	2418658	9.0	10.0	20440394	We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Rebecca's studio.  It's a rad, old building.  The apartment has great light, and cool views.  We loved walking around the neighborhood.  Rebecca was a great host.  I would highly recommend her place!
60552	2418658	9.0	10.0	21313247	Great little apartment in a really cool little area of town.   Rebecca was an excellent host, her map and local advice were super helpful, and she went above and beyond helping me plan a running route close to home.  We had a little confusion with the key drop off which she handled very well and in a timely manner.  We would definitely stay again.   
60553	2418658	9.0	10.0	23207742	Rebecca was an amazing host.  She was always super responsive, checking in and getting the keys was a breeze and the same goes for checking out.  Her apartment is in an ideal location, you really can't ask for more.  Lots of great coffee shops nearby, places to eat, and bars to hang out after a long day of work/site seeing but its far enough from the main street so her place is very quite.  I would recommend her place to anyone!
60554	2418658	9.0	10.0	23333266	Rebecca was super helpful in our check in and everything went well overall. This apartment is in a classic old Seattle building. We lived in Seattle for years and are very familiar with this kind of property. If you are not familiar I would warn you the building is dated, musty, peeling wallpaper, soiled carpet etc. The apartment itself has simple vintage furniture that has some definite wear and tear. Apartment had some similar old building issues. Broken tile in the bathroom, old windows that don't quite close all the way, etc... For us it was exactly what we were looking for. Location is the greatest, allows pets, and reminded us of our apartment when we lived in Seattle.
60555	2418658	9.0	10.0	23482913	"We didn't have the chance to meet Rebecca in-person, but she was very sweet and helpful.
The apartment has a prime location and it was cozy. We checked in and out very easily. Rebecca was very flexible for the checkout time which also helped us a lot.
There has been only one thing that we didn't like, which is the cleanness of the apartment on the first day. As Rebecca explained it was the previous guest's dog's hair all around the floor. She came by the next day and cleaned it up, but we already spent one night like that and that's the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5."
60556	2418658	9.0	10.0	23876883	Great location and a really cute apartment, looks exactly as promised with a great view! Rebecca was helpful and flexible with check in/out times, allowed me to stay an extra night when my plans changed. Only wish it had wifi!
60557	2418658	9.0	10.0	24013604	Rebecca's place was adorable and charming beyond words.  The apartment building is legitimately out of a Wes Anderson film with pink floral wallpaper and a service elevator that'll take you back (before you were likely born.)  Her bed was comfy and she took the extra time to provide us with an assortment of refreshments in the fridge.  I didn't get a chance to meet her in person, but she was very responsive and helpful via text.  When I left behind some belongings, she promptly mailed them back to me.  Location is prime!  There are tons of little stores around the block, great cafes, and bars.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks Rebecca!
60558	2418658	9.0	10.0	24535152	"Rebecca was very easy to communicate with, she was always a call or text away and answered all our questions promptly. We had no problems with the apartment, it is exactly pictured and what we wanted for our short stay in Seattle. The no wifi wasn't much of an issue either because the Starbucks was literally across the street. Great location, and nice quaint building. Absolutely would recommend and stay again.
"
60559	2418658	9.0	10.0	25291359	Extremely well located apartment with both downtown and Capitol Hill with in minuets walk.  Apartment very clean and tidy, well equipped and Rebecca was always quick to respond to any queries.  would definitely recommend to others and stay again.  
60560	2418658	9.0	10.0	25346281	"Rebecca made us feel very welcome. She let us into the apartment and showed us around. She left a great hand drawn map of cool spots in the area and was available by cell if we needed anything. The apartment was in a great location and worked great for our short visit.  The few downsides we had were more due to our rushed booking. The apartment didn't have wifi which was a bummer but it didn't hinder our visit too much. We enjoyed the record player instead and all was well.

"
60561	2418658	9.0	10.0	25448499	We loved our stay at Rebecca's apartment. It was cozy and felt like home. The pictures give a good idea of what the place looks like. The neighborhood was perfect--lots of interesting bars and restaurants and a close walk to great places in Seattle. Rebecca was attentive and helpful in giving us city pointers. If you are watching her cats, make sure you love cats! 
60562	2418658	9.0	10.0	25640900	Rebecca's studio is located in a great location within Capitol Hlil.  The neighbors in the building were super friendly.  The studio itself was a great rustic getaway that provided a perfect launching point to explore the city and its surroundings. We had the pleasure of earning the likes of Peanut and Lonnie Chan, Rebecca's cats, who were full of personality and a nice addition to the studio.
60563	2418658	9.0	10.0	25764213	"Our host was fantastic! Rebecca was super attentive and helpful. She ended up going out of town and left us in the care of her friend Grace who was also amazing and super on top of all our communications. They asked if we wanted creamer for coffee which I said yes to but ended up just running out and grabbing coffee every morning. That was so sweet though! Rebecca also made a cute little map with attractions and everything. Also check in and check out were a breeze!

The pictures are very true to what the apartment is. For the price it was a great little landing pad right in the heart of Capital Hill and we enjoyed it! It had all the basics and is surrounded by a lot of great places to eat, shop, and whatnot. We hit up the Starbucks right across the street every morning. There is the BEST breakfast place across the other street (main busy st) from Starbucks too. I wish I could remember the name but it was so good! Check it out if you want an awesome breakfast!

We had the pleasure of having Peanut and Lonnie (the two kitties who live there) stay with us. They were a little crazy the first night with jumping on us a bit while we were sleeping, but by the next night they were totally fine and curled up with us. They are really sweet and Lonnie was such a cuddler. We loved them!

Overall I would stay here again. =)

60564	2418658	9.0	10.0	25909272	"We had a great time at such a lovely apartment! The cats were nice but they can sometimes wake you up during the night. 
"
60565	2418658	9.0	10.0	26136662	Rebecca's apartment was perfect and comfortable for my stay in Seattle.  I enjoyed the location and they company of both her cats. Thank you! 
60566	2418658	9.0	10.0	26314528	Rebecca was great at communicating and making sure I had everything I needed. It was the perfect spot for a photoshoot, and loved how the images turned out! Cats were super sweet, I just wish I would have brought a little air freshener due to the litter box. She also warned me of the door knob, and even though I was pretty gentle it did come off. She was very apologetic, and I was totally understanding. 
60567	2418658	9.0	10.0	26686365	Rebecca's apartment was a wonderful place to spend time at in Seattle. It's perfect if you're there by yourself or with a partner and is exactly as described. Not too big, not too small. The best part is you're within walking distance of everything. Pike Place is a 15-20 minute walk, a Starbucks is around the corner, great restaurants and bars are only a couple blocks away, and when you come back for the night you're in a quiet neighborhood. We only ended up taking a Sidecar twice while we were there! The kitchen is small, but easy to navigate and Rebecca set us up with provisions for coffee and tea, which was wonderful! We ended up having breakfast there everyday and cooking  a full gourmet meal one evening. The building is old and charming and despite being 7 floors is very quiet. And although it is an old building, the shower's water pressure and temperature is great. Plus Rebecca leaves nice shampoo, condition and soap for your stay. It's like a little bed and breakfast. It was a great place to stay while we explored Seattle!
60568	2418658	9.0	10.0	26837922	Rebecca's apt is a great place to stay for a visit to Seattle! Fantastic views, good location to downtown as well as the Capitol Hill bars, shops, and restaurants. Rebecca left a hand-drawn map of her personal faves, which was a nice touch. Her two cats, Lonnie and Peanut, are VERY friendly, so be prepared for some feline love and attention. Rebecca was away when I arrived so she coordinated key pick-up with her friend Grace who was very helpful as well.
60569	2418658	9.0	10.0	26990872	Rebecca's place is awesome! Really cool old building in a really nice area with a lot of neat stuff all around, she was very accommodating and her apt was perfect, lots of cool records and great views 
60570	2418658	9.0	10.0	27226945	My stat in this very classic American appartement Building was a joy. The location is perfect in the most living area of Seattle, Capitol Hill. It was a convenient place, a bit hard to find parking for my car (although I parked it illegally at the next door Starbucks at night, and wasn't towed away :)) So thanks, good place.
60571	2418658	9.0	10.0	27536137	Rebecca's place was excellent, just what we needed for our week in Seattle. Though Capitol Hill is filled with great restaurants, bars, and coffee, it also makes a great base for exploring other parts of the city as well. Moreover, Rebecca helped orient us with a map and lists of her favorite neighborhood spots. The kitchen is huge for a studio apartment and (with Rebecca's cookware) provided ample room for cooking on nights when we didn't feel like dining out.
60572	2418658	9.0	10.0	27922416	"Rebecca left a personalized note for us based on what she knew of our interests, and a map with different restaurants and stores she recommended within walking distance. She really had everything taken care of in advance, so we didn't need to ask much of her.

The apartment itself has a great view, is well decorated, and is located very close to bus stops that got us anywhere else we wanted to go in Seattle. The apartment building kind of looks like it could be in a Wes Anderson movie.

I really liked the neighborhood (Capitol Hill), too. There happened to be an art gallery walk while we there. There are lots of cool coffee shops and roasteries, bars, and restaurants in the area. There's at least one fringe theater nearby."
60573	2418658	9.0	10.0	28776433	The room and location are fantastic. Brilliant design sense and so peaceful up on the top floor, at the end of a hall. If you are looking for a place to explore capital hill and downtown this is a perfect launching point. I hope we can return.
60574	2418658	9.0	10.0	28960401	Great place, we really enjoyed our stay. The location is also perfect!
60575	2418658	9.0	10.0	29212814	Great place. Rebecca was very warm and welcoming. Clear instructions, easy to find, easy to access, and very comfortable & calm  space. Would definitely stay again. 
60576	2418658	9.0	10.0	30296108	Good location for walking to the sights, and Rebecca is a great host!
60577	2418658	9.0	10.0	30878387	"Rebecca was very responsive and accommodating. I was able to reach her every time we had a question or needed help, prior to and during our stay. She made sure to ask before our arrival if she could do anything to help us feel more welcome, and left us delicious coffee, some cream in the fridge, a really cute map of her favorite spots in the neighborhood, which we loved. Her apartment is really cute, well-situated, really comfortable, and is in a great neighborhood. We ran into intermittent issues with the elevator, but the stairs are not too bad and have got their own skylights!  

Overall I had a really fun weekend, and would definitely stay at Rebecca's again when I return to Seattle. 

"
60578	2418658	9.0	10.0	31123025	The unit was exactly as advertised. Cool vintage furniture, comfortable bed and full bath/kitchen. Perfect location for those wanting to walk downtown/South Lake Union or stay in Capitol Hill. Typically I get units with TV and Internet but it was nice to come back to the studio, unplug and relax. Everything you could ever need is walking distance - great food, coffee, bars, shops etc
60579	2418658	9.0	10.0	31313178	Rebecca's place is the perfect place to stay to explore Seattle! Right in the heart of Capital Hill, her apartment is exactly as advertised; very quaint and eclectic in decor. We were told that the elevator might have issues from time to time, but we did fine on it the whole weekend. The little notes she left for us upon arrival were a lovely touch, as was the map of her neighborhood. I can't say enough good things about the location of her studio. By the end of our trip, we had a running joke that everything was just a 10 minute walk, because it was so convenient to get everywhere. We did not rent a car and did not have an issue walking all over Capital Hill, First Hill, and even to Downtown. We would definitely stay here again, Thanks Rebecca!
60580	2418658	9.0	10.0	32153460	Super cute, hip old building. Awesome location in the heart of the gentle part of Capitol Hill and an easy walk to all of the crazy busy spots. Comfortable, cozy, clean, and very welcoming place. Rebecca is awesome.
60581	2418658	9.0	10.0	32528271	Rebecca's apartment was perfect for a weekend getaway in Seattle! Easy walking or a short Lyft/Uber to many attractions, tons of restaurants/bars nearby and an adorable space that was exactly as pictured. Rebecca was even kind enough to provide coffee/cream and soap/lotion during our stay. Great place!
60582	2418658	9.0	10.0	32877892	Rebecca was super accommodating for my stay. Check in time was flexible, she left a detailed list\map of local spots and the place was so perfect! Beautiful views and adorable space. It was my boyfriend and i and it was exactly what we were looking for in our trip to Seattle!
60583	2418658	9.0	10.0	33116342	Rebecca made us feel right at home. Great location.
60584	2418658	9.0	10.0	33769391	Rebecca was AWESOME! She kept in touch when we needed her and was super fast on the reply. The home was everything the description said. We were very pleased with the place. Great views and an amazing neighborhood.
60585	2418658	9.0	10.0	34243414	I had a great experience at Rebecca's place! Great location, many restaurants/bars around, super easy to walk to downtown area. The apartment was exactly as the photos on the site and in perfect conditions. Rebecca also provided some great tips on things to do around her place.
60586	2418658	9.0	10.0	34389796	"Rebecca was there to meet us when we got in and she gave us a very complete tour of the quirky vintage apartment. Everything in this apartment is an antique, and has a very charming appearance. The apartment has a very nice view and on a hot (I know, very unusual for Seattle) day, we got a very nice breeze in the apartment. The lounge chair is SO COMFY! The apartment is furnished with quite a few interesting books which made for great reading. 

Rebecca was very knowledgeable of the area and gave us hand drawn recommendations and maps to guide us in our stay. All her recommendations turned out to be winners! "
60587	2418658	9.0	10.0	34809031	Wonderful!!!!! What a stylish place, clean and furnished beautifully, with a beautiful view and comfortable bed. Fantastic location. The building also has tons of character. Thank you for a super stay, Rebecca! 
60588	2418658	9.0	10.0	34907918	My stay at Rebecca's was a great one. I fell in love with the apartment! The location is great. Rebecca provides great tips and and a list of her top picks around town. Overall it was an amazing experience!
60589	2418658	9.0	10.0	35592527	"Let me start by saying Rebecca was a great host, kept in contact, left instructions, notes, supplies, etc. 

It should be noted however, that this unit is an a massive, very old apartment building that isn't the cleanest or best smelling place. Additionally, the unit itself was much more run down than I had anticipated. The unit had very strong cat urine scent that was very unpleasant. The lack of wifi is also frustrating, mostly my fault for overlooking that detail before booking, but come on, in 2015 it's not really acceptable to not have wifi when obviously most people will be visiting and have relatively limited resources.

While the location of this building is convenient, for the price there were certainly better options. 

"
60590	2418658	9.0	10.0	35887774	Rebecca was great, we ended up meeting in person and she totally made us feel welcome in her home. The location is really central for exploring Capitol Hill and the old building is charming.
60591	2418658	9.0	10.0	36159600	Rebecca's place is seriously as charming as it looks in pictures! Even though I wasn't able to arrive until late in the evening, Rebecca kept in touch and made sure that her husband was able to meet me, drop off keys, and welcome me into the neighborhood. She also left a great little map that highlighted spots to eat, drink, and have a cup of coffee. I was able to walk downtown easily for work and would love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!
60592	2418658	9.0	10.0	36338125	What you see in the picture is exactly what you are getting. It's beautiful, retro place I'd love to rent again next time I'm in town. The neighborhood was great, too. Lots of eateries and bars, and not too far from the ocean.
60593	2418658	9.0	10.0	36631660	Rebecca made checking in completely painless. The space was cleaned and ready ahead of schedule, and her detailed instructions on how to navigate the building made the otherwise potentially confusing (it's an older building) process simple. Her apartment is cute, clean, stocked with travel necessities, has wonderful views, and is right in the center of Cap Hill, making everything easily accessible. She even left a hand-drawn map with suggestions for local eateries/bars/shops/attractions that the local tourist board should probably just buy from her and sell as a Seattle keepsake. I'd say the only drawback was a lack of a/c, but it's on older building, the windows are large, begging to be opened, and the ceiling fan provided plenty of airflow at night, when a cooler environ really counts. All in all, great place/experience, and Rebecca herself is very friendly/accommodating.
60594	2418658	9.0	10.0	37113868	"Rebecca's apartment in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle was the perfect location for us. It was within walking distance of terrific coffee shops, bakeries, shops and downtown.
It was so nice after a full day out to come back to such a peaceful home. Rebecca's quick responses during the booking process were also much appreciated.
We would love to stay again!"
60595	2418658	9.0	10.0	37709319	Ideally located, great care and attention to detail, a deep embed experience on capitol hill, awesome host!
60596	2418658	9.0	10.0	38205210	Very fun place in a fun part of town. Rebecca had a hand written note for us when we arrived - the personal touch was nice and very appreciated. Easy to get into her place with her directions. Neighborhood was centrally located in a hip part of town and a great jumping point for a lot of awesome sights and other neighborhoods around town. Would definitely recommend her place! Thanks, Rebecca!
60597	2418658	9.0	10.0	38444631	"Rebecca left a ton of information about her neighborhood and how to get around to the rest of Seattle. Capitol Hill is a fun neighborhood that attracts a younger crowd, allowing a sense of knowing Seattle outside the touristy parts.

The walk into the heart of downtown is approximately one mile, and the return trip is mostly uphill. Skip the gym and get your workout hiking back up to this quiet building with historic charm and friendly, helpful neighbors. I feel like I got to experience the city more like a resident than a tourist, which really enhanced my enjoyment."
60598	2418658	9.0	10.0	38578415	Rebecca was great! She was easy to get ahold of, via email or text or phone call. This was my first time with Airbnb, so I had lots of questions.  She knew a lot about the neighborhood, parking and buses being my main concerns.  She asked multiple times if there was anything she could provide to make us more comfortable. I'm from a small town, so being in the middle of Seattle was so different, but really fun. Her apartment is in the best spot! So close to all Seattle's main attractions.
60599	2418658	9.0	10.0	38801662	Rebecca was wonderful to host me with short notice.  She was timely and clear with communication, and a really thoughtful hostess.  Attention to detail is not lost on her and that really made the stay wonderful.  Her welcome note with a map outlining local attractions and necessities was really great.  This apartment is fantastic, an idyllic Seattle style.  I really appreciated the location and the building, it was so close to everything I needed to do in Capitol Hill and downtown.  Parking was easy, I just parked on the street two blocks away on Belmont.  Note:  I saw the review talking about a cat pee smell after I booked, I am not a cat person and allergic so I was concerned but I did not have the same opinion...I noticed nothing of the sort.  I would absolutely stay here again. 
60600	2418658	9.0	10.0	38939276	Rebecca's apartment was delightful. We had originally booked for just a night, but ended up extending for two more nights and canceling our other accommodations because we liked the apartment so much. The location was great for exploring Seattle and the sixth floor views were swell too.
60601	2418658	9.0	10.0	39559396	Lovely place, perfect location. Rebecca is incredibly sweet. Everything about it is warm and inviting and real.
60602	2418658	9.0	10.0	39951700	Rebecca is fantastic and her place is wonderful. Clean and quaint and exactly what we needed. It is walking distance to almost everything, and we had a lovely time thanks to her recommendations. 
60603	2418658	9.0	10.0	40945258	"Despite Rebecca's apartment being right in the heart of Capitol Hill, it couldn't be more quite. 
We really loved the beautiful furniture and the view from the living room windows. 
Rebecca made it super easy for us to check in and out, and was very flexible with everything. 
The brick building is really beautiful as we. We really loved our stay and the more than perfect location of the apartment! "
60604	2418658	9.0	10.0	41929086	Nice cozy apartment with the basics. Beautiful views of Seattle from the upper floors. Host was very receiving to any questions we had and answered them in a timely manner.
60605	2418658	9.0	10.0	42146878	"The quintessential Airbnb apartment and a very courteous hostess. Rebecca was great in making the check in process seamless and was very thoughtful in how she prepared the apartment for our stay (down to a handwritten welcome note + neighborhood map!) 

The location is great. Stumbling distance (but out of earshot) from some lively bars and restaurants, and a lovely view from the apartment. 

You'll especially love it if you like firms beds.   ;)"
60606	2418658	9.0	10.0	42447578	Great neighborhood!  Rebecca was easy to contact and very responsive to my texts and emails prior to arrival. The apartment has a beautiful view over Seattle. 
60607	2418658	9.0	10.0	42618690	Lovely little place. Great location and a wonderful view. She was lovely as well. 
60608	2418658	9.0	10.0	43096632	"Rebecca's apartment was a lovely place to stay for a weekend in Seattle. Although it's on the 6th floor, the views and the breeze from the top floor are worth the trek up the stairs! Her nice sense of style shows through in the furniture pieces and apartment decor, making it feel a little more homey and special. The building is old, but everything was very clean - and it had a nice charm. Capitol Hill is a nice spot for easy access to good restaurants. 

Communicating with Rebecca is really easy, and she's a thoughtful host. She left a nice welcome note and had a few neighborhood recommendations to share with us, as well as local coffee and cream. 

The bed is a little firm and uncomfortable if you are picky about your mattress, but I did sleep fairly well with the evening breeze coming in through the window. 

Overall, a good stay! "
60609	2418658	9.0	10.0	43436798	Rebecca's apartment was really cute and very well located.
60610	2418658	9.0	10.0	43702830	Cute apartment- perfect location for getting around the city. Rebecca is super nice and very attentive! Totally recommend her place!
60611	2418658	9.0	10.0	44980569	Rebecca's place is a real gem! Clean, great location, neat old vibe. She's a great host too. She was very attentive and left great information for us about the apartment and the surrounding area. I would stay here again and recommend you do the same.
60612	2418658	9.0	10.0	45300420	We had a great time at Rebecca's apartment.  The location is conveniently near some of our favorite spots in Capitol Hill, particularly Analog coffee! Her unit doesn't have wifi, if you're anticipating getting some work done, but wasn't a problem for us. Overall, we had a great time and Rebecca was an excellent host! 
60613	2418658	9.0	10.0	45589193	Location was great. The room is as pictured. Rebecca was a great host, down to the smallest details - she left a handwritten note with recommendations and gave us access to her delicious teas (along with beer in the fridge). The kitchen table overlooks a beautiful view of Seattle. A warning for those with a car: overnight parking is a problem (as it seems to be all over Seattle).
60614	2418658	9.0	10.0	46349096	We had a very nice experience in Rebecca's home! Very clean and neat with a lot of personality. In fact, we enjoyed staying here more than at the Ace Hotel in Portland! It felt more homey and a much better value! She was very helpful with all of my questions and left a map with a lot detailed suggestions. Location was really nice, central but quite! Parking was kind of a pain as it is in most major cities. Turned out to be not a big deal as we got to see more of the neighborhood that way! 
60615	2418658	9.0	10.0	46632800	Rebecca's place is in an awesome location. We LOVED staying here. The space is very big for being a studio and it's so close to restaurants, bars, coffee shops and a short walk to downtown. We would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the hill and downtown. 
60616	2418658	9.0	10.0	47072152	Rebecca was an excellent host and her apartment was very comfortable. It was located in an ideal spot for my needs. Everything you needed was either provided for you by Rebecca or was easily obtained a short walk away. Rebecca was very responsive throughout my stay, even coming over to the apartment one night after I had locked myself out! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends. 
60617	2418658	9.0	10.0	47207961	Rebecca's apartment was perfect! Just like the pics, clean, and in a great location. Although we didn't meet Rebecca in person, she let us know she was nearby and easy to reach if we needed anything. Next time we are in Seattle we plan to stay there again!
60618	2418658	9.0	10.0	47500180	"Rebecca was a great host - she was very responsive to my inquiries and gave clear instructions on how to get in the building. I think the buzzer to the outer building was broken while I was there, but one of the tenants was kind enough to let me in. 

The apartment is as described and I had a pleasant stay. It has a great view and comfortable places to sit and read or work. Also, as others have mentioned, Rebecca left really nice notes around the apartment to guide you through the stay. I did not notice ahead of time that the apartment doesn't have wifi, and this did affect my trip (I was in Seattle for work), but the Starbucks next to the building is perfectly adequate if you are desperate.

60619	2418658	9.0	10.0	47719362	Our experience at Rebecca's in Capital Hill was great! Her apartment was tidy and was quite accommodating. Rebecca was quick to answer when I had a question. Overall, I'd highly recommend this location as it is close to many businesses, shops and near the heart of the city. We had so much within walking distance! 
60620	2418658	9.0	10.0	48213152	Rebecca's apartment is really cute, and she has lots of resources about Seattle (including a handwritten map). 
60621	2418658	9.0	10.0	49613482	Rebecca was an exceptionally kind and welcoming host. She had wonderful communication and even offered some helpful information about the city. Her home had everything I needed for my stay and a beautiful view of the city was an added bonus. I would come stay here a million times over and would definitely recommend Rebecca as a host.
60622	2418658	9.0	10.0	49955794	Rebecca's quick responses and communication were helpful since I did book last minute.  Easy come and go and I love the funky neighborhood of Capitol Hill, which is why I have stayed in that area about 7 times.  I walked to the light rail too...piece of cake...I thought it would be far but, only took about 20 minutes...about a half mile.  Nice view and an historical building that is pretty cool.  Well equipped kitchen, though I did not use it.  Starbucks right across the street and other coffee joints to enjoy close by...as well as bars and restaurants.
60623	2418658	9.0	10.0	50291906	Rebecca was the ideal host for my trip. Apartment was super spacious for a studio (especially coming from the world of Boston where studios are oftentimes just closets), and the location in Capitol Hill put me close to a number of great restaurants and bars as well as convenient bus lines into Downtown and Seattle Center. Rebecca was also very fast to respond when I had questions- overall would definitely recommend!
60624	2418658	9.0	10.0	50478046	Great little place. Great little neighborhood! Great hostess!
60625	2418658	9.0	10.0	51122530	We had a great time at Rebecca's place - fantastic location which is the key. Would recommend!
60626	2418658	9.0	10.0	51451314	"Rebecca makes you feel very welcome at her cute apartment. My girlfriend and I came for an extended weekend and would definitely come back and stay here again.

The location is fantastic. Walking distance to all sorts of fun things in Capitol Hill. But also walking distance from downtown and all the tourist bits.

Glo's across the street serves up a lovely breakfast feast."
60627	2418658	9.0	10.0	51530293	The best place to crash in Seattle for a night. Centrally located in Capitol Hill and close to lots of great stuff! Rebecca had new towels and soap ready for us and was very responsive through the stay. Wish I could have stayed longer!
60628	2418658	9.0	10.0	51705723	I loved this cute apartment in a funky neighbourhood with downtown an easy downhill walk away. The building is very charming and full of character - very European feeling. The apartment itself has a few quirks, but Rebecca was on hand to explain everything I needed to know, and was a great host. I really enjoyed listening to music on vinyl. There was no wifi but a Starbucks right across the street where I was able to do some work and send emails. The bed was lovely and firm - just how I like it. All in all a very nice stay.
60629	2418658	9.0	10.0	52222382	This is an amazing apartment in a beautiful location. Rebecca couldn't have been more available or accommodating. As previous guests have mentioned, the bed is quite firm, and my partner did have a tough time sleeping on that particular mattress (it's very nice, but very firm, which we aren't used to). Overall, I wild highly recommend this place for ease of check-in/out, location, cleanliness, host response time, and uniqueness. 
60630	2418658	9.0	10.0	52691086	My wife and I had an awesome time staying at Rebecca's. Her place has super great style and is located in an amazing part of Capitol Hill. You can walk to so many awesome parts of Seattle from her front door. She has plenty of amenities in the house that you can use to stay cozy. If we ever return to Seattle this is where we would want to stay again!
60631	2418658	9.0	10.0	53080243	This is a great space located in the heart of Capital City. There are lots of great restaurants, bars and coffee shops within short walking distance.  Rebecca as always goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable and welcome. The apartment room is clean and spacious and the apartment building itself is charming with a lot of character. This was the second time staying in Rebecca's place and it won't be the last!
60632	2418658	9.0	10.0	53331846	"There are a couple of tricks to this apartment, if they don't come intuitively to you (which they didn't to me, but maybe that's because I'm British!):

1) When opening the front door, turn the key all the way to the right, then keep turning to the right at the same time as pushing open the door.

2) To use the shower, turn on the bath tap then pull the actual end of the bath tap down to make water come out of the shower.

Other than this, the apartment is really nice and Rebecca responded quickly to our questions. The view is great, and if you're looking to stay in a neighbourhood with cool coffee and bars (rather than downtown or somewhere touristy), then this is a great choice. It's got a great feel to it, while still being a short walk to the waterfront and market etc."
60633	2418658	9.0	10.0	53477871	Rebecca's place was wonderful and communication with her was a breeze. The space was clean and just as pictured! Definitely recommend Rebecca's home as a quiet retreat for a quick Seattle trip.
60634	2418658	9.0	10.0	55270713	Rebecca’s apartment is adorable and is located in a great neighborhood!  She provided a welcome note that included a hand drawn map of the neighborhood with recommendations for restaurants, bars, coffee, shopping, and parking.  Rebecca was communicative and made sure she was available if needed.  I couldn't have wished for a better first Airbnb experience!
60635	2418658	9.0	10.0	55509293	Studio was in a good location with easy access to all one might want while staying on Cap Hill. One downside was that the studio was a 6 story walk up, since the elevators weren't working. The views were great though, which made he climb worth it. 
60636	2418658	9.0	10.0	55750610	Lovely place. I am a repeat guest, which should say it all!
60637	2418658	9.0	10.0	56638920	"Pros: 
- Listing looked exactly as it did in the picture. 
- Instructions to access the room were easy to follow. 
Great view from the window of the space needle and downtown.
- The building is right in the middle of capitol hill which has an amazing nightlife pretty much any night of the week. 
- The walk to downtown only takes about 20-25 minutes. Really nice walk!
- Appliances are vintage and fun, no microwave:)

Cons: 
- Unfortunately the elevators werent working so we got quite a bit of exercise in, having to walk to and from the 6th (top) floor. 
- No TV or WiFi for those who need their tech fix. We really didn't mind as we were out most of the day. 
- The closest light rail station is about 1 mile away. Again we don't mind walking but its something to take into consideration if you don't have transportation. 

I would definitely recommend for the value and location! Seattle is a really cool town and has a lot to do. I would just follow up to see if the elevators are back up in case you're traveling heavy or require that accessibility. "
60638	2418658	9.0	10.0	56812220	This was the perfect place to stay for a little getaway! It had everything we needed without feeling cramped or cluttered. WE loved the fact that there was no tv so that we could really just focus on where we were and what we were doing. It was so quaint and Rebecca had everything perfectly ready for us. We were beyond satisfied with our decision to stay in Rebecca's home.
60639	2418658	9.0	10.0	57000320	Rebecca and this space were both great.  Rebecca was helpful and eager to make sure we were well situated.  The space was clean, exactly as depicted, and in a great location.  Highly recommended.
61233	7821003	9.0	10.0	57547339	Great location. Clean, comfortable and well-appointed.
61558	5660792	9.0	10.0	29245741	Host was very kind and friendly. Neighborhood was very central and safe. Walkable distance to downtown. Very nice stay. Thanks!
61559	5660792	9.0	10.0	29518618	I loved my stay in Seattle! Thank you Caroline and Grace for being such great host! You guys were so helpful and helped us get around town with your tips. Their dog Mousse was the the cherry on top! So thankful for choosing them for my stay!
61560	5660792	9.0	10.0	29687453	"Caroline and Mousse (her dog) are awesome hosts! She even invited me to an event her friend was hosting.

As far as the place, the photos are spot on. Check-in was easy even though I had a really late arrival. Caroline's place is centrally-located to everything in Capitol Hill and is walking distance to downtown and elsewhere. Even though you're close to everything, her street is quiet for those of you that are light sleepers.  I should mention that Caroline's house is clean and the shower has great water pressure, which is huge."
61561	5660792	9.0	10.0	31214476	Great hospitality. Very friendly. The place is perfectly located, calm and 15 minutes of walking distance from downtown. 
61562	5660792	9.0	10.0	32352083	Our time at Caroline's place was excellent. There were no issues at all and we got great recommendations for things to do in Seattle. Highly recommended for anyone spending time in Seattle!
61563	5660792	9.0	10.0	32827412	Caroline is very welcoming and sweet. She offered anything in the house including food, and bath products. The home is so lovely (wish I could live there), clean and tidy. Mouse is such a sweetheart and probably the most disciplined dog I've ever met. The bedroom is just as shown in the photos and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It's literally in the heart of Capitol Hill. You can walk anywhere as it's a safe and hip neighborhood. There's a lot of stuff nearby and you really don't need to leave the area. I don't think I could have felt anymore comfortable staying here. I would book again if I could. Thank you Caroline!
61564	5660792	9.0	10.0	32916278	The description was accurate and Caroline was super welcoming and accommodating and friendly! Great vibe in the space. We weren't able to spend too much time in the place (just there one night) but the amazing shower and really comfortable bed were amazing to come home to! 
61565	5660792	9.0	10.0	33622503	Caroline is one of the most friendly and caring people I have met. She took the time to show me around Seattle and even let me use her paddleboard on the lake. Her place is very nice, just like the picture, has a great feel and is super comfy. I will definitely stay here again!
61566	5660792	9.0	10.0	33732773	Caroline was a great host. I was in and out in a short time but she made me feel very welcome. Her apartment is cute and her dog is adorbs.  I'd stay at her place again if in town. 
61567	5660792	9.0	10.0	34563240	Caroline's place was cozy, the bed was really comfortable- we slept so well, it really was centrally located in the heart of Capitol Hill. Everything was within walking distance. Public transportation was also really easy to use.
61568	5660792	9.0	10.0	35392383	Caroline is a great host and made us feel very welcomed on our trip to Seattle.  Her place is in a great location with access to many delicious restaurants.  Everything went very smoothly, and I highly recommend staying with her.  Plus, she has a cool dog.  Thanks again!
61569	5660792	9.0	10.0	35673588	"The apartment really is in the heart of Capitol Hill, just off the Pine/Pike strip of nightlife/bars/restaurants. It was easy to get to from the airport and was a quick walk to downtown (about a mile).

Caroline was a great host. She knew the area really well and gave some great recommendations on places to go. I would definitely stay again!"
61570	5660792	9.0	10.0	35867268	Lovely stay in a lovely neighborhood! The apartment felt very homely and Caroline was incredibly accommodating and helpful with restaurant suggestions. 
61571	5660792	9.0	10.0	36132520	I stayed at Caroline's place for two nights. The location is great! I took Uber from the west lake station (central downtown) to her place and it only cost about 6 dollars. The house was very clean and the room was lovely.  I didn't really get to meet Caroline but her roommate Grace was friendly and welcoming. Thank you for hosting! :) 
61572	5660792	9.0	10.0	36218286	Caroline was an awesome Airbnb host. Super friendly, relaxed, and able to make some great recommendations for things to see/do/eat in the area. She obviously likes meeting and hanging out with new people and even took a friend and I to Lake Washington for some sunshine and paddle boarding! Her place is comfy and funky, and her dog Mousse is a total love junkie but 100% well-behaved. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. 
61573	5660792	9.0	10.0	36307020	Caroline was extremely hospitable. Our room was clean and we were offered tons of helpful information about visiting Seattle.    The apartment was conveniently located to our destination and Mousse (the canine companion) was polite, friendly and well-behaved.  This was our first Air BNB experience and it was very positive. 
61574	5660792	9.0	10.0	36480635	Caroline was so nice and welcoming! My schedule got a little messed up and she was very flexible with check in times. She even found a spot for me to park my truck (since parking in Capitol Hill can be tricky). The room was nice, clean, and very comfortable. Plus the location was perfect. It is within walking distance of all the great spots on Capitol Hill. I would definitely come back. 
61575	5660792	9.0	10.0	36687680	"Great part of Capital Hill. Easy to get to bus stops. Caroline made it easy to get the key and check-in on my own. She was flexible with my check out time, too, because her next reservation wasn't until later in the evening on the day I left. 
I loved her roommate, Grace. We bonded over a love of blogs and food, and she gave me some recommendations for the area.
They have a dog, but it was super chill and easy. Even when I came in without Caroline or Grace, the dog never barked or even sniffed me to check me out. Since I'm not 100% comfortable with dogs, this was great."
61576	5660792	9.0	10.0	38402835	Caroline and Grace were extremely welcoming! In fact, Caroline picked me up from the Amtrak station and dropped me off at the bus stop when I left. I was unfortunately sick, but Grace made me some tea. I thought what an amazing experience they have given me. They were rock stars and would stay over there again. I liked having my own room/bed. The bed was extremely comfortable and smelled super clean! Thank you ladies for all you do to make my experience awesome.  
61577	5660792	9.0	10.0	38888565	"What could possibly make Seattle any better than it already is?  How about a killer place to stay with some awesome people, an amazing location, and to top it off an adorable puppy!  I'd say WIN, WIN, WIN!!!

Although Caroline wasn't around during our stay, she was super communicative before we arrived and throughout our stay.  Her roommate Grace was there the whole time and just an awesome host.  She was not only fun to hang with, but really helpful in giving us some things to do and places to eat.  

Now, let's chat about that puppy!  What an adorable and gentle fella.  He was there to great us every time we returned and was just the fluffiest friend ever.  

Loved the space, loved the location, loved it all!  Thanks so much!"
61578	5660792	9.0	10.0	39101353	Caroline and Grace were such lovely hosts. Their place is in a great location, and the room was tidy and spacious. Caroline was awesome at communicating... providing me a very detailed description of how to get to their place. Too bad I only stayed in Seattle for a night!
61579	5660792	9.0	10.0	39314487	I stayed with Caroline during a solo trip to Seattle in the midst of a long Pacific Northwest vacation. Caroline was very accommodating of a few changes to my schedule and always promptly responded in a welcoming way. I unfortunately didn't get much of a chance to get to know Caroline (I was only there for a short night), but I had a great time with her roommate and really enjoyed the neighborhood, apartment, and their dog Mousse. The location is excellent (safe, and I was easily able to walk down to Pike Place Market), and they were polite, friendly hosts. I would certainly stay with them again. 
61580	5660792	9.0	10.0	39471336	The place was conveniently located and comfortable. A great last minute solution for me on an unexpected work trip when the rest of the city hotels were booked out. Thanks Caroline!
61581	5660792	9.0	10.0	40299518	Great place!  Super friendly hosts! Neighbourhood full of great restaurants.  Quick communication, clean, tidy.  Felt just like staying with friends!  Highly recommend.
61582	5660792	9.0	10.0	40626755	Caroline was super easy to talk to and checked in with us prior to arrival. When we showed up, a bit late, her and her roommate were making a late dinner and offered us some food after long travels. Both her and her roommate were kind and generous.
61583	5660792	9.0	10.0	41201183	Caroline and Grace were fantastic hosts! Very friendly and easy-going! The apartment is located in a great neighborhood that's easily walkable to the downtown area. Would definitely stay with them again! 
61584	5660792	9.0	10.0	41490027	I was in Seattle traveling for business and stayed with Caroline and Grace for one night. They were excellent hosts - laid back, easy to coordinate with, helpful with suggestions for the neighborhood. The location was centrally located and a short walk from a nice park nearby. The place itself was pretty solid considering the price and location. I hope to stay again if I'm back in Seattle.
61585	5660792	9.0	10.0	41615087	This was a calm, comfortable oasis in the middle of crazy Capitol Hill nightlife scene.  As others have said Moose the dog is friendly and laid back.  Everything is accessible via walking so there is no need for a car.
61586	5660792	9.0	10.0	41770695	"Caroline and her roommate Grace were very helpful during our stay and made sure to give us clear instructions on how to arrive at their place. Additionally, although we never met either girl, they were available by phone for any questions. The place itself is in a neat neighborhood with a few restaurants and bars nearby. It was a 20 minute walk to Volunteer Park where there are amazing views of the city from the water tower. And it was not too far of a walk from the train station (although the walk was mostly uphill). 
The negative is that the place was not as tidy as I was expecting and you definitely get the feel that you are staying in somebody else's space. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean, but the bathroom was cluttered and the stairwell leading into their place smelled like animal urine. There is no air conditioning so the windows remain open and the traffic outside can be loud sometimes. "
61587	5660792	9.0	10.0	42427911	"Host was great.  Room was great.  Neighborhood was great.  Dog was great.  

If you are going to an even at the Washington Convention Center, this is a great alternative to the expensive hotels near the convention center.  It's about a 20 minute walk (all downhill) to the convention center.  "
61588	5660792	9.0	10.0	42910132	Caroline was wonderful. Very relaxed and friendly. The location is perfect. Walking distance for great bars, food, lake washington. The list goes on. Definitely recommend. 
61589	5660792	9.0	10.0	43252916	The location is great with many shops, bars, and restaurants within walking distance. A good ice cream spot and a brewery are only two blocks away! There are many bus stops close by and downtown is only a short walk away. The room is spacious and the bed is very comfortable. Caroline and her roommates (including the dog) are very friendly. Overall this is a good spot in the Capital Hill. Highly recommend it for visitors who are comfortable with walking and using public transportation. Seattle is wonderful. 
61590	5660792	9.0	10.0	44698020	Grace and Caroline were both super nice and very helpful. They gave me great tips of what to do around the city and were happy to hang when I was home (even if it was only for a few minutes)
61591	5660792	9.0	10.0	45068680	Amazing location, great people, and the sweetest dog. We had a great time staying here and would highly recommend both the Amazing hosts and the location. 
61592	5660792	9.0	10.0	45573862	I would definitely stay here again! Grace and Caroline were awesome hosts. The apartment was clean, bed was super comfortable, and there's lots of room too. You can't beat the location in Cap Hill. They're super knowledgeable about the city and had great recommendations for what to see and do. 
61593	5660792	9.0	10.0	47337405	Simply stated Caroline and Grace were excellent hosts. Very accommodating, friendly and organized. Highly recommend. 
61594	5660792	9.0	10.0	47713019	"Caroline and Mousse (her awesome, amazing, and down to earth dog) where amazing hosts. The location was perfect, excellent walking radius to all things fun. The accommodation was very cozy. Caroline was helpful on recommendations for around Seattle. I would return to her home again!

明るく人当たりの良いカロラインさんと、元気で人懐っこい犬のムーシーに囲まれて楽しく過ごす事が出来ました！ロケーションも良く、ダウンタウンやスペースニードルなどにも時間を気にせず行けます。
おすすめの宿泊場所です！"
61595	5660792	9.0	10.0	48863856	Caroline was a great host and the location is perfect if you're looking for restaurants, bars and coffee within walking distance. Noise from Capitol Hill was not a problem during our weekend stay. There are lots of buses to downtown, but we walked to most sights (it helps to stop and grab a coffee on the way!). Caroline was very friendly and able to give us lots of tips for where to eat. Mousse was very friendly, too!
61596	5660792	9.0	10.0	49966280	The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
61597	5660792	9.0	10.0	49991810	Caroline's listing is in a great location.  There are tons of food, drink and shopping options all within walking distance.  It's also within walking distance of downtown Seattle.  I walked almost everywhere I went and had no problems getting around.  Getting to and from this listing was simple, and the hosts were friendly, helpful and very responsive.  I would recommend this listing to anyone.  It's clean and cozy.  Oh, and the bed was comfy too!  
61598	5660792	9.0	10.0	53242983	Caroline's descriptions for her place are just the way it really is. The location is very accessible to downtown either by bus or on foot. The bed is just way too comfy that I'm sure you will have a very sound sleep. Caroline is very easy-going too and I would like to meet her very much and stay here if I visit Seattle again!
61723	7149703	9.0	9.0	40795978	I made a two week visit to Seattle, staying at private room - enjoyed the stay very much. The host was very hospitable and kind.  The room is spacious, clean. The toilet is decent and I felt comfortable using the other facilities of the flat as well. Neighborhood seemed safe - Downtown Seattle is within walking distance which is convenient if you use public transport. Being not sensitive to noise I would add that traffic from the motorway and proximity of the main entrance of the building can probably be something to consider if the traveler needs full silence. Altogether my experience was fairly good and I recommend the place. 
61724	7149703	9.0	9.0	40984382	"Noora was great, responded quickly to messages, really hospitable, and was fun to talk with.

The room was very spacious, bed was super comfortable, shower pressure was great. Located within walking distance of many places and easy to get to public transportation. Would definitely stay again if in the area."
61725	7149703	9.0	9.0	42354350	Noora was great about responding to messages quickly and setting up the visit was easy. When we got there Noora and her apartment were warm and inviting and made us feel very comfortable. She was great company and had fantastic recommendations about what to do in the area. The apartment was great, very comfortable bed and the location is perfect with easy access to restaurants and bars in cap hill and a quick walk to downtown. Cannot recommend staying here highly enough. 
61726	7149703	9.0	9.0	42641233	Noora was very nice and accommodating at the last minute. The room was small but the bed was comfortable, and there were quite a few bars/restaurants in close walking distance, as well as being a 25 minute walk to Pike's market and downtown area.
61727	7149703	9.0	9.0	44166319	Right in the middle of capitol hill, walking distance from shops, stores, coffee. Parking is very limited. I suggest walk or uber.
61728	7149703	9.0	9.0	44671648	Noora is lovely. The apartment is beautiful and right where you want to be in Capitol Hill. Had an awesome week. Strong recommend!
61729	7149703	9.0	9.0	44982083	Great location, walking distance to everywhere. Close to the freeway so a little noisy but we were able to sleep perfectly. Noora was a lovely host, informative and also left us to our own devices which was great. Good communication at all times before and after our stay. thanks Noora.
61730	7149703	9.0	9.0	45389975	Noora was very welcoming and made our stay have aa wonderful personal touch to it. From the coffee to the constant communication me and the friend that were staying there had a great time before going out to hike in the Olympic Mountains. Location is great and her place was clean and comfortable. Would stay again.
61731	7149703	9.0	9.0	45709624	Noora was so great! She wasn't able to meet us when we were getting in to the city, but her boyfriend let us in and was very kind. When we finally met Noora the next morning, she made us coffee (which was fantastic)! She was flexible about when we could get there and check out. The photos were accurate about what her place looked like and the bed was so comfortable! I would stay there again next time I stop in the city. 
61732	7149703	9.0	9.0	46648666	Noora makes you feel right at home. She was very friendly and fun to be around. She was very flexible with arrival and departure time.  Also provided wonderful recommendations about places to eat and visit.
61733	7149703	9.0	9.0	47820385	Noora was very welcoming an went above and beyond to insure my stay was comfortable. Her apartment is settled in a quiet neighborhood with plenty in walking distance. Despite being just a few thousand feet from I-5 I never once heard the traffic. If/when I'm in Seattle again I'd definitely try to stay here first.
61734	7149703	9.0	9.0	48315554	Great location at walking distance from several restaurants, bar and the Westlake station. Noora was very welcoming and made me really enjoy my staying. 
61735	7149703	9.0	9.0	50772366	Noora was very welcoming and super sweet; made us coffee on our arrival! The apt was just as described (super cute) and had lots of charm. The room was also quite spacious and comfortable. We had a great time in Seattle and loved our stay with Noora, who was very helpful and gave us lots of recommendations on things to do.
61736	7149703	9.0	9.0	51354621	Wonderful AirBnB experience. Noora was most welcoming and full of suggestions to visit. Many thanks for hosting me. 
61737	7149703	9.0	9.0	51489445	Cute apartment very central to where I wanted to be. Bed is very comfortable and the room is spacious for someone with lots of luggage. Noora was a very gracious host and very welcoming. My trip was brief but would definitely recommend the apartment to future guests.
61738	7149703	9.0	9.0	51811114	Noora was a great host. She was very flexible with check in and check out times, and made me feel as if it was my home. The home was cozy,  clean, and I loved the scented candles! Location in capitol hill was great and I could walk to many coffee shop's/ restraunts and very convienient to pike place market, and the Space needle. I would definately recommend Noora's place. Thank you :) 
61739	7149703	9.0	9.0	52133389	Nice apartment in a very convenient part of Seattle - a short walk to downtown, easy access to all that Capital Hill has to offer. The room is clean, comfortable and quite spacious, and the common areas are very well kept. I was there for a wedding and out most of the time so didn't get to see Noora very much, but she was extremely responsive, helpful and friendly both on messenger and in person. 
61740	7149703	9.0	9.0	53118231	Noora's place is adorable and incredibly convenient to a host of great Seattle spots. We could walk to all of the Capitol Hill bars and coffee shops, and it was a quick drive to anywhere else in the city (7 minutes to downtown, 10 to the University area). The room was comfortable, the pillows to die for, and we were made to feel incredibly welcome. Finding parking required a bit of patience, but nothing out of the ordinary for a busy part of the city. 
61741	7149703	9.0	9.0	53496533	The place was pretty conveniently located, not too far from downtown but not too close to the hustle and bustle either. Noora was very accommodating in terms of check-in and check-out times and in general was prompt, responsive, and friendly whenever we interacted. The room, though on the smaller side, was pretty cozy and actually worked out okay in terms of space for me since I didn't have too much stuff with me. Overall, it's a definite recommendation.  
61742	7149703	9.0	9.0	53793389	Noora was a very welcoming host and her spot is extremely well located. My girl and I loved staying here. So good it was that we left some flower for her in appreciation.
61743	7149703	9.0	9.0	54266260	"Noora was a great host. It's a really cozy spot in a great location! 

The apt is very minimalist but has all the essentials. Clean, fresh bed and bedding, cool lighting in the room, wifi, toiletries. 

As mentioned, the location is great! It is in the middle of Cap Hill and walking distance from many great bars and restaurants. It's even close enough to walk to downtown (~1.5 mi) which has a lot more things to do.

One potential problem you might run into: Noora's listing on the directory at the entrance doesn't actually contact her. I suggest confirming with her beforehand on your expected arrival time to ensure you aren't stranded outside... in Seattle where it rains a lot. It most likely won't be an issue since Noora is very responsive and came to get me within a couple minutes but just something to keep in mind.

Overall, it is great value and you will enjoy your stay."
61744	7149703	9.0	9.0	55269153	Although I arrived a late night, I still felt completely welcomed by Nora. She offered me a warm tea and showed me the nice view of the building. As I sort of made myself at home and she was no problem with it. I was lucky to have a great chat with her and she was so fun to talk to. The house is exactly like the description, cozy, warm and lovely. I wish I could stay there longer!
61745	7149703	9.0	9.0	56045415	Lovely apartment maintained by someone that likes good things and is incredibly easy (and interesting) to talk to. Noora helped make my first trip to Seattle so memorable that it was really difficult to board the plane back to Boston, and when I inevitably visit again, I hope Noora will allow me to stay with her once more.
61746	7149703	9.0	9.0	56522803	Noora is super super welcoming and hospitable. The place is in a really convenient  location. Would definitely stay at Capitol hill over downtown, so really hit jackpot. Taking uber from the place was super easy. The bed was comfortable and the room is very spacious. Would also recommend getting a tarot reading from Noora aswell. :) 
62360	4231670	9.0	10.0	22405577	My boyfriend and I wanted a centrally located spot for our 5 day trip to Seattle.  This pad was very relaxing, clean and comfortable.  Tons of bars and restaurants walking distance, the neighbors all seemed young and cool and were friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this spot,  very quaint and zen in a way.

62362	4231670	9.0	10.0	24303877	Emily was super sweet and flexible with check-in/out times, which was very helpful ( we didn't have to find a place to stash bags while waiting on a late flight). Her place was comfortable, hip, and *extremely* walkable. The shower was temperamental - it seemed to be too hot or too cold - and the mattress was a bit soft for my taste.
62363	4231670	9.0	10.0	24597902	Great apartment! Super spacious, very clean and easy to walk to bars and restaurants. Emily was a great host and provided us with everything we could need!
62667	458186	9.0	10.0	1376233	This was a really cozy room and the shared space is great; a huge kitchen with anything you would need and a large living room.  We had a really nice stay and enjoyed talking with Chris and the other guests.  The host is very helpful and accommodating and the location is great. 
62668	458186	9.0	10.0	6158604	Chris is an awesome host that really made us feel welcome and comfortable. We stayed in the tree room, which was very nice (had towels and everything), felt like a hotel room, but with the convenience of a house. The location was perfect, walking distance to tons of restaurants, cafes, a few museums and bus routes pretty much everywhere.
62669	458186	9.0	10.0	6310505	"We had a wonderful time with Chris at his lovely home. The location is perfect on Capitol Hill with lots of stores, restaurants, and bars to noodle around. The house itself is great. We were staying with 10 of our friends total who all it in the house extremely comfortably. There is a foosball table, and a great communcal living room where everyone can hang out. This is perfect for a large group.
The only thing about the Tree Room specifically is it's the only room in the house without a lock on it's door. Chris did offer to hold our valuables while we were out but we just ended up leaving them in one of our friends rooms who had a lock. This might be an issue for some people but for us it was not a big deal.
We had a wonderful time and will definitely be booking with Chris again!

"
62670	458186	9.0	10.0	7542443	My stay at Chris was quite short but went well. The house is perfectly located in Capitol Hill with easy access to tons of restaurants and bars. The room was clean and tidy. The shared bathroom was very clean as well. I did not meet Chris in person. Yet I got all the details by email to access the place.
62671	458186	9.0	10.0	9908370	Fantastic location. Great space. I actually stayed in the Sunshine Room because it had a desk and I was on a work trip this time. The kitchen had everything one could need to prepare a delicious meal. Great common area for lounging and TV enjoyment. Clean, Safe, and  Well Maintained. Chris is a stellar host. I will continue to support his airbnb listings. 
62672	458186	9.0	10.0	11272839	"Chris' place was nice, as confirmed by the other reviews of folks. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious. Location was great, considering it was a few doors down from restaurants, stores, bars, and bus stops to downtown and the University district. 

Chris was a VERY accommodating and friendly host. My roommate and I both felt comfortable staying at this place."
62673	458186	9.0	10.0	19256157	First Airbnb experience and it was great. Stayed here one night on a whim and had a blast. Chris was great in showing us around the place, and mentioning some bars and breakfast spots to check out.  Location is close enough to downtown but in a great area of Seattle.. The downstairs is spacious with a large kitchen and dressing room to get ready! You are sharing the space with other guests but it didn't bother us as we arrived at night. We're planning on booking at his place again in the near future!!
62674	458186	9.0	10.0	20855359	Our host Chris was very nice and helpful, and the house was fun to stay at - hot tub, full kitchen, and a makeup/dressing room - a perfect place for larger groups, like a bachelor/bachelorette trip. I really liked the location as well, right behind Broadway where there is plenty of shops/coffee/restaurants. 
62675	458186	9.0	10.0	21063173	"Bit of a rough start: door code lock was broken so we couldn't get in; toilet sprayed water everywhere; hot tub overflowed and flooded lounge and kitchen.

That said, nice place and very comfy bed. Cool dressing room area. Close to a lot of bars and restaurants nearby and around 20-30 minute wall to downtown. No lock on the bedroom door, which was fine as we were the only guests there. Hot tub was great, kitchen well stocked, free to use TV, movies, Netflix whenever.

Run more like a business than other Airbnb places we've stayed in. Chris was friendly and have us good recommendations of what to see. Not bad at all."
62676	458186	9.0	10.0	21407343	The Tree Room was super comfy and great value for a private space, with super convenient options nearby for food. Chris is always on point for making sure you're taken care of.
62677	458186	9.0	10.0	22799667	This place was perfect for our stay. The downstairs bathroom/dressing area reminded me of a day spa and the beautiful kitchen had everything you could want or need. the bed was very comfortable, and the downstairs space is well laid out for privacy. I hope to stay here again. Next time I will use the hot tub!!! 
62678	458186	9.0	10.0	25586774	This was one of the best Airbnb stays I've ever had. Great location, great accommodations, Chris was very helpful!
62679	458186	9.0	10.0	27377786	This house and Chris were both awesome! I definitely recommend staying here. It's a great location, but still off the main road, making it quiet and comfy. The room was great and has everything I needed. The house was perfect for what I needed. Easy to make food and leave left overs. Chris also was very hospitable and gave a quick turn over for a last minute room. 
62680	458186	9.0	10.0	27859528	great position! It's located in a safe and quite neighbor, and there's several fantastic cafe around. The room is big and clean. It's located at the bottom level of the house, and we are the only one at that level. Overall. We had a great trip to Seattle! 
63330	13068	9.0	10.0	2670493	"Our research group was looking for a shared accomodation during our conference in Seattle. This house was just the best way to host every individual in a comfortable way, with a balanced mix of private areas (e.g. bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.) and shared spaces (e.g. kitchen, living room,  patio, etc.). Its hillside location in a quiet neighborhood made our stay very pleasant. Meanwhile, supermarkets, bars, restaurant are only a couple of blocks away. The city centre is only 15min walk (this is the time we had to walk every day for our conference).

It was just the perfect house for us (i.e. business travelers) and it would also perfectly accomodate families and friends. The host was very responsive and answered to all of our inquiries. We had a very nice welcome during our check in (with a detailed introduction on all the house facilities!).

We wish there were houses and hosts like that in every single city of the world :)"
63331	13068	9.0	10.0	3030763	It was great to stay at Christopher's house - we all enjoyed it a lot. We were 10 people in total and it worked fine. The highlight was definitely to sit outside in the hot tub enjoying the view. Thank you so much!
63332	13068	9.0	10.0	3217309	The place was so great! I stayed here with a bunch of friends from out of town for New Years and it was everything we could have asked for. Plenty of space to sleep 10, great kitchen for cooking, and a hot tub that made for the perfect place to relax. The place is right in Capitol Hill, so there are tons of great restaurants and bars within walking distance, as well.
63333	13068	9.0	10.0	3592419	"For anyone wanting to house a small group of folks in Seattle, you should check out this house!  We had an extended family in town for a wedding weekend, and the house not only slept us all, but served as a gathering-place for other friends and families who came to town for the event.  The only issue at all involved parking locations for these ""drop-in guests,"" and we handled this issue by finding a web site which provided maps of the closest parking lots in the neighborhood and distributing this to all.  
The house itself is spacious, well-maintained, and casual.  We found it easy to handle the door code and security system, and had no problems with safety issues. We were within walking distance to any needs we had, and the freeways were quite accessible. The upstairs shower was a complete hit, as was the hot tub on the back deck. We had a couple questions during our stay, and Chris got back to me immediately and cheerfully on both of them. If I had a small group planning a Seattle trip again, I would definitely try to stay at this house."
63334	13068	9.0	10.0	3834161	My friends and I had a great time at the Oasis. There were 5 of us and we were beyond comfortable. The hot tub was a gem, the shower was incredible, and the kitchen was fabulous. Great location and perfect space for an unofficial high school reunion. We loved the community dining/lounging area.
63335	13068	9.0	10.0	4243032	"We had a great stay at the Oasis! We were a group of 7, so we definitely fit comfortably (only sharing the king bed). More people could certainly fit.

Checkout was a breeze - the owners provided a great checklist that was easy to follow. After splitting up the tasks, it only took us a few minutes to get the house ready for checkout.

Our group was attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center; the conference site was only a short walk from the house (10-15 minutes). There are lots of great cafes nearby, and plenty of great places to eat (Molly Moon's for ice cream, Tacos Chukis for great/cheap tacos). The information book provided also had many restaurant recommendations. The house also had a nicely stocked kitchen and grill if you're interested in cooking (Melrose Market nearby has a great-looking meat shop).

The hot tub was especially useful for post-conference relaxation. If you're a crossfitter interested in a workout on your trip, we checked out Foundations Crossfit (also a 10-15 minute walk) and got in a great workout!"
63336	13068	9.0	10.0	10448004	"This place is true to what it says unlike a lot of Airbnbs!

The place was spotless and very homey. The kitchen is amazing and so is the back patio. The beds were comfortable and the sheets and towels new.

Wifi was fast which was great. I was there for a charity and had 7 other people staying with me and we were very comfortable. 

This isn't mentioning the location which is just where you want to be. I was in walking distance to everything on the hill and downtown. What a treat!

Next time I am in Seattle, I will plan on staying here again.

Greatly appreciated all around."
63337	13068	9.0	10.0	10847283	"The house is amazing and the location is great too. However, the parking is very badly organized. It's at a hidden spot and no one can find it without getting direction on the phone. When we called Chris, the owner, he was very rude to us, and said that he is catching a plane and he cant' give us directions until we are around the house. The other woman Tina, and her co-worker women at Seattle were helpful, and they ensured we find the parking. Chris should be more polite to people who are giving him business. 
Additionally, the hot tub wasnt working. The water didnt get heated and we couldnt use it inspite of paying for it. We looked for directions everywhere but couldn;t bring it to work. "
63338	13068	9.0	10.0	11173089	This was a perfect place to share with 6 friends while we were in town for a conference. Walking distance to downtown, but also far enough away that we could take advantage of being in a different neighborhood and retreat. The hot tub was an especially nice bonus to come back to. Would definitely recommend for a group such as ourselves.
63339	13068	9.0	10.0	12641363	Where else can you be in a house in the heart of a city?  Nowhere!  Great place for a group that wants to hang out.
63340	13068	9.0	10.0	14013863	We had a great experience. The location is PERFECT. You can get everywhere in the city on foot or for a very cheap cab ride. The house is very charming and Chris was very responsive when we needed to contact him. I would definitely stay here again.

63343	13068	9.0	10.0	19823033	"The Oasis is a great place for anyone to stay at while in Seattle. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet and the house is just as described in the property listing, actually better and more comfortable than it seems in the photographs. This is a big house and the cleaning staff did a great job of making the place sparking clean for us. There was plenty of room for everyone and overall the facilities provided in the house were great. There was some basic food/coffee/spices and dishes to work with, which was very nice. Chris was a great host and was almost always available on phone/text. Most of our questions were answered immediately and everything was neatly put down in the handy house manual for quick reference. Chris was also kind enough to point us to a number of nearby eateries and coffee/tea shops. 

Overall, this was a fantastic experience for a lively group of grad students.  The house exceeded our expectations and I would highly recommend this property to anyone who is travelling in a small/medium group and needs a comfy, convenient place to make camp. There are several stores and restaurants nearby so that is also a big plus. We look forward to staying at the Oasis again on our next visit!"
63344	13068	9.0	10.0	22100213	"It was odd working with a company that works doesn't completely clarify that it is a separate entity from AirBnB and requires agreement to a separate contract. 

Other than that - the property was amazing and in an excellent location! The property manager was very friendly and the check-in/out process streamlined. We enjoyed our stay very much and highly recommend to other. "

And the serivce was amazing. When I arrived this this trip the hot tub hot recently been cleaning and drained. When I arrived the tub was not very warm. After sending an assistant over to take a look and still no increase in temp, they sent over a professional technician who fixed it immediately. They didn't have to go through such efforts-- on a sunday no less!-- but they did. A great house and totally worth the price."

The host cleaned the house and left the lights on for us, it was walking distance to the Convention Center and Capital Hill restaurants and pubs, the shower is amazing.  The house is fully stocked with essentials and basics for cooking.  Perfect for a group.  House rules are very well laid out and property managers were responsive and friendly.
63351	13068	9.0	10.0	31590808	We had a wonderful experience in this house. The house has enough space and nice environment. The location is very convenient, nearby space needle. Thus, it was a good decision to live here.

63354	13068	9.0	10.0	48671485	Lovely home. Tons of character. Fabulous location. Walking distance to all the sites and great nightlife.  Only comment would be it is an old home and the windows are very drafty and you can hear a lot of the outside noise. All part of the homes character. 
63355	13068	9.0	10.0	56587504	It was a nice property with all amenities.  My family did not expect such a cosy ambience.  Highly recommend it for family reunion or gathering.  Will rent this property again next time.  Except infecting- could not find a jug to boil water as our custom is we like to have a cup of chinese tea or English tea in the morning so we had to boil water in a saucepan several times a day.
63627	2898401	9.0	10.0	15072992	The apartment and the location was awesome. I came into Seattle for Pride and I was around the corner from it all in Capitol Hill. New up level building, great brand new cafe and bar right next store so I could get coffee at 6am.  Amit was a vanishing host. Didn't really meet him but for a few minutes, but I got everything  I needed from him through responsive emails. Gym in the building too, but I didn't see it. Thank you Amit for a lovely stay.
63628	2898401	9.0	10.0	16131771	Excellent host in an excellent location. The apartment was very nice.
63629	2898401	9.0	10.0	16505904	I had a great experience with the host and his home. The location was amazing--right in the heart of Capitol Hill. The apartment was clean and spacious. I would definitely stay here again! 
63630	2898401	9.0	10.0	17399147	Our stay with Amit was great. The apartment was clean, modern, spacious and conveniently located. We'd definitely consider staying here again.

63632	2898401	9.0	10.0	18736793	Seattle: I honestly didn't stay much at the apartment, but I can say it's an incredibly nice building in the perfect part of town. You can easily walk everywhere in Capitol Hill yet you're surrounded by suburbia and a park, so you've always got a quiet home base to come back to. Amit gave me exactly what I was looking for. He responded quickly and clearly and there was no hassle whatsoever. Definitely recommended.
63633	2898401	9.0	10.0	19559946	A wonderful place to stay for our first time in Seattle! The apartment is spacious and clean, and its location is fantastic with a lot of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Amit was a very accommodating host, giving us a flexible checkout time and answering our questions quickly. 
63634	2898401	9.0	10.0	20325262	Amit's place was perfect. The energy was good. No bad vibes whatsoever. Everything that you need is right outside of his door. Bars,gym,restaurants and buses. I honestly didn't do much but sleep and leave off to work or sightseeing. If I wanted to stay, there was everything that I needed in the apt. Amit was very accommodating even though he was literally going out the door to travel himself. I contacted him just 3 hours before I was to arrive and before he was to leave. He totally accommodated me... and with joy he did it. Thank you again Amit. I look forward to staying with you again in the near future!
63635	2898401	9.0	10.0	21927671	This apartment is very centrally located on Capitol Hill, only one block off Broadway. It's in a nice neighborhood, in an upscale complex with a nice gym and lounge. 
63636	2898401	9.0	10.0	22557970	Amit's place was awesome! It's located in the middle of Capitol Hill pretty close to Broadway, so everything was within walking distance. It was about 1.5 miles or less to walk down to Pike Place Market and everything else in Downtown/City Center. There's also public transport, of course. His place was really clean and in a nice (and what appears to be fairly new) building, and he went out of his way to find a place to leave his key for us since we were getting in so late! He was really easy to reach and would respond within an hour or so. Definitely would stay at his place again on my next trip to Seattle! P.S. Lots of good coffee everywhere, but definitely try Vivace...just a walk down Broadway.

We were 3, but each needed our own bed and the host's answer was to put a mattress on the floor in the den (fine) and one on the floor in the main room (pretty awful, as it obstructed the sofa and table both). So, would really only consider this apartment if you just require 2 beds. 
The host clearly lives here. Personal items (such as bathrobe, toiletries, bath sponge) were all left out- you feel as you're truely staying in someone's home. He has nice cookware and appliances. The coffee maker is nespresso so you're out of luck unless you bring in your own pods or a drip maker of your own. 
The ad said laundry was available, but we couldn't figure out where (certainly not in the apartment).
Not the best organized Airbnb rental we've had: We couldn't figure out internet, and the host replied back to my query at 11:47 PM the first night we were there (waking me) with the network name & password. We never did figure out where the trash chute was. We were given only one key (despite requesting 2 or 3) so the logistics were tough when we each went our own way. Overall the apartment met our needs ok, and the location was great."
63638	2898401	9.0	10.0	24429054	The neighborhood was great. Very centrally located to the sites and food and drink. The building had great rooftop views. The apartment was clean. Amit had Chromecast which he let us connect to which was a nice perk. 
63639	2898401	9.0	10.0	24972248	The apartment was lovely! Spotless and comfortable in a luxury building, located in the heart of Capitol Hill. The key exchange was very easy, and everything was exactly as advertized. Amit responded to any communication very promptly and was always gracious and accommodating. I'd recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Seattle. 
63640	2898401	9.0	10.0	38922044	The apartment was nice and the location was fantastic. The apartment looked clean, but it also  looked like someone had just left the apartment before I arrived. The sheets on the bed looked like they hadn't been changed...the sheets were wrinkled and looked as if someone slept in the bed the night before. The bed was also poorly made. I had to contact Amit to find clean sheets and change the bed myself! There were also used towels hanging in bathroom. Amit assured me the maid was in before me, but I'm not so sure. Amit was very easy to contact and responded quickly, so that I appreciated. I also couldn't figure out the TV, but that wasn't the biggest deal as I mostly used the apartment just to sleep. Overall, my stay wasn't bad and it was well priced, but I'm so/so if I'd stay again. 
63641	2898401	9.0	10.0	39438815	Amit's apartment was clean and welcoming.  Although the kitchen was only stocked with minimal cookware, the beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of fresh towels.  The windows next to the dining table overlook the street and provided so much light that we only turned the bathroom light on!  Location on Capitol Hill was great with cafes, shops, well known restaurants, and a grocery store within walking distance.
63642	2898401	9.0	10.0	39992827	This apartment was my first stay with airbnb. I was not disappointed and rave to everyone I know about the experience. This apartment looks as good, or better than the pictures. I was able to obtain the keys as described. The apartment is very clean and the building was new and secure. Amenities are nice, and I fell in love with the iron. Parking is a little tricky, it is in a great location so you really don't need one. There is not anything negative I can say about the apartment, the price was very reasonable, the location and furnishings felt luxury.
63643	2898401	9.0	10.0	40361327	Amit made my trip up to Seattle wonderful. The apartment is exactly as pictured. It's in a luxurious building equipped with a gym, which I didn't have time to explore among many other communal amenities. Within the apartment, there is a full kitchen, living/dining room area, washer and dryer, large bath in the master bathroom, and spacious bedroom. The apartment building itself is right in the heart of Capitol Hill, a great neighborhood for people who love good restaurants and bars. This is definitely a great find for its price.
63644	2898401	9.0	10.0	40706857	"Amit's luxurious building is very conveniently located in Capital Hill.  We took the Link from the airport to downtown Seattle ($3 each), and an Uber to the apartment ($8 total). There are so many bars, restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores surrounding this prime location. The walk down to the Pike Place Market was a pleasant 20-25 minute downhill walk (Uber back up the hill was only $8). 

The building itself has an amazing rooftop patio with stunning 360 degree views. The apartment was very clean and the bed itself was very comfortable. This house also has central AC which is rare for this area and was definitely a plus during our late July weekend stay. Thanks again Amit!"
63645	2898401	9.0	10.0	42989639	Amit has a wonderful place and made us feel super welcome. The apartment was clean, spacious, and well decorated! I currently live on Capitol Hill and this is ground zero of all the action to say the least! We had a blast and would definitely re-book with Amit for another stay at his gorgeous apartment. 
63646	2898401	9.0	10.0	46979287	Amit was a fantastic host. He was very accommodating and the location was amazing. Nearly everything was within walking distance and there was no shortage of fun activities, bars, and restaurants. We had a great time and I'd recommend this place to all of my friends without hesitation. 
63647	2898401	9.0	10.0	48814259	"The condo was great... One of the better experiences on Airbnb.

Things to Know:
1) It's in a semi luxurious apartment complex. Give it 4 stars.
2) Location, Location, Location! A+ Not only can you walk to downtown and Pike Market (about 1.2mi) but you can also walk around the neighborhood. (You've probably noticed I like to walk way too much) 
3) Miscellaneous: There is some really good restaurant in the area open late. Bring your laptop & Stream: You can also use the Host's Google TV to stream and watch movies from your computer. "
65294	3386862	9.0	10.0	16874541	Claire was a great host! She was very flexible and accommodating! We needed very random things during our stay and she was able to provide us with the items we needed when we asked! Her place is convenient  and very close to popular bars, shops, and restaurants~ I would definitely come back again for a stay next time I'm in Seattle!
65295	3386862	9.0	10.0	17473361	"claire's apartment was perfect for us.  we were in seattle with our 22 month old daughter and needed a one bedroom with a kitchen (anyone with kids knows that you can't function in the same room when the littles are sleeping, you need a separate room for them to nap/sleep so you can do your own thing), which in hotel terms is very expensive.  

PROS:
-location location location.  spend more on being in the heart of things, especially if you have kids that nap.  you won't waste time traveling.  plus this apartment is a 10min walk to volunteer park, which has a great splash pool + playground. public transportation (the bus stops in front of the apartment), cafes, restaurants, ice cream, grocery store, yoga, pilates... it's all right there.
-fully functioning kitchen with dish soap, dish rags, ice cubes, coffee maker, etc.
-fast wifi.
-uncluttered apartment.
-apartment gets great light, has nice views of plants/trees, and with open windows you get a crosswind.
-1 bedroom (which means you have a separate space from the sleeping quarters).
-includes shampoo, body wash, towels.  the little things make a huge difference.
-easy check in/out.  claire was accommodating and met us to give us the key, when checking out we just left the key in the apartment.
-claire is so sweet.  i don't expect her to do this with everyone, but she refunded us a night (we had airline problems and didn't arrive until the next day), and had coffee stocked in the apartment.  she was so smiley when we met, she's the kind of person you'd want to be friends with.

CONS:
-could be cleaner (this is actually not a con for us, but i could see others being bothered).  dust mites in the corners.
-the shower head is like a garden hose. totally not a deal breaker for us, but again, for others i could see this as annoying.
-the building is older, so sound travels.  we travel with a sound machine app so it was not a problem but without the white noise to block it out, it could be a little loud with neighbors and traffic.

things to keep in mind:
-no tv. we don't watch tv and travel with our iPad so this didn't bother us at all, others might miss it.
-no laundry on site. something to keep in mind. claire did generously offer laundry services but we didn't need it.
-if you are traveling with kids, keep in mind that there is only one queen bed. the bedroom is not large, but it could fit an air mattress on the floor for your littles if need be.

honestly i have to stretch for the cons, as for us personally they were non issues.  we had a lovely stay and would stay here again without a blink.  thank you claire!

65296	3386862	9.0	10.0	18079058	Claire has a charming apartment and she is a lovely host. Would highly recommend! 
65297	3386862	9.0	10.0	18431957	Claire was a great host -- very easy to communicate with and accommodating. The apartment was just what we were looking for -- A spacious one bedroom, centrally located. It was a great place from which to enjoy Seattle!
65298	3386862	9.0	10.0	19275779	Claire was super communicative and welcoming and waited for us at the house. She explained how stuff in the house works and gave us some great recommendations for nightlife. The house is absolutely perfectly located and we were able to walk to coffee shops, bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. We would definitely stay there again!
65299	3386862	9.0	10.0	19708453	"This 1 bedroom is in an older building in a great location of Capitol Hill. Coffee is a quick walk away. A few more blocks and you are in the heart of a vibrant area. With the age comes beautiful windows, hardwood floors and unique design features. There are also loud doors and floors but the neighbors seemed to be relatively quiet and respectful.

Be aware that if staying on a busy weekend you might have difficulty finding parking. 

Also, as others have noted, the showerhead will pound your face like Niagara Falls.

I really enjoyed my stay here. Claire was clear with instructions and was nearby if we needed anything. I appreciated her attentiveness and post-it notes."
65300	3386862	9.0	10.0	19859271	Claire was very helpful and prompt in responding to our request. When we arrived, she was extremely welcoming and friendly! She made herself available in case of any emergency (but that wasn't necessary because everything went smoothly!) The neighborhood was very close to many eateries and grocery stories. The listing says that there is ample parking but it's extremely to hard to find parking because the entire neighborhood also parks on the streets.
65301	3386862	9.0	10.0	19885129	Claire was a very friendly and welcoming host. Her apartment is very well located in Capitol Hill. The place was very clean with minimal furnishing, bed was very comfortable and wifi worked without trouble. Highly recommended. 
65302	3386862	9.0	10.0	20025805	The apartment is in a great location—plenty of hip bars and restaurants to check out within a few minutes. It also offered everything we needed and was an accurate reflection of the pictures and description online. Claire was fantastic with responding to texts and emails. The whole process was very smooth. All in all, we had a wonderful time in Seattle!
65303	3386862	9.0	10.0	20097022	Claire was a delight! She is super sweet and responds quickly. Her apartment is spacious, very clean, quiet and in a great little area of town. It's walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, bars, etc. The wifi works great too! She even recommended a few places in town for us to drink delicious beer and get some food. The parking is street parking but we didn't have any trouble finding a nearby spot on a Sunday night. Check in and check out was a breeze. I'd definitely recommend Claire as a host! Thanks again! 
65304	3386862	9.0	10.0	20918598	"The three of us had a great stay at Claire's apartment. Claire responded quickly to any questions, and she recommended some great restaurants to check out. The neighborhood, Capitol Hill, was absolutely perfect, and a lot of the best places to eat (and drink coffee!) were located within a 10 minute walk. It also felt very safe, and was very quiet. There's a bus (#49) which is a 3 minute walk from the apartment that goes straight to downtown, too.
The apartment itself was very comfortable. It was clean, with lots of light and room. There is one bedroom, so if there are three of you, there's a couch to sleep on (you have to bring your own bedding though). We didn't use the kitchen to cook, but all the usual amenities were provided. There isn't a tv, but that wasn't an issue for us, and the wi-fi worked great.
All in all, Claire's apartment is the best place to explore Seattle from, and I'd highly recommend staying here! "
65305	3386862	9.0	10.0	21011393	Claire and her place helped us to have an amazing time in Seattle. It's located in a charming, safe, and fun neighborhood with plenty to explore and do with walking distance, and a short taxi to downtown and other land marks. The apartment had all the essentials and was very comfortable. Claire provided great tips about her favorite places and activities nearby, and always responded quickly whenever we contacted her. We will be back to Seattle and when do we hope to stay here again.
65306	3386862	9.0	10.0	21106751	Claire was very nice, and the listing was accurate. 
65307	3386862	9.0	10.0	21298478	"Claire was very responsive to my emails and was able to push back my check-in time, when I was running late.
The unit was spacious and in a quiet neighborhood, only a few blocks from Volunteer Park, and some restaurant/coffee shop options.  The location was also good for going to downtown Seattle, as the #49 bus stop was only a few blocks away.
The bathroom was a little cramped, with no counter space, but easily managed with some planning.  
The unit is listed as being able to accomodate 3 people, one bedroom and a large couch.  Claire provided 3 sets of towels, but the couch sleeper should bring their own sheets, pillows and blankets, only linens for the bedroom are included.
Overall, this was a good value in a convenient location."
65308	3386862	9.0	10.0	21558570	Claire's place was in a fantastic location. It was super clean and tidy but you could still see her cool personal style in the home. Communication for me is key and Claire was very fast to respond to any questions. Thanks, it was perfect for what we needed. 
65309	3386862	9.0	10.0	21671908	Great place to rest your head after a long day of running around the city. Perfect location in the best neighborhood in Seattle. 
65310	3386862	9.0	10.0	22118644	Clair was very easy to communicate with; we had to reschedule our arrival time and she was very accommodating and responsive.  The apartment is a full 1 bedroom, 1 bath, and is well laid out in a great neighborhood and was exactly as advertised.  It is just a tad spartan, but really had everything we needed.
65311	3386862	9.0	10.0	22439129	Claire was helpful and her place was lovely. I'll be back for sure.
65312	3386862	9.0	10.0	22536041	Claire was a responsive host and easy to communicate with. The apartment is clean and in a great location in Capitol Hill -- close to numerous coffee shops, restaurants, and Volunteer Park. 
65313	3386862	9.0	10.0	22697459	Claire welcomed us upon arrival gave a good overview of the place and there area. Located in the trendy area of capital hill. Close to everything in capital hill and a close ride to downtown Seattle. 
65314	3386862	9.0	10.0	22861761	Claire was great at making arrangements for my arrival.  The apartment's location is hard to beat.  A block away from shops and restaurants and yet on the nicer end of Capitol HIll.
65315	3386862	9.0	10.0	23387853	We enjoyed Claire's place. It was warm and exactly the refuge we needed on a cold, rainy day. Claire was very accommodating and even loaned us her umbrella. The location is great and there is a bus stop right across the street. Overall a great experience!
65316	3386862	9.0	10.0	23494199	This apartment was well located and Claire was very nice and helpful.
65317	3386862	9.0	10.0	23761043	Claire's listing was a great, charming and comfortable spot. It's conveniently located in Capitol Hill is a great walkable location lose to all that The Hill has to offer. Claire couldn't have been more helpful in coordinating our arrival or more accommodating as a host. Looking forward to staying there again in the future.
65318	3386862	9.0	10.0	24061971	Apartment was exactly as described in the posting. Claire was really easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Perfect location for exploring Capital hill and downtown 
65319	3386862	9.0	10.0	24096814	Claire is an amazing host and the space is equally stellar!  Highly recommended. 
65320	3386862	9.0	10.0	24159134	Great place, lovely neighbourhood, super host. My friends and I had a fantastic time staying here. Thanks Claire :)
65321	3386862	9.0	10.0	24437673	Claire was a superb host! Very understanding and sweet despite my late arrival (and my poor communication as I was coming from outside the country and didn't have immediately cell phone service). She made sure to even restock the paper towels at the apartment for me and left them on the back door so as not to disturb me. The place is great, maybe even more spacious and comfortable than I imagined.  Everything was more than adequate for my 6 day stay, and I'm sure anybody with shorter or longer stays will be pleased too. Note: The whole building is extremely quiet so squeaky doors and bed made me feel a little criminal moving about but I really enjoyed my stay, parking was not a problem, restaurants and other are walkable distance and I think Claire has pretty cool taste. 
65322	3386862	9.0	10.0	24628741	Claire's place is a perfect place to unwind from jet lag and long travels - it's very quiet and cozy, yet close to dining, cafes, and grocery. One of the few remaining authentic independent coffeehouses in Capitol Hill, Joe Bar, is located just one block away. Another plus is her flat is just a few blocks from Volunteer Park, one of Seattles best urban parks featuring the Seattle Asian Art Museum, a gorgeous glass conservatory, and some of the best trees. Next to the park is a graveyard where you can visit the burial of Bruce Lee.  The bed is very comfortable and the space is very tastefully and artfully done - minimal yet with character. Though we didn't meet Claire, she was very prompt with all communications, allowing for the overall experience to flow stress free. I'll definitely be booking this space in the future. Many thanks, Claire! 
65323	3386862	9.0	10.0	24840221	"- easy to communicate 
- very accommodating and thoughtful
- great location and great apartment"
65324	3386862	9.0	10.0	25139845	Location was absolutely perfect and just a short walk down the road to everything fun. Decent cafe on the corner. Place was comfortable and stylish without feeling cramped. 
65325	3386862	9.0	10.0	25443571	Clairemont was great! Easy to work with and she made my trip a joy. 
65326	3386862	9.0	10.0	25657768	This apartment is cute, old-style & uncluttered. The location is lovely & convenient to many cool areas. I would recommend it highly for these attributes. However it is very basic - no microwave, toaster or kettle; no extra blankets, no place at all to unpack a suitcase. And we were caught by the 2-prong powerpoints (we had brought USA 3-prong) which was a problem for charging our many devices. 
65327	3386862	9.0	10.0	25752617	Had such an awesome time! Such a great location and Claire was so easy to contact and get a hold of. If I'm ever back up in Seattle it's the one place I would be looking forward to staying :) 
65328	3386862	9.0	10.0	26311537	"Host:
Claire made it very easy to stay in her apartment. We arrived pretty late at night, and we were easily able to communicate with her on the day of arrival to figure out where to get the keys, etc. We never actually met face to face, but it was easy to communicate via text.

Apartment:
There are great post-its around the apartment to help answer FAQs. The apartment itself is larger than it looks in the photos. It was quite clean, although the building itself is a bit older, so not everything is sparkly clean. One downside is that the heating elements cannot be adjusted; instead you have to open and close the windows (which have no screens) to adjust the temperature. When we were there the heat was turned up pretty high, so if we didn't open the windows, it would've been way too hot. It worked okay for us, but something to note. We didn't end up using the kitchen, but it looked like the basics were there, although the space is quite small.

Amenities:
Wi-fi worked well. Be sure to bring your own shampoo and other toiletries etc. There is a coffee pot, but you'll have to provide your own coffee.

Location:
Great! A short 2-3 minute walk to the north end of Broadway in Capitol Hill. Lots of delicious restaurants, coffee shops and bars in the area. A slightly longer walk to 15th ave, which has more eateries."
65329	3386862	9.0	10.0	26425520	Claire was an amazing host as she was very responsive to all my questions at any time of the day.  The location of the listing was already super convenient as it was really close to markets and coffee shops.  However, the heater was turned on a bit too high for my liking (caused the air to feel dry and stuffy) and we had to regulate temperature by opening windows.  I'm sure Claire probably would have fixed it for me had I asked, but I didn't want to bother her.  The walls and ceilings were also kind of thin so we could hear people coming through the front door of the complex but I was able to sleep through it.  Definitely understand that this is an older apartment before going into it and you should be fine.  
65330	3386862	9.0	10.0	26601648	Claire was super accommodating and extremely easy to get a hold of. From the moment we arrived to when we left, she was always available to help us out whenever needed. Getting in contact with her was no problem. The place itself was perfect, very cozy and very quiet. Couldn't have slept better. The area, right in Capitol Hill, was awesome - lots of great and lively places for nightlife and tons of good food. We rented a car, and street parking was no problem at all. I would definitely stay again when I come back to Seattle. Thanks a bunch again, Claire!!!
65331	3386862	9.0	10.0	26757219	Great space for a great price. Claire was super easy to work with. Fantastic location!
65332	3386862	9.0	10.0	27018172	"Claire was a wonderful host for 3 days. She was extremely patient with my newness to the whole AirBnB process. She went through the trouble of buying an ironing board for the apartment just because I said I had an interview. The place itself was great. A block away from my favorite coffee shop, about half a mile from some of the more mild bars in Cap Hill and probably about a mile to the main scene.

Everything came as advertised. The living room was great to hang out in or do a little bit of work. Claire also kept the place nice and warm as it was mid winter (although a very mild winter). I plan on coming back to Seattle in about two months and will definitely look to stay here again."
65333	3386862	9.0	10.0	27227785	Claire was cool. The place is in a very good walking area. Couch and bed where comfortable. Plenty of street parking.
65334	3386862	9.0	10.0	27851280	I didn't get a chance to actually meet Claire in person, but everything about my stay was great. Claire was very flexible regarding my booking and very helpful in making sure I had everything I need. The space itself was great, and the location is amazing - very conveniently located and in a beautiful neighbourhood. I would definitely stay here again.
65335	3386862	9.0	10.0	28176951	Great little apartment in a great location. Has all the basics for a short stay in Seattle. Although we didn't meet Claire, she was easy to stay in contact with, and promptly replied. Claire also left us a fresh bag of local coffee, which was a nice touch. 
65336	3386862	9.0	10.0	28880957	"This space was perfect for us! Easy to find, although parking was a little bit of a challenge at times. It's a minimalist type space, so if you're looking for bells and whistles this isn't the place for you (although you'll certainly have everything you need). It was perfect for us as we are more interested in exploring the city than the extra amenities.  Claire was very welcoming and gave us a thorough walkthrough of the apartment. She was very reachable and easy to communicate with the whole trip.  

We had access to a full kitchen which was nice, although we didn't end up making anything but sandwiches due to the wonderful restaurant options around! The bed is very comfortable, although it is on wheels which we were not expecting, so it slides around a bit when you sit down. There is excellent Wi-Fi, and a large flat screen TV in the living room. We brought our laptop and cables and were easily able to hook up our computer to watch Netflix on our downtime.

The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful, with lots of trees and flowers everywhere. It is very walkable and has kind of a small town feel. Everyone we met was extremely friendly and kind. It's a short walk to restaurants, a couple of bars, and the biggest grocery store I've ever been in. It's also a short drive to pretty much anywhere in Seattle. It's very centrally located and is perfect for getting around the whole city.

I would definitely recommend this space!"
65337	3386862	9.0	10.0	29144832	A lovely one night stay, apartment as advertised. Great location. Claire was super helpful in her contact and left notes with instructions around the apartment where needed, the finishing touch was a couple of cold beers appreciatively left for us in the fridge. A great start to our Seattle stay. 
65338	3386862	9.0	10.0	29756901	We had such a great stay. The place was nice, Claire brought us toilet paper and paper towels part way through our stay when they were running low. There was some unexpected maintenance on the building while we were there, but Claire communicated with us best she could and even left us an apology present! We couldn't have been in a more perfect location.
65339	3386862	9.0	10.0	30003851	We had a very relaxing night at Claire's lovely place - it looked just like  the pictures, was very clean, warm and spacious and in a safe and great neighborhood.

Great location, within walking distance to all the great places to eat and drink! I loved the neighborhood! We had a car and was worried there might not be any parking spots but we were able to street park all nights we were there within a 2 min walking distance. The place was very clean and Claire was very helpful with everything!!! Thank you Claire! And come visit when you are in Hawaii :)

65343	3386862	9.0	10.0	33714144	"Claire was very helpful and welcoming and then completely discreet and left us to enjoy the place in complete privacy. The neighborhood is very nice, north end of Capitol Hill so it's an easy walk to everything but the street itself is quiet and just outside of all the madness. Parking was ok; one night I did have to park in a ""four hour"" zone but I never got a ticket (not to say that's a general rule - I have no idea). The apartment is comfortable and well decorated. The kitchen has all the basics including a french press (though a sauté pan is missing).  Overall a very positive experience. "
65344	3386862	9.0	10.0	34139293	Although I didn't meet Claire in person, she seemed very nice and accommodating. The apartment was in a great location and was exactly as described. I would definitely stay with Claire again if I were ever in the Seattle area.
65345	3386862	9.0	10.0	34541887	The location was great. Walking distance to some great restaurants and bars. Witness was a excellent restaurant with great service. Also going downtown or to Pike and Pine street was a $10-$15 Lyft ride. There is no microwave so just keep that in mind if you bring back food to eat later. Although I never met Claire she was quick to reply when I contacted her for any questions and issues that I had. 
65346	3386862	9.0	10.0	35217386	Claire was a great host; she helped me to feel at home immediately. Her apartment was clean and comfortable, wIth everything I needed! 
65347	3386862	9.0	10.0	35557878	"I don't think we could say enough about this space to really capture how lucky we got! This was THE perfect location. My husband and I spent 5 days here and were able to walk everywhere. I think the only day we used our car was when we drove to Canada for the day. There is an incredible selection of restaurants, bars, shopping, people watching, late night sidewalk cafes, and an incredible grocery store, all within a 2 block walk from the apartment. Not to mention the adorable street it's located on (little neighborhood bookstore, tiny cinema, and two different coffee houses). We walked to Pike's Place in about 20 minutes, and it only took about 15 to get to Volunteer park, the Arboretum, and the Lakeview Cemetery (you know, where Bruce and Brandon Lee are buried). The space was clean, large, and has all the necessary amenities -- even an iron & ironing board!
"
65348	3386862	9.0	10.0	35928912	"The apartment itself was great - a TV that I could hook up to my MacBook, clean kitchen/bathroom with well-stocked supplies and amenities, close to many different bus lines, and an extremely comfortable bed that was perfect after a full day of walking.

Aside from that, Claire was what made this stay awesome.  She went out of her way to make sure we had a smooth check-in/check-out, and made herself available throughout the trip for any questions or problems we might have had.  I'd book again in a heartbeat!"
65349	3386862	9.0	10.0	36399749	Loved Claire's place and had a fantastic stay. The location in Capitol Hill area was perfect, right next to amazing restaurants and bars. Could easily get the bus or walk into downtown area. The flat was clean and spacious, just as it shows in the pictures, and had amazingly fast WiFi! Claire was really helpful with personal suggestions/recommendations in the area and made check in / out really hassle free. Thanks for a great time in Seattle!
65350	3386862	9.0	10.0	37854391	Awesome place to stay; clean and quiet. Claire was welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. Great location as well, many restaurants and bars nearby. Downtown is also really close (10 min by bus or 20 min by foot). Would definitely book with her again!
65351	3386862	9.0	10.0	38181049	The neighborhood was great and the apartment was a perfect resting spot during our Seattle adventures. 
65352	3386862	9.0	10.0	39048865	Claire's place in Capitol Hill was perfect. Walking distance from some great restaurants and the bar scene Capitol Hill is known for. Claire was great with communication while checking in, and made sure we had everything we needed for the duration of our stay. Kitchen and bathroom were clean and couldn't ask for a more well prepared place. We had a minor issue with the front door lock being stubborn, but Claire was prompt to get us a new set of keys which solved everything! I'll definitely look up Claire again if I plan on staying in Capitol Hill again.
65353	3386862	9.0	10.0	40121428	"Claire was a wonderful host! She communicated with me promptly and in such a friendly manner that I felt welcomed even before our trip began. The space itself is lovely; it's in such a vibrant and convenient location. It's kept spotlessly clean, it's airy, with lots of natural light, and has everything you need for both a short-term and long-term stay. Between Claire and the apartment, we didn't want to leave. I would definitely stay at this property again! Thank you, Claire!
"
65354	3386862	9.0	10.0	40480929	"Claire was a very accommodating host, allowing us to check our bags in earlier than the check in time, head out for the day and then come back once the room was ready. She was available via text for the length of our stay.

The apartment is in a beautiful tree lined street area within the very trendy Capitol Hill. The apartment is basic but fulfils the needs of a short stay. There is a bus stop near by which takes you downtown however the half hour walk was our choice of transport for our stay!

Arriving from the airport is simple: a $3 light rail takes you downtown and then its a quick $12 cab ride to Capitol Hill.
"
65355	3386862	9.0	10.0	41124136	Claire called and welcomed us to her place. 
65356	3386862	9.0	10.0	41645847	Although I did not meet Claire we talked over the phone and she walked me through the checking in process. She was very pleasant and her apartment was exactly as advertised. The apartment is a bit on the older side but perfectly sized. We didn't stay in the apt much since we wanted to explore the city, but would be nice to have a DVD player to watch a movie if you wanted to stay in. The neighborhood is awesome perfect for public transit (there's a bus stop about 1 block from apt.) that will take you downtown/pikes place. There are lots of bars, restaurants, coffee, etc. Had a great time exploring the city!
65357	3386862	9.0	10.0	41997685	Claire was very accommodating and communicative the entire weekend. She made it easy to get into her place and although it wasn't walking distance to the main area of Capitol Hill it was in a cute neighborhood and very peaceful. 
65358	3386862	9.0	10.0	42560131	"Claire was very accommodating with our arrival and was quick to communicate anything we needed. She sent out some great recommendations prior to our arrival as well. 

The place is a nice size and is in a perfect area for a Seattle stay. You can easily walk anywhere you need, even the ball park if you are the waking sort. I would suggest looking into who is performing at the Paramount Theatre as your stay approaches.

The place was clean and was easy to find. As some other guests mentioned, it is a bit dated, so just be aware that certain features are not as modern as some may be used to. 

We eventually found that the street to the South west? (on Broadway behind the apartment) had free all day parking. I would suggest just parking there and leaving it for the stay, unless you're visiting the outlet malls which are a 45 min drive north, which if you're coming from Van, I would recommend visiting on your way down. 

Overall it was a great stay. The price for the location cannot be beat. "
65359	3386862	9.0	10.0	43389732	Claire's apartment is great! We loved it. Great location in Capitol Hill, near shops, restaurants and transportation. Claire is easy to communicate with and friendly!!Wish we could have stayed longer!
65360	3386862	9.0	10.0	43647495	An old charming apartment. Perfect location. The neighbourhood is absolutely beautiful. Claire is very nice host.
65361	3386862	9.0	10.0	44550124	Claire was a very nice and accommodating host. The place was in a very convenient and beautiful spot in Capitol Hill- walking distance to some great restaurants, coffee shops and bars. The nightlife was not too hoppin (during the week at least) in the area, but there were several bus stops nearby to be able to explore different parts of the city. The place was very clean, comfy, and spacious. I would definitely recommend this spot!
65362	3386862	9.0	10.0	44746162	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
65363	3386862	9.0	10.0	45106235	It was our first time visiting the city and we chose Claire's place because it was economical and in a good location! Our stay started out with a small set-back since the key broke off in the lock and had to be re-keyed the day we were coming in. Claire was very helpful in getting the situation taken care of and keeping us up to date during the re-keying process! The apartment has all the basics and is in a great location. Its a quiet, safe, and walkable neighborhood. We especially enjoyed walking to all the shops and restaurants around. Overall, it was a good spot for a few nights in the city! 
65364	3386862	9.0	10.0	45696033	The apartment was clean and the photos shown were accurate.  We loved the location.  The bed was very comfortable.  
65365	3386862	9.0	10.0	46931570	Excellent location if you enjoy the hip vibe of urban living. One block walk to great bars and restaurants and easy access to public transportation that make the whole city a short ride away.
65366	3386862	9.0	10.0	47174596	Claire made everything easy and was very welcoming. Her apt was immaculate, and the location is great. Easy walking to great coffee, buses to downtown, the heart of Capitol Hill, etc.
65367	3386862	9.0	10.0	47737859	The apartment was really nice and cozy. Enjoyed the stay there, everything was well explained and convenient. Thanks!
65368	3386862	9.0	10.0	48199617	"Claire was extremely helpful and clarified any questions that we sent her. She was also really thoughtful - she left an umbrella for us to use just in case! The space itself is spacious indeed and a major plus is that Claire has a water filter in the fridge (not that we used it though because we had already bought water ahead of time). The bed is also comfy!

A close spot to major bus stops that take you to downtown, Pike's Place, International District, and Pioneer Square! It's also right around the corner from a street with lots of late night eateries and coffee shops. "
65369	3386862	9.0	10.0	48415267	This place is great! Everything was clean, the bed was comfy, and the shower was hot. It's within walking distance of tons of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops, and it was very easy to get downtown. It felt like a home away from home - a great way to test drive city living in Seattle!
65370	3386862	9.0	10.0	48720090	My stay at Claire's was a great way to experience Seattle and Capitol Hill. Her place was very cozy and comfortable. She was easy to communicate with and the entire process was streamlined. The location is perfect for anyone looking to checkout the downtown area or Capitol Hill. Great places to eat within walking distance, and very fun nightlife. My only difficulty during my stay was the parking, since I rented a car. If there was no parking on Broadway St. the other parking was 4 hour parking only. Other than that I would recommend Claire's place to everyone. 
66249	7934963	9.0	10.0	49148626	"I stayed with Farah and Ben for almost a month— and it was a great experience!
They are both easygoing people who will chat with you if you want, or just let you do your own thing if that’s what you’re feeling. They always checked in with me to see how I was doing, and if I needed anything. I had space to store food in the kitchen, was able to use to w/d, and had a little spot in the bathroom for my things there. The location is also very conveniently near a bus stop that takes you to downtown, and the neighborhood itself is nice and quiet. Lots of street parking, and I felt very safe the entire time I stayed there. Overall, I would say a long stay with them would feel very much just like staying in your own house— very convenient, very easy. 
Would definitely stay with them again!"
66250	7934963	9.0	10.0	49512452	The house and room were clean and nice. Farrah and her boyfriend were friendly. Would definitely recommend.
66251	7934963	9.0	10.0	50105565	Farah made us feel very welcome in her home. She was excellent at communication and tips and the room was just as described. The neighborhood is safe and she is near an excellent grocery store, coffee shops and bus stop. We were in town to do a class and so had to leave early each morning. As mentioned, this listing has a shared bathroom but at the time of our stay there were 5 of us trying to get ready in one bathroom all at the same time to all leave by 7am. I guess we just assumed it would be us and her using it only.Farah did her best to schedule the times that each person could use the bathroom. I would take into consideration your trip and daily bathroom time use when booking this listing. With that said, you cant beat the price and value for the seattle area.
66252	7934963	9.0	10.0	50367910	Farah was a great host.  She provided little touches that made one feel welcome such as a night light in the living room, and a towel for your stay.  She was very prompt to reply during the reservation process.  Her home provided all that was needed for a short stay.   
66253	7934963	9.0	10.0	50608166	The house was awesome, everything was as described, the bed was very comfortable. Farah was super helpful and communicative!
66254	7934963	9.0	10.0	50908355	Farah was a great host. She welcomed us after normal check in hours because we could not make it early in the day. The room was as pictured, she provided towels for us and the room was clean. 
66255	7934963	9.0	10.0	51083272	"Farah was very accommodating for us. We needed to stop by a little earlier than the listed check in time, and she was more than happy to figure out a time that worked for both us and her. The location was incredibly nice! Ballard is such a cute area, and we were in good walking distance from a lot of different businesses and cute shops.
"
66256	7934963	9.0	10.0	51330898	Farah was very accommodating and understanding. We fell in love with the place! The outside of the house is a cute baby blue color and it was absolutely adorable! Prior to our stay, Farah reached out to us and made sure she had all of our toiletries available to ensure our Airbnb was perfect. The house was clean and very homey! 10/10 would recommend :)
66257	7934963	9.0	10.0	52284544	"Wonderful experience for my first Airbnb! The space is clean and somewhat minimalist tho' comfy/cozy, which was perfect for this trip!  A lovely neighborhood with restaurants etc within easy walking distance. Ben and Farah are personable and engaging, offered great suggestions for restaurants, tho' provided privacy and non-intrusion also as needed.
The only bathroom is a shared one with the hosts, but it really wasn't a problem as only slight scheduling communications took care of it.
I will return here again when in the area, and would recommend this space to friends who might travel there as well.
Thanks for a great first experience!"
66258	7934963	9.0	10.0	52811074	Fatah was great, room was just as described and the location was very nice. Would recommend to anyone who needs a quick place to stay.
66259	7934963	9.0	10.0	53288901	The house was in a very quiet Ballard neighborhood. The listing was exactly as I found it. Farah was a very welcoming, friendly and pleasant hostess.
66260	7934963	9.0	10.0	53428793	Farah was more than welcoming. She made us feel right at home. The bedroom was large and quiet. There was plenty of free street parking and downtown was only a seven minute drive away.
66261	7934963	9.0	10.0	53726144	"
We had a great stay at Ballard Bliss. Farah was always fast to respond and the place looks just like the pictures. It is basic and clean. 
 The neighborhood was nice and quiet. It is walking distance to grocery store and many restaurants and stores.
We would recommend Farah's place to anyone who needs a basic place to stay close to Seattle.

"
66262	7934963	9.0	10.0	53796206	The stay here was very comfortable. Farah was accommodating with our arrival time and welcomed us when we got there. We were pretty exhausted after a day of driving and exploring Seattle so we went into our room and slept pretty quickly. It was only 8:30 or so when we decided to go to bed, but the house was very silent even though it was so early, so we really appreciated that! I would recommend this house to anyone who comes to Seattle! Thanks, Farah!
66263	7934963	9.0	10.0	53867186	We had a wonderful & comfortable stay at Farah's. The neighborhood was literally few blocks from the market area (restaurants, stores, coffee shops, bars) yet it was so quiet. It was great to share travel stories with Farah :-) 
66264	7934963	9.0	10.0	54004552	My trip up to Ballard and staying with Farah was very pleasant.  I met her when I arrived and they showed me everything that I asked for. I forgot a towel and she supplied me one.   I did not arrive until the evening  and went to bed early and woke up early, so I did not have much contact with them. The neighborhood is a very quite.  I slept very well.  I will stay here again when I come back for another workshop.  
66265	7934963	9.0	10.0	54217135	Great room and welcoming host! The house was very clean and quiet. Ballard is a really cool neighborhood to stay in - close to the center of Seattle but with street parking and cool shops/restaurants to explore. Thanks Farah!
66266	7934963	9.0	10.0	57109210	I had an comfortable but short stay at Farah's place, and enjoyed talking with Farah and Ben.
68972	670056	9.0	9.0	2469960	me and my friends really enjoyed our stay at your house. the house was clean and felt very homely. the room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. the huge air mattress was also comfortable to sleep on. darlene was a nice host and she did her best to help us out and attend to our queries. we just wished that the location was closer to downtown, but other than that, we really enjoyed our stay. thank you darlene!
68973	670056	9.0	9.0	2649982	Great place, very comfortable, the neighborhood is quiet and very nice.  The TV is awesome and there is wi-fi. Tiki is a very nice hostess. Only complaints: the beds are very soft, the dining table is really a small bistro table with high stools--not useable for us old folks, there is no coffee maker and no microwave. Other than that, highly recommended! 
68974	670056	9.0	9.0	3409326	"Darlene was a great Hostess!

Our plans to stay in Seattle fell thru and we were madly contacting people on AirBNB the night of trying to locate a place to stay. Darlene was super helpful, easy to communicate with, prompt and very thoughtful and caring. My wife and I have service dogs and she even put out blankets for our dogs to curl up on. Can't tell you how much that means to you when you've got a medical condition and people really get how important your dogs are to you.

Pros
Dog Friendly
Cute little house, smaller but plenty of space and well used and laid out
Great Amenities, well organized kitchen, laundry
Ok WiFi, not the fastest but totally workable
Quiet Neighborhood and nice, close to groceries and easy to get to and around.
Little snacks were left out for guests,
Cable and comfy living room for relaxing
Cozy bathroom. good hot water and plenty of it!

Cons:
None!

68975	670056	9.0	9.0	3418678	"Darlene is a wonderful hostess. My wife and I felt very welcome and there were a lot of nice homey touches that were very appreciated such as coffee, little snacks etc.

Great little kitchen and laundry available.

Super dog friendly, Darlene even set up a dog bed for my wife's and my service dogs. Felt so welcomed! Would definitely visit again."
68976	670056	9.0	9.0	4236432	"I enjoyed my stay very much. The house was spotless, quiet and private. I felt comfortable in the entire house. Thank you.
 "
68977	670056	9.0	9.0	5795625	I spent six days with Darlene and her daughter, TrishAnn.  I shared the main house with TrishAnn, meaning we shared the main spaces and bathroom.  It was great!  Such a wonderful alternative to a cold, sterile hotel room. The house is cute, the room well appointed.  There was absolutely no problem sharing the bath and kitchen (the water pressure was great!).  NIce little front porch area for relaxing and reading, great back deck space as well. This was so easy and comfortable I will definitely be staying here again.
68978	670056	9.0	9.0	16639950	Darlene was a very cordial host. We arrived late afternoon and we were promptly met by Darlene. The place was clean and inviting. Parking was plentiful on the street. The area was also quiet, safe and hospitable. When using only one of the rooms Darlene was kind enough to mention that we essentially had the home to rent while she stayed alongside the place in her own attached living space. The kitchen is nicely upgraded with a washer and dryer to use. It is colorful and clean. Wifi is provided but the signal is strongest in the living room. From the farthest room the signal is lost. The home is close to the main highway that easily takes you to downtown Seattle. It is also close to a collection of well known shops and nice places to eat. It's just far enough to be away from the hustle of downtown but close enough to get there and enjoy the flair of the city. 
68979	670056	9.0	9.0	17249193	The house is very nice and clean. We shared the common space with one other person which was totally ok. The room was large and the kitchen very well equipped. For a longer stay I might rather consider an external cleaner than using the washing machine, but that was not an issue for us. Tiki leaves you pretty much to your own but is very available if you need anything. She was very nice. Distance to Seattle downtown is about 20 min by car without traffic and totally managable. Would stay here again.
68980	670056	9.0	9.0	17989528	Great place. Everything was really neat, tidy and in good shape. Bathroom, kitchen and bedroom were all great. Overall quite happy.
68981	670056	9.0	9.0	18215719	Darlene was very responsive and helpful during the booking, and friendly during our stay. The house is a 8-10 minute walk from the bus stop away (512 goes directly downtown, about 20 minutes). Its a quiet neighborhood, lots of trees and green. Her house has its own flair :) We didn't use the kitchen, but it seemed to have pretty much one could need there and it looked quite clean and in order. the room was not that clean, there was quite a bit of dust/webs at the not-so obvious places, behind the bed, on the inside of the roomdoor (!). The bathroom is a bit odd: it's divided in two parts, one with a basin etc., the other one with the toilet and bathtub/shower, and the connection is half-open. There's only a light lamp in the first part with the basin, which means that when showering/using the toilet at night, you have only a very dim light from what reaches the second part from the first one, which was a bit strange. As other's already mentioned, there is WiFi, but the signal is weak in the room. Overall, our stay was okay, but not mind-blowing.
68982	670056	9.0	9.0	19315133	We really enjoyed our stay here!  The house was clean and had a great TV and modern appliances. We only had a 15 minute walk to my daughter's place and seeing our 3 week old grandson!  We did have different opinions on the bed, my husband liked a soft bed.  We got along well with the woman in the other bedroom, she was considerate with the TV use, and quiet.  We appreciated  being given some breakfast food, Would stay here again!  Glenn and Ruth Euler
68983	670056	9.0	9.0	40783022	Had a very nice two week stay at Tiki's house while in Seattle. Quiet neighbourhood with good proximity to many shops, restaurants, bus routes and the highway. Also has a good space in the front yard to sit. Enjoyed lovely conversation with Tiki when our paths crossed, we would definitely stay here again!
68984	670056	9.0	9.0	44918985	The listing description was very accurate, the room was great, and the host was very helpful! Host was very accommodating and kept the living space very clean. No complaints!
68985	670056	9.0	9.0	47152363	Darlene Tiki was there to welcome us and help with our luggage into the house. She had breakfast food available as we asked. The house is always neat and clean. We stayed here last September so knew what to expect. Really enjoyed the wifi since I recently purchased a tablet. The tv is excellent too.  Her place has everything we need  and is very reasonably priced!
68986	670056	9.0	9.0	47585232	We had the house to ourselves because the 2nd room was rented out. I suggest getting the whole house to yourself or else you'll have to share a bathroom with them. The house was really nice and clean and we enjoyed the short time we were there. It wasn't that far from DT either so it made it easy travelling back and forth. 
69996	3040278	9.0	10.0	13446192	The pictures did not do this place justice. Place was beautifully decorated without leaving the comfortable homey vibe. Jenn was very responsive from the time of inquiring about her space to the time we checked out. Not only did she have a binder filled with places to go and restaurants to try, but she also took the time to tell us about everything that was nearby that was worth checking out. This space is in prime location. Everything was walkable. Space needle was a 10 minute (leisurely walking). Pike Place 25-30min walk. I would totally recommend others to stay here.
69997	3040278	9.0	10.0	13889640	"Jenn was a stellar communicator throughout the whole booking process as well as the stay. Her beautiful condo was the perfect place to get away, in the heart of Seattle. Walking distance from the space needle, restaurants and grocery stores, as well as yoga studios (home yoga is great).
  Jenn was very helpful, she provided everything needed to make the stay super comfortable. The condo itself is gorgeous, and decorated with a intellectual/romantic/worldly vibe. Lots of art on the walls, candles, and tons of books about wine and travel.
  Last but not least, the view! I was lucky to visit when the weather was just perfect and from her balcony the view of elliot bay/west seattle and the Olympic? mountains were simply stunning. 
I would definitely stay here again."
69998	3040278	9.0	10.0	14174386	We had a wonderful time and loved this place. The view was simply amazing. Jenn was so nice and everything worked out perfectly. We will certainly go back.

We love our stay here. Very nice, safe and nicely decorated apartment.

The place is strategically located near to happening places and main attractions.

70000	3040278	9.0	10.0	14748344	"A friend and I visited Seattle for the first time and Jenn's apartment looked perfect. Having made an enquiry she emailed straight back and made things very easy throughout the whole process. Although we didn't get to meet, Jenn left very easy instructions and other contacts should we need them. 
The apartment was superb! Perfect location near the space needle and just the right size. There even a couple of local beers in the fridge!
Thank you Jenn!!"
70001	3040278	9.0	10.0	14805733	"The apartment is great, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It is equipped with all you might need. It is clean and cozy and you fell at home as soon as you get in, like staying at your friend's house (but better looking than my friend's place... :^D).
The Murphy bed was extremely comfortable, a pleasant surprise as i was a little worried after my experiences in other apartments, i had a great night of sleep.
The location is also great, just a couple of blocks from the Space Needle and the Olympic Sculpture Park and close enough to Pike Place.
The pictures are very accurate, it might even say i liked it better in real life, and the view from the living room/master bedroom is beautiful.
Having an attached garage was also very comfortable, you can part and walk or take a cab pretty much everywhere.
As for our hostess, Jenn was superb. Communication was perfect and she was really helpful. When we got into the apartment we found nice notes from Jenn around the place and in the kitchen counter a very nice binder with extremely useful information on what to do, see, eat and drink in Seattle.
A great experience, I just wish i had stayed longer !!
Thanks for everything Jenn, I'll definitely try to stay at your place next time I'm in Seattle."
70002	3040278	9.0	10.0	14869993	This was a great find. I can't imagine a better value for the neighborhood, comfort of place, and hosting of Jenn anywhere in Central Seattle. It was almost a too good to be true sort of place. The beds were both incredible comfortable, the view fantastic, and all of the amenities offered by the host were fantastic. Building and neighborhood both incredibly safe. Large enough for four adults (two couples) to not feel cramped in the least, which was an initial concern of mine when booking, but definitely not the case. Communication with Jenn was simple and prompt. Although she made herself available for questions and help with our stay, my only real regret was not getting a chance to talk with her more, as she seemed really cool and interesting. Strongly recommend, and will hope it is available again on my next trip to Seattle.
70003	3040278	9.0	10.0	15045790	Jenn was a super host — helpful and sweet. The apartment is snug, but perfect for using as a basecamp to explore the city. There's a bus stop right out the front door and some of the most authentic Thai food, bars and a grocery store just up the block. It's a quiet, safe neighborhood very close to the Space Needle and the museums of Seattle Center, only 10 min by bus downtown and about 5 min's walk to Olympic Sculpture Park. Would highly recommend it, especially if traveling with friends or family.
70004	3040278	9.0	10.0	15141281	The apartment was clean, just as described, had a great view, and very homey! Jenn was a fantastic host, she was very proactive in communicating, offered some great recommendations, and was super professional. The location also can't be (email hidden)ny things were within walking distance or a short cab ride away. Thanks, Jenn, for making our short Seattle stay a great one!
70005	3040278	9.0	10.0	15264865	Jenn was a great host. She was really communicative before my arrival and met me at the apartment when checking in. She was full of great advice for my stay in Seattle.  Her apartment was clean, well appointed and in a really central and convenient location.
70006	3040278	9.0	10.0	15536254	We had a fantastic time staying at Jenn's! Great location close to Safeco, Century Link field, the Space Needle, Kerry Park and many great restaurants. Jenn was amazing to deal with and provided us with many suggestions on restaurants and things to do in the city. We'll definitely be back. Thanks Jenn!
70007	3040278	9.0	10.0	15648178	"What a great place! Jenn was awesome! Although we barely got to interact with her, due to our hectic schedule - Jenn was accommodating and basically got us in earlier than we originally anticipated. 

This was my first time on air BnB and what a great experience. Jenn's home was beautiful with hard wood floors. Although it was a little hot at 90degrees - my husband didn't mind at all - the night time was great with all the windows opened. 

The balcony had a great view of the ocean. Jenn was very generous and we had a great time! "
70008	3040278	9.0	10.0	15683935	Jenn's place was incredible for our girls get together.  The apartment was tidy and beautifully decorated, and the view is amazing!  We wish we'd had more time to sit on the patio and enjoy the view!  Thank you Jenn!
70009	3040278	9.0	10.0	15871435	Great apt - great size & GREAT views from the apt (we sat on the balcony both evenings we stayed & watched the amazing sunset). Buses for downtown & capitol hill leave from outside the door. We got the monorail back from downtown which is a 5 min walk from the apt (beside space needle). Jenn has a great welcome pack & a welcoming note encouraging use of all facilities. I never met Jenn but her friendly nature was apparent and her home is lovely.
70010	3040278	9.0	10.0	16248862	Host provided a ton of information regarding sightseeing in the city, as well as availability for questions from us. Great option for walking distance to anywhere in the seattle centre. The apartment was very clean, had great views and comfortable beds!
70011	3040278	9.0	10.0	16305057	Jenn was very helpful when we arrived as we were confused about getting in.  It was so great to have a secure parking space in the middle of the city with bus access and walking.  A couple of great restaurants close by (the Greek one especially) but walking to Pikes market was easy which we love to do.  The view is indeed spectacular and the rooms very comfortable.   We had an extra person join us at the last minute from Brazil and Jenn was very accommodating.   
70012	3040278	9.0	10.0	16666374	Jenn's Seattle place was great, clean and efficient with easy access to public transport and sightseeing destinations.  She was easy to contact and helpful throughout our stay.
70013	3040278	9.0	10.0	16770345	"Jenn's place is amazing, it's clean and tidy and the view is to die for! It's in a rear location and Jenn was very helpful with pointing out all the best locations to visit. I also love the book she has put together with everything to do in Seattle! There is no way you would miss anything that is happening!
Highly recommended. 
Thanks again! "
70014	3040278	9.0	10.0	16985457	The apartment was perfectly located, well-appointed, bright, comfortable, clean and felt very welcoming.  Jenn was really helpful with arrival instructions and overall incredibly friendly and helpful.  We would stay there again in a second upon a return trip to Seattle.
70015	3040278	9.0	10.0	17273269	Jen, you are an awesome host, the apt and it's beautiful view is really an great experience. The airbnb concept is vacation changing, it is the future. My family was more comfortable, vacation experience starts instantly, location is perfect. Apt really cool, million dollar view, Seattle is just great! We really had a great time and really appreciate your hospitality. 
70016	3040278	9.0	10.0	18054195	Jenn is great as a host.  Her place was just as the pictures show & the view is amazing!  The building is secure & having our own parking was a huge bonus.  If you are going to be in Seattle, you can't go wrong with this place.  Convenient to everything and only a short walk to the waterfront!
70017	3040278	9.0	10.0	18122959	"Exactly as advertised.
Clean, safe, accommodating, friendly and close to pier 69 for our trip to Victoria.
Highly recommend "
70018	3040278	9.0	10.0	18310234	"We didn't get to meet Jenn because we were late arriving in Seattle, but she was immediately available by phone every time we called or texted with a question. She gave us great restaurant recommendations and provided lots of information in the apartment about what to do in Seattle and how best to enjoy her home and neighborhood. And having a safe reserved parking spot was incredibly convenient.
The apartment is beautifully furnished with comfortable beds and linens and provided plenty of room for the four of us to relax and enjoy ourselves. A twenty-minute walk got us to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle is even closer.
I highly recommend Jenn's Seattle place and would love to go back again some day."
70019	3040278	9.0	10.0	18409728	We only stayed briefly for one night, so we didn't have much interaction with the host, but the place was great and everything went smoothly.  I would be willing to stay here for a longer duration on a future trip.  The place is well kept and beds are comfortable.  The parking space in the garage below is super convenient.  There are decent restaurants within a close walk.  Seems like a good choice if you want to spend some time in Seattle and need 2 bedrooms.
70020	3040278	9.0	10.0	18537605	Jenn's apartment was just lovely to stay in. Super-comfy beds !  and everything could need at hand .  Jenn was there to meet and greet us and left us lots of info about Seattle.  The apartment is walking distance to all the tourist attractions and in a safe neighborhood. We had an absolute ball in Seattle and would recommend Jenn's appartment and Seattle to anyone thinking of going to Seattle!
70021	3040278	9.0	10.0	18651691	"Jenn's place was lovely!  From booking the condo initially to when we arrived Jenn made it a simple and fun experience!  Jenn accommodated an earlier than normal check in mid-afternoon and met us at the condo promptly after letting her know we were 15 minutes away.  The parking spot was great to save money on downtown Seattle parking and she gave us detailed instructions on how to enter and exit the building and to use the garage.

Once we arrived Jenn gave us a quick tour of her place, let us know where things were we might need and gave us some recommendations on some good restaurants and nightlife spots close to her home.  The location was perfect to see the Space Needle, Chihuly Glass and Garden exhibit and Seattle Center!  

Seattle was a great time and the condo was perfect for myself and my siblings who were visiting.  The next time I am in Seattle I will definitely look to stay here again :)"
70022	3040278	9.0	10.0	18937786	If you visit Seattle, staying with Jenn is a MUST. Beyond having an unbelievable charming and comfortable condo (with laundry!), Jenn is the kind of host you dream of having in a new city. If you want the DIY approach to travel, her guidebook of things to do and places to eat will set you off on the perfect path to self-selected exploration. If you'd like something a little more hand's on / the true local experience, Jenn has genius ideas and tips for that too. You can't ask for a more walkable location, inviting condo, or delightful host - I can't wait to stay with her again.
70023	3040278	9.0	10.0	19016491	Jenn was an amazing host and made us feel right at home. If we had any questions, she always answered back right away. The apartment was beautiful and clean. The views were  wonderful. Also, Jenn provided us with a great book that had everything from coupons to local restaurants to how to check out. It was a great experience.
70024	3040278	9.0	10.0	19075655	Great location with good view. Jenn is a very friendly host and the appartment is amazing! The location is perfect for exploring Seattle by walk. Jenn, thank you so much!
70025	3040278	9.0	10.0	19192214	We spent 2 nights in Jenn's condo, prior to an Alaskan cruise. The location is perfect, just  a one mile walk to Pike Market, and plenty of restaurants nearby. You cannot beat the view, either. Would be glad to stay here next time I am in Seattle.
70026	3040278	9.0	10.0	19591931	"What a wonderful place. Great view and an easy walk to so many of Seattle finest attractions; the Space Needle, Museums; Pike Place, Sculpture park and many more. Jenn was a wonderful hostess. She stopped in to make sure all was good and gave us some great ideas of places to go and things to do. The building is very secure and the underground parking spot is clutch! Overall it was a great find. Jenn was great and the apartment and location couldn't have been better. 
Thanks!"
70027	3040278	9.0	10.0	19734969	My husband, William and I were so lucky to stay at Jenn's condo for our first airbnb experience! Her home is absolutely beautiful and the location perfect. We parked the car in her garage and walked everywhere. The kitchen is well-equipped and the entire place is charming with unique art work and comfortable sitting areas. The view is remarkable. Although we didn't get to meet Jenn, we'd love to at some point...and next time we're in Seattle, we'll try to book with Jenn again. She made sure it was easy for us to get into her place. Her communication was great. We felt very welcomed and right at home. Since our stay in Seattle was the beginning of two weeks of airbnb stays in 5 different homes, we were grateful for this great space and positive experience.  Thanks again, Jenn!
70028	3040278	9.0	10.0	20001913	"Our stay at Jenn's apt. was great! The location of 
her apt was very important to us. It allowed us to
walk to most places. The apt was very comfortable, everything one could need was available - except for a toaster!!??- It is tastefully
furnished, and the view of course is ""Amazing""!
Returning to Seattle is our wish, should we do so
Jenn's place will be considered. 
Thank you for making our stay enjoyable.

70029	3040278	9.0	10.0	20184402	Great view and really great location. Walking distance to Space Needle and Chihuly Glass Garden, 5 dollar Uber ride to anything in downtown, and a bust stop downstairs. Apartment is equipped exactly as listed, very comfortable and includes anything you would need on a Seattle trip. Jenn was very helpful and accommodating in the check in process. My friends and I would definitely choose to stay here again if we return to Seattle.
70030	3040278	9.0	10.0	20548864	"We fell in love with this place the moment we walked through the door.  It had everything we needed to feel comfortable after an exhausting week of cruising the San Juan islands.  Our hostess left explicit and timely directions on how to access her unit.  With the help of her copious materials on Seattle, what to do, where to go and where to eat we enjoyed our brief visit to the Emerald City to the fullest!

The sleeping accommodations were wonderful and the kitchen was well equipped. The unit is conveniently located close to Seattle Center and Space Needle and offers an expansive view of Elliot Bay with the comings and goings of ferries and cruise ships.  There is public transportation on the street in front of the unit.  While parking was offered to us, we felt no need for a car as buses took us wherever we wanted to go.

My son, his wife and I hope we can return again for a longer stay.

70031	3040278	9.0	10.0	20626558	The apartment is located just a short walk from the Space Needle which was the main reason my family chose to stay there. The design and decoration in the apartment was lovely and very homey. Jenn was out of town and wasn't able to meet us in person but by simply staying there makes me feel like I already know her. It really reflects her character and I think that is what makes the apartment feel so homey. The apartment is clean and secure. I only wished I planned by stay in Seattle longer. I will definitely return and stay in this apartment again.
70032	3040278	9.0	10.0	20987884	I was in Seattle for a wedding with a few friends, and we stayed at Jenn's place for about a week. The apartment is absolutely wonderful, with a great view of the Sound. Jenn was great - made check-in/check-out extremely easy, and was always easy to reach with questions. The apartment is in a very central location, and within walking distance of great restaurants/shops, etc - we had a lovely time! I've recommend this to anyone interested in finding a great location for their Seattle travels.  
70033	3040278	9.0	10.0	21028789	This was our second trip to Seattle and the first time with our 7 and 8 year old boys. Jenn's place was perfect for the four of us. Jenn is very friendly, welcoming, and thoughtful. She even helped us recover a stuffed wolf that got left behind after we checked out. It is a 5 minute walk to Seattle Center which made it easy to check out the Children's Science Museum. My only regret is that we were only able to spend one night here. Next time we come to Seattle we'll definitely be checking if Jenn has availability. 
70034	3040278	9.0	10.0	21103381	"Jenn was a great hostess and was very attentive.  I was amazed at how communicative she was throughout the process at staying at her place and how willing she was to supply information on good local restaurants, bars, etc.   The apartment was beautiful with a lot of cute details and very nice decor.  The location was was also amazing... a short walk to the space needle, chihuli exhibit, the Bill and Science Museum, Melinda Gates foundation, etc.  Centrally located in downtown.
"
70035	3040278	9.0	10.0	21196911	Greatly enjoyed our stay at Jenn's listing over the weekend. Although we did not meet she was always prompt in communicating and she was a great resource. To top it all off she was very accommodating and understanding of some last minute requests that we had. We really enjoyed this neighborhood as there were lots of walkable places nearby and if you are not a walker (or if you just get a little lazy like we did) downtown is just a short/cheap cab ride away (we took a Lyft, it was $5). The best part about this listing was THE VIEW! Definitely enjoyed relaxing and watching the sunset out of the living room. Nice amenities, comfy beds and a great view! 
70036	3040278	9.0	10.0	21317904	Jenn was an amazing hostess. She was very efficient in getting back to me with any questions I had. She made our stay very welcoming! I would definitely recommend her abode anytime you want to enjoy the sights and scenery of Seattle!!!! Great views from the Condo too!
70037	3040278	9.0	10.0	21376886	"Location, Location, Location! as promised by sweet Jenn. Although we didn't get to meet her in person every aspect of Jenn's communication (response time, restaurant recommendations, local attractions, etc) were""spot on"" as was our expectation of her delightful condo. A quick 2 block walk to the Space Needle, IMAX, Chuhuilly Exhibit, Monorail,music, coffee houses and restaurants all situated in a very walkable,safe neighborhood-or take a short 5 minute cab ride to Pikes Market. Ride the Monorail ($2.25 p/p) that whisks you to the motherlode of shopping options (Nike Town, Nordy's, Macy's, high-end and funky, art galleries, etc-we did our level best to support the local economy!) The condo is nicely decorated with all the amenities we could have asked for and more. Nice to have the secure parking garage, although we never moved our car as everything was so accessible on foot. A generous, honest hostess. We felt like we were staying in the home of a good friend. Jenn even arranged for great weather-although we can't promise that for every Seattle visitor! We will be back.

70038	3040278	9.0	10.0	21462641	Jenn was a fabulous host. She answered all questions we had leading up to our trip in a very timely manner and was super helpful. Her apartment was gorgeous, very inviting, and super comfortable. The view was even better than expected and we couldn't have asked for a better location. We walked everywhere we wanted to go during our 2 day stay. I would definitely recommend this lovely apartment as the perfect centrally located place to stay while visiting Seattle.
70039	3040278	9.0	10.0	21652831	Everything Jenn suggested was spot on. The apartment was exactly as described; amazing view and amazing location! I would highly recommend this listing for anyone visiting for the first time.
70040	3040278	9.0	10.0	21774205	I loved this place and felt right at home!  Jenn's dedication to making guests feel comfortable is special!
70041	3040278	9.0	10.0	21944622	Jenn's home is exactly as she described it. The view is outstanding (the picture was spot on!). Her home is warm and comfortable. When we walked in the door, we relaxed instantly. There were little post-it notes all over with comments, smiles, hints, etc. She left a book on the counter with tons of area recommendations. The place is very small, but this added to the coziness. I would definitely head back up to Seattle and stay at Jenn's place! Thank you, Jenn, for a wonderful stay!
70042	3040278	9.0	10.0	22356053	I've never been in this area of Seattle, and I really enjoyed it!  Close to Pike Place Market.  Very nice, secure building with underground parking garage.  The small but nicely appointed apartment was cozy and welcoming.  The view from the balcony was beautiful!  We walked to many cute shops and delicious restaurants, and there are grocery stores nearby as well.  We did not cook, but there is a full kitchen with anything you might need.  The master bed was super comfy.  I would rent this apartment again.  The description listed by the renter is accurate.
70043	3040278	9.0	10.0	22494574	Jenn's apartment is very nice and exactly as described. Instructions for everything were very clear with a detailed book of attractions and places to eat.

70047	3040278	9.0	10.0	23503438	First, Jenn's condo is a great location. Walk to tons of things, and a central location for places you need to drive to north or south. Second, what a great view! Jenn was great with responsive communication and this 2 bedroom condo was perfect for me, my wife and our 3yo over the Thanksgiving holiday. Great instructions, along with a ton of recommendations for nearby amenities. We come back often, and we'll check to see if Jenn's place is available before we search for other options.
70048	3040278	9.0	10.0	23570960	Jenn's place is super cute and in a perfect location... Especially if you are going to an event at the Key Arena! We will definitely be staying here again!

Jenn made us feel welcome, and as our travel and arrival plans changed, was quick and responsive to make sure our arrival was easy--even though a delayed train had us arriving at 1:30am!   Really wonderful to finally arrive, and find a beautiful living space, comfortable beds, kitchen ready for our use.
  
 It's a great location for getting around Seattle and yes, amazing view.  Jenn was available for questions and help at any time, but we found her notebook with suggestions and guidance met all our needs."
70052	3040278	9.0	10.0	23957768	Jenn was so helpful and responsive as our travel plans changed -- adding and subtracting a family member guest, arranging a late arrival, accommodating an even later arrival due to delayed train!  When we finally arrived we found a warm, lovely living space, perfectly appointed, beautiful view, great beds, kitchen with every possible need considered.  Jenn provided a binder of information on restaurants and other logistics.  The location was ideal for us: the Seattle Center and Seattle Rep Theater is within easy walking distance, and the bus stop for downtown is right outside the door. Wonderful restaurants nearby - we were very happy!
70053	3040278	9.0	10.0	24022640	This was our first air B and B stay and the bar is set unbelievably high. Awesome location, comfortable place, so inviting and warm. I not only would use air B and B again but I would love to stay at Jenn's place. 
70054	3040278	9.0	10.0	24125937	Perfect location for a stay in Seattle: views of the Puget Sound, walking distance to the Pikes Market and the Queen Ann neighborhood. The parking spot makes it easy for everybody arriving by car to safely store the car every night. The apartment was spacious and equipped with everything listed. We had a great stay, thanks Jenn.
70055	3040278	9.0	10.0	24229906	Staying in Jenn's apartment was a delight.  It is in an excellent location that felt very safe and was within walking distance of most of the places we wanted to go.  Inside, it is very comfortable and attractive, and its wonderful view of the Sound makes it feel much larger than it actually is.  It also has the kind of TV and music devices one would want.  While it is small, the three adults in our party did not feel cramped.  The bed in the second bedroom is not as comfortable as in the main bedroom, but the other features of the apartment compensate for this, unless one has a significant difficulty with sleep.  Jenn was very easy to communicate with regarding our visit.  Since we arrived later than planned, we were not able to meet her, checking in was a snap anyway.  I would highly recommend this apartment.
70056	3040278	9.0	10.0	24458668	"Jenn was a fantastic host and was available to answer any questions that we had at any time. Jenn was able to share her knowledge of the area and suggest things and do and transportation.

The check-in and check-out process was seamless and easy, despite us not knowing exactly when we'd arrive and our really early morning departure. She also recommended 2 really delicious restaurants that I look forward to returning to on my next trip to Seattle. I would definitely recommend Jenn's apartment to someone staying in Seattle.
70059	3040278	9.0	10.0	24704244	"What an amazing location!  Jenn was so gracious and easy to work with.  She was incredibly accommodating, and really made us feel at home.  The condo has an amazing view, and is walking distance to so much that Seattle has to offer.  We stayed with my parents, a tween, and a toddler.  My dad said that the pillows in the ""blue room"" were the best he's ever slept on, and asked me to ask Jenn where we could find them.  :-)

We really enjoyed Jenn's space, and will definitely stay again the next time we are visiting Seattle!"
70060	3040278	9.0	10.0	24850967	Jenn is an accommodating and responsive host. We loved her cozy condo with a great view. She provided us with excellent detail to park and get checked in.

THANK YOU JENN!
Frank "
70062	3040278	9.0	10.0	25330584	Everything is like what's described! Cozy apartment with amazing view. Jenn has a book that documents everything you need during your stay in Seattle, very helpful! 
70063	3040278	9.0	10.0	25632221	Jenn was very helpful. She gave us a detailed decription of her place and helped us to get in. She responds to text in a timely fashion and is always so friendly and helpful. Her place has a georgous view and is so tastefully decorated. She provided us with everything we needed. We really enjoyed our stay here and spent a significant amount of time in door especially during the stormy weather :) we highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back again!
70064	3040278	9.0	10.0	25853641	Jenn was terrific to work with before we even got to Seattle.  She was so warm and friendly at check in and was a plethora of  great information about the city.  Really great tips on restaurants.  We absolutely loved the accommodations.  Fabulous location - we pretty much walked everywhere we wanted to go!  The view is spectacular.  We were three, and we were all extremely comfortable in her apartment.  Jenn has done a great job of making her place warm, interesting and comfy.  It was impeccably clean and well appointed.  We would highly recommend her place and would definitely return!  Thanks for a wonderful weekend, Jenn!
70065	3040278	9.0	10.0	25907069	"Jenn's place is epic. Stayed there with a friend for two nights, and it's an incredible way to experience Seattle. The place itself was spotless, and the view from the bedroom and the balcony is breathtaking; make sure to catch the sunset over the water. It's only a couple blocks walking to great food and the Space Needle, plus public transport is just a few steps away from the front door.

Jenn was extremely welcoming and gave us a quick tour of the place before leaving us with tons of great recommendations and suggestions. It's obvious that she loves the city, and it was great to share in that enthusiasm. My only regret is not having more time to spend there. I can't recommend Jenn's place highly enough!"
70066	3040278	9.0	10.0	26010245	Wow, what an incredible space! (The view!) Jenn was an amazing host, and welcomed us to Seattle in the most incredible and informed way. Her space was perfect, and just as described.
70067	3040278	9.0	10.0	26080223	"I loved this place.  It was the perfect place in the perfect location.  Jenn really scored a beautiful view, and we enjoyed every minute of it.  Unfortunately, our Super Bowl win dreams were smashed.  But this stay was a trip saver.

As a new host, I know what I need to do for my guest to have the best experience.  

Thanks Jenn"
70068	3040278	9.0	10.0	26168155	Staying at Jenns lovely place in Seattle was like being home. Quiet and comfortable but close enough to walk to many of the happening things in town. My only wish is that we could have stayed longer. Thanks Jenn.
70069	3040278	9.0	10.0	26677711	Jenn was the best host! Very attentive to our needs, she made time to meet us and make sure we were comfortable. Jenn also had great tips on areas to hike, eat & sight see.  The informational binder at the Condo was amazing & so helpful.  We loved her beautiful home, the view & the whole atmosphere. We will be sure to return, it made our trip much more enjoyable.
70070	3040278	9.0	10.0	26859294	The property was amazing.  It was in a great location.  It was totally clean and convenient to everything.  Its a great place to see Seattle from!
70071	3040278	9.0	10.0	27047933	Jenn gave us a nice orientation to the neighborhood to supplement the really-together binder she provides with many of the best (and close!) things Seattle has to offer (including some fun quirky things).  We were 2 couples coming from 2 locations so she gifted us her extra private parking spot too.  All 4 of us agreed her place was awesome and we could find nothing to not like about it.  Super nice to just hang out in, and the perfect weather meant gorgeous views of the snow-capped Olympics.   We'll be back! 
70072	3040278	9.0	10.0	27325667	"We loved our AirBnB experience with this rental!  Jenn was an excellent host from the moment our request was accepted.  She provided information about the unit and the neighborhood, provided excellent instructions to ensure a smooth check-in, and made it easy for us despite a late arrival (10:30pm).

The neighborhood was perfect for our visit to Seattle!  Walking distance to the Space Needle and numerous excellent restaurants.  The view of the Sound and Olympic Range beyond was beautiful.

"
70073	3040278	9.0	10.0	27461683	Jenn was a terrific host. She was very communicative and clear with directions on how to find her place and how to access it. She even met up with my group and explained all of the details, along with giving us some great suggestions about what to do during our time in Seattle. As for her apartment, it was absolutely perfect. Our entire group absolutely loved it, and the view is much better than the photos show. The apartment is ideally located for exploring Seattle as well, being walking distance to both Seattle Center (where the Space Needle/EMP Museum are) and Pike Place Market. I would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Seattle. 
70074	3040278	9.0	10.0	27534578	"Jenn was awesome and responsive as a host! Her condo is beautiful and had such a lovely feel to it. My husband loved its decor and we both loved the location. We walked pretty much everywhere--we loved that we were so close to everywhere we wanted to go. 

For being in the middle of the city and part of a condo complex, it was remarkably quiet and peaceful!!

I would definitely stay there again if we make it back up to Seattle!"
70075	3040278	9.0	10.0	27887030	Jenn was a fantastic host! From the beginning, she was reachable, helpful, and knowledgeable. She is full of great advice for the area, and my Seattle experience was great because of both Jenn's advice and her apartment. The apartment was clean, well-kept, and felt like a home away from home, and it was in the perfect location - near many nice restaurants and in a walkable place. I will be recommending Jenn's apartment to friends and family anytime they visit Seattle. Thanks so much, Jenn! You're awesome! :)
70076	3040278	9.0	10.0	28058045	"Jenn was great and the flat was amazing!  There really were ""Amazing views""! Jenn was very helpful and was in contact with me as soon as I submitted my request. She was quick to fill me into all of the details and checking in was a breeze. The home was put together so well, very clean and very comforting. My friends and I had a mini reunion from our trip to Spain last month and this was the best place. walking distance from anything you wanted to do and you can relax and enjoy the view of the water, space needle and PI Building. Beautiful location, great host!! And competitive pricing.

I will definitely rent again and recommend my friends to Jenn! "
70077	3040278	9.0	10.0	28160686	Great neighborhood.  Pretty close to walk to things, nice neighborhood.  The view is wonderful (better than the pictures!).  Jenn was very accommodating, and the place is lovely.  Love the balcony!
70078	3040278	9.0	10.0	28464064	We thoroughly loved our stay at Jenn's apartment during our time in Seattle! Jenn is super welcoming and friendly and provided us so with so many ideas and places in the area to visit and eat. Her apartment is super clean and in a perfect location to park your car and walk to the main attractions! Beds are also super comfy : )  Would definitely stay here again. 
70079	3040278	9.0	10.0	28611895	Jenn was incredibly hospitable and sweet. Her place was a luxury for us (and my dog!) -- very comfortable beds, amazing view, every amenity you need. Our stay in Seattle was too short, but we never had to get in the car -- so much great stuff can be reached on foot from this lovely condo. Jenn's Seattle pride is strong and she has an endless list of suggestions for places to visit. (Chihuly was fantastic! Tiny Bigs rocks!) I'd definitely seek out Jenn on another visit to Seattle. Thank you, Jenn!!!
70080	3040278	9.0	10.0	28666929	we will happily stay in this unit again. Jenn met and quickly oriented us upon arrival and also has a large binder full of useful tips about the neighborhood and seattle.  the view truly is great and there is much to do - virtually all accessed easily by foot - in the neighborhood. nothing difficult at all about this rental. it helped to make our trip very pleasant.
70081	3040278	9.0	10.0	28932896	The apartment was fantastic, exceeding all of our needs (primarily location-based). For the most part, we were able to get around without a car, though the parking space downstairs was very helpful. The apartment was well-furnished and homey. The host was extremely helpful, both in providing an abundance of good information for visitors and in making sure all our needs were met. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle, and this apartment was a big part of that.
70082	3040278	9.0	10.0	29233147	"Since I have lived in Seattle before, I knew this location was in a safe neighborhood right near Seattle Center. The building and parking were both very secure as well, and there was plenty of ""temporary"" parking when we first arrived and got familiar with the entry/exit procedures. The view is much better in real life than the picture! The owner made us feel very welcome, and we did try to schedule an in-person meeting after we arrived.  But our schedules didn't quite match up.  Nevertheless, we stayed in steady contact throughout our short 2 day stay, and did not experience any unanswered questions.  There were plenty of clean towels and informative strategically placed notes to help us out too. It was very comforting to be staying in a place that felt very much like a ""real"" home instead of just a hotel.  "
70083	3040278	9.0	10.0	29335482	Wonderful hospitality. Jenn was very attentive to our questions and made the stay very easy. Wonderful view, wonderful location!  Would highly recommend to all to stay here for a great Seattle experience. 
70084	3040278	9.0	10.0	29605923	We loved the location of this fabulous condo. The space was perfect for our group of four, and everything we needed was within walking distance. We even took our time one day and strolled all the way to Safeco Field, making some fun stops for lunch and refreshments along the way. Jenn was a very accommodating host, which made our first airbnb experience better than we could have expected. We will definitely look to stay here again. 
70085	3040278	9.0	10.0	29972281	"We were met by Jenn shortly after we arrived at her home and were able to ask lots of questions about Seattle, getting around, things to see in the neighborhood. Jenn was welcoming and knowledgeable. The condo had the view that is exactly featured on the website and it was spectacular. We loved having the small deck available but were unable to use it because of the weather. The location was ideal. We walked downtown, to the Pike Place Market and along the waterfront. 
Because we were visiting our daughter and friends we needed to rent a car. We found Hwy 99 convenient for getting into and out of town and it dropped us off a few blocks from the condo. Having parking under the building was a huge help. We are looking forward to booking this condo again in the future."
70086	3040278	9.0	10.0	30381498	Jenn, met us in person and gave us a some great ideas of what the city had to offer. She provided info, suggestions and directions to things. She was also available by text if anything came up.
70087	3040278	9.0	10.0	30861623	Best experience ever! The view is fantastic. And you have everything you need in the apartment. Jenn is very detailed and provide us a lot of stuff.(even an eye cover) We enjoyed every moment in the apartment. I would definitely recommend all my friends go this apartment if they are traveling to Seattle.   
70088	3040278	9.0	10.0	31211587	Jenn's place was AMAZING...the best location possible. She had a ton of great information on Seattle sites and restaurants throughout her place. We were never without options. Jenn had also recommended some Tom Douglass restaurants and he we hit one location and loved EVERY bit!
70089	3040278	9.0	10.0	31667644	Jenn was a very thoughtful host. It became very clear that she wanted her guest to make the most out of their trip. Very friendly with great communication throughout the stay. I greatly appreciate how she systematically put tips and instructions in the binders about how to get around and her recommendations on nearby attractions. Her place is awesome, just a short walk to the Seattle Center and very accessible to all the major attractions. I'm thankful that we got a chance to stay here and hope we will get another chance to visit this beautiful city and be her guest again.
70090	3040278	9.0	10.0	31730841	Jenn's apartment was fantastic! In a great part of town that allowed for us to park the car and walk around the entire downtown. Very clean and well equipped for 2 couples. I was very pleased with an easy check-in and check-out process. Would recommend to anyone looking in the area! Laundry is a bonus! Ohand the view, Great lil patio!
70091	3040278	9.0	10.0	31760296	Beautiful condo, perfectly located, and everything was as it should be. We loved our stay here and would again if we come back to the Seattle area.
70092	3040278	9.0	10.0	31897024	This was a perfect intro to airbnb. The apt was as described- amazing view and amazing location! Jenn was responsive about timing questions and very helpful with excellent suggestions for activities/restaurants. We felt like we were staying at a friend's place while they were out of town. Everything was comfortable and clean. Thanks Jenn!
70093	3040278	9.0	10.0	32741353	"I whish i could rate 6 stars. Everything was just perfect. Jenn is a very friendly and caring host. Her place is just amazing and right at the Space Needle! Next time we go to Seattle, we'll try to stay at Jenn's place.
"
70094	3040278	9.0	10.0	33228487	What impressed us was not only sea-view but also Jenn's indoor decoration and lots of books and info about wine. Truly everything one needs in Seattle.
70095	3040278	9.0	10.0	33491523	What can I say? My first Airbnb experience was amazing thanks to Jenn and all the special touches to make sure our stay was comfortable and fabulous. Location was perfect (walking distance to Key Arena) and check-in/check-out process was a breeze. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle. 
70096	3040278	9.0	10.0	33773466	"Jenn and her apartment in Queen Ann were absolutely perfect. My family and I were traveling the Pacific Northwest, and had stayed at Jenn's place. We loved the neighborhood immediately. Tons of great local and must-see restaurants right nearby. This is the perfect experience for those who don't want to be in a tourist hub OR too far outside of the city.
Listing description was more than accurate, and had more amenities than we expected.
We left for Vancouver for a weekend, and returned and it felt like home.  If that's not a home-run, I'm not sure what is."
70097	3040278	9.0	10.0	33979154	Jenn was a great help, guiding my father and I into her downtown apartment late at night as we drove from the airport, and was very kind and patient as she walked me through the steps of getting to the location and entering it. The apartment itself had everything we needed, was tidy and well furnished, and the morning view was an exceptional introduction to the city and the wider Pacific Northwest which we were to explore. A great start to our travels and a place I'd recommend to all.
70098	3040278	9.0	10.0	34282592	"Amazing view, and location,location location.
Close everything. the house was great and Jenn was there for what you needed. would stay again"
70099	3040278	9.0	10.0	34575995	"Compact condo with all you need. Absolutely a great place to stay. From the start Jenn's communication was excellent. 

Our transcontinental flight put us in Seattle early in the day but Jenn worked to get the condo ready for us early so that we could tour without the burden of our belongings. Although we weren't able to meet in person, Jenn made it easy for us to feel at home. 

Jenn's place is very comfortable, features a great view of the Sound and the Olympic Mountains when nature cooperates (as it did for us).  The condo is in a great location and Jenn's recommendations list on restaurants was quite helpful.  Jenn was always just a text message away. 

Jenn, thanks very much for your concern relative to our comfort, for your recommendations on things to do and see and for the fresh fruit!"
70100	3040278	9.0	10.0	34690264	Access was made very easy despite late arrival.   Great location with views just as promised. Much personal type stuff around the apartment which gives the definite feeling of staying in Jenn's home despite having the whole apartment to ourselves.
70101	3040278	9.0	10.0	34849101	Jenn's condo is gorgeous, it is close to so many touristy things, we walked everywhere. It truly was like staying in a friends home. Jenn's communication was amazing, she really cared about our experience in Seattle. Just remember people, you are a guest in a home, make sure you treat her home with the respect it deserves. Leave it as beautiful and clean as you found it.
70102	3040278	9.0	10.0	35382156	Although I only stayed one night at Jenn's apartment, it was still a great experience. It has a great location where you can walk to all of the major sights. Major benefit that it has a parking space - just leave your car there and walk everywhere! There was a bit of confusion in the time before we got our keys to the place and parking garage because there wasn't any available street parking nearby. One of us ended up sort of parking illegally while the other person grabbed the key. Finding the right garage door took a couple of tries too, but once we were settled in it was well worth it. While I did not meet Jenn, she was available for all of my questions. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and homey. Another benefit for me was being able to do laundry inside the apartment. Also, the view is amazing! I loved seeing the water from the living room and balcony. All in all I would definitely would recommend this place. 
70103	3040278	9.0	10.0	35535244	Jenn's condo was everything we expected and more. Description and photos are very accurate and might not due the space justice. Walking distance from downtown or a $5 Uber ride. View and beds were first class. Can't thank Jenn enough for her correspondence and hospitality . Would not think twice about staying here again. Loved our stay
70104	3040278	9.0	10.0	35665998	"Jenn is a great host! Great place! Great city!

Would definitely stay here again!"
70105	3040278	9.0	10.0	35999963	We can't say enough about Jenn and this apartment. It was perfect! Clean, comfortable and the most amazing location. We were absolutely thrilled with everything. And while we never got to meet Jenn she answered our many questions and took good care of us. 
70106	3040278	9.0	10.0	36167955	Jenn was a lovely host at an amazing apartment. She provided super tips on local eats, where to go and what to avoid. Special shoutout to the balcony views, a perfect place to watch the ferrys at sundown.  Would stay again. 
70107	3040278	9.0	10.0	36282280	Jennifer was a fantastic host!!  She was very accommodating and had tons of ideas for first time visitors. The home was exceptional!  Super comfortable beds, all you need in the home in the way of accommodations, and boy oh boy... that view!!!!  If we ever move here we will try to buy this condo from her as it was perfect in every way. We will definitely stay here again! 
70108	3040278	9.0	10.0	36814822	Jenn and Jenns place were fantastic.  Beautiful place, perfect to see the waterfront.  Jenn was extremely well organized and getting in was a breeze.  I heavily recommend staying here.
70109	3040278	9.0	10.0	36938766	Jenn was amazing.  She let us check in early, let us leave the car in the lot late, left unbelievable amounts of information about the city for us to read, and was easily reachable.  What's more, these pictures do not do this condo justice.  It is unbelievably beautiful and comfortable.
70110	3040278	9.0	10.0	37128863	Jenn was very easy to work with.  She made sure the condo was very clean upon our arrival.  She was able to be flexible with our travel schedule, making our stay that much more comfortable.  The condo is very homey, and there was lots of good, easy to find information so we could maximize our time there. Definitely will consider staying again, should we need a place in downtown Seattle.
70111	3040278	9.0	10.0	37295908	Not much else can be said but phenomenal.  The two bedroom unit has an amazing view, wonderful kitchen to cook, and just a lovely ambiance to relax and enjoy.  Highly recommend NOT renting a vehicle if able to walk on foot.  Just minutes (walking) to EMP and downtown.  Would highly recommend this place, and hope to visit again. Seattle is gorgeous! 
70112	3040278	9.0	10.0	37637820	Jenn's condo in the Queen Ann section of Seattle was perfect...great location, an amazing view day or night as advertised and a comfortable, beautifully decorated apartment with everything we needed for our stay. Jenn herself was great, providing us with lots of useful info and suggestions. It was a pleasure to have the chance to meet and chat with her.
70113	3040278	9.0	10.0	37751797	Great place - very convenient location!  Jenn was great about providing information about check-in and lefts tons of info in the condo regarding restaurant recommendations, places to go see, etc.  It was pretty warm when we were there, and there is no a/c, but she did leave fans there, and in the evening there was a nice breeze due to the location so we were fine.  Would definitely stay here again!
70114	3040278	9.0	10.0	38253653	Great view and Jenn was available to help with any questions we had!  
70115	3040278	9.0	10.0	38406169	Amazing place, great location. Would definitely stay here again and Jenn was so helpful and friendly!
70116	3040278	9.0	10.0	38579701	"Jenn communicated fully and immediately once our booking had been made, as well as throughout our stay. She has plenty of guides and materials about the city of Seattle on hand, and she is complete in her instructions about the condo. The photographs and descriptions of the flat are detailed and accurate. The neighborhood is quiet and the condo is situated very close to the sites and the bustle of the downtown. The view from the small balcony is wonderful--we sat out there for coffee in the morning and for drinks well into the evening. The condo itself is outfitted with everything you might need. We would definitely book to stay here again. Thanks for such a wonderful time! 
"
70117	3040278	9.0	10.0	39142285	"100% recomondation to all visitors of Seattle. 
Pros: all sightseeing could be done by foot, great view from the balcony, style of the flat
Cons: none"
70118	3040278	9.0	10.0	39738437	Awesome time.   Location great.  We walked to pike place market through sculpture park.  We walked to space needle.  We took bus to safeco field.  We had rental car and ventured to Fremont woodland park Rei store and Ballard locks.  Jenn place center to it all. 
70119	3040278	9.0	10.0	40194105	A great place to stay, with a lovely view.  Lots of handy hints and whimsical notes left by Jenn were so helpful.  
70120	3040278	9.0	10.0	40419068	'Amazing View' was everything we wanted for our stay in Seattle.  The apartment has a great view of Elliot Bay and the shoreline was a safe walk distances away.  In this day of 'IKEA' furnished places, it was refreshing to stay in a place that was personalized and comfortable.  
70121	3040278	9.0	10.0	40568113	"Jenn's place was terrific-the view and location not to be surpassed!
Everything we needed-"
70122	3040278	9.0	10.0	41192906	"First, let me say that I would recommend this listing to anyone.  It is conveniently located and a quality apartment at a fair price for the location.  I felt the host was a very good communicator and very prompt in her responses.  Any questions I had were promptly answered and she always made herself available.  

I liked the following things about the apartment: 1) The view off the balcony.  You can seat two on the balcony and honestly if I was sitting in the apartment it was on the balcony. 2) The host has many kitchen items available for use if you would like to cook. 3) There is onsite parking in a secure garage.  You never have to worry about your car.  4) The location is a couple blocks from the Space Needle and the Science Center.  In a whim we decided to go to an IMAX movie and it was a 3-4 block walk.  5) Pike Place Market is about 1 mile away.  We took a cab/Lyft/Uber to the market and walked back.   6) There was a large grocery store nearby if you need anything. 7) The furniture was classy looking and comfortable.  8) The wireless internet was fast and reliable.

Only one thing struck me as a (email hidden)ere is no air conditioning.  This is clearly stated in the listing so there is no deception...just take note if you plan to visit in July and August.  The apartment is exposed to the afternoon sun and it heats up quickly.  This is not normally an issue in Seattle as the weather is usually cool.  But, I traveled at the end of July and August when the outdoor temperatures reached 90.  There was also no rain during my 2 week trip to the Pacific Northwest.  However, the host does have numerous fans for your use (2 in the master bedroom, 1 small one in the living room, and 1 in the guest bedroom).  After the sun went down the apartment quickly became more tolerable as there are many windows.

Overall, I would not hesitate to rent this apartment again especially at cooler times during the year."
70123	3040278	9.0	10.0	41426487	"Jenn gave a detailed message on how to arrive to the apartment. 

She met us at the garage and took us up to the apartment to give us a tour. She also gave us great recommendations of where to eat, visit, and catch a good view of Seattle. 

We walked along the waterfront to Pike's Place, it took about twenty minutes. The Space Needle and Chihuly Glass & Garden is about a ten minute walk. 

The only bummer about this place is we didn't stay longer! Would love to come back if we ever come back to Seattle. 
"
70124	3040278	9.0	10.0	41717053	Lovely unit very close to the major attractions, and it was easy to get downtown. Nice view overlooking Puget sound.
70125	3040278	9.0	10.0	42244726	Jenn's Amazing View, Amazing Location holds up to the name. We found the unit to appear as advertised in the photos,tidy and clean. It is close to the touristy activities (seattle center,space needle) and about a $6 uber ride to the sports stadiums/pike place market. Jenn has a binder she prepared with a bunch of her local suggestions on food/drink locations, the ones we tried were on point! We had a great time and the unit felt like home! 
70126	3040278	9.0	10.0	42515682	Jenn's place is fantastic - it feels very homey, has a great view and is amazingly located in a quiet neighborhood just a door away from many of Seattle's attractions. And Jenn is such a thoughtful host, anticipating our needs, answering our questions promptly and making great suggestions (that binder of hers demonstrates such care). We would definitely book with Jenn again. Thanks again for a wonderful stay.

Best choice for visiting Seattle. "
70128	3040278	9.0	10.0	44514927	I went to Seattle with my Dad and Uncle as we try to see  a baseball game in a new city each year and this year was Seattle.  I have used various other B&B's in other city's and have had positive experiences but Jenn was above and beyond helpful.  She was in constant contact and ensuring that we had everything we needed at all times.  The apartment itself is amazing with a great view and most importantly in a perfect location...I cannot stress how great the location is.  Jenn is not joking when she says that you do not need a car.  I am 27 and my Dad and Unlce are in their 60's and do not like to walk much more than a couple blocks.  Between Uber and the ideal location of the apartment we never needed a car and were very glad that we opted out of renting a car.  The bottom line is that Jenn is most interactive, helpful and concerned host (in a good way) possible.  Combine that with her perfect location, you cannot go wrong!  Highly recommend her! 
70129	3040278	9.0	10.0	44749805	Jenn is an amazing host and her space couldn't have been better for our precruise stay.  We arrived early and she was so accommodating for a luggage drop off.  The condo is in the heart of Queen Anne and within walking distance to all the touristy attractions.  The view was wow!  It was also very nice to have coffee and all the condiments available.  Jenn was just a text away at all times and her dinner recommendations were perfect.  We much enjoyed our stay and will be back!!!
70130	3040278	9.0	10.0	45233806	"What a beautiful condo! More amenities than I even have at home - no detail went over looked! So well decorated to make you feel completely welcomed and comfortable. 

The view was fantastic and I wish we could have stayed longer! The neighborhood is absolutely perfect. A $6 Uber ride from the downtown Westlake station and a very brief walk to ""Seattle Center"" which has the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens and Glass, Key Arena, and Armory which hosts an upscale food court, Children's Museum, and function space. "
70131	3040278	9.0	10.0	45492683	We were staying for 2 nights at Jen's place and we had a wonderful time. The place is very clean, with a great view and has more than enough space for four adults. It's location is perfect with everything easily accessible on foot. Jennifer is a fantastic host who made us feel welcome and was always available for questions/restaurant recommendations and so on. We highly recommend this place for everyone who wants to spend some time in Seattle.
70132	3040278	9.0	10.0	45652285	"Jenn and her place are awesome!

Her instructions were clear and easy to follow.

The condo location is pretty much perfect and is in walking distance of all the major Seattle landmarks (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc.). 

I was able to go to leisurely walk to Pike Place Market (twice), Pioneer Square, and Myrtle Edwards park along the Waterfront all within the course of a single day.

Much thanks to Jenn for opening up her place to visitors. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Seattle.

70133	3040278	9.0	10.0	45920508	If you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle and are reading this review, stop looking and book this place! This apartment is amazing and so close to everything! You will instantly feel at home as soon as you walk in. I cannot say enough good things about it, so you need to find the rest out yourself! I will definitely be back! Thank you Jenn for an amazing stay! 
70134	3040278	9.0	10.0	46367124	We had a wonderful stay! Jenn was a great hostess; everything we needed for our stay was available. Her place was adorable and comfortable (the beds were sooo great!)  Everything was within walking distance to all the major tourist attractions. We really enjoyed ourselves and would stay again if we come back to Seattle!
70135	3040278	9.0	10.0	46487307	I couldn't have asked for a better experience than what we had with Jenn. She was warm, responsive, and accommodating from the beginning, helping us with early check-in and parking. She was always available for us. Her place in Queen Anne was airy, well-kept, and comfortable, with a fantastic view. I would love to come back and stay again! What a fantastic host and location. 
70136	3040278	9.0	10.0	46693959	"Location and unit were amazing.  Jenn was fabulous - absolutely flexible with a varying arrival time.  Lots of tips, notes, articles, on the city.  For my first time using Air BnB, it met and exceeded mine and my friends expectations.  So great to have a ""home"" to come back to after a long day.  "
70137	3040278	9.0	10.0	46907682	Jenn's place is great!  Great location, very welcoming, clean and cozy.  It was the perfect size for two couples.  We rode the train up from Portland for a Mariners game and a Seattle overnighter.  Had we stayed longer it would have had everything we needed.  We'll definitely try and book this place again.
70138	3040278	9.0	10.0	47139848	Awesome apartment with amazing views. Jenn was very helpful. Thanks for everything!!
70139	3040278	9.0	10.0	47621444	Jen is amazing!  Her directions on everything was spot on and the view was exactly as shown in her pictures.  The apartment was very much like a home away from home feel.  Felt relaxed immediately.  Loved the place, the view and the location is incredible for sight seeing like we did.  
70140	3040278	9.0	10.0	48162372	Very nice place to stay with an amazing view over the Bay from the balcony. The apartment really showes who Jenn is with a lot of personal touch. It made it cozy to stay at the apartment. Very close to downtown and the water. Jenn was great to communicate with and in the apartment you will find lots of recommendation for bars, restaurants etc.. We would stay at Jenn's again. Tanja and Carsten 
70141	3040278	9.0	10.0	48677568	The title says it all - Amazing view, Amazing location.  We had everything we needed.  Jenn was very responsive to any questions. It really felt like you were staying in a friends apartment.  We will definitely stay again the next time we are in Seattle.
70142	3040278	9.0	10.0	49006985	Wonderful place to stay. We had 4 adults that fit comfortably in the two beds. The place is walking distance to most of the tourist attractions (pikes place, space needle, lots of food) We didn't have a car and walked or used a quick taxi ride. We would definitely stay here again. 
70143	3040278	9.0	10.0	50427358	Jenn was excellent at communication and her attention to detail is outstanding. Her apartment is really nice, very homey feel and in a great location. Jenn has so much information meticulously organised in her compendium and on her listing that you don't need to stress, she has got everything covered from transport, dining through to attractions. Jenn truly is a Superhost, best so far! Highly recommend
70144	3040278	9.0	10.0	50858972	"We really enjoyed our stay at Jenn's apartment. It was very cozy for a couple with a baby and another friend. We enjoyed the view too! 
The location is excellent. It's an easy walk to the Space Needle, the sculpture garden, Lower Queen Anne, and Belltown. In quick walks from the apartment we liked the Boat House Cafe and Petit Toulouse for eats. "
70145	3040278	9.0	10.0	51264126	Such a cozy place!  I felt so warm and welcomed at Jenn's place!  Very close to the Space Needle and all it's wonderful attractions.  A quick Monorail ride away from downtown shopping and Pike Market.  Very nice! The view from the master was a nice sight to wake up to. 
70146	3040278	9.0	10.0	51735745	The reviews speak for themselves. Everyone loves this location, accommodations, and Jenn. I agree with all the 5 star ratings. If in Seattle this is a must book apartment.
70147	3040278	9.0	10.0	53831313	"Jenn's place is perfect! It has a fantastic view, and is close to everything! Seattle Center and downtown. The neighbourhood offers great restaurants and shopping, and the apartment is homey, and really nice. 2 bedrooms and very comfortable beds.
We are actually staying here 3 more days, and will return!
I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Saettle. Jenn is also super sweet and answered all my questions immediately. Great host, great apartment!"
70148	3040278	9.0	10.0	54124410	"Jenn is a great host....she answers questions immediately and was a very flexible with our check-in and check-out.
Her apartment is a wonderful 2 bedroom, with a great view, and has everything you need. The beds are very comfortable, and we had a wonderful stay. It has an extraordinary view over Puget Sound, and is located in lower Queen Anne close to shopping, Seattle Center and restaurants!
We will definitely stay again and I highly recommend Jenn's apartment!
"
70149	3040278	9.0	10.0	54751970	Weekend trip to Seattle for a friend's birthday & booked Jenn's condo. WOW, that was a GREAT idea! Very nice accomodations & hostess! 
70662	6780670	9.0	9.0	35046246	Talitha's apartment was everything we expected from the photographs and more! It was very neat, tidy and extremely cozy. And her vintage decor and design made it feel like were were in a trendy hotel! Talitha was very warm and friendly and really helpful in sharing with us fun places to check out and great spots to eat. I would definitely stay here again! Especially since it is so close to downtown and within walking distance to the Spaceneedle!
70663	6780670	9.0	9.0	35973356	"Talitha's vintage apartment was perfect! The apartment itself is clean and comfortable, plus she has a great sense of style. Our arrival time turned out to be later than we expected and she was gracious and flexible. She made sure we had a few snacks and drinks waiting when we first arrived. The location is great and we were able to walk most places or take a 10 minute drive to other locations. 

There is plenty of free parking, though it can be difficult to find a spot. However, we were visiting during the U.S. Open, so the whole city was bit more congested than usual. It wasn't burdensome and can be expected in the city.

We got to spend some time hanging with her before we left and it was great getting to know a bit about her. We would definitely stay with Talitha again!"
70664	6780670	9.0	9.0	36727217	Talitha was so nice! She had fruit waiting for us and was very accommodating when we were running late checking in. The apartment was quaint, comfortable and perfect for our stay.
70665	6780670	9.0	9.0	39084624	"Talitha was a good communicator. She left us some snacks and fruit. The apartment was in a pretty convenient location, and was nicely decorated. Only complaint was the cleanliness. Was informed that the apartment had been ""professionally cleaned"" but the bedsheets had many hairs on them and the bed didn't have a bottom (fitted) sheet. We ended up buying a cheap set of sheets to use during our stay."
70666	6780670	9.0	9.0	40983532	Talitha was a great host! She was very nice and accommodating to my special requests. Her apartment is in an ideal location with plenty of restaurants and activities nearby. Inside has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Talitha has an eye for decor, you will notice little details all over the apartment that make it really special. I stayed on a Saturday and had no problem finding free street parking. Overall it was a fun stay, I highly recommend Talitha and her quaint vintage apartment. 
70667	6780670	9.0	9.0	44239413	Talitha's place, more lovely than her photos depict, is a peaceful, thoughtful retreat in the middle of bustling Seattle. It was a great home base for my first Airbnb experience! If you enjoy the charm and character of old buildings and architecture, you will enjoy staying at Talitha's. The air outside was unusually muggy and smoky from forest fires and Talitha was thoughtful enough to provide cold, fresh fruit and water which was so refreshing at the end of the day. Couple things to note: you will definitely hear the neighbors moving about, although infrequently, but if you're not used to apartment living, this may bother you. Also, as a person of tall stature (6 ft.), I found the lower height of the shower-head a bit challenging, however the rest of the apartment is very open, airy and spacious. Nice comfy bed, lovely ambiance and great neighborhood access to restaurants and nightlife. Stay here! 
71814	9034515	9.0	9.0	55860463	i love Luke and Laila - they are terrific hosts, welcoming and very friendly.  they are full of enthusiasm and love the area and were a great source of information on what to do and where to go to have fun in Seattle.  their cottage shows a lot of loving attention to detail and is very comfortable.  i loved that i could walk to the beach park from their house.  the location was great - conveniently located near Seattle downtown city amenities without having to deal with the highway traffic.  
71815	9034515	9.0	9.0	57937830	Laila & Luke's North Beach Studio Cottage was great. We came here with the intention of finding great craft beer and delicious food, and we found it -- right in the cottage! They were so thoughtful over the holidays and went so far as sharing a bottle of their favorite IPA with us. They even left us a chocolate bar as a snack, and had a carton of egg nog in the fridge (which we did not get around to enjoying). We enjoyed our time here in Seattle and loved how quiet and easily accessible the neighborhood was. Parking was never an issue, and were very comfortable in our little cottage thanks to the 2 heaters! Laila & Luke were diligent in providing all necessary toiletries, should you forget them at home. The kitchen was stocked, and the bathroom was filled with everything you may need. 
72102	3689416	9.0	9.0	16872521	My pet and I had a wonderful experience staying with Lauren. The place was very clean and cozy, spa like atmosphere with many amenities. Moreover Lauren was more than a good host and even walked my dog while I was away. I am definitely looking forward to going back!
72103	3689416	9.0	9.0	17312697	Listing was accurate--neighborhood isn't the best, but I knew that going into it.  It's heavily residential dense within walking distance of Aurora which is like the 82nd Ave. of Seattle (if you're from Portland you'll get my reference).  The home was well kept and clean, and had parking as well.  The host is very nice, and wish I could've chatted with her more but was on the move.  Nice kitchen and has internet.
72104	3689416	9.0	9.0	17479871	Lauren is a awesome host and her place is very nice and clean. Highly recommended! 
72105	3689416	9.0	9.0	17662567	Lauren was very gracious and accommodating on very short notice.  A peaceful environment (and I didn't even take advantage of the pool or the nearby lake park access).  And a small, friendly pet that adjusts to you quite quickly! Lauren is quite in tune with how to get around the area and is generous with her information.  I most enjoyed the casual chat with her friends where I learned about the hitherto secret world of theater costume production.
72106	3689416	9.0	9.0	17810960	We thought this place was a private appt untill we arrived and found its her appt and she has a small dog which unfortunately im allergic to dogs so it was too vague for me.   
72107	3689416	9.0	9.0	18135879	Lauren was a great host. She was very kind and explained a lot about the city and how to get places. Her great apartment was also wonderful. The bed was comfortorbale, the pool was big, and the apt was very clean. We loved Ellie her dog she is just adorable! We are definitely. Staying here again!
72108	3689416	9.0	9.0	20579346	Lauren was absolutely fantastic as a hostess. She gave me full run of the house and incredibly inviting. I would stay here again no question. It is conveniently located for driving, biking or bus.
72109	3689416	9.0	9.0	22428276	"Staying at Lauren's home was great. The house is situated in a good place, it is easy to get downtown by bus. Lauren was kind and considerate, she helped me when I needed. Her dog is really fun! 
The only drawback was a little noise in the room because of vehicles outside. "
72110	3689416	9.0	9.0	34659595	Welcome messages left for us. We didn't struggle at all. We were welcome very nicely by Lauren. Yes, the listing description was accurate. We didn't get much time to interact with Neighborhood. 
72111	3689416	9.0	9.0	35110709	impeccably clean and well appointed. Very convenient for our event, Parking a bit challenging. Good experience
72112	3689416	9.0	9.0	35844121	I booked Lauren's place for some of my colleagues from out of town so I didn't stay at her place myself and didn't get to meet Lauren in person. But my colleagues had a nice stay and enjoyed some of the amenities of the property.  The space was good for two, but tight for 3. 
72113	3689416	9.0	9.0	41671656	Lauren was very organized and welcoming, and the apartment is very nice and clean. Comfortable bed, and plenty of room in closet and dresser drawers to store my things. Little dog was sweet, well behaved and quiet.
72114	3689416	9.0	9.0	48285719	I had a nice stay and really enjoyed the time. The apartment is really nice and clean. I had my own parking lot. Lauren was absolutely great as a hostess and it was a pleasure meeting her. 
72673	6994406	9.0	10.0	41627257	Cute house - would be great for families with small children. Quiet neighborhood. Loved all the little notes with helpful tips. Vase of fresh flowers on the table, nice touch. Didn't realize from the pictures how low the beds were, not easy for an arthritic 60 year old to get up in the morning, haha. 
72674	6994406	9.0	10.0	42414616	This was my first experience with airbnb and I couldn't be more pleased. The home is beautiful, the neighborhood is lovely, and instructions from the host were made perfectly clear! Communication was excellent and the listing was accurately described. 
73474	3250577	9.0	9.0	37816695	Pavel is a great host.  I have been to his house twice an its great!!!   
73475	3250577	9.0	9.0	38060260	The room was nice and fairly large. It had plenty of room for 2 people and a couple of suitcases. The cat was very friendly and came down to greet us and stayed for a couple of pets. The host was very flexible and made sure everything went smoothly, even accommodated special check-in/check-out times.  
73476	3250577	9.0	9.0	39137884	You can launch in almost any direction from Pavel's basement space and get to cool things within minutes. In one direction Green Lake Park to run around...another direction a beach at Golden Gardens Park on Shilshole Bay....and in another all of downtown is within 15 or so minutes. The room is clean and pretty large..and the shower particularly is nice.  Not much interaction with Pavel himself but he was always there and responsive to any small issues or requests.  I explored Seattle from this space...and had a great time doing it!
73477	3250577	9.0	9.0	40411475	He was very communicative with helpful bus instructions. VERY flexible when it came to check out time. Some of the furnishings are tacky but it has everything you need. There is an air mattress if the twin sized bed isn't enough.
73478	3250577	9.0	9.0	42009493	"Pavel was a superb host. Very accommodating.

No complaints whatsoever. I only have praise for Pavel and how smoothly everything went.

The room was much bigger than pictured, which was a pleasant surprise. The neighborhood is a quiet suburb, which felt welcoming and homey.

For me, the experience was all-around perfect."
73483	7349099	9.0	9.0	39718864	Houssam was great with my last minute booking and was very prompt with any questions that I had! 
73484	7349099	9.0	9.0	40178940	Houssams apartment was perfect. Everything was exactly as described and ready for us when we arrived.  Very quick in responding to my last minute requests.  Definitely would stay again!  A+
73485	7349099	9.0	9.0	42500348	Wonderful place, really nice people, no surprises, and great neighborhood!  Thanks so much for the hospitality, the space was perfect and the bed was comfy!  We will definitely be coming back :)
73486	7349099	9.0	9.0	42617699	Very nice and clean basement apartment with friendly host.  Houssam made us feel very welcome and the apartment was cozy.
73487	7349099	9.0	9.0	43844900	"I am a single young woman who stayed for a week at the basement apartment. The apartment was lovely. Complimentary chocolate as well, so welcoming!  It is a one bedroom with a study but with no doors dividing  the rooms except bathroom, but plenty of space! The pictures are exactly what you get. If you are looking for a cozy place to stay with an awesome family above you this place is it. You can hear some rumblings from upstairs but they don't start before quiet hours end in the morning and they end by 10:30 every night. If you want a quiet place to be in Seattle but not hear the bustle this place is great. Quick 20 minutes to get downtown Seattle on the bus, literally a 3 minute walk from the door of the apartment. The neighborhood is quite lovely too. If you stroll along 73rd towards 5th there are lovely homes and shops as well. The entire family were great hosts!  I would definitely stay again if I come back to Seattle! 
"
73488	7349099	9.0	9.0	44570689	Houssam was more than generous: he even gave my group beer! Great and easy communication. We blew a fuse and he was so chill about it. Really enjoyed our stay.
73494	5123904	9.0	10.0	27882754	We couldn't believe our luck to have found such a wonderful place.  We stayed for a week with the adorable house to ourselves in a fantastic neighborhood. It was great to be able to use the back patio and walk/run to the nearby parks,restaurants, and shops. Emily made us feel at home, she left a note with 'how to's' for the house and recommendations of things to do. We had everything we needed to cook at home, which saved us a bundle. The soap, shampoo and conditioner were really helpful. We also worked a lot from the kitchen area, and all the windows and natural light were really pleasant. 
73495	5123904	9.0	10.0	28099579	Emily was a fantastic hostess.  She offered assistance with booking, restaurants, and anything additional she could help with.  The house was in a wonderful neighborhood - a great place to go for a walk.  The older home was perfect for our family of 3.  The only thing that would have made for a better stay would have been to have window coverings on the bedroom windows, especially on the ground floor/basement bedroom.  
73496	5123904	9.0	10.0	28559169	I'd love to stay at Emily & Kyle's place again. Emily was very helpful & friendly in communications prior to our stay. Upon arrival, we felt very welcomed with clear instructions/information about the home and neighborhood. And what a lovely neighborhood it is; I loved walking through it. We were in walking distance to a great park, the zoo, and various restaurants. The photos of the home are spot-on. There's a lot of natural light, and the convenience of a full kitchen to cook in made our stay even more comfortable. Wish we had a few more days there!
73497	5123904	9.0	10.0	29549661	the host is very welcoming, accommodating and responded to my questions fast.
73498	5123904	9.0	10.0	30127795	Nice house- basic furnishings but comfortable. Emily left us a bottle of wine (so sweet!) Nice decks- but too cold while we were there to enjoy. Great location. Would stay there again. 
73499	5123904	9.0	10.0	30796447	Emily was so great with communication! The house was perfect and in the most cutest neighborhood. A quiet residential area, but close to everything we needed! I would definitely recommend it!
73500	5123904	9.0	10.0	33894747	Thank you Emily and Kyle. Your Craftsman home was perfect for visiting and entertaining our Seattle children. Our first grandson was born during this stay and will make it all the more memorable. The kitchen and dining were spacious for my cooking needs. The street was wonderfully quiet. I hope to return to your wonderful place on my next visit to Seattle.
73501	5123904	9.0	10.0	37680968	Great little house in a cool part of Seattle.  Emily and Kyle were very communicative and super helpful with all our needs and questions.  The house is walkable to everything you need (Coffee, bars, pizza and an unbelievably delicious pie shop!!!)  
73502	5123904	9.0	10.0	39880582	Great place! Easy to find and close to a lot of excellent rsstaurants and cafes! 5-10 min to downtown, 2 min to Ballard and Fremont! Would stay again, excellent hosts! Clean house, easy check-in and out!! Thank you
73503	5123904	9.0	10.0	42411436	Emily and Kyle's house was wonderful!  It was clean and looked exactly like the pictures and was in a great neighborhood.  Emily was very responsive when I had a question.  I would definitely recommend Emily and Kyle's house!
75502	1145148	9.0	9.0	5117569	What a wonderful stay we had at Gardenlife Sanctuary!  From the cozy sleeping accommodations to the peaceful and beautiful yard...we couldn't have found a more enjoyable place to stay on our recent visit to Seattle.  The home is a quick drive to the beach and only 15 minutes to Safeco & CenturyLink Field (avoiding all the crazy traffic).  Jessie Rey & Maketa were perfect hosts.  They prepared a map to help us navigate around the area as well as instructions to help with items in the home.  If you are considering Gardenlife Sanctuary, you won't be disappointed.
75503	1145148	9.0	9.0	6119054	"A lovely, relaxing, peaceful retreat to come ""home"" to after a full day of sightseeing in Seattle. The garden was enchanting, and we stayed outdoors as late as possible playing bubbles, talking, and lounging in the hammock. The interior is tastefully styled, and little bouquets, leaves, and live plants bring the charm of the garden inside the home. The alleyway neighborhood looks a little rough, but once you get inside the driveway, it feels like your own little sanctuary. We felt safe and the guys walked around the neighborhood for snacks and to pick up a few meals - no problems. The energy in the garden and the home is serene, peaceful, and energizing.  

There's no microwave in the home, and although we don't use one in our home either (EMF!), the other couple with us found it odd. Just plan ahead to use the oven and stove, and you'll be fine. There is also no TV cable, but the Apple device connected to our iPhones seamlessly, and we were able to stream Netflix and Hulu. Again, not a huge issue with us since we spent most of our time outdoors and sightseeing.

Overall, this was  LOVELY place to stay, and we will DEFINITELY be contacting Jessie Rey and Maketa again next time we're in town!! "
75504	1145148	9.0	9.0	6399221	Great place to stay while in Seattle. Jesse and Maketa's place is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle of Seattle, which is a short bus ride away. The place was clean and plenty of room for my group. I highly recommend.
75505	1145148	9.0	9.0	6472225	"GardenLife Sanctuary was a delightful place to stay with a beautiful yard and gardens.  The home was immaculately clean and well organized, complete with fresh flowers in every room.  Jessie Rey and Maketa also provided a house manual and info about the neighborhood.  They were always very prompt in responding to messages and provided a neighbor's contact information in case we needed immediate assistance.

My family and I very much enjoyed our time there, both in the home and in the yard, where we had a lovely picnic dinner to celebrate both of my sisters getting married.

I highly recommend GardenLife Sanctuary to other Airbnb guests."
75506	1145148	9.0	9.0	6942593	I could not met Jessie Rey & Maketa in person, but the service was great,  the house ws in great condition, written instructions for everything, so we were very pleased with the house. I only stayed one night, but everything is great.  the garden is beautiful,  so thank you for evrything Jessie and Marketa, and hoepfully next time I could stay longer!    regards  Antonio
75507	1145148	9.0	9.0	13479022	Jessie Rey and Maketa were amazing hosts. They let us check in early, and the house and backyard were pristine. The bathroom was also amazing. They even left some nice Trader Joe's shampoo/conditioner/body wash. How cool is that? Even though the house was SO CLOSE to downtown, it was extremely quiet and serene in the backyard. Awesome house. We definitely plan on booking this house the next time we come to Seattle.
75508	1145148	9.0	9.0	15119059	What a fabulous place, a truly serene setting only 10 mins from downtown. The place really felt like a home away from home, and both front and back gardens -as the listing suggests - were sanctuaries from the hustle-and-bustle of city life. Jessie Rey left great instructions for us, which let us enjoy the highlights of the neighbourhood, and feel like a true local! Highly recommended - our only regret is that we didn't stay longer...
75509	1145148	9.0	9.0	15755620	Experience dealing was smooth and very prompt. The place is just as described. A quiet and serene atmosphere. I would definitely repeat if I had the opportunity and I highly recommend it.
75510	1145148	9.0	9.0	17672262	This home was as presented in its ad. Very comfortable rooms throughout, with ample room for relaxation inside, where several good-sized windows can be opened to let the cool, fresh Seattle breezes flow thru. The table & chairs on the elevated deck overlook the charming yard & gardens, providing a delightful place to dine or just chill. The location is awesome: downtown by reliable,  on-time bus route 120 in under 15 mins. Good neighborhood coffee shops, creperie, pizza, pho, Italian & Mexican eateries within easy walking distance. Also a 10 min walk to a beautiful urban forest trail walk. Having full kitchen and laundry in-house makes extended stay easy-peasy. Highly recommended!
75511	1145148	9.0	9.0	36969989	"Nice house with high porch, overlooking a beautiful little garden. Great location for easy access to city center. 
No access to washer/dryer was a bit inconvenient for a longer stay (but known from stated information). No microwave."
75512	1145148	9.0	9.0	39917598	My husband and I traveled with another couple to Seattle for the weekend. We chose this house in large part because both of the gentlemen are fairly big guys, so it was important to find a place with two beds that were at least queen-sized, and we were happy to find that here. The house is exactly as it looks, with the best features being the deck and backyard. Very private and relaxing. The hosts were extremely helpful without intruding at all, and very easy to communicate with. We found West Seattle to be super convenient and fun, and would definitely stay in that area again. A great time had by all!
75513	1145148	9.0	9.0	41069435	"The Sanctuary was exactly as described, a beautiful home. The owners were very mindful of what a guest would want. They left us everything we could need, a stocked fridge even! 

The drawers and closets they wanted private were clearly marked, and we were left plenty of space for ourselves, which made me as a guest feel better about being in their home. 

Perfect location to get in and out of town fast via our rental car or an Uber driver. They made our first trip to the Pacific Northwest amazing. Some afternoons we would just watch Netflix and sit in the house with the cool breeze."
75514	1145148	9.0	9.0	42267533	Very smooth booking and communications with Jessie Rey. The house was well kept, clean and comfortable.  We had a great time and would highly recommend the house.

76303	7843145	9.0	9.0	53699656	Carla's home was so comfortable and the hot tub was fantastic. She was available quickly to inquire about booking and sent all the info we needed to make our stay go smoothly. The bed was a dream, I couldn't wait to get into it at night after a super relaxing soak in the hot tub. Very clean home. The neighborhood was close in driving distance to shops and restaurants, and home is on a quiet residential street with other nice homes. 
76304	7843145	9.0	9.0	55853330	Carla was very prompt communicating with me and was flexible with our check-out time. Her home was wonderful; clean, great location, safe, warm, comfortable, perfect for our needs.  The hot tub was enticing but unfortunately we weren't able to fit it into our schedule.  I would definiitely stay here again and highly recommend Carla's home. 
76305	7843145	9.0	9.0	56231861	Carla was very welcoming and was available via text for questions that we had. it was easy to find and easy to get in and overall just an easy and nice (website hidden) was a wonderful stay!
76306	7843145	9.0	9.0	56955930	Our stay was lovely! It was easy to find and close to everything! I love that it was decorated for the holidays. The listed in exactly as described: beds are comfy and hot tub is nice & toasty. Carla was easy to get a hold of for any questions. I would definitely stay here again. 
77569	5297143	9.0	10.0	26577349	Matt was a great host. He was prompt in communicating and his apt is in a very nice part of capitol hill.. I would recommend his apt. to travelers on a budget who would like to be near the center of the city but just far enough away from the commotion.  Cheers, Cara
77570	5297143	9.0	10.0	35687447	"Matt gave very good details on locating his apartment (written instruction and photos) and on the check-in process. He answered my emails immediately and was attentive to a couple of questions that arose.

The location is great and and the living room/ dining area in the apartment is spacious. "
77571	5297143	9.0	10.0	41962921	"Don't stay anywhere else in Seattle!
Matt was a great host and his place is perfect.  My wife and I were in Seattle for 3 days before heading to Vancouver, then on to Whistler.  Matt's apartment in Capitol Hill was very comfortable.  The perfect place to call home.  Right across the street from an amazing park.  A 10 minute bus ride, with a bus stop right out front of the apartment, to all that needs to be seen in Seattle.  Plus a 10 minute walk to the heart of Capitol Hill to enjoy the city's best bars, restaurants, shopping, and sunsets.  Matt's local knowledge had us all dialed in for an amazing 3 day stay. 
We will be back.  Thanks again Matt for your help with an incredible trip!"
77572	5297143	9.0	10.0	53500545	Matt was a great host! The apartment looked just like the pictures, Matt sent a great instructional email with pictures attached and made it super easy to find the place even at 10pm at night coming off a flight. The location was perfect- right next to Volunteer park, free parking, close to so many great parks and views and restaurants and bars. We had a great experience with the apartment and would highly recommend it to anyone. 
77573	5297143	9.0	10.0	55008652	"My daughter (age 14) and I had a great time staying at Matt's place. It was very nice, clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the art and photography on the walls. The apartment was lovely. Across the street from where the apartment is is a really beautiful park.

The neighborhood was perfect for us. We walked just a few blocks down to a really cute neighborhood within Capitol Hill, lots of places to eat and shop. We walked down  further and had more restaurant, coffee shop and shopping options. We walked even further and enjoy the walk to Pikes Place Market and enjoyed the other sightseeing that was available in the area. 

I would highly recommend staying here. I completely fell in love with Seattle. Matt was a great host and he was very friendly and helpful. I have nothing but good things to say about my stay. "
77582	4388148	9.0	10.0	21928011	Jordan was incredibly hospitable and a fantastic host. Getting the room was seamless and easy, and communication never once was an issue. If you are ever in Seattle, his home is a great headquarters to truly experience the city.
77583	4388148	9.0	10.0	22410723	We had a lovely experience at Jordan's studio! Jordan was helpful and very quick to respond to our last-minute questions about check-in/out, wifi, keys, etc. The apartment itself was simple and clean, very comfortable for two people.

77585	4388148	9.0	10.0	22545805	Our stay in Jordan's suite was great! The place was clean, bed was comfortable and location was awesome - street parking was a bit tricky but we eventually found a spot down the street. Applesauce was the sweetest kitty ever and made the experience even better.  
77586	4388148	9.0	10.0	22742736	We had a great stay at Jordan's apartment! Jordan was quick to respond to questions we had and the apartment was lovely with many snuggles from the cutest cat ever. We really enjoyed staying here.

We had the pleasure of hosting the cat, also, who is super nice and friendly. He's easy and comes and goes. The location is amazing for breakfast and dinner: Olympia Pizza & Costal kitchen are fantastic. The Wander Goose for breakfast is amazing. Not to mention the cafes. Don't forget the Asian Art Museum and grave of Bruce Lee that is right around the corner. 
77591	4388148	9.0	10.0	23638220	Had a great time in Seattle staying here. The cat is very chill and was no additional work. The place is also walking distance to a lot of great pubs. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Seattle:)
77592	4388148	9.0	10.0	23766989	Great little place, convenient to one of the best parts of town. I recommend a walk through the greenhouse conservatory in Volunteer park. Comfy bed and adorable cat. I would stay again.

The cat is adorable! Very lovely :) "
77594	4388148	9.0	10.0	23994902	"We were welcomed with a bottle of wine. He checked up on us later that night to make sure we got settled OK.  The neighborhood was beautiful and we enjoyed walking around admiring the neighborhood's personality. The bus stop was near giving us easy transport to downtown. The ONLY downside was the construction sites next door. 
Applesauce was charming and cuddly. So friendly and made the place more homy. 
Great value for the location. Worked great for our purposes. "
77595	4388148	9.0	10.0	24182646	Me and my boyfriend absolutely enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Jordan's appartment matched the description, and we had a great time there. It was really cozy to have Applesauce, Jordan's cat around :) The only negative thing was that there was a lot of noise from the heating element in the room and from the construction site outside the window. 
77596	4388148	9.0	10.0	25259602	Cute, clean place as shown in pics. Applesauce the cat was adorable and led us right to the correct apartment. Only two blocks to a street with many options for dining. Didn't hear any of the construction others mentioned, so maybe they don't work weekends or the project is done. Host responded quickly, with clear instructions. Would stay again.
77597	4388148	9.0	10.0	25325628	Jordan's place was great. To start off with, Applesauce is one of the nicest cats I've ever met. Jordan's apartment was tidy and well decorated, and there was plenty of space for two or three people. The area is close to lots of restaurants and bars, and public transportation was easy to access. Jordan left us a bottle of wine, and was in touch quickly when contacted. Would definitely stay again.
77598	4388148	9.0	10.0	25551623	"Jordan apartment was perfect for my weekend getaway to Seattle! It has all the basics i needed for a comfortable stay. The cat was cute and friendly, no trouble at all.
However, what really stand out about his place is the location, ultra convenient to lots of shops, cafes, and restraurants, all were steps away. If i need to get down to lower capitol hill, and didn't feel like to walk, Uber is easy and inexpensive to use. This was my first time using Airbnb in over 2 years and was a great experience. Thanks Jordan!!"
77599	4388148	9.0	10.0	26511744	"Jordan was very quick to respond and was very helpful with my forst experience with an airbnb stay.  The location was great with a walgreens less than a block away and also with lots of nice restaurants, bars and coffee shops close by.  There was a safeway a couple of blocks down and it was about a 15-20 minute walk to the Capitol Hill area where there are more bars, restaurants, etc.  

All in all it was a great, last minute 1 night stay and we were lucky to find this place in the area for such a great price."
77600	4388148	9.0	10.0	26912437	We didn't meet Jordan during our 4-night stay, but everything was easily arranged and the key was exactly where he said it would be.  The cozy studio suited our needs and is conveniently located in a great neighborhood steps from cafes, restaurants, bars, markets, pharmacy, a great bakery, and public transportation.  There is a pretty view of the sunrise from the kitchen window.  Jordan's cat was very friendly and took care of itself.
77601	4388148	9.0	10.0	27255348	We didn't meet Jordan however the apartment was exactly what we needed. Comfortable, clean and extremely cheerful place with lots of great natural lighting. The best part was the location - just blocks away from great restaurants and bars and made it extremely convenient.  Applesauce, the cat, was another charming addition to the apartment and even though he kept to himself mostly, it made the experience all the more fun. Highly recommended, would certainly stay here again.
77602	4388148	9.0	10.0	27912515	The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
77603	4388148	9.0	10.0	28702506	The space, location, and host were amazing! Jordan was quick at getting back to me whenever I had a question and was very accomodating. It was our first time in Seattle and it turned out so well in part by being able to stay at Jordan's rental. The space was cozy and welcoming and very comfortable for two. The bed and couch and pillows are highly recommended as they allowed for a very comfortable stay. Applesauce was the perfect little housemate, she's so friendly and low maintenance. Everything was close by. We walked EVERYWHERE and when our feet complained there were bus stops conveniently located nearby. Good restaurants surrounded us; we had lovely breakfasts a couple of blocks away every morning before heading out to explore the city. I cannot recommend this place enough. Coastal Kitchen, Jamjuree, Harry's Bar and Olympia Pizza were a couple of favorites nearby.
77604	4388148	9.0	10.0	29049300	Nice little spot outside of downtown. Walking distance to restaurants and bars. 
77605	4388148	9.0	10.0	30387653	The apartment was great for our needs, and well priced for what we got.  Note that there is a flight of stairs to climb.  Everything was prepared for our arrival.  Capitol Hill location is excellent; 15th Ave is just one block over, with abundant coffee shops, good restaurants, craft beer bars, etc.  It's in a small apartment building in a quiet and very attractive neighborhood.  Will very likely stay again.
77606	4388148	9.0	10.0	31177171	We arrived a little early and Jordan welcomed us in with a nice chat about the local places.   Great neighborhood with lots of bars, coffee shops, grocery stores and major bus routes within a few blocks. The apartment was properly represented and we were even able to do some laundry in the coin op machines downstairs.  Jordan was quick with communication if we had any questions.  Applesauce the cat had important things to do outside but would pencil us in for some belly rubs, playtime and cuddling.  The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was easy to use. We would definitely stay again.
77607	4388148	9.0	10.0	32916608	Jordan was so accommodating! The apartment had all the basic hotel essentials - he even threw in some beverages and a train pass!! The apartment was near all the things we needed - amazing food, good shopping and uniques sites.

77609	4388148	9.0	10.0	34117567	Jordan's studio apartment is an older style but is functional and clean. Importantly there is WiFi and good TV; exactly what a tired traveler sometimes needs.
77610	4388148	9.0	10.0	34362561	Stayed at Jordan's place with my girlfriend for 2 nights. Excellent location - walking distance from great food+drink options. Place was pretty much as described/pictured. A little dusty but not too bad. It is a little difficult to find parking but not much to do about that but be patient. We didn't actually meet Jordan - but he was responsive to our texts and messages and we had no trouble. Overall a positive experience. 
77611	4388148	9.0	10.0	35584449	It was very nice to stay at Jordan's apartment! The neighborhood was quiet and safe and convenient! There was a little construction noise, but it was fine since it only started after around 10am. The cat Applesauce was a very lovely cat! We enjoyed playing with her. We would always expect to see her at he front door when we came back home. She is definitely something special during the stay!
77612	4388148	9.0	10.0	35836367	Jordan's place was exactly as described. We were so happy to have a cute kitty that would come and go as it pleased! It was very easy to find the location and super convenient to a lot of shops and restaurants. The parking is the only thing that was a little tough but that's what you get when ur in a city. I definitely recommend this place and we would stay again if we passed thru Seattle!
77613	4388148	9.0	10.0	36419354	Perfectly described and Jordan was kind enough to leave some refreshments in the fridge for me. Great communication and easy to work with the entire time. In addition, highly recommend for convenience and location.
77614	4388148	9.0	10.0	36648729	"Great place, very comfy bed, Chromecast is a big plus!
Applesauce is a sweety, always around for some love and belly rubs.
Bit of construction noise but nothing crazy. Also quite warm but when it's 30°c + outside that's just a given!
Overall great place, you won't be disappointed!"
77615	4388148	9.0	10.0	37105905	Jordan's place was outstanding! The apartment is located in a really fun neighborhood with numerous places to eat and drink within a block. The apartment was very clean, kitchen was stocked. Jordan made every attempt to make us feel welcome, from leaving the window fan on (during Seattle's record-breaking heat wave!) to stocking the fridge with bottled water! He was very good at communicating and it felt like we were staying with a friend instead of a stranger. The apartment was just a joy to stay in, impeccably decorated and the cat Applesauce was very friendly. The bed was comfortable, and the even though the shower was small the water pressure was on point. This was my first time using Airbnb and now I'm hooked!
77616	4388148	9.0	10.0	38438588	Jordan's apartment has a lot of charm and made my stay in Seattle enjoyable.

It was very nicely furnished and he had kindly stocked up everything for his guests. From the stocked fridge to all the toiletries in the bathroom, Jordan provided us with a great stay. 
His studio is located in Capitol Hill where safeway and local food stores are close and convenient. 
We couldnt be more happier with out stay! "
77620	4388148	9.0	10.0	40375498	What a great spot in a great location! If you are looking to be near the hub of Capitol Hill, this is the spot. Clean and airy, the apartment was perfect for two people. Jordan was so helpful and getting in and out was a breeze. Would definitely come back!

77625	4388148	9.0	10.0	43819185	Capitol Hill was a perfect location for our first trip to Seattle. Our airbnb was near grocery stores, delicious restaurants, trendy bars, convenient public transportation, attractions and sites, and everything necessary to make for a successful trip. The listing was very comfortable and clean and the towels and bath amenities were a major plus for someone who had to pack light. It's located in a quiet neighborhood, so sleeping at night with windows slightly open was not an issue at all. Jordan was very accommodating and helpful! Would definitely stay again. Wish we got to meet Applesauce!
77626	4388148	9.0	10.0	44585686	"Pros: Jordan's place had the ideal location right in the heart of Capitol Hill. With this prime location, the apartment is still very quiet and I had no trouble sleeping and relaxing there. I really appreciated how clean and tidy the place was when I arrived.  Pictures of the space are accurate. I will add: The bed is super comfy.

Host: Jordan was a responsive host and was thoughtful enough to leave me snacks and food for my stay. 

Cons: Like many Seattle apartments, this one has an old built-in carpet. Not much you can do about that; and this is very evident in the pictures. But: If you have allergies, take note."
77627	4388148	9.0	10.0	44807277	Comfortable place in a great neighborhood! Jordan was an excellent host and very communicative. Definitely recommend this place as a base to enjoy Capitol Hill.

77629	4388148	9.0	10.0	46014290	Never met Jordan but he was very friendly and accomodating. The place was everything I had expected from reading the review. Bus 10 picked up a short 3 min walk away and took us to the middle of downtown Seattle. There were also some great places to eat and a couple of grocery stores within very close walking distance. It was a great stay here!
77630	4388148	9.0	10.0	47825106	The place was easy to find and was exactly as listed. The fridge was stocked with water and breakfast foods, and all were offered to me which was great! Jordan always responded to questions instantly so communication was very good. The place was also one block away from a street full of restaurants, so plenty of food options close by. Would definitely stay again!
77631	4388148	9.0	10.0	48153729	Great location and terrific host. Perfect place to walk to broadway, 15th, parks, and if you like long walks, downtown. Jordan was very accommodating and replied almost immediately to every question we had. Also left necessities in bathroom and kitchen. Highly recommend!
77632	4388148	9.0	10.0	48747050	Jordan was in the area when we arrived at his apartment so he was able to stop by and give us the keys personally. Jordan was very thoughtful - when we arrived he had a bottle of wine and 2 glasses out for us. He also left bottled water, orange juice, Greek yogurt, eggs, bacon, and English muffins in the refrigerator for us to eat for breakfast. Jordan was accessible throughout our stay; I had to contact him for help getting Netflix to work and he responded very quickly. It is a small space but this is advertised in the listing so I was not surprised. Overall, Jordan was a very accommodating host.
77633	4388148	9.0	10.0	49957742	Great experience with Jason and this apartment.  Nice and clean little place, great location.
77634	4388148	9.0	10.0	51189516	Jordan was such a good host! He gave full description how to locate the key and everything and he also made sure that we had a good stay and even left food and wine in the refrigerator! Location was good, close to bars and restaurants, which I wanted and it wasn't far from downtown! But be aware, parking sucks at night but other than that, had a good stay at Jordan's place. When I go back to Seattle, I know where to stay again!
77635	4388148	9.0	10.0	51981472	Jordan certainly went above and beyond by leaving us a bottle of wine and a fully stocked fridge.  We loved the neighborhood and felt very at home!
77636	4388148	9.0	10.0	52540434	Once again, I had a lovely stay at Jordan's. Clean, cozy, in a fantastic location, and I adore his cat, Applesauce! Will very likely stay here again. 
77637	4388148	9.0	10.0	57169492	Where to begin.. Jordan's apartment is awesome. It is in a wonderful part of town and has every amenity you could want without feeling like a hotel. The bed is like sleeping on a cloud and the bathroom is large and luxurious, with white fluffy towels. We will absolutely be staying here in the future. His apartment made for the best anniversary getaway imaginable!
77638	4388148	9.0	10.0	58378385	Jordan made our stay great - starting with leaving a bottle of wine! He was happy to offer his help in getting to know the area or give suggestions regarding anything in the city. The neighborhood was great and was walking distance to restaurants, bars and even a Walgreens. We loved our stay and Jordan was a great host!
77639	1432713	9.0	10.0	6378424	"I usually stay in high end hotels downtown and did not know what to expect when I decided to stay at Z's apartment.  Thank goodness I did.  I would normally come up to Capital HIll all the time anyway to eat dinner or have drinks with friends.  Great neighborhood.  Great restaurants.  Great vibe all around.  Z is an incredibly considerate and kind person and a phenomenal host. 

Great place for an artist, creative person or someone who appreciates the arts to stay.

77640	1432713	9.0	10.0	6437689	"My husband and I had such a wonderful experience! Z arranged for an airport pickup for us and even made us dinner reservations. The home was cool and comfortable and was in a perfect location - walking distance from all  the ""action"" and right next to a bus station is you'd prefer to ride instead of walk. 
It was a great experience all around, we would stay here again and would recommend it to others."
77641	1432713	9.0	10.0	6572782	Probably best to stay elsewhere. We came and left immediately. 
77642	1432713	9.0	10.0	6747916	"Z was an AMAZING host!! This was my first AirBnB experience, and I think I'm spoiled forever. First of all, Z's place is absolutely gorgeous---it's full of the most beautiful art + furniture that he made himself---and as fate would have it, he knows the friends I was visiting in Seattle, and they spoke well of him too, so he came amply recommended. He was a gracious host, obviously has hosted lots of people before (he had a ""house rules"" posted, menus from local restaurants, and suggestions of where to explore and what museum exhibits were open right then---a thoughtful tour guide), and he was totally responsive over text / email. The neighborhood is super cute, too, and it's pretty easy to find parking in the area. I would *absolutely* recommend Z's place to anyone traveling to Seattle, especially to artists who want to be surrounded by his awesome creativity in the place and get inspired. Thanks Z!"
77643	1432713	9.0	10.0	7040009	"Staying at Z's place was great. The location couldn't be better. It was my first time in Seattle and he was helpful to recommend places to go, restaurants to try, along with how to get around with the bus lines. There is a stop right outside of the building that gets you downtown and to Seattle Center and Pike Place Market. There are eclectic bars and restaurants a few blocks (easy walk) away. There is a wonderful Greek place also in walking distance. 

All in all, I will definitely be staying there next time I'm in Seattle!"
77644	1432713	9.0	10.0	7408093	"Z's apartment was the perfect place to stay for two days in Seattle. Clean, stylish, and perfectly located. 5 minutes walking to all the shops, bars and restaurants on 15th, and accessible by car from any other part of town. Our host was friendly, helpful and communicated quickly. While we didn't get to meet Mr. Z in person his nephew Drew let us in and brought us pastries our second day.  The bed is comfortable too!

It's an older building, so expect the fixtures to show their age. This didn't bother us though, everything was obviously carefully cleaned and cared for. "
77645	1432713	9.0	10.0	7715790	Z. is such a sweet host! He was very thoughtful and kind, showed us all we needed to know about his place and gave us recommendations for things to do and eat in the neighborhood.

It's a hip, cozy apt filled with unique furniture and beautiful artwork that is around great restaurants and bars. 
77650	1432713	9.0	10.0	10717169	My boyfriend and I could not have asked for a better first AirBnB experience than the one given to us by Mr. Z and his accommodations.  His apartment was incredibly spacious for two people and conveniently located next to public transit, making it easy for us to dart back and forth between downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill.  There were also tons of delicious food options just a short walk away from the apartment building, so it really felt like the entire city was at our fingertips!  
77651	1432713	9.0	10.0	11228344	Nobody can complain about the location. One block, one bus downtown and walking distance to everything on Capital Hill.  Z is great, place is unique and precious (good and bad), and very comfortable except the bed if you are a couple. I don't personally care if Cameron Crow stayed there or knows Z personally. Overall it was great and we had a wonderful sunny weekend in Seattle thanks to z.
77652	1432713	9.0	10.0	11474125	"Mr. Z graciously allowed us to stay in his apartment for my boyfriend's 40th birthday trip to Seattle. (Z even gave left a birthday card!) Such a great host, Z informed us of the local restaurants, hang outs and attractions - many we would have never known before. Not only do you get to stay in the Singles Apartment building but you get to enjoy his art and eclectic style. So if you are a movie buff or love art and culture, this is a great peaceful place.  
We had a great time!
Beware however if you're tall, the furniture is short! LOL"
77653	1432713	9.0	10.0	12036263	We had a wonderful stay in Z's apartment. Very convenient location with lots of restaurants and bars nearby. It was easy to walk downtown in about 30 minutes. Would stay again on our next visit to Seattle.

77655	1432713	9.0	10.0	12763939	"This was a great little apartment. My wife and I spent two nights here and we weren't long feeling right at home here. Located in the artsy area of capital hill (great views from here too) with bus outside door to downtown Seattle.
Zaxxr was a very friendly and attentive host and was very accommodating of our late arrival into Seattle. We also very much appreciated that he had left us coffee and other things for breakfast. Would happily stay here again.  "

77657	1432713	9.0	10.0	13157687	"Fantastic stay in Seattle with possibly the best Air BnB host I've had to date! If you're looking to stay in a quirky, artsy place in the middle of a great, convenient neighborhood, this is the spot! Mr. Z himself is very responsive, friendly, accommodating, and charming. He greeted us after our late arrival into Seattle from NYC, and directed us to some great neighborhood eats in walking distance from the apartment. The apartment itself is in a classic, older building, but it's well appointed and very comfortable. The apartment is super clean, and there is a TV should you get bored or rained out during your stay. The kitchen is well equipped for your needs (though we just made coffee and heated up leftovers), and the bed is comfy. Extra blankets/pillows/towels are available if you need them. Did I mention the neighborhood is great? The apartment is on or very close to several bus lines to get you to and from downtown, and across the street from a nice park. Safeway and QFC supermarkets are in very close walking distance if you need snacks/groceries. Being a museum professional, I am amazed by Mr. Z's collection and am grateful he shares it with his guests. If you truly want to feel like you're staying at ""your favorite uncle's home,"" as he puts it, stay with Mr. Z for a unique experience."

It had everything we needed and wanted, and it was super close (walking distance) to a lot of restaurants/bars/parks/etc. Mr Z was a gracious host, and left us a few things in the fridge to get us started. Def would stay here again when I go back to Seattle!
77659	1432713	9.0	10.0	13481702	"tl;dr:  Z is awesome, the apartment is awesome, and the neighborhood is awesome.  Stay here.

Z was an awesome host!  He met us at the apartment, showed us around, and gave us some tips on what to see/where to eat.  He was also thoughtful enough to supply us with a hairdryer upon check-in for my wife (we weren't sure if the apartment would have one or not).

The apartment is clean and cozy, and the bed was quite comfortable.  Other tenants at the apartment complex were pleasant and the noise from other apartments was quite minimal (we didn't hear anyone at night/early in the morning).

The part of Capitol Hill where the apartment complex is located is fantastic!  It's a very short walk up to 15th where there are two grocery stores, several coffee shops, and a few amazing restaurants and cafes.  19th ave. is also nearby and has coffee shops like Fuel and several restaurants.  If you want some suggestions on where to eat, ask Z.  He has several options readily available for any meal.

Volunteer Park is a short walk away (check out the views from the water tower!) and there is a bus stop right by the complex that can be used to reach downtown.

We had a fantastic time in Seattle, and we enjoyed renting from Z."

Going beyond the call of duty, Mr. Z provided stellar recommendations to local eateries and museums based off our interests.  If you're looking to enjoy Capitol Hill the apartment is in a prime location, while the bus stop across the street makes public transportation to the rest of the city very accessible.  The Apartment itself was extremely clean and outfitted with lots of personality and interesting art.  

I'm hoping we'll have the chance to stay there again sometime soon.

We walked all around iconic Capital Hill, Downtown, Lake Union, etc. and never felt like we were too far from ""home."" Mr. Z was such a gracious, helpful, sweet host. He had the apartment dressed with flowers, all the thoughtful amenities you might need, from soap to local coffee and every kind of cream you might want for your coffee. He checked in on us to make sure our stay was pleasant and was just wonderful from start to finish. I could go on forever. Awesomely decorated place, he's extremely knowledgeable of his area. Just great. Can't wait to go back!"
77662	1432713	9.0	10.0	14683574	We had an outstanding stay at the home of the very accommodating Mr. Z. We arrived late at night to find him waiting enthusiastically to receive us, with an array of personalized gifts (especially for our two-year-old son) to make our two week stay more comfortable. His home is exceptionally well-located, within walking distance from all the Capitol Hill and Central District restaurants, bars and shops—but not right in the hubbub; the peace and quiet at night kept us all well-rested. There is a great park for children across the street, with a water fountain to wade in on warm days (admittedly few this June). Volunteer and Interlaken Parks are other nearby attractions an easy walk away. 19th Avenue in the easternmost part of Capitol Hill has changed since we lived in Seattle, adding a nice (though pricey) grocery along with a new restaurant and gourmet ice cream along with the good options (the Kingfish and Fuel) that were already there. As for Mr. Z's apartment, it's eclectically and quirkily decorated with interesting art; comfortable and reasonably spacious for a one bedroom; the price is reasonable for Seattle; staying in the Singles building is fun if you have some nineties-era nostalgia; and the host himself could not be more generous and welcoming. We had a rental car and always found parking on 19th just outside the apartment, but bus connections to downtown are also frequent from the bus stop right outside.
77663	1432713	9.0	10.0	14754697	Staying at the 'Singles' movie bldg was an experience. Mr. Z was very outgoing and welcomed us right when we checked in. He showed us around, gave us recommendations and asked about us as people. The apartment was very eclectic. Overall, a pretty good experience.
77664	1432713	9.0	10.0	14868725	Mr Z is fantastic! Such a great soul and he was very welcoming. The place was impeccably clean when we arrived and he made us feel right at home (plus, the fridge was stocked with the essentials for breakfast!).

The space was very clean and well looked after. 
77666	1432713	9.0	10.0	15152272	What a gracious host with one of the most beautiful, clean and unique apartments in Seattle's quaint neighborhood, Capitol Hill.  Mr. Z did anything and everything to make us feel comfortable and at home.  He gave us many wonderful recommendations on places to eat, destinations to see and things to do, most of which we did and all of which made our trip that much more memorable.  The apartment itself is close to many great restaurants and bars and right beside a bus stop that will take you to downtown in 10 minutes or less. Overall, Mr. Z is one cool dude and our stay wouldn't have been the same without him!
77667	1432713	9.0	10.0	15324780	Mr. Z's place is very quirky and fun, and great for what we needed. Lots of great art, very clean, certainly comfortable. Conveniently located near some great dining (if you get a chance to try the ice-cream and cookies at 'Hello, Robin!' you really must), and a few of the transit stops. He was a very gracious host, and helped us out with plenty of useful tips for our stay in Seattle.
77668	1432713	9.0	10.0	15498006	Mr. Z's pad is top-notch.  My girlfriend and I had a great stay there, the place is comfortable, and very conveniently located.  We had a rental car, yet we never used it once!  Also, Mr. Z (aka The Man Himself) was very responsive and had the place extremely clean and orderly upon arrival.  I highly recommend staying here!
77669	1432713	9.0	10.0	15554362	Place was great, and Z was around to meet us when we arrived.  We had a great time in Seattle, and we were happy to have a place so close to a happening neighbourhood. 
77670	1432713	9.0	10.0	15640300	Z's place was great! Clean, quiet, and tastefully decorated. He's also quite the repository of local knowledge, and a visionary for future endeavors. Enjoyed staying in his abode as much as we enjoyed meeting him. Cheers!
77671	1432713	9.0	10.0	15822170	"How could a college grad circa 1992 pass up the opportunity to stay in an apartment building from the iconic 90s movie, Singles? It was the movie connection that caught our eye, but Z made it much more than that.

First off, the location on Capitol Hill is ideal for anyone looking for a lively scene, and it was easily to get to many other Seattle neighborhoods and tourist hot spots from the apartment. 
The space that Z has created is sleekly eclectic - warm and hip, funky and comfortable at the same time.  It felt like our own personal modern art museum at times. 

Z himself is infectiously enthusiastic. He wasted no time filling us in on the myriad of options awaiting us. Every restaurant or local watering hole suggestion was spot on; we enjoyed them all.

Our travels rarely take us back to the same place twice, but if we ever find ourselves once more in Seattle, ours and Z's paths will definitely cross again."

77674	1432713	9.0	10.0	16205704	We're not sure if we can add anything new , but we would definitely echo all the previous reviews. Mr. Z has a cool place and we certainly enjoyed staying there. The location was a perfect home base for our Seattle excursions. Z was out of town during most of our stay, but we did catch up with him right as we were leaving. Z is very knowledgeable on all things Seattle, so he is a great resource. The apartment was very comfortable and we would not hesitate to stay there again.

His apartment is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood, close to public transportation to city parks and downtown, and walking distance to Trader Joe's, a great food co-op and Safeway.  Also, Z. recommended that we try Tallulah's, a wonderful restaurant less than ten minutes' walk from the apartment, where we enjoyed a lovely meal in a nice setting.  The apartment is hung with really interesting artwork that reflect Z.'s sensibility.  He is friendly and made us feel at home.  One detail that I especially liked were the fresh flowers that greeted us on our arrival.  It was also convenient to be able to do laundry in the building.

The apartment was super lovely with lots of interesting objects d'art dotted around. The bed was very comfy and we slept brilliantly. The shower was a waterfall shower with good water pressure.
The neighborhood was quiet and friendly and we felt very safe there. We walked to a bar down the road and had no concerns about walking back late at night.
The experience of staying in the Singles movie building was great for me as I loved the film when it came out and it felt like staying on a movie set!

The flat itself was very comfortable and had everything we needed. 

Couldn't recommend the neighbourhood more, which was pretty quiet, but close to some great spots and easy walking distance to all that Capitol Hill has to offer, plus an easy bus ride away from downtown/Pike Place market, etc.

He gave us excellent advice on what to do for our too-short one night's stay:  a few blocks' stroll to Volunteer Park to its dahlia garden,  a walk up its water tower for a fabulous view of Seattle and then on the return route an exceptional meal at an informal and creative neighborhood restaurant, Tallulah's. The apartment has such eclectic furnishings that were I to relate it to something in my hometown of San Francisco it would be a cross between The Castro and The Mission. Since we had a rental car for a week's trip we did not find parking to be a problem. We did notice lots of bus routes nearby.  So, a great stay. - Arnie Gubins"

The place was clean and artsy - it captured the quintessential Seattle culture in a unique way. The neighborhood is quiet and quaint but is close to the city.
77695	1432713	9.0	10.0	20023235	"Z was a fantastic and friendly host, and his apartment is both beautiful and comfortable. The kitchen is well organized if you want to do any cooking, and he leaves basics in the fridge (milk, orange juice, etc) which is great!

The apartment is totally gorgeous and well designed, clean, in a fun and walkable neighborhood, and the bed is very comfortable. I would highly recommend it!"
77696	1432713	9.0	10.0	20250424	"Mr Z's place was the perfect jumping off point for exploring Seattle. The Capitol Hill neighborhood has so many great cafés and restaurants within walking distance (and Z provides great recs of the best ones to try) and access to bus routes that can get you anywhere in the city. The space itself is delightful, with both a great design aesthetic and lots of soul that says every piece in the house has a special significance. Mr. Z himself is a colorful, funny, thoughtful, and warm personality that instantly makes you feel at home and talking to him about his extensive travels when I checked in was one of the best parts of the experience. I had never seen the movie ""Singles"" before staying in the apartment but did soon thereafter and it adds an extra fun dimension to an already beautiful place. I can't wait to stay again next time I'm in the city!"
77697	1432713	9.0	10.0	20350310	Mr. Z was a wonderful and informative host. In addition to providing us with a beautiful, clean place to stay - with seriously unique art and furniture throughout the apartment - he let us know what nearby restaurants, bars and coffee shops to try out in Capital Hill. We absolutely loved our time at Mr. Z's place. 
77698	1432713	9.0	10.0	20663175	"Mr. Z was incredibly warm and hospitable. He let us know the best restaurants and bars in the area and wanted to make sure we got the most out of our short time in Seattle. 

The apartment is spotless and the photos represent the space very well."
77699	1432713	9.0	10.0	20973735	We loved staying in Z's awesome apartment! The space was artfully decorated, clean, comfortable and in a great location. We were blocks away from many shops and restaurants, and the 43 bus pretty much takes you to the door! Z was responsive, friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this apartment.
77700	1432713	9.0	10.0	21163149	ZL was very hospitable and his place was a great space for a brief stay in Seattle.
77701	1432713	9.0	10.0	21280093	Everything was as described and reviewed.  Very clean, interesting art work, great location.  
77702	1432713	9.0	10.0	21536986	Mr Z was a great host! He was super-flexible (much appreciated) about my changing arrival time, met me with the keys and also even arranged a lift back to the apartment for me. Really awesome! His apartment is great - really artistic, well-designed with a lot of space and a really peaceful vibe. I haven't watched the Single's Movie yet but plan to! The location is great as well - easy walk to nice restaurants and an amazing mega-deli on 19th, and in the other direction there's a Safeway really nearby. Of all the AirBnBs I stayed in on this trip (four on the West Coast), this is the one where I relaxed the most. I really liked staying at Mr Z's place and hope to stay again in the future!
77703	1432713	9.0	10.0	21726755	"we had a great time staying at mr z.'s home!!
it was clean and the location was perfect-there are restaurants and marketplaces only a few minutes away in a cosy neighbourhood....you can even reach downtown seattle by a 30 min walk!!

"

77705	1432713	9.0	10.0	21864770	Very easy check-in and check-out with Z -- he met with me to let me in and show me around to get better acquainted with the space. He also recommended plenty of things to do around Seattle as well as recommended amazing restaurants nearby. Z was very accommodating and always available by phone or e-mail and responded to all my questions very quickly. Parking was easily accessible by street parking (free all day). Z's home is walking distance to plenty of restaurants and is very close to all the excitement going on in Capitol Hill and just a few minutes drive away from Pike Place Market. He also left plenty of fresh towels, juice, beer and bathroom essentials. Overall, Z's home was spectacular and has a lot of amazing culture inside. Next time I make a stop in Seattle, I will definitely stay here again.
77706	1432713	9.0	10.0	21954403	Great place to stay if you want to get s true feeling of Seattle. The space was cozy and we walked everywhere all over Seattle from Capital Hill, the neighborhood where this apartment is located. There are some of the best restaurants in the city within a half mile walk of this place. Everything was clean and the bed was soooo comfortable after a long day of exploring. Make sure to stay here if you are visiting the city. You won't regret it!
77707	1432713	9.0	10.0	22548731	"Z was there to meet me at the apartment with keys and open arms. He was very accommodating, and I appreciated his flexibility because my arrival time kept changing and he was able to be there. His apartment was awesome, spotlessly clean, and it was amazing to get to see all of his amazing artwork and collection of artifacts from around the world. Z was very thoughtful, helpful, and also provided some amazing restaurant recommendations. 

Thank you so much Z! "
77708	1432713	9.0	10.0	22967097	"The host was incredibly accommodating and the apartment was immaculate. The apartment is eclectic and has quite an interesting layout but the kitchen was larger than expected and stocked with quality necessities. 

The neighborhood is quiet but still close enough to walk to a variety of restaurants, stores, and landmarks. I loved this location and felt very safe even at night. 

I would highly recommend staying at this location."
77709	1432713	9.0	10.0	24690046	Z was wonderful! He was incredibly flexible and accommodating, and he welcomed us to his apartment like we were old friends.  He was very knowledgable of the area and had great recommendations.  He was very warm and fun, and made our stay in Seattle easy and relaxing.  Thanks, Z!

77711	1432713	9.0	10.0	25569244	Mr. Z went out of his way to ensure that we could get into the apartment even though we were arriving in Seattle around midnight.  The apartment was clean, cute, and near many excellent restaurants.  We were very happy to stay there on our first trip to Seattle.  
77712	1432713	9.0	10.0	25778016	My son and I really enjoyed our stay. We spent the weekend going to museums and parks. The location was great. Z's nephew made sure we had everything we needed. We felt safe and comfortable. I would recommend this space to friends and family. 
77713	1432713	9.0	10.0	25939685	I had a wonderful stay at Mr Z's apartment. Conveniently located, stylishly designed/eclectic space. Mr Z was extremely communicative throughout the whole process and although he was out of town he had his nephew greet me upon arrival and so graciously show me around, he even bought me coffee & fresh flowers which was super sweet.
77714	1432713	9.0	10.0	26039627	Great place to stay a weekend in Seattle. Warm welcoming. Ample parking in the area.
77715	1432713	9.0	10.0	26630297	Z was a wonderful host. Super hospitable & accommodating! 
77716	1432713	9.0	10.0	27220699	"We had a wonderful stay! Z was very helpful and informative about the area. Great location and apt has everything you need.

Thanks Z!!!
R+J"
77717	1432713	9.0	10.0	27478675	We had a quick but lovely stay at Z's place. He was very informative and friendly. It's a cozy apt with a comfortable bed. Would recommend  staying! 
77718	1432713	9.0	10.0	28349131	I booked Mr. Z's room for someone else coming into town -- Mr. Z was wonderful about scheduling and a terrific host to my guest.  I would absolutely book with him again!
77719	1432713	9.0	10.0	28636541	Mr. Z's apartment made for a perfect first visit to Seattle!  The apartment was clean, comfortable, and very unique (contains some really cool art!).  I will be recommending to friends and family!
77720	1432713	9.0	10.0	28728498	Very nice host, location and space.
77721	1432713	9.0	10.0	29216757	"Loved this place. We were greeted by Mr. Z on arrival. He was the first person we met in Seattle, and was also by far the most interesting. If you've got a few minutes for some of his stories, it's definitely worth your time. He also has a wealth of local knowledge, so if you need recommendations, he's your dude. 

Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Probably will next time we're in town. Thanks Mr. Z!"
77722	1432713	9.0	10.0	29607137	Great place.  Z is a fantastic host; the place is clean, comfortable, and decorated with lots of excellent and very distinctive artwork.  Bus to downtown/attractions stops outside the front door.  (You can also walk downtown if you have the time and a little motivation.) Only downside is that the upstairs neighbors were early risers during my stay, and they woke me up a little earlier than I might have liked. 
77723	1432713	9.0	10.0	30116581	Z. is one of the most creative people I have ever met. His home is like an art museum. The rent goes towards his non-profit which does great work in Latin America. This place isn't to be missed.
77724	1432713	9.0	10.0	30259366	Mr. Z has a wealth of knowledge and experience from his travels around the globe that he loves to share, very nice guy and extremely welcoming. Will give you the shirt off his back if you need it. Even called me during my stay to make sure I was doing well. Thanks very much for everything, truly enjoyed it! 
77725	1432713	9.0	10.0	30707888	"Z had met us when we arrived and gave great restaurant tips. The place was great and was walking distance to everything we wanted to do.
Thank you"
77726	1432713	9.0	10.0	31371881	Z was a very welcoming host. He was responsive and friendly. His place is clean and conveniently located. Street parking is readily available. We never had to walk a full block to the front door. The unit is in an older apartment building, so you may hear the neighbors coming in and out of the building or heavy steps from the unit above, but never at a late hour. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this stylish home.
77727	1432713	9.0	10.0	31773986	We had a wonderful stay in Mr. Z's beautiful home while we were in Seattle! The apartment is in a great location, near many great shops and restaurants that are easily walkable from the apartment. Mr. Z greeted us upon arrival and was warm and friendly and gave us plenty of suggestions on things to do and where to eat. I would definitely stay here again when I visit Seattle.
77728	1432713	9.0	10.0	32043431	After some telephone confusion, Z was quite accommodating; giving us a tour of the apartment, suggestions on dinner places and good living advice.  His apartment was clean and full of interesting mementos of his travels.  My favorite was a coffee table book: Homes of the World.  A quiet and peaceful place to retreat to from the hub-hub of Seattle.
77729	1432713	9.0	10.0	32286101	Great location and pretty comfy place. Z is very attentive and professional and has some interesting pieces of furniture and decoration. He was extremely accommodating in meeting me to give me the key as he raced to get to the airport. Thanks again! Only negative is that there's a pretty musty smell in the apartment. Overall, good stay.
77730	1432713	9.0	10.0	32381804	Had a great time at Mr. Z's. Perfect location--cool neighborhood and a straight shot towards all the spots we wanted to check out. Z's apt is really nice and he's got a great sense of style. 
77731	1432713	9.0	10.0	32860724	We had a great stay at Z's apartment! It is stylish, creative and clean and the location was great!
77732	1432713	9.0	10.0	32977324	"We had a great stay at Mr. Z's - the location was more in the residential part of Capitol Hill, but close to shops and restaurants, which we definitely took advantage of. The unit was comfortable - plenty of space for two people - and tastefully decorated. An all-around great ""home base"" to have when visiting Seattle!"
77733	1432713	9.0	10.0	33156393	We had a great overnight stay at Mr. Z's place. The localization is really great and there are plenty of coffee shops, restaurants and a Safeway close by. The place was very clean, which was also great. We didn't get a chance to meet Mr. Z, who was out of town, but his nephew and neighbor were super friendly! Mr Z. was kind enough to give me a call as we were checking out to make sure everything went ok. My only suggestions are an extra chair for the kitchen (the table sits one) and an upgrade on the mattress, but those really weren't a problem for our short stay!
77734	1432713	9.0	10.0	33508621	Very much as described, great location, overall very pleasant stay!
77735	1432713	9.0	10.0	33589301	This place is great. We love the neighborhood - parked the car (for free on the street a block away) and walked everywhere - and really appreciated how clean and comfortable the apartment was. 
77736	1432713	9.0	10.0	33841465	Mr. Z was a great host providing useful local advice on places of interest. The apartment and location had everything I needed to be comfortable during my stay. I would definitely consider staying at Mr.Z's place.
77737	1432713	9.0	10.0	34015774	"Mr. Z was very congenial and helpful, his place was clean, well stocked, and well located. The bed was very comfy, the feel of the place inviting and eclectic. 
Recommend!"
77738	1432713	9.0	10.0	34106652	We loved staying in Z's place - it is full of neat stuff, laid back, comfy, and located in a fantastic area! Z himself is incredibly friendly and welcoming, with lots of great info about the area! Thanks Z!
77739	1432713	9.0	10.0	34638037	Mr. Z. welcomed us with lots of energy and great tips for things to do around the neighborhood. There are a couple of restaurants & cafes, a little shop, and Volunteer Park within a quick walk. I'm not sure whether this is an ideal walking/public transportation location as we had a car and Seattle neighborhoods seem fairly spread out, but we found street parking easily and saw a bus stop with at least a couple lines nearby.   The bed was soft, but comfortable with great linens.  Z. provided us a fan that kept us cool enough to sleep during the warm days. The bedroom was a bit bright but the light got us going in the a.m. All in all we had a comfortable, easy stay. 
77740	1432713	9.0	10.0	35202446	"We had a very comfortable stay at Z's house. It's centrally located, in a safe neighbourhood with a supermarket and good restaurants nearby. Downtown is near and well connected by bus. Z was there to greet us even though we landed up at almost midnight. He kept a well stocked kitchen for us which was very thoughtful of him. Thank you Z for a memorable stay.

Milind"
77741	1432713	9.0	10.0	35403307	"Mr Z's nephew met me at the apartment and was very nice to even come by a little earlier on short notice. The place is so cool- very artistic and centrally located. Parking was easy and we walked a lot as well as took uber for no more than $10 to get anywhere we wanted to go. 
It's not a kitchen to cook- but we didn't have time for this anyway. It's a great way to stay in Seattle without hassle. Thanks Mr. Z!"
77742	1432713	9.0	10.0	35921806	We had a great stay in Seattle! The apartment was perfect - great location a short walk to great cafes and bars on 15th and 19th Aves, and very cute style that felt like a home not a hotel. Mr Z was beyond helpful with tips on things to do. Would definitely recommend.
77743	1432713	9.0	10.0	36049676	Z was there to greet us when we arrived. He is a highly energetic and fun person. He showed us around, supplied us with towels, gave a few suggestions for dinner and walks, and then made himself scarce - the perfect combination of hospitable and non-intrusive.
77744	1432713	9.0	10.0	36382936	Mr. Z's apartment is in a great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and shops nearby and has easy access to downtown. We loved the location and the apartment itself. Mr. Z was extremely helpful and very enthusiastic about giving us suggestions and tips on things to do/see. He also is very easy to reach and always responds quickly. Highly recommend!
77745	1432713	9.0	10.0	37611546	Dru was a very welcoming host!  He double checked to see that we had everything.  What phenomenal art in the space!  And a super great location.  Z  was communicative and made sure everything was *just so*.  Highlight of the stay was a great meal at one of the many restaurants within walking distance.  
77746	1432713	9.0	10.0	37830788	We had a really nice time staying at Z's place. It was very convenient to buses and restaurant and the place was really quiet. Super comfy bed too! Z wasn't there to meet us, but his nephew met us to collect the keys and the bus timetables and tips on things to do that Z left were very helpful. My only regret was that I couldn't stay longer!
77747	1432713	9.0	10.0	38610122	Cute, older apartment. Z is a very gracious host and had a lot of good food recommendations! Building and neighborhood are very quiet at night. Great location. 
77748	1432713	9.0	10.0	38730441	Great experience!  Mr. Z was ready and waiting for us to drop off the key.  He was very easy to get a hold of at all times.  He suggested great places in the neighborhood to try.  The apartment was extremely clean.  Mr. Z made us feel like a welcome guest.  All in all an excellent stay!
77749	1432713	9.0	10.0	39015886	Perfect location as our home base for exploring. Z welcomed us in a very timely manner. The apartment was very clean, and was quiet during the evenings. I'd recommend, and would stay again.
77750	1432713	9.0	10.0	39486386	"Host was not very welcoming to us....we actually were a bit uncomfortable and did have 2nd thought of should we stay.  No other comments....not sure who the prior people are who commented such pleasant things about host but we honestly can't do the same.  Very unfortunate. 
The listing was accurate however, cleanliness of condo was not."
77751	1432713	9.0	10.0	39928202	Mr Z. met us at the apartment and spent a long time describing the local area to us and his work. The apartment is nice and the furniture is interesting. If you're looking for a home away from home then I would say this is probably not the right place (not sure you could really cook anything here & no table to eat at etc. so you're advised to eat out), but if you want to just use it as base to go off and see Seattle then that's all fine!
77752	1432713	9.0	10.0	40227810	Very nice place in a great neighborhood.  Close to public transportation and all the tourist attractions you'll want to visit on your trip to Seattle.
77753	1432713	9.0	10.0	40732150	Mr. Z was very helpful and had many recommendations for places to eat nearby.  The apartment was tidy and well decorated with unique artifacts.  Location is great for walking to Capitol Hill and Volunteer Park with convenient bus connection to downtown.  
77754	1432713	9.0	10.0	42295893	This place is absolutely stunning! Mr Z met us at the apartment and gave us a short tour of his place (which is completely accurate to the description). Everything was clean, the artwork was really neat, the bed was just right (and holy wow the shower head was amazing!!) and the location was perfect. We were walking distance to volunteer park, Safeway, and many cafés and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again next time I travel to Seattle :]
77755	1432713	9.0	10.0	43388180	Z was an amazing host! He was super friendly and gave us great suggestions for restaurants in the neighborhood. And the apartment was absolutely beautiful - gorgeous artwork, very clean, a comfortable bed, and all the amenities we would need. The location was perfect for us - within easy walking distance to everything on Capitol Hill, but it also has several bus lines with stops almost right outside the building. We highly recommend staying at Z's apartment if you are planning a visit to Seattle!
77756	1432713	9.0	10.0	43615692	"I don't think there is enough space to write how much we enjoyed staying at Mr Z's apartment.
Upon arrival, we received a warm welcome from the very well traveled, vibrant & talented Z himself.
The apartment was a lot larger than we expected it to be with a lot of natural light, it was also clean, tidy & beautifully decorated.
It should also be mentioned that the bed was amazingly comfortable! I miss it already!
The neighborhood & location was perfect for us- ample street parking, transport was literally at the front door, a short walk to local supermarkets & restaurants aswell as central to Capitol Hill & the CBD.

Don't even bother considering hotels when visiting Seattle, Mr Z's apartment is safe, inviting, comfortable & incredible value for money.
We love this apartment so much!
"
77757	1432713	9.0	10.0	43881325	Only a one night stay for us, but a clean, comfortable and stylish place to stay. Would second Mr. Z's recommendation of Monsoon nearby, superb cocktails and great food.
77758	1432713	9.0	10.0	44312163	A great place to stay in Seattle! The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable.  Also, the bus stop is right in front of the apartment complex so we were able to access all different Seattle neighborhoods with ease.  There are great restaurants and bars within walking distance as well as a food market.  Although we didn't meet Mr. Z, he made it very easy to check in and out.  He also provided excellent suggestions for things to do/see/eat in town.  We would highly recommend staying in this apartment !
77759	1432713	9.0	10.0	45074170	Excellent all round. The apartment was clean, conveniently located and had everything we could possibly need. Z was an impeccable host - hugely generous and couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Would definitely come again and recommend to others.
77760	1432713	9.0	10.0	45320264	Cloudy and mystical Seattle's own MR. Z! What a true gentleman. Lover of hair and tons of other good things don't stay anywhere else but his pad. His smile and enthusiasm will rocket your stay into a new orbit. Energy wise the place feels exactly right. Say what's up to the dinosaur in the fridge. Super rad time! 
77761	1432713	9.0	10.0	45585985	Mr. Z was very nice and welcoming. He had a great recommendation for dinner. We only stayed one night but the apartment is in a great neighborhood and close to everything. It's clean and cozy. Highly recommend staying here!
77762	1432713	9.0	10.0	45774216	Z's apartment was the perfect place to stay during our short trip to Seattle. Z gave us the warmest welcome upon our arrival. He had lots of interesting stories from his experiences locally and abroad. It's a shame we didn't get to stay longer to take advantage of his many suggestions for food and activities around Seattle. The apartment reflected his personality - very interesting and welcoming. Would love to stay again if ever in Seattle. Thanks again Z!
77763	1432713	9.0	10.0	45996119	I very much enjoyed my stay in Z's beautiful apartment. The location was fantastic and Z was a gracious and friendly host. I would definitely return and recommend to others! 
77764	1432713	9.0	10.0	46309752	We really had a good stay in settle and liked the appartement.  Everything as promised. It was very cozy and has nice art.
77765	1432713	9.0	10.0	46456353	We had an excellent stay at Mr. Z's cool and eclectic capitol hill pad!  It's full of wonderful art and fixtures.  Great location to explore Capital Hill, and the rest of Seattle.  Mr. Z was an great host. Gave us the full tour, found us a primo parking spot, and made us feel very much at home.  Highly recommend staying here!
77766	1432713	9.0	10.0	46490170	Z was an amazing host.  I wish we had more time to stay in the apartment and more time to talk to him as he seems to be extremely smart and have been around the world!! I was in awe throughout our stay looking at the all the art and furniture.  The place is within walking distance of many restaurants and bars.  Would def. stay there again if we ever venture back to Seattle.
77767	1432713	9.0	10.0	46583261	Mr. Z was the perfect host!  Very communicative, helpful and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again!
77768	1432713	9.0	10.0	47129712	Z. has a beautiful, spotless space. He had great suggestions for exploring the city, and was incredibly welcoming! Highly recommend this option. 
77769	1432713	9.0	10.0	47700039	My father had a great experience.  Z was helpful and kind and the stay and accommodations were very much enjoyable!
77770	1432713	9.0	10.0	49496803	Perfect location to explore Capitol Hill! Z was very helpful and accommodating to our schedule.
77771	1432713	9.0	10.0	49781390	"Although Mr. Z was welcoming and friendly, I was not entirely comfortable staying here. My main concern was the ax on the wall (hanging next to the gun on the wall) that was inscribed with ""to my favorite ax murderer."" I feel like the job of the host is to make the guest feel safe and welcome in a new place, and this made me feel nervous and scared. I actually stayed in a hotel both nights. "
77772	1432713	9.0	10.0	50034852	We enjoyed our one night stay at Z's apartment. His dinner recommendation for Monsoon was very good. Thank you for an enjoyable stay. 
77773	1432713	9.0	10.0	50203305	This is a great place in a really fun neighbourhood. There's lots going on in Capitol Hill, and it's within easy walking distance of downtown. Z's place is a really interesting space with a lot of character, and makes a great Seattle base. 
77774	1432713	9.0	10.0	50347693	Z was friendly and gracious.  The apartment was lovely and full of fascinating art!  Ours was a short stay, so we did not get to take full advantage of his hospitality- but the apartment was well stocked with everything we could need.  We would definitely stay there again!  Thanks Z!
77775	1432713	9.0	10.0	50801203	Location is fantastic for experiencing the less obvious, most charming districts of Capitol Hill. We loved Mr. Z's recommendations - he is very helpful and on point, with impeccable taste. 
77776	1432713	9.0	10.0	51346836	"Mr.Z met me at his apartment, he seemed friendly. The location of the apt. Is great. The place was clean but had a funky smell, we tried opening the window and putting the air on as mr.Z suggested but the smell would not go away.  Two days before we were supposed to check out mr. Z showed up unannounced and said he needs to get a hat from the apt. 
Next thing you know he is sorting out the place and taking garbage out etc.. The way the apt. is he has his personal things everywhere so if you want to unpack and use the table for example your things will be next to his. He starts rearranging his stuff on the table (mostly postcards etc.) which felt very invasive . We rented the place for a few days and having him come in in the middle of our stay and do that didn't feel right. The day we were checking out I asked if there's any way we can leave our luggage there or somewhere else since our flight was late at night . He said no that the place was rented out (which wasn't true it was available online)

77777	1432713	9.0	10.0	51914971	We were really happy with everything!!
77778	1432713	9.0	10.0	53212263	The apartment is in a great location and Z is a fantastic host. Would highly recommend staying here. 
77779	1432713	9.0	10.0	58107801	Thanks again I had a good time at your place. .
79163	442487	9.0	10.0	1383262	"Margot and Ivy's place is in a quiet and lush neighborhood that's still a convenient bus ride to downtown.  It's a small walk to some very nice cafes, bookstores, and restaurants (thumbs up for Elliott Bay Book Co., Oddfellows and Molly Noon!).  The beautiful and peaceful Arboretum isn't far off either.  

The studio itself is very spacious and comfortable.  The surrounding gardens are beautiful and the hens right outside the window added some unexpected charm to this urban oasis.  Margot and Ivy were lovely and considerate hostesses.  Would definitely recommend. "
79164	442487	9.0	10.0	1391873	"This was my first time using air BnB and it was a great experience (To be honest, I think I may have been permanently spoiled). 

The place is a beautiful, clean and spacious studio basement with plenty of light and views up to the permaculture garden above. Fresh eggs, coffee, tea, recommendations, wifi, an extra bed, and a private shower were all amenities I was very thankful for after having been driving for days on end. 

One great perk is that the space is separate from the main unit, which means you don't feel awkward coming and going (as I had to do at 3:45 AM to drive to seatac airport).

Margot and her daughter were VERY friendly, exceptionally thoughtful, and made the entire process fluid and fun.

Thanks guys!
"
79165	442487	9.0	10.0	1403148	I've stayed with Margot and Ivy a couple of times and always look to see if their place is open before booking another spot.  This light and bright studio is very welcoming and comfortable.  As other guests have stated, the linens are very nice, the location is stellar and the hosts very accommodating.  You don't often find yourself having a cup of tea for an hour while returning someone's key :-)  I felt instantly welcome here and enjoyed the sense of community, not to mention the urban farm feel with the lush gardens and curious chickens!  Fresh flowers, eggs or other goodies from your hostesses are a bonus, as is the full kitchen.  Hope to see you again soon!
79166	442487	9.0	10.0	1473567	This is a fantastic place (comfortable, cozy, private, quiet) in a great location in Capitol Hill.  Just minutes from grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants (check Safeway, Coastal Kitchen, Cafe Ladro, and Victrola Coffee Roasters on 15th Street). Just great! I really enjoyed staying at Margot and Ivy's Lovely Garden Studio - I highly recommend it. The garden and the fresh eggs were a plus. 
79167	442487	9.0	10.0	1497032	"Our stay at Margot and Ivy's studio was the perfect way to end our trip across the US and overall the best Airbnb experience we've had.
What else is there to say... we loved the place, the garden and the hens and we highly recommend you meet the lovely hosts Margot and Ivy."
79168	442487	9.0	10.0	1504683	The apartment was very clean and cozy.  We truly enjoyed the fresh- from-the-garden strawberries from Ivy.  Margot gave us many ideas for places to eat also, which we appreciated.  And loved watching the chickens in the morning.
79169	442487	9.0	10.0	1536904	The lovely garden studio is indeed lovely with charming bouquets, fresh strawberries and eggs from the chickens you can view out the windows. For a basement apartment it is especially light and has a pleasant feel. Margot and Ivy are very nice and are happy to make your stay a wonderful one. They are good communicators and check in and out is easy. The neighborhood is quiet but people live upstairs so earplugs might be handy for light sleepers. Great place and great value!
79170	442487	9.0	10.0	1546002	Staying with Margot and Ivy was great, the room was huge and quiet with great light, lovely and clean too. They were very communicative when it came to seeing if I needed anything and making sure I had the keys but did not disturb me atall. I would not hesitate to go back and stay for a longer amount of time, it really was lovely!
79171	442487	9.0	10.0	1556539	"Margot and Ivy provided the ultimate space for a quick getaway into the city.  The studio is minutes from everything.  It was close enough for me to get the middle of the city in just a few blocks but far enough from the urban core for me to feel like I'd stepped into the relaxation of small neighborhood comfort.

The interior was comfortable and well tended with wonderful attention to detail.  A welcoming packet provided plenty of information on the space, the neighborhood, and how to enjoy our stay.  It was warm and comfortable with the soft linens and soft carpet.  

The chickens were quiet enough to barely know they were there but cute as heck when peeking back at me through the kitchen window.  One evening we were greeted with a gift of fresh eggs delivered to our door!  I was able to use fresh rosemary from the front garden and whipped upa fantastic late-night breakfast.  It was delicious! 

I would recommend this space to anyone.  It is perfect for a business traveler, a student, a suburban escapee who needs a quick getaway (like me!) for  weekend, and plenty of other folks too."
79172	442487	9.0	10.0	1655086	We found many parallels between our lives and Margot and Ivy's. The location is fabulous, the hominess perfect, and the price better than right. We were very happy. Traveling with personal connections like we had with Margot and Ivy make the experience so much nicer! They are down home and real. Much thanks, you two!
79173	442487	9.0	10.0	1676130	"We loved Margot and Ivy's place!  It was super cute and clean and in the middle of a great neighborhood.  Being able to experience a neighborhood rather than just a tourist hotel is part of what made our trip to Seattle special.  They are great hosts and it is a great palce to stay!
"
79174	442487	9.0	10.0	1709870	"I had a great, but too short, stay at Margot & Ivy's truly lovely studio.  Even if this weren't a very nice place to stay with warm, welcoming hosts and features including a comfortable bed (not too soft, not too hard), lots of good pillows, soft sheets and duvet, big and fluffy towels, a shower with good water pressure, fresh eggs from the chickens out your window, a full kitchen, lots of natural light, beautiful flower gardens, safe and quiet neighborhood...even if all those things weren't true - which, of course, they are! - you should stay here because this location can't be beat if you plan to roam around the city on public transportation a fair bit.  

I know it's not obvious at first glance of the map, but hear me out. From the bus stops within 2 blocks, you can get almost anywhere on just one bus:  downtown/waterfront/Convention Center (route 11 or 43), Capital Hill (8), Seattle Center/Space Needle (8), UW (43 or 48), Ballard Locks (43), Golden Gardens Beach (48).  It took far less effort for me to get to where I needed or wanted to be from this studio than from a hotel near downtown on my last visit.  So if comfort alone doesn't sway you, the logistical aspect should.  

I can't say enough about the great hospitality and friendliness from Margot and Ivy.  I leave wishing I could have spent more time visiting with them.  I hope to return soon!"
79175	442487	9.0	10.0	1722399	We had a great time at Margot's and Ivy's place. The studio was clean and spacious for three people. It's also very conveniently located. Margot was very friendly and we enjoyed the fresh eggs and strawberries. 
79176	442487	9.0	10.0	1763111	"Margot & Ivy's place was perfect for our overnight in Seattle as a 3 person party! Lots of space and easy access to public transportation. They also live in a very trendy area of Seattle, so if you are a foodie/interested in nightlife, this is a great spot for you!

We love the chickens as well! And anywhere that let's you cut fresh flowers for your stay get's an A in our book! Thank you for a lovely stay!"
79177	442487	9.0	10.0	1776369	This was by far the best AirBnB place we have experienced.  Everything was just lovely and beautiful, plus wonderful hosts.  Had a lovely time and look forward to returning again,
79178	442487	9.0	10.0	1848447	We arrived a bit later than we had hoped but Ivy graciously greeted us and showed us around. It was even more lovely than the pictures. And having a fresh bag of coffee waiting in the fridge was very much appreciated. It felt like home-except the bed is much more comfortable than mine! They provided lots of info on the neighborhood and sightseeing so a great place for first time visitors, or someone who wants a place in town. Highly recommended!
79179	442487	9.0	10.0	1930430	"MArgot and her family are the nicest people we have met during the 6 weeks we passed in USA. They are helpfull and let you some privacy but are always there for you if you need something. The studio was perfect for us, and the chickens behind the kitchen's window was so fun! And so are  their fresh eggs!
If you try airbnb for the first time you will not be disappointed. We wish that we could come back here again in the futur!"
79180	442487	9.0	10.0	1948621	Fabulous basement  studio apartment in Capitol Hill area.  Parking was not a problem at all!  Clean, quiet and we loved the chickens outside the kitchen window.  We would definitely stay there again!
79181	442487	9.0	10.0	1967921	This lovely studio was perfect for my family that includes two young children.  It has the feel of staying with family and being spoiled with our own private space and freedom.  The studio is spacious and bright, completely comfortable and home-clean.  It was awesome having the chickens outside our kitchen window and garden flowers to enjoy!  We had our windows open all night and barely noticed the occasional cluck in the evening as we took in the fresh air.  The space is incredibly quiet considering how close this urban farm is to big city fun.  The neighborhood along the main drag has great eats, a Trader Joe's, Safeway and fun shops.  Margot was so generous with allowing my young daughter to collect the offering of eggs for our breakfast, help out rearranging the chicken coop, inviting us to picnic under the mimosa tree, roam her lovely urban farm freely and even gave us a tomato to complete our home cooked dinner so that we didn't have to go to the store.  This is a basement suite with very friendly and quiet people upstairs.  There is a small park for the kiddos to play on the corner, another park just 3 blocks up the hill that has fountains to splash in, and Madison Park with it's amazing amount of play equipment and the bay is only 1.5'ish miles away.  We even got to swim in the bay!  We couldn't have had a lovlier time.  We were in town for a family wedding that was going to require a hotel bill of $230+ a night.  We are so fortunate to have found Margot and Ivy's spot to save us a load of money AND the experience was priceless!  My kids had a blast and we look forward to another stay next summer :)
79182	442487	9.0	10.0	1999879	Margot and Ivy are wonderful hosts and their studio is a quintessential slice of what is great with Seattle! From their great communication and welcome materials to the urban chickens, from the exceptional walking location to the fresh flowers, their place is warm, fun and welcoming.
79183	442487	9.0	10.0	2009961	Although our stay at Margot and Ivy's studio apartment was less than 24 hours, it was very memorable! The apartment set up was comfortable and sweet with a urban-farm theme with a small chicken farm out the kitchen window! It was such a gem staying in a hip neighborhood at such an affordable cost! Ivy even wrote out a guide of neighborhood eats. I would definitely recommend and rent again at this lovely studio apartment!
79184	442487	9.0	10.0	2020459	"The modest basement apartment was a good fit for my 8 year old and I for the night.  Margot gave us a great recommendation for dinner in the neighborhood, a delicious french bistro as well as an ice cream shop a little further down the road.  It was very easy to use to the bus to take us to Seattle Center.  Thanks for a great stay.

"
79185	442487	9.0	10.0	2027659	I very much enjoyed meeting Margot, Ivy and  other family members too.  The place was great and very convenient too.  I appreciated the tips that were provided for me.  Thank you Margot and Ivy!
79186	442487	9.0	10.0	2053568	Although we arrived very late, the little flat was a safe haven after our rather tedious journey from Germany. It's comfy and light, and we all really enjoyed our stay here. The tips on what to do and the restaurant-suggestions were very useful (I, too, would recommend the Thai, we just loved it!) and alltogether, we had a pleasant two-day stay in Seattle. 
79187	442487	9.0	10.0	2092406	1 night stay with a friend. We found the place easily and were happy with our visit. The space is clean and well situated for the price. We walked into downtown and visited local neighborhood-y spots in 20-30 minutes. I would stay here again! No hassle, simple quick meet up with owners to get key. They are living right next door. Especially liked having chickens right out the window (no noise issues at all, just beautiful lively creatures ;-) 
79188	442487	9.0	10.0	2123512	We had a wonderful two day stay at the garden studio.  It was a spacious and clean environment plus convenient (by bus) to down town Seattle.  I would recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in Seattle. 
79189	442487	9.0	10.0	2227994	"They left us a bowl of fresh eggs, and invited us to nibble from their garden - do I really need to say more?

My husband and I were thrilled with Margot & Ivy's garden-level studio apartment. Very easy to find and access. Clean and tidy, lots of local info on-hand. Great quiet location, proximal to shops, restaurants, and mass transit. On-street parking much, much easier than anticipated. 

We are looking forward to staying here for all of our future Seattle trips.

"
79190	442487	9.0	10.0	2242389	This place is great. It's large, has a very comfy bed, full kitchen, and is in a great neighborhood. Margot and Ivy even left delicious fresh eggs from their chickens for us in the morning.
79191	442487	9.0	10.0	2287678	The studio is cozy, well lit and in walking distance from downtown. Everyone in the family was super welcoming and kind - I can fully recommend staying with Margo and Ivy to everyone!
79192	442487	9.0	10.0	2331558	"A short but wonderful stay with charming hosts.  We were entertained by the antics of the chickens outside the kitchen window every morning and rewarded with 4 fresh eggs for breakfast.  
The studio is within walking distance of some very nice restaurants, bars and coffee shops and is close to bus routes ... so no need to drive anywhere.  We loved Seattle ... especially Pike's Market Place ... but sadly didn't have time to visit the art galleries (closed on Monday) .... something for next time.  The ferry trip to Bainbridge gave us a glimpse of the wonderful coastline and islands around Seattle. 
Would definitely stay here again, thank you Margot and Ivy."
79193	442487	9.0	10.0	2378896	"While we didn't get to meet Margot or Ivy (we were all super-busy!), my sister and I enjoyed our stay in their Capitol Hill studio apartment.

We arrived on the early side of our expected ETA ... Ivy & Margot had not had a chance to get into the studio between our arrival and their last guests' departure.  A quick phone call, however, put things right. We were able find a super-cute restaurant for a delicious Basque dinner while Ivy took care of business.  In an hour, the apartment was cleaned and ready for us -- plus, they gave us gift cards for free coffees.  Yay!

They live in a great area and provide a folder full of really helpful info about the apartment, public transit and food recommendations.  Added bonus: be prepared to meet their adorable chickens in the side yard (I actually got to feed them by simply opening the kitchen window)!  "
79194	442487	9.0	10.0	2461961	Everything was as described. Margot and Ivy were very attentive hosts and made sure we had everything we needed. The location is great and much of Seattle is walkable or has easy public transit options. 
79195	442487	9.0	10.0	2536670	"I moved to Seattle and came here with just the things in my car. Margot & Ivy's Garden Studio is located in the neighborhood I had wanted to live in. And sure enough, it was a guest space, located at the basement of a house. Things were clean, and I was left to my devices.

I was able to sign a lease on my apartment ... and then instead of taking advantage of the free parking space at my apartment building, I decided to stay one more night on a ""real bed"".

I woke up the next morning to hop in my car to get some lunch ... and my car was gone. Turns out, it had been stolen, and the possessions I had left in there were gone. Most of my important things were already in the new apartment or still at the guest house. 

I drive an older Honda Accord. On Cap Hill, it is a very popular car for theft and car prowl. (Lesson Learned: if you are driving out here and have an older Honda Accord, make sure you get one of those club security devices and don't leave valuables in the car). Combined with my carelessly left-out GPS and stereo system, it's not surprising  someone broke in.

The reason this is a 5 star review is because of Margot's help afterwards. She didn't have to help me get my apartment setup -- she really didn'tt: blame is to the car thieves, even though the rest of us have to pick up the pieces -- but she help anyways. I never felt that she wanted to help because of AirBnB ratings. Margot and her family are much like a lot of people I've met on the West Coast: people who want to help you because they want to help.

This is the kind of neighbors I like. You should totally stay here when you visit Seattle-- the people are great. Besides, you know you want to say ""hi"" to the chickens."
79196	442487	9.0	10.0	2639067	This was my first stay at an Airbnb property and I am definately spoiled by this one!  Margot & Ivy were both extremely friendly and helpful.  The apartment is very cozy and warm.  I felt at home immediately.  The bed is very comfy...maybe too comfy!  And what a great way to start your morning by having chickens outside your kitchen window!  It always brought a smile to my face!  Nice to have herbs and flowers outside your window as well.  The property is very convenient to buses, restaurants and coffee shops (Ladro, a favorite of mine).  Parking was never a problem and the neighborhood felt very safe for a single woman coming home at night.  I would love to stay at this apartment again and would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Seattle.  The only drawback to giving it such a good review...I'm afraid it will now always be busy and I won't be able to get a reservation when I visit again!  Thank you Margot & Ivy for a delightful and comforting space.
79197	442487	9.0	10.0	3075839	The reservation was canceled 17 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
79198	442487	9.0	10.0	5018838	Super friendly hosts, and were very accomodating to my difficult schedule.  Place was clean, well located and comfortable.  I regret never seeing the chickens, but perhaps next time.
79199	442487	9.0	10.0	5075900	We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was comfortable and quiet. It was in a perfect location within walking distance from our favorite Capital Hill destinations but without any of the parking headaches. We would love to stay again!
79200	442487	9.0	10.0	5375145	We really had a wonderful stay at Margot and Ivy's place.  The studio is clean and comfortable.  It has all the necessities of home as well as a few neat extras.  Among those are the resident chickens outside the kitchen window.  My son and daughter really enjoyed feeding them our scraps every morning and eating an occasional egg as well.  The place is also situated in the middle of a garden, and Margot was very gracious in letting us pick some raspberries and strawberries each morning for our breakfast.  As far as the location goes, you can't find a much better area in which to stay in my opinion.  The Capitol Hill area is beautiful with many cool cafes right around the corner.  We especially enjoyed some of the nearby restaurants and parks.  Even just strolling around the area was fun as the houses and landscaping are colorful and vibrant.   If you want to be downtown, it is a very pleasant 30 minute walk.  This place was definitely one of the reasons why we enjoyed our trip to Seattle so much.
79201	442487	9.0	10.0	5445792	We really enjoyed our stay and found the apartment to be affordable, comfortable, and roomy enough for three people.  We especially appreciated the lovely gardens, the posse of chickens that like to poke their heads in through the kitchen window, and the great neighborhood.  We highly recommend dinner at Cafe Flora just down the hill.  Oh my goodness, so delicious!  But we also really appreciated the ability to cook our own meals in the kitchen, which was well equipped with pots, pans, etc.  Margot and Ivy were very kind and responsive to our needs.  Communication was great! 
79202	442487	9.0	10.0	5554296	I booked a stay here in this studio for my parents when they visited Seattle from Delaware.  The studio is beautifully kept up, clean and light (impressive for a basement/garden-level studio) and Margot and Ivy were both extremely kind and helpful.  My parents also got seemingly endless entertainment from the chickens visible at the kitchen window.  I can attest that the studio lies in a quiet, yet central/walkable, neighborhood with a lot of character; I live less than 2 blocks away!  Overall, the experience was all that we expected and more.  Thanks!
79203	442487	9.0	10.0	5657138	I had a very comfortable 3-night stay in Margot and Ivy's apartment. Margot and Anthony were very welcoming and helpful as I arrived earlier than the checking-in time. I enjoyed having the chickens outside the kitchen window with the bonus that I had a fresh egg each day of my stay. Margot was even able to provide an egg-cup for me as this appears to be a particular English tradition! The location is ideal with easy access to buses and with stores and coffee shops close by. Margot was attentive to my comfort during my stay, keeping in touch by phone, text and email; I enjoyed being able to chat over some iced tea  would certainly stay here again if I return to Seattle.
79204	442487	9.0	10.0	5727853	"I had a very nice stay this past weekend. As everyone has mentioned, the chickens outside the window were very entertaining and sweet. Fresh eggs in the AM a bonus. Margot was welcoming and very nice considering I made a mistake with my reservation. 
I was also welcomed by a wonderful blooming garden. On the practical side - there was always street parking available, it's close to good food, convenient for transportation and very quiet."
79205	442487	9.0	10.0	5881359	We had a wonderful stay in the apartment. We did not meet Margot  or Ivy but we spoke on the phone and the logistics went without a hitch. The apartment is very comfortable and clean. It is on a quiet street, surrounded by flowers. The chickens outside the kitchen window at eye level are hypnotizing. Our daughter lives a 15 minute walk away so it was very convenient. The arboretum, Lake Washington, Madison Valley and Capitol Hill are all within walking distances. 
79206	442487	9.0	10.0	6169990	We stayed at the Lovely Garden Studio three times over three weeks.  It was a comfortable, convenient and informal situation that felt like home by the end.  It was a quiet street with easy parking close to what we needed on Capitol Hill.  It couldn't have been a better stay.  One thing though: you must be prepared for a few curious chickens looking in at you at the kitchen window.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
79207	442487	9.0	10.0	6270046	Margot and Ivy's Garden Studio apartment was fantastic. The space was very clean and had a ton of character. We were greeted with a fresh collection of chicken eggs taken from the coop outside the kitchen windows. The apartment was easily accessible and street parking was plentiful at all hours. Margot is very responsive in all communication. We hope to make it to Seattle again soon and will cross our fingers that this apartment is available.
79208	442487	9.0	10.0	6341705	A great stay at Seattle. A very cosy and clean apartment.The bathroom could be refurbished. We loved the hens and the hens loved our cornflakes. Quiet neigbourhood. We recommend this place to everyone.
79209	442487	9.0	10.0	6455556	We enjoyed staying in this studio apartment, it was close to everything we wanted to see and we never had problems navigating our way to or from the neighborhood.  The apartment was clean and comfortable, much larger than a hotel and had more of a homely feel.  I would definitely stay here again.
79210	442487	9.0	10.0	6504902	Lovely space!  Great area not too far from downtown.  It was away from the hustle and bustle of the city and we thought it was so charming!  Kitchen, bathroom, bed, and little dining area.  We didn't spend too much time in Seattle, so we only had two nights with Margot & Ivy but this space was perfect!  :)
79211	442487	9.0	10.0	6589858	As first time Airbnb users, my boyfriend & I loved this experience! Great location that was a short drive to all the Seattle sights. Enjoyed the charm of the homegrown fruits & veggies surrounding the home and the chickens outside. Plenty of street parking for our rental. Communication with Margot & Ivy was great and they were quick to solve a tiny issue we had with ants (some found their way inside because the warm weather). The studio was neat, clean, and had all that we needed. We would definitely recommend this studio or any place that Margot & Ivy might list!
79212	442487	9.0	10.0	6755457	Margot was a great host! Even provided bike helmets to us because we forgot ours. :) We had a beautiful time in Seattle.

79214	442487	9.0	10.0	6854117	Margot & Ivy had a great place for us to stay, we never ran into them, but the place was great. The chickens were fun to feed. The location was close to downtown and we were able to drive back and forth through out the day to relax in the room.
79215	442487	9.0	10.0	6958278	We had an absolutely lovely stay at Margot and Ivy's studio apartment. Leading up to our arrival, Margot was helpful and quick to respond to emails and texts. We arrived to beautiful fresh cut flowers from the garden, eggs from the hens, and a delicious bowl of trail mix. The location was perfect for walking to Cap Hill and provided easy access by car or public transportation to other nearby neighborhoods. 
79216	442487	9.0	10.0	7196978	"The apartment was clean, the bed comfy, and everything worked. It's also in a great location: a nice quiet neighborhood, yet close to everything we wanted to see. Loved the chickens. Margot and Ivy also gave us very detailed directions and information, and responded immediately when I had a question. Great experience!
"
79217	442487	9.0	10.0	7256497	After you stay in a number of airbnb homes, you realize that some people do it for the money, and others do it because they have the resources to rent out their space and they want others to experience the home that they love. Margot and Ivy's studio is made for visitors, and you can tell they really love to share their home with guests. They leave recommendations and maps, and you can really tell they love where they live. Margot went out of her way to show my husband and me around, but allowed us to keep to ourselves and explore Seattle on our own. Quiet location (with the occasional exception of the chickens) and conveniently located.
79218	442487	9.0	10.0	7733748	If you love home away from home you will appreciate this quiet garden level studio apartment nestled in one of Seattle's beautiful neighborhoods. Just a few blocks from parks, grocery stores and hip places to eat and shop at. The host was warm, helpful and the accommodations clean and cheerful. We hope to stay their again in the future.
79219	442487	9.0	10.0	13546590	 I didn't get the chance to meet Margot & Anthony during my stay, but communication before, during, and as we were checking out was quick and easy. They were very responsive to any questions we had. Their location is perfect: they are in a quiet neighborhood, but are within walking distance to a number of different neighborhoods with great restaurants, cafes and bars. I highly recommend Margot & Anthony's space. 
79220	442487	9.0	10.0	14508286	The apartment and the neighborhood were as promised.  I would recommend the apartment to anyone wishing to stay in Seattle.  The price was very reasonable and the kitchen helped to keep our expenses down.
79221	442487	9.0	10.0	14734136	Nice stay! Great neighbourhood. Enough space  in the  studio. We took the bus to the center, it was easy to travel . Margot makes you feel at home.
79222	442487	9.0	10.0	15135401	A very convenient location for all our activities while in Seattle. A quiet side street with very nice accommodations. We have no complaints and enjoyed meeting our hosts. We would rate this as a top spot to stay during future visits to Seattle.
79223	442487	9.0	10.0	15389228	I had a great time staying in Margot and Anthony's studio. The studio is in the renovated basement of the house next door to where they live, in a lovely quiet neighbourhood. Getting to and from downtown and the airport by public transit was very easy. There is a large Safeway close by, and the studio has a decent sized kitchen which makes cooking easy. Margot is a very friendly host, and the chickens were friendly too.
79224	442487	9.0	10.0	15816772	Margot is a lovely host. She cares very much about the comfort of her guests and will accommodate your needs as best she can. The unit is just as it is pictured. The location off of E Madison was very convenient as a central point between downtown and Madison Park. Seattle was experiencing record heat, so the basement apartment was a blessing. 
79225	442487	9.0	10.0	16059525	Margot and Anthony were great! They had a lovely studio. Upon entering, there was a beautiful vase full of freshly picked flowers from the garden. The neighborhood was cute and quiet, perfect for strolling around. The chickens in the backyard were great and very friendly! Thanks again!
79226	442487	9.0	10.0	18464329	The accommodations were great and one of the best parts was meeting and talking w Margo.
79227	442487	9.0	10.0	19021878	The neighborhood was delightfully accessible by foot (our preferred method of travel), conveniently close to everything we wanted to do and a pleasant neighborhood that was well lived in. Our Hosts offered us FRESH chicken eggs, were available for our needs but didn't dote on us, and everything was delivered as advertised.
79228	442487	9.0	10.0	19410376	"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week, and it was the perfect spot for us. The neighborhood is beautiful and the apartment was clean and cute. We really appreciated the welcome packet that was provided to give information on the apartment and surrounding area. We're pretty private people and really appreciated that they were so helpful without being at all intrusive.

If you are coming from out of town and are planning on doing a lot of exploring around the city, we highly recommend pre-ordering an ORCA card and putting some money on it so you can easily get around (and it made it really easy to get from the airport to Margot & Anthony's). There are busses nearby that can take you pretty much anywhere you'd like to go.

If you're trying to stay in Seattle on a budget, this is definitely the place for you. We could not have asked for a nicer stay!"
79229	442487	9.0	10.0	19612643	"The studio was really really nice. A really quiet nice road with a 'suburbia' feel but still very close to central Seattle. There are some major bus routes close by but as the weather was so good we just walked. 

Studio is a great size and the bed was very comfortable. All the amenities we needed were included. We didn't get to meet Margot but Anthony was very helpful, helping us with and early check-in and an early morning taxi when we left. Would certainly stay again, highly recommended."
79230	442487	9.0	10.0	19938815	We had a great stay at Margo & Anthony's place. Pretty much anywhere we wanted to go was within five miles. There was plenty of street parking for our rental car. The place was nice and comfortable and private. It was fun to feed the chickens outside of the window. I never got to meet Margot face to face, but we talked on the phone and she was very nice and made sure we had a great stay. Thank you!
79231	442487	9.0	10.0	20249180	"Our stay was very comfortable. The apartment was fully equipped and the fresh cut-flowers on arrival were a nice touch.

We loved the neighbourhood; and the location is convenient for both the attractions in Downtown and those around the Space Needle, as long as you're comfortable availing yourselves of the many and frequent buses close by (journey times less than 25 mins).

Margot was very helpful with a swift response to any communications.

We were grateful for flexibility on the check out time.

We will certainly consider staying at Margot and Anthony's flat the next time we visit Seattle.

- I loved the chickens outside of the kitchen window!

 "
79232	442487	9.0	10.0	20817120	My parents really enjoyed their stay. Quiet location, close to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods and lovely chickens!
79233	442487	9.0	10.0	21051558	We loved staying at this cute little apartment. It had kitchen and laundry supplies included, which was very convenient. It's located in a very walk-able part of Seattle, near a lot of great restaurants and bars. Highly recommended! 
79234	442487	9.0	10.0	21209836	Lovely quiet little street.  The location was ideal, walkable to everything in Capitol Hill and surrounding areas. Thank you Margot & Anthony.
79235	442487	9.0	10.0	21511474	Margot was very very helpful. The Place is exactly how they described it. Is very specious. The bed is super comfortable. We loved the chickens they are the most friendly ones i have ever seen. They are super cute. The neighborhood was conveniently located super close to downtown, we used uber and the fare was no more than 8 dolllars to downtown so pretty convenient. Also is walking distance from a lot of coffee shops and bars. If you want to get a taste of Seattle. Stay with Margot. We had good communication she responded very fast, we are very pleased with our experience!  
79236	442487	9.0	10.0	22022021	"There were so many little ways Margot and Anthony welcomed me to Seattle. It began with a lovely email message of confirmation of my reservation, followed by a personal greeting upon arrival, fresh flowers & eggs and a fabulous list of resources for my visit. The apartment was as pictured. It is very light, airy and comfortable for one or two persons. 
The local area is an eclectic array of homes with a lovely variety of landscaping, mature trees and abundant color. It was easy walking distance to where I was visiting with many local bus routes nearby. "
79237	442487	9.0	10.0	22307462	Margot was helpful in accommodating our late check in and unusual check out times. The space matches the pictures and the kitchen is fully stocked with pots, pans, and other cooking needs. We enjoyed the neighborhood and were able to explore much of Seattle on foot from the property.  The apartment is easily accessed using public transport from the airport. I would highly recommend the space for those looking for a quiet urban retreat! 
79238	442487	9.0	10.0	22477763	The space is just as photographed but there are several minor maintenance issues that need to be addressed and it feels a bit like they are more concerned with filling the bed every night than looking after this property.
79239	442487	9.0	10.0	22589938	It was a lovely stay, comfortable and well appointed apartment in a fun neighborhood. We enjoyed walking to Luc for desert, and it was easy to get downtown and to the University District. We had everything we needed to be quite comfortable. Thank you!
79240	442487	9.0	10.0	23045516	This was a great and quiet place to stay. Really enjoyed my time here and will try to stay againin thre future. Thanks for making me feel so welcome!
79241	442487	9.0	10.0	23728430	I rented this space for my folks when they came to visit and it was perfect. Margot was incredibly welcoming, helpful and available to answer questions. My folks got around easily, both on foot and taking the bus. The place is clean, cute and comfortable.
79242	442487	9.0	10.0	23968947	Margot & Anthony were wonderful hosts.  Communication back and forth was easy and speedy.  They made sure we understood everything we needed to know about the studio and were very clear and thorough.  Plenty of parking is available and the heater kept us nice and warm at night. Location was in a nice quiet neighborhood.  We would stay here again and recommend to friends.
79243	442487	9.0	10.0	24343787	The place is clear and welcoming. Very interesting nice hosts. Highly recommend. 
79244	442487	9.0	10.0	35803064	"the place was spotless, bright and comfortable. there were fresh eggs from our neighbors the chickens and granola bars to snack on. the towels were plush, and the bathroom clean. check in was flexible and the hosts extremely accommodating. 
the location is quiet and a bit away from the noise of the city, and a relaxing atmosphere. "
79245	442487	9.0	10.0	36276536	Margot & Anthony are both incredibly welcoming and lovely hosts. We didn't get a chance to meet them in person, but communication with them was a breeze. The eggs they left for us were a delight, and the chickens were adorable. Even though it was really hot out for the few days that we were there, the studio remained at a very comfortable steady temperature all day and night. I would recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay at their garden studio.
79246	442487	9.0	10.0	36659975	"Although I have not met Margot or Anthony in person I felt they were really nice people the way email communication went. I arrived on an overnight flight so early in the morning and Margot made it easy for me to find the keys.
Me and my boyfriend felt very welcome as the studio is just so nice and cozy and clean.
The neighborhood is amazing. Lush green very quiet street and you can still walk downtown in half an hour or take one of the many frequent buses.
I would never want to stay downtown with this alternative. It was actually nice to come ""come"" to this quiet area after a full day downtown. 
Thank you!"
79247	442487	9.0	10.0	37557391	"The host met us upon our arrival and was friendly. The location was very good and the parking out front was great. The place had everything you needed to do your own cooking and make your stay comfortable. The place was clean and organized. 
You had to pay particular attention to keeping the kitchen counter tops exceptionally clean to avoid the visit from the local ant colony. This may have been a result of the exceptionally dry summer Seattle has experienced.
I am not sure why it was termed lovely ""garden"" studio as there wasn't really any garden. Again maybe a result of the dry summer.
When you are leaving make sure you sweep the floor, take out the garbage to the designated place and start a load of wash for the towels and bed sheets or the host will charge you an additional $30US.
Overall it was a convenient place to stay in central Seattle.

"
79248	442487	9.0	10.0	39372977	Great communication with the host, though we never actually met up due to us being so busy and their conflicting schedules. Margot made sure we had everything we needed, and was able to get an iron and ironing board upon our request. We met one of the residents who lived in the house, and he gave us some great advice on things to do. The best suggestion was Chuck's hop shop, a great place for beer lovers, and probably only a mile away. One thing that we were surprised about (in a good way) was our access to a washer and dryer. I might have missed it in the original description of the place, but it was nice to have so we could go on to Portland with clean clothes. It was pretty warm a couple days for our stay, but even in the lower nineties during the day, it got cool enough in the evening that with an open window and the thoughtful fan Margot left for us, we were comfortable at night. The place was clean when we arrived, though the sheets had an odor to them like they may have been left in the washer too long after a cycle. Not a big deal to wash them ourselves with the aforementioned washer and dryer. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Margot!
79249	442487	9.0	10.0	39906660	"This location was close to a large Safeway store and bus routes to different parts of Seattle. We used the light rail and bus from the airport following Margot's accurate instructions. We bought an Orca card at the Safeway and used the buses to get to the University area, downtown, Fremont and the Seattle center. It would be helpful to have the app for the buses on a phone as they don't follow the posted timetable and once we waited 40 minutes (a Sunday).
We loved the chickens and enjoyed the eggs Margot left us. Also the flowers."
79250	442487	9.0	10.0	40563444	We really enjoyed our stay at Margot and Anthony's apartment.  We had no problems accessing the key and when we arrived there were fresh flowers, some granola bars, and a fresh egg from the chickens out back.  We had everything we needed including kitchen utensils, toiletries and a hair dryer.  The location is in a quiet residential area, but it was easy to access everywhere we wanted to go via the buses and even walking.  We would definitely recommend Margot and Anthony's place!
79251	442487	9.0	10.0	41581399	Awesome place in a great part of town. Getting to and from Downtown was really easy and the convenient location is near a lot of great restaurants and grocery stores. The chickens were pretty entertaining as well. The space was very clean and cozy and I will definitely consider staying again!
79252	442487	9.0	10.0	42113083	Margot and Anthony's studio was absolutely perfect for our stay.  We immediately felt at home.  The neighborhood was great.  It made us feel like locals.  It was very easy to get to, and it was convenient to travel to all of the local attractions.  We had everything and more that we needed for our stay (absolutely loved the coffee).  We really enjoyed the visits from the chickens every morning!  They were great about contacting us with updates about our stay.
79253	442487	9.0	10.0	43473712	This airbnb was perfect for our needs; in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The location couldn't have been better.  Though we didn't need to use public transportation, it was very convenient.  Margot was very accommodating and though our schedules didn't enable us to meet, she was accessible and helpful.  There is a full kitchen with all necessary accoutrements for those wanting to take advantage of this.  The walk-in shower was great as were the shower accessories.  The fan was a welcome addition on the warm nights.  The fresh eggs, laid by their chickens, were a nice touch.
79254	442487	9.0	10.0	43963060	The studio was cozy, clean, and conveniently located near bars, cafes, markets, as well as public transportation. Margot and Anthony were great hosts, who were very accommodating and available for communication. There are chickens in the backyard and they even gave us some of their fresh eggs! We had an overall great stay and would definitely come back.
79255	442487	9.0	10.0	45054070	The Lovely Studio is Lovely!  We really enjoyed our stay here so much. Check-in and check-out were super easy and the place is quiet and clean. Good access to everything you need. Highly recommended.
79256	442487	9.0	10.0	45459519	"The Lovely Studio was indeed lovely. Nicely furnished and a functional space. Great location and easy to access downtown. The welcome pack was particularly helpful to get out bearings and to find local attractions.
I would recommend the studio to anyone staying in Seattle.
Due to conflicting timings we did not meet our host, however all interactions were timely and very helpful. "
79257	442487	9.0	10.0	46616467	The studio was great--clean, comfortable and had all the essentials, and was in a lovely neighborhood with a short walk to fun, eclectic Capitol Hill. The hosts checked in on us via texts a couple times and were always willing to provide anything we needed, yet were unobtrusive so we really had the place to ourselves.  
79258	442487	9.0	10.0	47035776	"Margot was extremely nice and helpful and able to quickly resolve any issue at all. 
Great quiet neighborhood & close by to all sorts of shopping and food needs. 
A very nice stay. "
79259	442487	9.0	10.0	47459875	"The listing was exactly as listed. We had minimal contact with the hosts, which was fine for us. She did send a message to check in the second day to make sure everything was ok, which I appreciated it. Everything was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was very pretty but very residential, not necessarily a lot of super close, walkable businesses nearby. We were charmed by the chickens. 

My only complaint- not a lot of privacy. Many of the windows did not have window treatments at all, so not only did the sun come in, but you could see directly in to the main space, including the bed area. It's a garden level apartment so anyone walking by at ground level can look right in. The only way to have total privacy is to go in to the bathroom and shut the door. The bed was completely visible by multiple windows. We also got a parking ticket on the street for parking within 10 feet of a driveway, which we had no way of knowing was a law. Kind of a bummer."
79260	442487	9.0	10.0	48380127	We had a phenomenal stay in Seattle. The apartment was clean and cozy and all the necessities were provided. Upon arriving, we were greeted with a hand written note from Margot and fresh eggs from their chickens. The location was perfect; in a quite neighborhood only steps from local eateries and buses that could whisk us off to every corner of the city. Margot was a great host, making sure we had everything we needed and providing lots of suggestions for quirky and unique Seattle sites. They love their city and it is infectious. This is a perfect choice if you want to take time to enjoy the wide variety of experiences Seattle offers.
79261	442487	9.0	10.0	48901406	Margot and Anthony made us feel welcome.  They even have a charming and useful basket of goodies in case you misplaced a toothbrush - quite a nice touch.  The studio is walking distance from tasty eateries and the shopping venues. We found the place to be clean and spacious and the WiFi works well.  
79262	442487	9.0	10.0	50084847	Super clean, comfortable, cute and relatively economical. Both Margot and Anthony were very nice and made themselves available if we needed anything. We loved having a full kitchen with ample dishes and cookware, and it was wonderful to be in a place that welcomed our little pup. The neighborhood is quiet, residential and very pretty, though it is about a 20- to 25-minute hike to the Pike/Pine center of Capitol Hill. Overall a great experience.
79263	442487	9.0	10.0	51260853	We had a great time staying in Margot and Anthony's studio. The location was great for touring the city and it was the perfect size for my me, my husband and our three year old daughter. Very comfy and we'll equipped:) We especially enjoyed the chickens;) Highly recommended!!!
79264	442487	9.0	10.0	51906537	What a fantastic experience we had in Seattle. Location of this Studio was top notch. Many Shops and restaurants just up a few blocks. Many restaurants and even a nice pub just one block away. The place is cozy and has everything you may need on your stay. Great access to public transit, although the Seattle transit system could be better. Ended up taking lyft and uber everywhere. They were able to pick us up within 3-4 minutes every time as this is a very central location to everything. If you clean up after yourself you can save yourself a cleaning fee which is fantastic. We had all appliances available to us, although we did not use any as we visited Seattle to try out their great food and coffee! Overall I cannot recommend this place enough.
81339	7596455	9.0	10.0	44254449	This apartment and Linda were truly amazing! We found everything we needed and there there is a big home cinema in the living room. A movie rental is only one block away. Linda even made us some popcorn for our movie nights. The cat Alice is one of the coolest cats we've ever seen. It is only a 10minutes ride with the bus and the bus station is only a 3mimutes walk. There is a very delicious burger restaurant right around the corner and some other restauants as well. Thank you so much for hosting us! We highly recommend this place.
81340	7596455	9.0	10.0	48592330	Linda was a lovely hostess. The location was great for us. You can't go wrong in the Fremont neighborhood. We had been on the road for a while so having access to a washer and dryer was awesome. The apartment is in a rustic basement. For the price, we expected a bit more.
