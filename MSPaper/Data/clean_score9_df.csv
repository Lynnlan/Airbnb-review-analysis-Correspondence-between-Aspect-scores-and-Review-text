1875	1148517	9.0	10.0	5326752	Great little house! We had a perfect stay and loved being close to the action in Ballard. Also loved the outdoor space.  Fleur was extremely helpful in helping us plan our trip. 
1876	1148517	9.0	10.0	5419666	I loved staying at Fleur's house.  It is in my favorite part of the city, Ballard neighborhood!  It is a lovely and comfortable home.  She had everything I needed for my 5 day stay.  I would definitely stay there again!
1877	1148517	9.0	10.0	5662749	Fleur was easy to make arrangements with, and her cottage is a perfect, cozy place to stay in Seattle. The location is convenient to so many great neighborhoods and activities. Thanks Fleur for a wonderful stay!
1878	1148517	9.0	10.0	5761322	Fleur's place was perfect for us and we were really happy we decided to stay in Ballard so we could spend our two days in Seattle exploring this great neighbourhood. Fleur's place was really well located, easy walking distance to everything. It was also full of character and felt very  homey. It was a pleasure meeting Fleur towards the end of the trip.
1879	1148517	9.0	10.0	6130583	Fleur is a great host. Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Her place is close to all the action in Ballard. The house is well equipped, spacious, and comfortable. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle.
1880	1148517	9.0	10.0	6459292	Absolutely loved Fleur's little Ballard cottage! (We would have left you flowers, Fleur, but we ran out of time!) My girlfriend and I stayed a weekend as we attended a workshop in the Greenwood area and this was the perfect hide-out. Market Street with it's coffee shops, restaurants and bars is all within easy walking distance. The house was lovely and clean... and the little kitchen well equipped. I will definitely stay there again!
1881	1148517	9.0	10.0	6684715	What a terrific location! We loved it~it's an especially perfect house for someone who is young and laid back. We walked all over Ballard to restaurants, Ballard Market, Farmer's market, galleries, bars...it was great. Took the bus to the city and Car2go is a a good alternative,too. We had rented a car and never had a problem with parking out front. 
1882	1148517	9.0	10.0	7013942	Fleur's cottage was very clean and comfy. It is in an excellent location central to everything in Ballard. We would stay there again next time we visit the city. 
1883	1148517	9.0	10.0	7180188	Fleur did a great job of creating a cute and comfortable home for us to stay in. Her cottage is convenient to Seattle hotspots, not least of which her immediate neighborhood. The beds were comfortable and she was a friendly and accommodating host.
1884	1148517	9.0	10.0	8540222	Fleur's place is awesome! You couldn't ask for a better spot in Ballard. I look forward to coming back again.
1885	1148517	9.0	10.0	8665473	Fleur's house was perfect!  Very cozy and great location.  1 block to a grocery store and great breakfast/coffee place, and lots of restaurants just a couple blocks away.  Both the bed and futon were comfortable (4 female friends slept there comfortably) and the house was charming.  I highly recommend it. 
1886	1148517	9.0	10.0	9133912	Such a cozy place, everything we needed for our weekend get away and a perfect location to hanging out in Ballard. Fleur was very helpful and accommodating to our plans.
1887	1148517	9.0	10.0	9191997	We stayed at this cute outage in Ballard during a visit to family there. The cottage is in a great location, close to shops, cares and restaurants.  The cottage was clean and comfortable.  We hope to be able to stay here again next time we visit!!
1888	1148517	9.0	10.0	9404143	"Fleur's cute house was wonderful for our stay over Christmas.  Everything was so clean and cozy....  We did a little cooking and even walked to Old Ballard for dinner. 
Thanks Fleur!       We had a great stay!"
1889	1148517	9.0	10.0	10290414	In spite of record-setting cold weather, Fleur's cottage was warm and cozy when we arrived!  Everything was great, and we really enjoyed our stay.  We'll probably stay here again, as we regularly visit the area.
1890	1148517	9.0	10.0	11181523	Just finished a weekend trip at the cottage with another couple. There was enough room for all four of us and the location was within walking distance to great pubs and restaurants. We didn't get a chance to meet fleur but her home was a great spot and a welcome change to a tiny hotel room. No issues, great trip. 
1891	1148517	9.0	10.0	11880075	The reservation was canceled 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1892	1148517	9.0	10.0	13454383	The cottage is exactly as pictured ... a little house with 2 bedrooms, a separate living room and kitchen and a little back yard.  You are a block away from food, coffee, etc.  Fleur was a great host.  We enjoyed our stay and will stay again next time in Seattle.
1893	1148517	9.0	10.0	14348655	Enjoyed our stay.  The beds were comfortable and the location cannot be beat.  There was a fully stocked kitchen although we only used some glasses and French press.  24 hour grocery within 2 blocks and we walked to restaurants, too.  Fleur met us there and she was very nice and filled us in on what to do.  She also answered our questions during the stay via email.  Highly recommend!
1894	1148517	9.0	10.0	15186583	"Great location and great place if you have kids. 

Walking distance from anything you might need and less than 10 minutes to downtown. Lost of parks in the area and very family friendly."
1895	1148517	9.0	10.0	15685785	Fleur's home was a wonderful place to relax and unwind during our trip to Seattle for a wedding. Her home is cozy and offered great space for the four of us who were staying there. The location was fantastic, as it was a 10 minute walk to the actual ceremony. The bus took us straight to Pike Place market in a direct route and allowed us all to see parts of the city we normally passed by on the I-5. We spent Saturday morning in Ballard at the markets and had a surprisingly great breakfast from the Smoke Shop diner. We were all very happy with our experience, spending a beautiful, hot weekend in Seattle.
1896	1148517	9.0	10.0	16202192	Our group of 4 visited Seattle and had a very comfortable stay at Fleur's cottage.  The neighborhood was great for walking to get dinner/drinks after a long day out.  The living room/kitchen area was roomy enough to hang out and chat or have a few beers too.  There is even room to sit outside.  All of my friends loved the cottage and, to my knowledge, slept comfortably.  We definitely chose the right accommodations for our trip.
1897	1148517	9.0	10.0	16973683	"My family really enjoyed staying in Fleur's cottage. It was clean, charming, and comfortable. Its location was really great - a convenient walk to a very good grocery store and perfect for exploring downtown Ballard. The whole family walked to the Farmer's Market on Sunday morning. Given the very warm weekend, we thought the house stayed cool enough to relax in during the afternoon, ventilated only by fans.

Fleur was also a pleasure to work with in renting the cottage. She was very quick to respond to messages and left very organized and clear instructions in using the cottage's amenities.  "
1898	1148517	9.0	10.0	17437752	Fleur's cottage couldn't have been a better find. The location was perfect, one block from a grocery store and 2 blocks from the center of Ballard. The house had everything we needed and was very welcoming. The rooms and amenities were as described and we definitely felt like we were staying at a friend's house. We'd love to stay again next time we travel to Seattle.
1899	1148517	9.0	10.0	17851459	"Fluer,
Loved your information book for guests.  Very helpful.
This is a charming cottage & we enjoyed our stay.  Thanks for calling to check with us that all was OK.
This home is conveniently located, close to Seattle downtown, & Ballard has a charm of its own, with some excellent restaurants, & a particularly good children's toy store, Clover.
Ballard Farmer's Market is great.  Much smaller than Pike Street Market, with more charm, & smaller crowds.
Due to the number of steps up to the cottage, it would not be convenient for those with disabilities."
1900	1148517	9.0	10.0	18358478	"Wow what a great place! Unfortunately we did not get to Meet Fleur as she was away for the weekend, but she made a great remote host. She was communicative from the beginning and continued to be so during our stay. 

The place was perfect for our needs. The two bedrooms were exactly what we needed for both couples on our trip and each had comfy beds. The common areas had everything we needed to unwind in-between outings (the new couch in the living room is über-comfortable) and the whole cottage had a great cozy atmosphere. It felt lived in and loved, but was still neat and clean. I particularly enjoyed the art and decorations (props for the skateboards and theater seats!) scattered throughout. Something to keep in mind is that this is actually a cottage and not a full-sized house, but as long as you don't have large group, or don't mind doubling up, it's perfect. A picture of this place should be found next to the dictionary definition of quaint :)

As for the location: Parking was really the only aspect that left more to be desired, however this was mostly due to a lot of construction in the neighborhood, and Fleur was very upfront concerning this. The cottage is located in a sweet neighborhood called Ballard about 10-15 min away from downtown, but has a bunch of stuff to do and see in its own right (which Fleur was happy to list out in her extensive info binder) and we had just as much fun exploring the surrounding area as we did the usual tourist hangouts. 

I definitely would not mind staying here again, and in all likeliness will probably seek it out on my next trip to the area. "
1901	1148517	9.0	10.0	18880143	"We loved our stay at Fleur's place.  It was clean, well-supplied, cozy and welcoming.  Very pretty too and the location was so convenient.  Just a block to many facilities in Ballard.

The 4 of us felt that we were at our own home and our 4 days passed too quickly.  We give the cottage our highest recommendation."
1902	1148517	9.0	10.0	19223308	"Our group of four enjoyed staying at Fleur's cozy home.  It is very conveniently located near bike trails, the locks,  and the community center where our training was held.  It is also a short walk from wonderful dining options which Fleur nicely outlined in her welcome book. 
We especially loved her quaint and well equipped kitchen! The cast iron skillets were a huge bonus! We loved the fresh flowers throughout her space. There was plenty of space in the refrigerator too (perfect for the daily meals we prepared).
The shower had good water pressure,  and the bedrooms were comfortable.  We appreciate having the fans as one of the rooms got hot during the night. 
Although we never met Fleur, we felt very much at home in her space. She checked in with us the day after we arrived and made herself available via phone of we needed. 

We did arrive at her home later than we had originally planned so, it was dark, parking was a bit awkward, but we were able to work things out.

We would definitely recommend Fleur's cozy cottage as a great place to stay and a very reasonable price!"
1903	1148517	9.0	10.0	22558312	We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood.  We were able to walk to alot of restaurants, coffee places and shopping.  The house is in a nice, safe enviroment.  It has street parking, so sometimes couldnt park right in front but no problems finding a spot.  The house was nice but a little cool in the livingroom, luckily the room had a heater.  
1904	1148517	9.0	10.0	26621128	We had a wonderful stay at Fleur's home. It is the perfect size for two couples and is very conveniently located. We had no issues with parking. Fleur was very responsive and provided great recommendations. We would stay there again in a heartbeat!
1905	1148517	9.0	10.0	32428673	Fleur went out of her way to welcome us to her cute cottage on very short notice when we came to town after the birth of our grand baby. The cottage was perfect for our needs, clean, great location, and very cozy. The neighborhood was quiet, and walking distance from anything we needed. We would very much recommend this cottage, and Fleur as a gracious host.
1906	1148517	9.0	10.0	33331717	"Staying at Fleur's place was a real pleasure for us. Located in one of the nicest areas of the city, we felt at home immediately and enjoyed our evenings in the house a lot. It is a very clean and tidy place with more than enough room for four to five people to stay in. Communication with Fleur was a bit difficult as she was not in the house and could not be contacted via phone but we were able to communicate with her upon our arrival, so that was not a big problem either.
Overall, I would definitely recommend the cottage if you are looking for a neat little place in one of the nicer and less busy areas of the city."
1907	1148517	9.0	10.0	33640144	The host canceled this reservation 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1908	1148517	9.0	10.0	34498652	Upon arriving at Fleur's place, we were happy to find a clean cottage with all household items provided. The beds were very comfortable and the other rooms were just perfect for our needs. The cottage is located within walking distance to everything in Ballard. Unfortunately  we did not get to meet our host Fleur but were able to communicate as needed. This accommodation was perfect for us and we would definitely recommend this place to others. 
1909	1148517	9.0	10.0	36023890	Fleur was very welcoming and met me for a tour of the place before my family arrived, who would be staying at her place. The house was very clean with plenty of linens and kitchen tools. The location was wonderful because you can walk to downtown Ballard in 3 blocks!
1910	1148517	9.0	10.0	36568485	Fleur's home was just as described.  Our family of four was really comfortable and enjoyed all the great neighborhood of Ballard had to offer.  We hope to come back again soon.
1911	1148517	9.0	10.0	39047452	Great peaceful little sanctuary in Ballard. Fleur was easy, flexible and professional. Absolutely recommend!
1912	1148517	9.0	10.0	39958933	We had a really lovely stay at Fleur's home in Ballard, great location for someone who wants to explore this neighborhood! Super easy check in & out! Really cozy feel, would definitely recommend!
1913	1148517	9.0	10.0	42854888	Great location and super cute place! Fleur was a very sweet host and made us feel so welcome. 
1914	1148517	9.0	10.0	44299505	Our family of three had a magical time staying at Fleur's place. She clearly is good at what she does.  The place is so charming and accommodating.  The neighborhood is highly walkable, and street parking was never an issue.  Thanks for providing such delightful accommodations for us, Fleur. 
1915	1148517	9.0	10.0	44911122	Fantastic place in a fantastic neighborhood.  Great cottage within walking distance of shops, bars, restaurants, and grocery stores.  Clean & cottage with all the amenities you would need.  Would stay again in a heartbeat.
1916	1148517	9.0	10.0	45835915	Our group of four had a wonderful stay in Fleur's sweet little cottage in Ballard. The cottage was clean and comfortable, with everything we needed for a laid back weekend. The location was great, an easy walk to lots of good restaurants and bars. Highly recommend!
1917	1148517	9.0	10.0	46935236	We loved staying at Fleur's house! Our beds were comfy & we love Fleur's cottage style. Everything we needed was available. Eateries and entertainment are only a couple of blocks away. Parking skills come in handy! Thanks Fleur! We enjoyed our stay.
1918	1148517	9.0	10.0	47806143	Thank you for the wonderful cottage.  We loved the lcoation in Ballard and loved the homey feel of this place.  Fleur also left a book with great recommendations of places to go and see in the surrounding area!

5227	5671843	9.0	10.0	29805704	"Emiliya's room is very pleasant, very comfortable, and is in a great location. Ballard is one of Seattle's up-and-coming districts and Emiliya's house is a 10/15-minute walk away from dozens of excellent restaurants and interesting stores. Overall, this is very good value accommodation for the price. 

We only stayed one night at Emiliya's place, but she did everything she could to make us feel welcome and help us get around. We particularly appreciated the fact that she let us use her parking spot for several hours after we had checked out, so that we could hang around Ballard for brunch before leaving town."
5228	5671843	9.0	10.0	29902240	The reservation was canceled 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5229	5671843	9.0	10.0	30170198	Great experience! Host was very friendly and hospitable, and the room was very clean, quiet and comfortable.
5230	5671843	9.0	10.0	30432662	Emiliya was a great host and the room was clean and nice. It was also in a good neighborhood.
5231	5671843	9.0	10.0	30593604	"Perfect location, lovely art everywhere, private and clean room just as advertised. Emiliya is a wonderful host and I look forward to a future stay.  

Thanks Emiliya! Was just what I needed."
5232	5671843	9.0	10.0	30815972	Emiliya was a gracious host to my two out of town guests. They felt at home and loved her morning coffee service. The room was quaint and the location perfect for ease of getting around Ballard.
5233	5671843	9.0	10.0	31241355	A sweet little spot within easy walking distance from downtown Ballard.  Emiliya was welcoming and kind, and the accommodations were homey and comfortable.  
5234	5671843	9.0	10.0	32589016	Really nice place to stay especially if you appreciate tasteful paintings. Great location if you like Ballard, have a car (easy and free street parking) or don't mind taking the bus to go downtown - which runs all the time. Great experience overall
5235	5671843	9.0	10.0	32867476	Emiliya was so very accommodating to my sister and I. We just needed a quick place to stay for the night on our way out to the Cascades and Emiliya could not have been sweeter about our very* late arrival and super early start. Day break french press coffee and fruit!! 
5236	5671843	9.0	10.0	33381570	It was fantastic and you were a great host. I appreciate you being communicative and all the goodies you left out were very considerate. I can't recommend you more highly. 5 stars. 
5237	5671843	9.0	10.0	36273924	I was in this cute city for the summer internship at Amazon. With completely zero knowledge of this city, I came in around 10 P.M at night. You got your own room with private bathroom. Everything is just there and I actually like how she put the bed in the corner with windows right next to it. Just image woke up in the charming-May-morning-of-Seattle, the first thing you would ever feel is the gentle breeze! Emiliya is a super friendly and easy-going lady. She helped me with everything I need and explain to me with great patience. I loved this place, right off the intersection of 15th and NW 60th street. I kinda enjoy walk for eight minutes to Leary and hop on a bus #40. I moved out to U district after my lease ends. Will absolutely miss this place! So if you are a future Amazonian or your company is located in the south lake union area, I would definitely recommend this place!
5238	5671843	9.0	10.0	36777296	Emiliya was a thoughtful host.  It was hot during our trip and she left us water bottles to use while we were out.  The space was as listed and perfect for two.  An added bonus is that her artwork is truly beautiful!  I would recommend this listing for sure.  
5239	5671843	9.0	10.0	37302214	Emiliya was a wonderful host! She was extremely flexible, allowing me to pick up the key and drop off my luggage for an early check in when I arrived in the city in the morning. Her place is on a quiet street, which I prefer, and bus stops and Market Street were still very accessible. Emiliya also offered to make coffee and breakfast in the morning. My sister and I had a lovely stay in Emiliya's home and would definitely stay with her again in the future.
5240	5671843	9.0	10.0	39379719	Emiliya's place was very convenient for me to visit family and to visit the Ballard and Freemont areas and to take the bus to downtown Seattle. Very close to bus stops, the Ballard Market and coffee shop, downtown Ballard, and the Sunday Ballard vegetable market. The perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle! 
5241	5671843	9.0	10.0	39851724	This was our first airbnb experience and it was great! The room was very comfortable and the location was amazing. Our host was great at checking with us through text messages and make us feel welcome. We barely saw her because we came in late at night and left early in the morning, but she was very sweet and we will definitely recommend her :) 
5242	5671843	9.0	10.0	40160460	Perfect! Easy check in, with no issues. Comfortable place, very clean. Beautiful artwork, too!
5243	5671843	9.0	10.0	40754998	"Emiliya is a gracious, thoughtful host.  Her home is bright & cheerful; she is an accomplished artist and her creativity and talent are nicely showcased in her living space!  

The location is wonderful. It's a short walk to many of Ballard's fun shops & restaurants, and public transportation is nearby. 

I had a great stay, and hope to return again!
I 
"
5244	5671843	9.0	10.0	41769957	"This was my first experience with AirBNB and I was not disappointed at all. Room was nice and cozy. Had a lot of well done paintings which created a nice atmosphere. Emiliya was a very nice host who was always making sure I was comfortable. Overall a great experience. 

"
5245	5671843	9.0	10.0	42036818	Our stay was very pleasant! Our room was beautiful! We would definitely like to return.
5246	5671843	9.0	10.0	43243854	"Hey Emiliya,  Thank you for being my first Airbnb host.  Your place was perfect for my needs.  I was able to be located near the venue where my niece was getting married, and also near enough to where the rest of my siblings were staying.  I loved the room, the art on the walls, the fan in the window cooling the room, the private bathroom.
You were a friendly and welcoming host, and making your home available to me was considerate and special, though I didn't really take advantage of the kitchen area.  I hope you liked the tomatoes from my garden.  If I was to come back again, I would definitely call you up and be your guest again.          Dave Berens"
5247	5671843	9.0	10.0	43414288	Beautiful art, a nice clean bedroom with a well stocked bathroom met all our needs for the stay.  In the morning a great cup of coffee was a good way to start our last day in Seattle.  We came in late and left early since we were cramming our time with activities, so not much time to interact with Emiliya.  Her place is waling distance to many good places to eat.  Try Morsel for breakfast on 15th and 60th.
5248	5671843	9.0	10.0	43651611	Emiliya was a very welcoming hostess & very responsive to any questions that I had. I stayed with her for a few days on a solo trip to the PNW & felt very safe. This was also my first time using airbnb. It was super easy to take the bus downtown & to walk to all of the restaurants/shops in Ballard. I would highly recommended staying here.
5249	5671843	9.0	10.0	44325079	"We had a wonderful stay with Emiliya. We arrived after spending six hot days in Portland (which we loved). We were happy to see that we had our own private room and bathroom attached. The bathroom is fully stocked and the room includes a big closet to hang clothes as well as hide away your luggage. There is also a fan in the window, which made for relaxing, cool nights and evenings. This is a shared space so the rest of the home includes Emiliya's things including tons of beautiful paintings so please be respectful. 

Emiliya is a fantastic host. She was quite busy painting, but still made time to chat with us and make us feel at home. She made coffee for me that was super yummy. We were allowed to use her kitchen and things to make breakfast and even decided to cook dinner one night after many days and nights eating out. Because of our lengthy travel she was even kind enough to let us do a load of laundry. 

In terms of the location, Ballard is a bit of a haul from the downtown area. HOWEVER, exploring Ballard and the marina was one of my favorite parts of our stay. There are so many great restaurants, cafes, and shops in Ballard. You have to check out Golden Gardens!!!!! We ended up using car2go to get around the city a lot. Fremont, Green Lake, Capitol Hill, etc. It was all very beautiful. I really fell in love with Seattle and have Emiliya to thank for a relaxing home base for all of our explorations. "
5250	5671843	9.0	10.0	44804833	"The Ballard Artcove was a recommended listing at the bottom of the screen.  I usually choose ""entire place"" listings however this seemed truly private (located on the top floor of a condo).  Pictures were okay and previous reviews were complimentary.

A week or so before arrival I messaged Emiliya to inquire about public transportation from the airport to her home since we were not planning to rent a car.  She did not know the immediate answer and I was able to figure it.  She did eventually message me with a helpful website.  A day or so beforehand I messaged her to clarify check in time.  Contradictory information was listed and I wanted to make sure it would be okay to check in at 1 pm after our long travel time.  Emiliya messaged that it would be fine, the room would be ready and told me how to get the key.

Room was located easily, smaller than I expected, but seemed satisfactory at first glance.  We were exhausted. Unfortunately when I pulled back the bedspread, I noticed a large reddish brown stain.  This led me to take a closer look at the sheets.  Upon doing so I discovered multiple places where a dried mucus like substance was visible and some had crusted onto the sheet.  I stripped the bed down to the white mattress cover and decided to wash the linens.  This seemed like a quick and easy solution.  There happened to be a 2nd set of sheets in the wash that fit the bed we had reserved.  I texted Emiliya to let her know that we had found the room easily and that I had switched the sheets due to the condition of the set on the bed.  This led to a number or texts from Emiliya filled with exclamation marks and language that began to attack my character.  

Keep in mind, I have never met this woman in person & now found myself in what seemed to quickly be becoming a confrontational situation.  This put me under a tremendous amount of stress and we began to notice other things in the room and bath that didn't seem to have been cleaned.  Discomfort doesn't begin to cover the emotions I was feeling.  

This trip had been in the works for over 2 years.  Very limited funds meant our budget was well thought out.  We planned all of our exploration and sightseeing around the areas we chose for housing, intending to walk or take inexpensive public transportation. As a result, our housing and transportation expenses more than quadrupled.  What was supposed to be a relaxing start to our vacation was unsettling, unnerving, and filled with anxiety because of a set of unclean sheets that I was happy to wash.  

I am very uncomfortable recommending this listing.  After my initial request to Emiliya for a full refund, she issued a partial amount.  I declined and made a 2nd request through Airbnb resolution portal and was issued a full refund."
5251	5671843	9.0	10.0	45267102	We have nothing but kind words for Emiliya. She is beyond hospitable as a host and we loved interacting with her. My daughter can't stop talking about Emiliya and how great she was. The room and arrangements were perfect and the area was close enough to downtown Ballard and away enough from the busy Seattle city life. I can't recommend this enough.
5252	5671843	9.0	10.0	46146990	Excellent! A lovely room in a lovely house well located in a great neighbourhood, it was exactly what we need. 
5253	5671843	9.0	10.0	50171086	Emiliya was an excellent host! MY girlfriend and I stayed with her for a month while we searched for a permanent place and jobs in Seattle. She was very accommodating and made us feel very welcome and at home. Her home is lovely and filled with her beautiful paintings. She gave us free use of the kitchen and offered us storage space for our things beyond the room we rented. The apartment is in a very good location with many great local restaurants within walking distance. The bus stop is a 2 minute walk away and its about 30 minutes to downtown by bus. All in all Staying with Emiliya was an excellent experience. We couldnt have asked for a kinder person to stay with while establishing ourselves in a new city.
5254	5671843	9.0	10.0	50861969	Excellent room, lovely host, great location. Quiet, clean, comfortable.
5255	5671843	9.0	10.0	52075548	I needed a room near my daughter's house in Ballard and Emiliya's home fit the bill. I had a little bit of trouble with the lock box, but that was my fault and not hers. The room on the third floor was perfect in all ways, very clean and comfortable. Everything was as it was described on the listing. One small issue was that the water in the bathtub drained quite slowly; but that will be easily fixed. The neighborhood was ideal for me. I look forward to my next stay with Emiliya. She is a wonderful host.
5256	5671843	9.0	10.0	55347927	"Emiliya was a wonderful host. She checked in a couple of times to ensure that everything was in order before we moved in. She was very prompt in responding to questions as well. The neighborhood was very enjoyable as well!!

It was a very comfortable experience!!"
9090	2776890	9.0	10.0	18917009	Claire's apartment is comfortable, functional and in a great location. You can easily access the walk/bike trail which leads to Fremont and Ballard neighborhoods. The bus stop to go into  the city is within 3 blocks. Though we didn't meet Claire, she responded quickly to any email contact and is obviously interested in her guests' experience. I highly recommend this listing for people who want a relaxed setting and enjoy exploring smaller areas around a big city. An added plus is the vine covered patio for cocktails or meals!
9091	2776890	9.0	10.0	20396775	"Claire was very responsive (via sms) throughout my entire trip and even pre-trip. She offered restaurant recommendations and tips on how to get around. She was also very accommodating; I was in town for a wedding and she ran out and got an iron and ironing board so I wouldn’t look like a wrinkled mess at the ceremony. She also provided some breakfast foods for me in the kitchen.

I didn’t get a chance to tour the neighborhood since it was a brief visit, but from what little I saw and from what my Seattle friends told me, Wallingford is a really nice area. The house itself is simple, but well maintained. I didn’t have any issues with appliances, the wifi was worked fine, and the windows in the house provide tons of natural light (I happened to be in town on a day when the sun was actually out!). On the downside, the closet was locked up so I didn’t have a place to hang my formal attire, but I made do. The other thing that was slightly annoying was dealing with the creepy crawlers (I must have caught like 5 or 6 spiders), but again not a huge issue. All in all I would say given Claire’s responsiveness and the area I was in, my first airbnb experience was pretty positive. "
9092	2776890	9.0	10.0	21187553	I contacted Claire on short notice. She responded right away and made arrangements for the place to be ready ASAP. She was also really good at being in touch when I had questions. It's a charming, comfortable and well-equipped place within walking distance of Gasworks Park as well as Fremont and Wallingford shops and restaurants. I loved staying there.
9093	2776890	9.0	10.0	21542155	Our experience at Claire's duplex was very pleasant.  The place itself is charming (especially the patio!), in a cute neighborhood walking distance to Lake Union and centrally located to nearly everything in Seattle.  Claire was very easy to communicate with, and so friendly! She left us some treats, and a ton of great coupons. The only improvements that she may need to make would be the addition of some basic amenities.  A coffee maker would have been awesome, and a TV might have been nice to wind down with (there was a screen not plugged into anything).  Also, a real bed would have been great- her's is a thick, hard foam mattress on a stand.  I ended up sleeping on the couch because I found it pretty uncomfortable, although my husband said he didn't mind it :)  All in all a great, very private, cute little place.
9094	2776890	9.0	10.0	22567369	"This was amazing. Claire was incredibly quick to respond, the ""handoff"" was seamless, and the place was clean and even nicer in person than it was in the photos! It was close to a bunch of great places and very easy to access; even in the craziest traffic. I definitely hope that I return in the future. "
9095	2776890	9.0	10.0	23419106	Probably one the best place we ever rented on Airbnb. The house was comfortable, clean and quiet. We really appreciated that the breakfast was provided (fresh and organic products!). Claire was perfect as well she would always answer our emails super quickly and she was flexible on the check-out time. Thank you!
9096	2776890	9.0	10.0	29749465	Claire was excellent in her communication before and during my visit at her home. The home itself was clean, and very nicely located. The bonus food supplied was delicious and a wonderful addition to my stay. I would definitely stay there again next time im in Seattle
9097	2776890	9.0	10.0	30231370	Great neighborhood, centrally located to the action. Claire left several food amenities to make our stay that much easier. She was very accommodating of a late arrival. House is clean and very comfortable. Thanks again!
9098	2776890	9.0	10.0	31228732	"Adorable small home, just as described. Claire responds quickly and helpfully. All aspects of our check in and check out were smooth and simple.

The neighorhood is quiet, pretty, and friendly, just a few blocks from the water. If you like long walks, this is an ideal location. Walk to lovely Green Lake in just a couple of miles.

The house is attached to at least one other unit, but you'd never know that from the inside - very quiet and private. The outdoor patio with its pretty grape arbor is a wonderful place to relax on a dry day."
9099	2776890	9.0	10.0	31848286	"This place was perfect -a gem of a house.  I stayed in it while house hunting locally, and it was perfectly situated for exploring Seattle.

The house was great- very quiet and peaceful, Claire was a great host, and was incredibly responsive to my questions.

Late night arrival was no issue, and I would gladly stay her again.."
9100	2776890	9.0	10.0	33156004	"Enjoyed our stay in Wallingford! The location was fantastic, super centrally located and easy to get to everything. It was the perfect home base for the activities we had planned around the Seattle area. Quiet, safe neighborhood with street parking available and a great little kitchen with all the amenities. Thanks for a great stay.

~Casey and Matthew"
9101	2776890	9.0	10.0	35714912	Claire is great to communicate with and very accomodating to our travel schedule. Her house is clean and ready when we arrived at 3 am. She even stocked the fridge with breakfast food and coffee that we were able to enjoy. The location of her place is very convenient, easy walk or drive to the u district or bellard, and fantastic views of the canal at the gas works park nearby. We had a balast while staying there.
9102	2776890	9.0	10.0	37111345	Clair is an excellent and host and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her charming little house. She was instantly responsive to all requests and queries. The house was meticulously cleaned prior to our arrival and the fridge was generously stacked with breakfast essentials. That local ice cream in the freezer also came in quite handy:) The house is conveniently located in Freemont, just a block away from the water (5 minutes to Gaswork Park) and a 15-20-minute from to the university. The neighborhood is quite attractive, with plenty of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops reachable on foot. We had a rental car, which was great because Seattle neighborhoods are kind of scattered around + we wanted to explore the parks and hiking trails around the city. Highly recommended.
9103	2776890	9.0	10.0	37982191	Great place.  Claire did a really nice job making everything easy and special for our visit.
9104	2776890	9.0	10.0	38941030	Bright and welcoming, neat and comfortable cottage with inviting arbor-covered patio and a mesmerizing nighttime view of Seattle skyline from the kitchen window.  Splendid location. Quiet, friendly neighborhood. Convenient walk or bike ride to shops and restaurants. 
9105	2776890	9.0	10.0	39789148	This was my first time to be disappointed by an AirBnB booking. We arrived later in the afternoon than planned (due to heavy traffic) and needed to find transportation to Safeco Field. However, there was no contact information of any kind at the house and no directions about how to access the internet or public transportation. With our phones on roaming, we were really stranded. As well, there was no air mattress in place as had been promised, no table for 2 people to eat at, no place to comfortably sit in the front room (since the couch had been hastily made into the second bed we needed). For a father-daughter celebration weekend, this was a big disappointment. 
9106	2776890	9.0	10.0	40822638	Lovely home, delightful setting. We loved having our coffee on the deck. Breakfast provisions were great and Claire was good about asking if we had any special requests. We'd stay here again!
9107	2776890	9.0	10.0	41820232	We had a lovely, problem-free stay at Claire's place. It's a brightly lit, clean, spacious 1bd apartment that's the upper level of a cute house. The kitchen is really nice to cook in, with all the requisite supplies and an awesome selection of breakfast foods (including organic eggs!), coffee, and tea provided by Claire for us. The bed was very comfy--I think the mattress is a memory foam. The location and neighborhood is great: a block from the waterfront running/biking path, prosperous, interesting. There was also a TV with Netflix that I availed myself of while I did some work in the sunny living room one morning. I'd definitely go back!
9108	2776890	9.0	10.0	42935083	Claire's place is clean, cheerful and well situated. Claire was very communicative and went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and at home. Claire exceeded my expectations as a host. The place itself although perfectly adequate did not quite meet expectations. At this price point we were a little dissapointed with the rather spartan bed, the apparent lack of spare blankets for cold nights, the lack of anywhere to hang or drape clothes (we set up an ironing board for the purpose in the end). Perhaps we have been spoiled by other Airbnb's but access to a back-up bar of soap would also have been wonderful, especially on the first night. All relatively minor things and overall I would still recommend Claire's place.
9109	2776890	9.0	10.0	44026066	The house was so inviting, it felt like our home away from home.  It was easy to communicate with the owner and we found the place right away.  It was clean, comfortable and just the sweetest little place.  We will definitely be using this house again when traveling to Seattle.  It's so nice to stay away from the downtown area but be close enough to go if we wanted to.
9110	2776890	9.0	10.0	45900124	Overall had a great experience, Claire was an excellent host, providing helpful tips about the area and filling the house with breakfast foods. The house is in a great (quiet) neighborhood with street parking available and quick access to Fremont/Wallingford. 
9338	7601333	9.0	10.0	43185784	Lauren was really sweet and helpful. Property is in the center of all local attractions which made it easy to find all of Seattle's hot spots.
9339	7601333	9.0	10.0	43860046	Wonderful house in a nice area, Easy to park outside the house and close to god restaurants and bars.
9340	7601333	9.0	10.0	44270685	Cool place, great location. We love it
9341	7601333	9.0	10.0	46622549	"Lauren was awesuum--very quick + responsive to all my questions.  Her house was lovely, spacious, clean and light filled + had a nice bkyard.  House stocked with anything you wld need.  Internet fast 
and consistent.  The neighborhood was great.  

Wld def stay here again--thnx Lauren! *"
9342	7601333	9.0	10.0	48578894	We loved this wonderful warm house. Lauren was a great host. The beds were super comfortable and the location was great. 
11326	7967844	9.0	10.0	46315901	The house was even better than it looks in the pictures. We loved the view and all had a great time in the house. The owner was very helpful and kind to communicate with. Would definitely recommend staying here anytime! 
11327	7967844	9.0	10.0	46676077	Gabe has created the perfect Seattle experience. Nestled in a character filled neighborhood close to downtown but away from the bustle. We felt like residents right away. We were here for business and were able to use the simian area for a really productive ling meeting with our team and then step out into the deck for the views and a relaxing evening! I am looking forward to coming back again. Gabe made our arrival and departure seamless.
11328	7967844	9.0	10.0	47328680	Gabe's place is so nice and so cozy. It would be perfect for a winter trip in Seattle. I didn't know much about the area before I stayed there, but I eventually found Fremont, which is a short 5 minute drive from the house, full of restaurants and vintage clothing stores. The space itself was very clean and comfortable, and in a safe area. There's a beautiful view from the windows, and a lovely patio in the back. It's an airbnb that doesn't feel like you're living on top of somebody else's things, but still has a homely vibe. Definitely recommended!
11329	7967844	9.0	10.0	47594988	Exactly as described in text and photos. Host was lovely, promptly responded to call when lock had a software error and was kind and patient with me. : )  The big windows face west so we sat and watched the sun dip down. House has everything you could possibly need, including needle and thread. Shower was yummy and there were enough dishes to feed an army. Linens and bed were super clean, pillows the perfect fluffiness. Highly recommend. When we were there the dishwasher and disposal were broken and the tub drained slow but the house is old. I've no doubt they will have those issues sorted by the next renter. There's a great bakery and coffee shop within easy walking distance and the drive to the city is a piece of cake. Don't hesitate to book this place. 
11330	7967844	9.0	10.0	48368574	Nice place, good location, we hope to stay here again!
11331	7967844	9.0	10.0	48660574	Listing was clean, quiet, and comfortable. Hosts responded to my inquiries in a short time, and answered all my questions. No complaints, the listing is as described. Would recommend to a friend. 
11332	7967844	9.0	10.0	49799413	A cozy place in QA with everything at hand.  Gabe is a nice host and also a tech savvy. Enjoy our time in Seattle and will definitely recommend it to friends~
11333	7967844	9.0	10.0	50653904	"Definitely a charming, comfortable Queen Anne home.  Light, open and airy living room and kitchen space.  The view was spectacular!  Nice, quiet neighborhood with Fall weather, leaves changing color, Halloween decorations and light rain.  The #1 bus stop (end of the line) was a short walk up to the next street through an all residential area.  Downtown, activities and any restaurants are just a short bus ride away.  My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
"
11334	7967844	9.0	10.0	52014849	The apartment has lot's of windows and is settled on a hill which gives you stunning views over the surrounding hills. You really get a lot of value for your money there. Really nice area and the next bus station is 2 min by foot bringing you directly to downtown Seattle.
11335	7967844	9.0	10.0	52295489	"I absolutely loved staying here!! Having never been to Seattle before, I found that the location was remarkably easy to get to and a very convenient location in general. The inside has tons of natural light (which I love!) and a cute little patio with just enough privacy and great views of the neighborhood. 

Dealing with Gabe was about as easy as it comes. He is a wonderful communicator and gets back to you in a timely fashion. This whole process (which I am fairly new to) was a breeze because of him. You can tell he is an efficient person all around, lol

I would also like to add that there were a couple of little ""extras"" there too. Fresh coffee, hot tea, Iphone AND Android chargers (in case you forgot yours) plenty of towels, blankets, dishes, toilet paper, toiletries, etc made this such a pleasant stay. As with most things in life, it really is the little things that matter. 

I absolutely recommend staying here and if/when I make it back to Seattle I know just who to contact!
"
11336	7967844	9.0	10.0	53146985	Last minute reservation which turned out to be super simple.  Host was extremely easy to work with and had comprehensible instructions.  Neighborhood was quiet.
11337	7967844	9.0	10.0	53624640	What a great vacation! And the house definitely was a contributing factor! The house is beatiful, clean, and plenty of room with a view to match! Both bedrooms were very comfortable and couches were just as good to sleep on! The kitchen and living room was very open and bright, even with the cloudy weather! The ability to use my phone to unlock the front door was awesome, no need to worry about keys! The neighborhood was spectacular, very quiet and safe and beautiful trees everywhere, we walked all over the place! It is centrally located as well, it didn't take over 15 minutes to drive anywhere we wanted to go! Gabe was a great host, he responds quickly to any questions or concerns you have (which I had no concerns!) Thanks for helping my family have an amazing adventure together!
11338	7967844	9.0	10.0	53854332	"This was my first time renting through airbnb. I was unsure if I had done it right and when I communicated with Gabe he was extremely helpful and communicative. Getting into the house required downloading an app and it was truly the simplest easiest thing ever! 
The house was clean and with two queen beds it was an incredibly priced deal. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Oh yes, we went to the children's museum after we left and it was only a few minutes away! Great location!! Thank you Gabe!"
11339	7967844	9.0	10.0	54082781	I loved the view. The kitchen had everything I needed. 15$ cab ride to capitol hill was convenient. The host was friendly and quick to respond.
11340	7967844	9.0	10.0	54746287	Gabe's place was very cute and the view was gorgeous. The neighborhood is nice & quiet which made for a peaceful weekend. The only thing that could have improved our visit was if the front bedroom had window coverings. Also, the bulbs in the porch light & light over the couch didn't seem to be working. Very minor things that I'm sure will be fixed shortly. Thank you for having us!
11341	7967844	9.0	10.0	55027577	The apartment had remote entry so did not meet our host but when a small problem arose he was available and took care of it immediately. The apartment was as listed and the views from the great room were splendid.Good value for the money
11342	7967844	9.0	10.0	55401517	"We had a lovely stay at Gabe's place. Our first impression was how much bigger the apartment was than it looked in the pictures! We were more than comfortable (two adults and our son) with plenty of space. Her apartment is more beautiful than the photo, also spacious, well-equipped, comfortable living. We wouldn't hesitate to come back or to recommend it to anyone else. 
What I loved about the apartment:
- The apartment is exactly the same as on the pictures;
- Amazing view from the kitchen;
- Bbq area;
- Clean and warm place;
- Close to the downtown;"
11343	7967844	9.0	10.0	55693337	The house was clean and comfortable. Afew minor maintenance issues with a couple light bulbs out including on the porch which is very dark at night without the light. Otherwise all good. Gabe was accomodating allowing us to arrive early to drop off our luggage even while the cleaners were still there. The location is very picturesque and convenient to both the Ballard area as well as Queen Anne. Street parking was always availble but beware, it is on a steep hill so e-brake is pretty much a given
11344	7967844	9.0	10.0	55953911	"We had a wonderful stay! Gabe has a beautiful home with a great view. We used Lyft and Uber to get around and it was very affordable since the home was about 15minutes from everything. 
My only complaint was that there was no plunger in the home, which made for an interesting last day. Still, Gabe did everything he could and always responded promptly."
11345	7967844	9.0	10.0	56539425	Wonderful time staying in gabe's home. It was clean, warm, spacious and well equipped. The neighborhood was close to everything. Couldn't be happier!

11347	7967844	9.0	10.0	57531908	We loved our stay in Seattle. Gabe was a great host, very responsive and the location could not have been better. Can't wait to visit again!

The area is lovely and the apartment is spacious. Very clean and homey. They provide towels and extra linen. The kitchen was fully equip with all the tools and cutlery you need and clean. Wifi included as well as Netflix on the TV.

My only problem would be that you can sometimes hear footsteps from above and I am a very light sleeper. 

But besides that, the apartment is very private and quiet. Andria was very welcoming and accommodated to my requests. Had a great time!"
11880	6466129	9.0	10.0	36035594	The apartment's location on Green Lake is ideal. Close to the park, coffee shops and restaurants for brunch or dinner. We made coffee each morning and set out on our way. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us along with a list of places to visit and nearby restaurants. If you have a question they respond right away. Thank you for a great stay.

The keys and a bottle of wine awaited our arrival.  It was quiet and well priced.  The Greenlake neighborhood was awesome- I could live there.  It was close to everything  we wanted to do as tourists and just a beautiful, active, fun place to be.  My kids loved the playground a short walk away.  

There were some steep stairs getting down into the unit (which is below the main house) and might be difficult for certain individuals with physical limitations, but was not an issue for us.  
We had a great experience and would stay here again!  "

Both Chad & Andria (the manager) are very responsive & friendly.  Chad met us when we arrived & offered to help with anything we may need, but everything was set up & we lacked for nothing...
We'd do it again!"
11891	6466129	9.0	10.0	41363445	Chad and Andria made us feel very welcome.  Andria was very prompt in responding to any questions we had via email before our stay.  The accommodations were exactly as described, and the Green Lake area was beautiful.  We really enjoyed staying at this location.
11892	6466129	9.0	10.0	41963369	The host made me feel quite welcome, answering questions in advance.  On the check-in day, the host stopped in to say hello; the day after he answered (politely, so) questions about using this listing.  The description of the listing accurately reflected what I discovered upon arrival.  The listing's pictures offered a what-you-see, what-you-will get expectation that was fulfilled throughout the stay.  The location was convenient to recreation (a 2.8 lake trail loop across the street) and restaurants up the street and around the corner, public transportation nearby, which was used several times a time.  It was a quiet, safe, cheerful location, easily accessible to Seattle's neighborhoods, downtown area and surrounding suburbs.
11893	6466129	9.0	10.0	42323696	Great location, clean, comfortable & well set up place.  The apartment had everything we needed (coffee maker, plates, utensils, etc.).  The complimentary bottle of wine was delicious & picking blackberries & swimming in Green Lake were fabulous.
11894	6466129	9.0	10.0	42702553	Great location! Right by the Green lake.
11895	6466129	9.0	10.0	43297458	Chad's place was perfect for 3 days in Seattle. Clean and super comfortable. Green lake is fantastic neighborhood, and staying right on the lake was perfect for us
11896	6466129	9.0	10.0	43598269	This house is at a great location by the lake very safe and quiet. I arrived around 12:30 AM, and wasn't able to enter the house due to a lock issue. I contacted Andria. She immediately responded and drove all the way to the house to help us get in. She was extremely helpful in every way. Definitely a great stay. 
11897	6466129	9.0	10.0	44744093	"Chad's place is in a perfect location, and the apartment was as comfortable as described. Andria was my contact and couldn't have taken better care of me. 

You're set right on the water. It's such a breath of fresh air to walk out the door to Green Lake. Sweet people, sweet restaurants, sweet drink spots. With all that fun, it's a really healthy environment.. Everyone's moving around the lake. It was super safe, nice neighborhood.

Loved my time there"
11898	6466129	9.0	10.0	45164559	Chad and Andria definitely made us feel welcome. I appreciated that they were able to accommodate us a couple hours earlier than the standard check in time. The place was neat and tidy, and it was useful to have a washer and dryer. Location was great! Greenlake was at the front door, and shops and restaurants were only a couple of blocks away. Would definitely recommend this listing.
11899	6466129	9.0	10.0	46020200	Amazing location on Greenlake!  It was such a great neighborhood.  It was nice to see bikers, runners and families on the lake path.  Parking was easy, usually right in front of the unit.  With two young kids, it was a touch tricky getting up the exterior stairs and down the steep interior stairs.  But after a couple of trips, we were pros.  Layout and space were cozy and comfortable.  Amenities were useful and worked well, especially the in-unit washer and dryer.  The welcome gift was a great, personal touch!
11900	6466129	9.0	10.0	47572658	"The unit was clean and well stocked. The free bottle of wine on arrival was also a nice touch. Easy to get in and out on arrival/checkout. 

Only comment is the unit is in the basement, so while the unit is right on green lake, you don't get the benefits of the view. Not much natural light. "
11901	6466129	9.0	10.0	47766802	I was very excited to stay at this location and look great in pictures and the host was quick to answer my questions. The day of I had not received the code to get in made several phone calls and never received a call back till 10:30 am and was forced to book a hotel. The house looked great from the outside though....
11902	6466129	9.0	10.0	48360186	We had great three days in Seattle and in Chad´s place. Nice neighborhood and easy and fast access to downtown. The flat was super clean, comfortable, quiet and had everything you need. Check in and out was easy. The only disadvantage was that the flat is situated in the basement so you cannot get much daylight. Oh yes and the bottle of wine waiting on the table was very tasty:) !
11903	6466129	9.0	10.0	48633864	Chad and Andria were great hosts all around. They were incredibly responsive and accommodating. The space itself was comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the quiet, residential neighborhood with a great running/walking trail around the lake right out the door and easy parking. We felt that Chad or Andria were easily accessible with any questions however the space itself was very private. We'd highly recommend this place to other guests! 
11904	6466129	9.0	10.0	49172683	"I only ran into Chad a couple of times while I was there but he was really personable and easy to talk to.

I really love the house and the location.  It's just a short walk to a bunch of great places in Green Lake (restaurants, bars, cafes, etc) and you've got an amazing view of Green Lake right across the street.

The room is basically a private Mother in Law type room with it's own kitchen and bathroom which is great.   

Honestly, the best AirBnB I've stayed in so far in Seattle"
11905	6466129	9.0	10.0	49869926	Chads place was really clean and accessible to downtown Seattle. Great neighborhood and clean accommodations. 
11906	6466129	9.0	10.0	50357491	Chad greeted us at the door of his place and seemed very nice. We did not stay very long as it was only a two day trip so we did not see him other than that. As far as the home goes, it is actually only the bottom/basement floor of the home as it appears the home is compartmentalized into several homes. You enter and leave from the back and the basement has a private entrance. The apartment itself is very nice and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. The best sleep I have had in years! The apartment is right across the street from the lake which has a nice walking path around it. Some nice little local bars and restaurants within walking distance. All and all it was a great stay, would recommend!
11907	6466129	9.0	10.0	50813938	Great hosts and a great location. 
11908	6466129	9.0	10.0	50909724	I had a phenomenal stay at this location. The place was clean, well furnished. Even a lovely bottel of Wine. And came with Netflix Too!!! I would highly recommend this location to anyone. It's great place in a beautiful part of Seattle and the Host couldn't be any more accommodating!
11909	6466129	9.0	10.0	51507451	On our very first trip to Seattle our host was very welcoming! The house was very nice and easy to find.  The park right out front was so nice for us.  We love to be out doors and could easily walk around the lake.  The accommodations inside we perfect for what we were looking for.  Perfect size for the two of us and a great location to just about anything we wanted to see.  We had lost the keys (our fault) at one point and Andria was very quick to respond and get back with us to replace the key!  We enjoyed everything about this place and would love to come back again!  
11910	6466129	9.0	10.0	52527354	Chad's place was perfect for our visit to Seattle. The location on Green Lake was beautiful and conveniently located near lots of great restaurants and coffee houses. Chad greeted us at the door to make sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was nicely decorated, quiet and immaculate. And the bed was amazingly comfy as other reviewers noted. We had all we needed, and more (bottle of wine an Ben and Jerry's in the freezer :)). We will definitely stay there again!
11911	6466129	9.0	10.0	54993407	Kept in good contact with me before the visit. The apartment was as described and directly across the street from Green Lake, a popular Seattle park. I rented this as accommodation for relatives coming for Thanksgiving as it was close to where  I live.
11912	6466129	9.0	10.0	55242568	"There is literally not a bad word I can say about this place! Seriously Cozy and homely vibe. The complimentary wine was a nice touch...plus there was dunkin donuts brew in the cupboards :p

The hosts were extremely accommodating and polite! If I'm ever back in seattle I will be re-booking"
11913	6466129	9.0	10.0	56283358	"The rental unit is quite lovely and a bottle of wine on the counter is a nice touch, and the location is great!  Also, the bed is super comfy!
The one thing that was disappointing was the lack of privacy.  The listing states there is a private entrance but this is not enitrely accurate.  You must enter Chad's home to get to the door inside that is the entrance to the private unit.  This is one of 4 doors in his rear hallway.  It does not feel private to walk in the back of his home when the other doors to his living room and office are open and he is right there.   Also, it is not very quiet when he is talking or walking around upstairs.  Phone calls can be heard as well as TV or chairs rolling across the floor above.  A bit disppointing when looking for quiet.  If you are not going to be there much or don't mind a brief chat or two with your host, then it might be just fine."
11914	6466129	9.0	10.0	56352995	This is my favorite Green Lake location. It's right across the street from Green Lake, which is great for going on walks or runs. It's close to a number of coffee shops and restaurants. The hosts are very kind. I'd like to stay here again when the weather is nicer. 
11915	6466129	9.0	10.0	56435203	The place was nice and as expected.  Good location, nice blow up mattress, great for longer stays.  My only suggestion is to lower the cleaning fee, I thought it was a little over the top considering the size of the apartment.
11916	6466129	9.0	10.0	57663761	The home was perfect for us. Never had trouble parking and we weren't far from all the items on our itinerary. Thanks a bunch!
15240	5719631	9.0	10.0	38871326	"The apartment is in a good location. Really close to walk to the UW campus. The description is accurate. 

It did get a bit hot in the bedroom but Melissa provided me a fan on request.  Everything about the apartment is good except the internet. 

I could not connect to the network mentioned in the house manual. Melissa provided me another network which worked well sometimes and disappeared other times. I later figured out that the wifi signal is okay in the living room and really bad in the bedroom. I don't understand why the router was not in the apartment instead of somewhere else where the tenant cannot reset it.  I had to schlep out to UW campus two times at 5 am just to have internet to work for a deadline.  

Melissa was helpful and prompt in trying to fix the internet situation. However, it was very inconvenient since I had a lot of work to do. "
15241	5719631	9.0	10.0	39565103	"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Melissa made it easy and comfortable. The listing was accurate. She supplied extra towels and bedding for us when we requested it for our son, and also kindly supplied a fan (without being asked) since it was an unusually hot time in Seattle. She stopped by the next day to double check that we had everything that we needed. We slept very well, since the bed was comfortable. Melissa included little things, like an iron and ironing board, which I wasn't expecting but appreciated.

The location is excellent. An hourly car rental service keeps a car in the parking lot (and more nearby), which we used to take a trip up to the Boeing factory, and frequent buses run downtown within a few blocks of the apartment. Even though this unit isn't in the middle of downtown, we had no problem getting around the city inexpensively. Melissa was a great host, and we enjoyed our stay!"
15242	5719631	9.0	10.0	41096214	The place was as advertised. Spacious and comfortable. Melissa was very responsive to our needs. Great location. Very quiet but only a block or two away from restaurants and such. Excellent access to public transportation. Would stay there again. 
15330	7363462	9.0	9.0	39246065	Modern Home is very welcoming. Clean and clutter free, many quality breakfast foods to help yourself to. Dario and his manager Ethan are very easy going and helpful. Ethan made me feel at home and I would stay with them again without hesitation. Thanks for the conversation fellas!  
15331	7363462	9.0	9.0	39580901	"Dario and Ethan who manages provide a truly wonderful service.  I don't want to say so many nice things that this place is always full and I cannot get in in the future :-) But its that good!

I loved that they provide free breakfast - eggs, toast, cereals, orange juice, berries and fruits, etc etc.
I love that they've just done the place up and everything feels designer, new, and clean.

The location is awesome in terms of restaurants.  I am a vegan and i found some of the best vegan restaurants I've ever been to within 10-minutes walk.

Free wifi works great.  I was able to sit quietly and get a lot of work done on my laptop.

Ethan is incredibly helpful and really keeps the place spotless and creates a warm ambience.

Its thoroughly recommended.  These guys are taking airbnb seriously, and creating an environment that just beats a hotel hands down, and way better value for money. 

Flowers in the bedroom, and plants in the bathroom. nice candles. Lovely decor.

Excellent!

Taddy Blecher from South Africa"
15332	7363462	9.0	9.0	39847857	Clean, safe, and welcoming. Had a good stay, would stay again.
15333	7363462	9.0	9.0	41028706	Very cozy room and easy to navigate, quiet neighborhood. There was a bit of trouble with the bed but it was fixed right away. Very busy hosts, though. I usually have my own agenda and it doesn't bother me, but others may expect more hospitality from the host.
15334	7363462	9.0	9.0	42241441	"This room was exactly as advertised and perfect for my needs!
The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. Everything that I needed in terms of internet, food, access etc. was clearly labeled. 
The breakfast and access to the kitchen was great. There was a nice variety of options. The host was pretty timely in communication. "
15335	7363462	9.0	9.0	42607436	Room was as described, everything was clean, well-organized and self-explanatory. No problems. I would probably do a 1-2 night stay again. 
15336	7363462	9.0	9.0	43125186	"Had a pleasant stay. The place was clean and everything was well-stocked.

The only thing to be mindful of when staying in this room is that you can hear people go up and down the stairs and it's pretty loud (the bed positions your head right next to the stairs). Thankfully, there didn't seem to be a lot of people in the house when I was there so it wasn't an issue. If you're a light sleeper it might be more of a problem."
15337	7363462	9.0	9.0	43586613	"I had a wonderful stay in the Pink Room.  It is exactly as pictured and described.  My interactions were with Ethan who was prompt, responsible and an overall nice guy.  This place felt a bit like a hostel in the best way possible.  I got to come and go as I pleased and met interesting fellow travelers.  

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a clean, comfortable and easy place to stay in Seattle!"
15338	7363462	9.0	9.0	44621979	"Dario's place is very nice, clean and friendly home. Its close to bus lines that go downtwon but it takes some time to get there.. I didnt actually met him but Ethan that live and work at the house was very nice .
I met few interesting and nice people and it's really fun when you travel alone."
15339	7363462	9.0	9.0	45414963	Great overall experience. Easy check-in and coordination with Dario.
15340	7363462	9.0	9.0	46097003	"I was impressed by how much was provided for guests including food, towels, and some misc. items. The room was cute and everything was super clean. 

That being said, this was more like a hostel/guest house experience than someone's home, complete with a key code to get in, multiple guests, several international people cooking at the same time and common spaces that felt pretty sterile and unlived in.

 That's not really a criticism, just different than what I expected from an AirBnB experience."
15341	7363462	9.0	9.0	46434484	The location was about 20 minutes by bus to downtown. Close to the UW and the university district. There was a little delay in communication but nothing too bad, nice and clean house and is perfect spot for anyone visiting UW. 
15342	7363462	9.0	9.0	46682825	The home was lovely and clean, the bedroom was big enough for my belongings and to get comfortable. I don't think I've ever felt better quality sheets in my life. Great stay!
15343	7363462	9.0	9.0	47510263	Awesome place. Had a bit of a security problem but we fixed it. 
15344	7363462	9.0	9.0	48747149	I did not have the chance to meet Dario but everything was as advertised.  The bathroom was clean and the wifi worked extremely well.
15345	7363462	9.0	9.0	49076549	Dario was easy to contact w questions.  Place worked out perfectly. 
15346	7363462	9.0	9.0	49297987	Very clean, quiet, great breakfast! The location is also only ten minutes from plenty of different restaurants and bars. Would stay again.
15347	7363462	9.0	9.0	50294391	"I really enjoyed my stay in the Pink Room.
The house itself is conveniently located a short walk from the University and it's accessible by buses. I had no troubles checking in or out and the communication with Dario and Ethan was quick. The room was clean and comfortable for my needs. I really liked the kitchen with available breakfast for all the guests. I recommend this room if you like being by yourself and minding your own business in a quiet and clean house."
15348	7363462	9.0	9.0	50686486	Good value, worked well for my needs and a nice walk over to the University. Also enjoyed having Ravenna park nearby.
15349	7363462	9.0	9.0	51493750	I recommend this place! Perfect to stay. 
15350	7363462	9.0	9.0	52752413	I loved this room and house!!! The Pink Room is a cute small bedroom and it was perfect for my stay - just the right price and size. I liked the way the house was set up. It was very comfortable and quiet. All of the house guests seemed at ease coming and going on different schedules. Very laid back but respectful. I loved the University District. I took the bus everyday and was able to get downtown easily. Ethan and Dario really know what they're doing and have come up with a perfect AirBnB formula. The breakfast was a very nice bonus. I would definitely stay there again!
15351	7363462	9.0	9.0	53524620	It was great. The room was ready way before I arrived, which I appreciated. It is a lot smaller than I thought, but that was okay. There was no pressure to be social or converse with people in the house which is what I wanted. It was always very quiet, except when I would hear someone gettinf ready in the bathroom next door. I only met Dario very briefly and that was good enough for me. The bathroom is right next door which is convenient. The rooms and the entire house are always clean and everything was in stock. Would do again. 
15352	7363462	9.0	9.0	54789043	This house is in a good location,quiet,but it is not so far from downtown.I will still choose it next time.
15353	7363462	9.0	9.0	55139398	I had a good time staying in Dario's place. The room was clean and warm, and everything worked well in the house. We did have a lot of choices in breakfast. I had a busy schedule so I actually haven't seen Dario and his roommate, but they have set everything well and ready.
15354	7363462	9.0	9.0	55678416	The room was nice and clean. The location is awesome. Lots of buses very close to the house. Dario wasnt there but his friend Ethan was there to help. I would recommend this place!:D
15355	7363462	9.0	9.0	56730346	Just as with my stay in the property's tangerine room, the Brown House operates very efficiently for airbnb guests. UW is certainly walkable, but there are also many convenient buses there, downtown, and elsewhere. The neighborhood feels quiet and safe and the room is accurately portrayed.
15356	7363462	9.0	9.0	57105205	Great spot. Easy to walk and grab food.
15357	7363462	9.0	9.0	57371656	Cozy and comfy, great location-- near bus lines, grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants.  Dario and Ethan were easy to work with and provided for a great experience.  Really nice to have breakfast options provided.  Would definitely stay again.
15579	7353834	9.0	9.0	42009289	"Melissa's apartment was located in a very walkable location next to the University of Washington. 

She made check-in and check-out very smooth and simple.

The listing is accurate and I would be happy to return in the future."
15580	7353834	9.0	9.0	42978014	Super Spartan furnishings but perfect if you're in Seattle to be out and about, good location and close to a lot of things!
17133	4418480	9.0	10.0	24651598	We stayed at Nick's place almost a month during December. He has been very easy to communicate with from the very beginning. His place located right in the middle of the action in Seattle. Very cozy, clean, and great appliances. This is a great place for anyone. Highly recommend.  Would love to stay next time we come around. Thanks
17134	4418480	9.0	10.0	30412170	Great host!  Very easy to communicate with, nice apartment in a good location, and clean.  So many great restaurants in the area and easy access to several bus routes.  I'd definitely stay again.  
17135	4418480	9.0	10.0	41641947	Nick's place is a very nice and comfortable apartment in a great neighborhood. Check in and check out was flexible. Host was very responsive and available if needed. I would highly recommend if wanting to stay in Capitol Hill.
17136	4418480	9.0	10.0	43142671	Nick was very communicative, easy to work with, and quick to respond whenever we had a question. Can't beat the location for Capital Hill.  The second floor deck made for great people watching.
17137	4418480	9.0	10.0	51249560	Just wanna say that Nicks has a beautiful apartment and great location if you enjoy going out or relaxing. Nick was very helpful with information when you need something. I will definitely recommend this place to any body.
17138	4418480	9.0	10.0	52028650	Very nice and well located apartment. Host friendly and easy to contact. Lovely experience!!
17139	4418480	9.0	10.0	53422116	There were some hiccups with the cleaning service prior to my arrival and the place wasn't quite guest-ready. The main thing that bothered me were the sheets that needed washing. The one coin-operated laundry unit in the building was occupied every time I checked, so I ended up sleeping on a friend's couch elsewhere in the city. Beyond that, the space is big, has nice furniture, and is in a great location. With an easy fix regarding cleanliness, this would be a top-notch spot. 
17140	4418480	9.0	10.0	57174263	Great place to stay if you like to be close to restaurants and bars. Very comfortable environment and host was excellent.
18318	443736	9.0	9.0	1249569	"This is a great little space in a wonderful part of Seattle.  I can't say enough good things about it.  There's a lot going on in a little space, but the bed's so comfortable, the kitchen's great, wireless internet is convenient, laundry's right downstairs, and the porch is awesome for those sunny days.  The apartment is in a quiet and nice neighborhood--look for the parking that isn't limited to two hours--there's a street nearby!  There's a bus stop less than a block away that takes you to all the great spots downtown--so easy!  And Capitol Hill is right out your doorstep. 

Monika is just as great as the apartment.  Despite the fact that we were unable to meet before I ""moved in,"" we communicated well.  She's very on top of things and so friendly and helpful.

Definitely consider a stay at this apartment--Monika offers it at a great price, too!"
18319	443736	9.0	9.0	1459274	Monika was very prompt in her responses to all inquiries we made. We decided to change our plans a day before we were to stay in her place, and she was very accommodating to those changes. The apartment was in a convenient location to downtown and the bed was comfortable… exactly what we were looking for. We did not use the kitchen but appreciated that it was clean and ready for use if we needed it. 
18320	443736	9.0	9.0	1507185	Monika's place was great for what we needed. It was very clean and Monika was very accommodating to our needs and easy to communicate with. I'd recommend her place if you want to be near Capitol Hill but not right in the action- it's a quiet neighborhood.
18321	443736	9.0	9.0	1575136	Monika's place is great. It's just spacious enough for one person, with a large bathroom and fully-functional kitchen. It's conveniently located on two major bus routes into downtown Seattle. Monika made it really easy to arrive and leave. Thanks for making my stay enjoyable!
18322	443736	9.0	9.0	1756088	"Great experience! Monika was awesome to communicate with and always responded to any questions right away.

The space itself is great. Great bed, awesome bathroom and kitchen and the back deck is wonderful. Very private. The neighborhood is a short and enjoyable walk to the heart of Capitol Hill and close to Ezell's Famous Chicken!!!!

I gave it 4 stars due to a lack of any closet space but not a big deal. There is plenty of room and surfaces to put clothes etc."
18323	443736	9.0	9.0	1787682	"My boyfriend and I stayed at Monika's while attending the Capitol Hill Block Party. We never met Monika, but she and her house mate Kayla provided us with everything we needed! It was a great space and I can't express how cozy. Although we didn't spend too much time there, we loved coming back to it every night. It felt like coming home! If you ever stay, make use of the lovely patio and kitchen. The location was perfect to for us. We were able to walk to the event every day and pass several amazing restaurants and coffee shops. We went to Presse twice! If you are in a pinch and need something, there is a small convenient store down the street that has limited items. 

I have to say that I did love the eclectic artwork sprinkled around the studio. It was fun getting a sense of her artistic style. It also seems that her yard is in a ""transition"" face, but that didn't bother use too much. It was far better than staying at a crap hotel 15 miles south of the city. This was my first time using airbnb and it lived up to it's expectations. I will be using again when staying in NOLA this fall. It has now become my go to place when searching for places to stay in a city. 

Thanks again to Monika for being a great host and having the cutest place in a great hood!!"
18324	443736	9.0	9.0	1849110	This is a cute space in a convenient location in Seattle. The area is very quiet even though public transportation and a number of good bars and restaurants are nearby. The back deck of this apartment is a particularly enjoyable feature and is very relaxing and surrounded by greenery. My only complaints have to do with the state of the apartment upon my arrival. The floors, toilet, and shower were not sufficiently clean for a guest having never been there. Additionally, and curiously, there was nowhere to put my clothes. I essentially had to live out of my suitcase for the duration (6 days) of my stay as there was no drawer or closet space provided. Overall, I would recommend this space so long as the host takes these comments into consideration for the next guest.
18325	443736	9.0	9.0	1901986	The place was great! Simple, clean with a great deck and yard. It was a great location - walking distance to all the great restaurants and bars of Capitol Hill. We would stay again.
18326	443736	9.0	9.0	1956407	Monika's studio is great. The incredibly soft yet immensly supportive bed is worth checking out the place alone.  Everything that we needed was available for us and we loved the location. We had no issues until the day that we were set to leave, I forgot about check-out times (my fault! luckily we completed everything on the check-out list) but Monika flexible with us (we appreciate it!).  
18327	443736	9.0	9.0	2304159	Monika was an excellent host. Everything was clean and organized, and she was very helpful and communicative. The Cherry St. House was charming and quiet, and close to the best stuff on Capitol Hill. I will definitely be staying here again.
18328	443736	9.0	9.0	2344159	Great location! Stayed here for two nights and i really enjoyed the cozy apartment. A lot of points of interests are with in walking distance. 
18329	443736	9.0	9.0	2362627	Monika's private studio is a great value in a centrally located part of Seattle. The back deck is one of the nicest features. Monika was a clear communicator and check in and out was easy. It is orders of magnitude nicer than any equivalent priced hotel.
18330	443736	9.0	9.0	2808717	Monika's place was lovely, had everything you could need and in a great location! Couldn't ask for better!!
18331	443736	9.0	9.0	4541596	5 weeks of grad school left for this wife + Mama of 2 teens. I needed a beautiful, quiet, safe Room of My Own to reflect, sleep + keep up on my beginning trumpet practice while writing two final papers. I  put off finding a place until the day before I needed it. When I saw Monika's studio apt it looked ideal. She got in touch w/me right away and all the arrangements ahead of time were super easy. The place was immaculate + set up well for my needs. Bedding was comfortable, even luxurious. I made many of my meals there. Great to have different areas in such a small space. Monika has a way with color and feathering a nest; I felt physically held in beauty. There was a deck at tree level w/a great table + chairs so I could write among the birds. I took a bath twice in the incredibly spacious bathroom (especially for a studio apt). Great place, great location, great deal. I hope to be back.
18332	443736	9.0	9.0	5127272	"What an amazing spot - cozy, funky, perched high among the trees (flickers and starlings and squirrels and jays nesting all around), light pouring in from all sides, a luxurious deck, a fully equipped kitchenette, boldest house color in the neighborhood, Monika - and the manager Erin -  helpful, responsive, easy-going. 

Great, diverse, central location too - walkable to Capitol Hill, to the International District, to Downtown, to the Central District ... a small stretch to Lake Washington, the Arboretum, Interlaken Park. 

Really, I stayed for a month and can't even come up with a quibble. 

I hesitate to recommend it only because I may want to stay there again - and would be sad if it were already taken!"
18333	443736	9.0	9.0	6533552	Cute and cozy!
18334	443736	9.0	9.0	7043442	Monika's apartment was clean, cozy and a wonderful place to crash. It was easy to locate, had everything we needed and Monika was readily available to answer any questions we had. Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable - would recommend this place to anyone! 
18335	443736	9.0	9.0	7172743	Thanks for a great stay in a very convenient area. Internet works well and the apartment was really comfortable. Will stay again when I'm in Seattle.
18336	443736	9.0	9.0	7308607	This is a great spot to use as a home base while spending some time in Seattle.......  Right on bus lines that run in to the heart of downtown.........    As for the unit itself,   it was clean and comfortable........   Very private with  a great deck for relaxing on in the evenings,   after spending the day pounding the city streets.......   I would definitely stay here again..........    
18337	443736	9.0	9.0	7663004	The reservation was canceled 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18338	443736	9.0	9.0	9074281	I didn't get to meet Monika, but everything was exactly as she said it would be! This was a great location for me to get around town and to get to the hospitals that I needed to visit, and I'd definitely stay there again. I didn't make use of any of the kitchen stuff, but it looked like everything was in order. Thanks!
18339	443736	9.0	9.0	9122344	"I did not get to meet Monika in person, but she is still my hero.  I locked myself out in sub-freezing temperatures, and she responded to my panicked text within two minutes, so I did not have to stand there freezing.  Thank you Monika!

The apartment was just as advertised - a small studio with a lived-in feel, within in walking distance of several good restaurants (it is worth going a bit further for the ribs and sweet potato pie at the Barbeque Pit), and right on major bus lines.  It was too cold for me to check out the deck.  The neighborhood was very quiet.

Monika seems to have addressed the issues raised by earlier reviews - there is a bureau with plenty of drawer space, and a rack for hanging clothes. I did not try the queen bed with the foam rubber pad, but the single bed had a real mattress that was plenty firm.
 "
18340	443736	9.0	9.0	9387566	This was my first visit to Seattle, and now I know where to stay when I come back! :) House is very clean and cozy, no surprises. Everything detail is provided in the house manual, and I had no problem getting around the city, since bus stop is literally right in front of the house. Thanks Monika!
18341	443736	9.0	9.0	9417638	The place was a perfect crash pad for me as a single person who likes to adventure in the city lights but come home to peace and quiet as it's technically in the city, but out of the hustle and bustle and noise of the commercial areas. Everything was clean and Monika and Erin were more than accommodating with me booking at the last minute before Christmas Eve, and even responded to issues I had that night with the internet. I would definitely stay there again.
18342	443736	9.0	9.0	9484805	Monika's apartment was pleasant, cozy, and excellently located. Though I didn't get a chance to meet Monika, she was very responsive and answered all my questions. I recommend her as a host.
18343	443736	9.0	9.0	9626564	"Great place with room for 4, although it was only me. Small kitchen, but more than enough to sustain yourself for a weekend. Good location to the Needle, Marketplace and nightlife. 

Thanks for a great stay!"
18344	443736	9.0	9.0	9836030	This is such a nice space, very comfortable and welcoming.  The host is an artist, and has some really great pieces displayed.  I really enjoyed my stay.
18345	443736	9.0	9.0	10073636	Had a brilliant stay in Seattle at Monika's place. Nice a cosy and well located, it really accommodated my needs perfectly. It is very much self-serviced and I was able to cook breakfast each morning and get out to everywhere I was hoping to see in Seattle. A great host!
18346	443736	9.0	9.0	10676342	Very charming studio. I would definitely stay there again on a future visit to Seattle.
18347	443736	9.0	9.0	10761223	Monika's place is lovely, secure and easily accessible, and provided a cosy nook to crawl back to out of the Seattle rain. it's got everything you need, was clean and quiet and a very comfortable bed! Thank you!
18348	443736	9.0	9.0	11024678	We had a lovely experience in Monika's studio apartment. We enjoyed the artwork and brightness of the studio. The place is small, but nicely laid out. The kitchen was well-stocked with cooking utensils and the bathroom was very roomy. Perfect for a mini getaway vacation for two! The bed was also extremely comfortable. The apartment is in a quiet location, with a short walk to the local food co-op and neighborhood coffee shop. We didn't get a chance to meet Monika, but we had no problems with check-in and any questions that we might have had were answered in the House Manual. 
18349	443736	9.0	9.0	11554666	Nice and quiet place to relax and explore the city!
18350	443736	9.0	9.0	11703549	Monika's place was very convenient for my boyfriend and I. Although she was out of town, her house mate Erinn was very helpful. Our stay was short, but we enjoyed our accommodations. 
18351	443736	9.0	9.0	11757166	Monika's place was comfortable, cozy and in a really cool neighborhood. Didn't get the chance to meet her but Erinn was very responsive in helping with any questions.
18352	443736	9.0	9.0	12152303	"I will say that this place was so-so.  Showed up at 3 pm and there were dirty sheets on the bed and wet towels in the bathroom.  Called Monika and she was a bit rude exclaiming, ""check in is at 5 pm.""  Checked my email confirmation and check in was actually 2 pm.  Regardless, we left so that the place could be cleaned. Monika wasn't apologetic.  Emailed her our confirmation email that afternoon just so she knew that her supposed check in wasn't what it said in our email and never heard back. 

In terms of the place, it was fine but nothing extraordinary. If you're in a pinch stay here.  Otherwise, look for something else.  "
18353	443736	9.0	9.0	12328329	Great little budget place that is located in a central neighborhood. Very quiet and safe neighborhood. Lots of bars/restaurants/shops close by in Capitol Hill. We actually walked nearly everywhere we wanted to go, but transit access was easy. Kitchen has all you need to make a meal in the house. Wifi worked well. We needed a few more towels and Erinn, the property manager, promptly delivered. We had a great time during our first Seattle stay.
18354	443736	9.0	9.0	13561541	Monika, I love how you put your creativity into every aspect of your home.  It was a pleasure staying at your apartment and very convenient for my internship.  Thanks again so much!
18355	443736	9.0	9.0	49657205	Listing was accurate. Host was great. Neighborhood was nice.
18356	443736	9.0	9.0	50013769	The listing was great and host was very informative and helpful!
18357	443736	9.0	9.0	50947568	The listing was very accurate and helpful. The neighborhood seemed pretty nice. The house is about a block away from a hospital. 
18358	443736	9.0	9.0	51918388	I enjoyed staying here. Monika and Ryan both are helpful. I appreciated Ryan's quick response when I had questions while I was there. Lots of great little restaurants up 12th St. I found the apartment to be cozy. The bed was very comfortable!
18359	443736	9.0	9.0	52294625	Quiet and convenient accommodations.  Never heard or anyone.  Great communication.
18360	443736	9.0	9.0	52442533	Monika's upstairs studio is a great home base for visiting Seattle. It's centrally located and within waking/uber distance from lots of great spots. They've done a great job with the space and it's extremely cozy. Would love to go back next time!
18361	443736	9.0	9.0	52557337	My husband and I stayed here during a quick overnight trip to Seattle. Great location, clean, perfect little stop over spot.
18362	443736	9.0	9.0	52856186	I enjoyed the large studio apartment.  It was comfortable and functional.  I particularly appreciated the full kitchen and privacy of the unit.  I personally would have liked a comfortable reading chair, but was able to adjust pillows and read on the bed.  A very nice unit that is a great value.
18363	443736	9.0	9.0	53691371	We loved this house, it was so cozy and beautiful! The self check in and out was easy and it was a really nice place to stay!
18364	443736	9.0	9.0	53866119	Cute studio in a ceteral location that allowed us to access everything we needed. Clean with comfortable bed. Easy and convenient check in and check out process. 
18365	443736	9.0	9.0	55609535	"I stayed at Monika's place for 2 weeks. The place is really comfortable and private. You have the private entrance, small kitchen and your own bathroom which makes you feel like at your own place. The location is really good, approx 20 min to downtown by bus. The bus stop is just 1 min walking from the house. 
I didn't have a chance to meet Monika but I met Ryan, the house manager. He seems to be a really cool person...
To sum up, my overall impression was good. I would recommend this place both for long and short stays.

Thank you Monika and Ryan!
Izabela "
18366	443736	9.0	9.0	56168563	"The apartment worked great for my sister and I. There was some confusion about what the apartment was going to be like, but Monika made it right. 
It was a good stay at her place."
18367	443736	9.0	9.0	56221695	"Easy to find .. Clean .. Host very responsive to questions / emails ..
Great bang for your buck , great location !!!"
18368	443736	9.0	9.0	56400626	Monika's private studio apartment was amazing! She had everything set up, because we arrived pretty late at night and we didn't have to disturb anyone to let ourselves in. The bed was very comfortable! I would definitely sleep in that bed my whole life if I could! It is very clean and close to the bus that takes you to downtown pretty quickly. The neighborhood is calm, we slept without outside noises, eveything was amazing, it made our stay enjoyable, even though we didn't get to meet her, I love that she had everything organize and set up to fend for ourselves, and made easier the process to check in and check out.
19456	6716380	9.0	10.0	35611335	I stayed in Jay's beautiful home with a buddy of mine for a long weekend to attend the U.S. Open. The location was prime! Walkable to all the action in Capitol Hill and Chuck's Hop Shop(an awesome beer place!)He provided some water bottles in the refrigerator and after asking brought down some pots and pans to cook. He was available when needed and communicated very well, particularly when I was first attempting to book his place. His family, who lived upstairs, was very sweet.  The space seemed like a mother-in-law kinda of setup. Jay was able to provide many useful tips and recommendations and the guidebook was helpful. The bathroom was clean with towels and all the amenities. He also allowed me to have a late checkout which was extra nice. The coolest part was the lock system. He invited me to use an app August that used Bluetooth technology for the lock. All I had to do was walk up to the door, wait for it to recognize the lock, push the unlock button on my phone and magic, the door unlocked!The space had a private entrance and parking which both were great. I highly recommend anyone staying here!
19457	6716380	9.0	10.0	38081084	Perfect location and jay was great in helping us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible and the space was perfect for my wife and I and our three kids. Thanks for making our stay in a Seattle extra great.
19458	6716380	9.0	10.0	39318646	Jay and his family were very accommodating and the location is just perfect for anything that you will want to do in/near Seattle. He and his family left for a long weekend while we were there and made sure that we had everything we needed before leaving us there. The accommodations were nice and he listened to our concern of not having windows that open (we are from the South East and love windows open during nice weather.) Jay was sure that we had fans for our comfort. He also made available to us his outdoor grill and seating area. Having an off street parking spot is a great advantage!!
19459	6716380	9.0	10.0	39547467	"Jay's home was exactly as described. My friend and I were looking for spacious, comfortable and clean accommodations for a 2-night stay in Seattle. The area, as advertised, is extremely convenient via bus and car. While it was off major roads, you don't get the traffic that you would expect from a major road. The street that it is located on is extremely tight so driveway parking was super helpful. At the time of our stay (late-July 2015), there was construction going on next door. The one negative about the stay was that it was not mentioned in the listing. It looked like full construction was going on and a new home was being erected so mornings would get loud if you are a light sleeper. That said, the neighborhood itself was safe and quaint. I was able to go out for a run and walk both mornings who no worries.  

As a host, Jay was great! He responded quickly to emails and messages. He lives above the rental and came by after our very late arrival to check-in on us and make sure everything was OK. The keyless entry system through the August phone app is awesome & really alleviated any concerns about losing a key and whatnot. Overall, a great stay and highly recommend it for a wonderful space in a safe, convenient neighborhood and great host! "
19460	6716380	9.0	10.0	39791875	Jay was a great host even though we unfortunately didn't meet. The unit is clean,  comfortable and provides everything you need. It's also in a nice little neighborhood of Seattle. Highly recommend staying here, I suspect I will be back.
19461	6716380	9.0	10.0	42420006	The whole experience was great. Jay was kind and welcoming. He also went out of his way to accommodate me. The unit was clean and spacious, and very comfortable. I couldn't have been happier with my stay.
19462	6716380	9.0	10.0	42788937	Jay was very kind and helpful towards us. If i come to Seattle again, i'll definitely choose his house. He has good recommendations about the city so you dont need to worry about your vacation
19463	6716380	9.0	10.0	43313867	The home was very welcoming and comfortable. It felt as if we were at home our self. The location is very convenient to every places. Followed Jay's advice, we left our car on the driveway and used ubers to go many tourist attractions. We had a great weekend trip in Seattle.  
19464	6716380	9.0	10.0	43993572	Great location with easy access to downtown Seattle. The apartment was very spacious and the two bedrooms were perfect for our trip. Wonderful hosts! 
19465	6716380	9.0	10.0	45126201	Everything was as it should be. Like the neighborhood.
19793	555858	9.0	9.0	1591662	"Qing Chen listed the apartment and claimed it was available, and then told us it was under renovations after he approved us. I even had a message conversation with him about how many people were staying and if there were anyone else staying at the property. So him claiming renovations after viewing the photos does not scream honesty to me.

He pulled out on me with less than 48 hrs notice, which was careless of him and caused us to have to book on Hot Wire spending $100 more than we had bugeded. 

Be careful of booking with this guy, or better yet, do yourself a favor and book elsewhere. 

This is my first experience using Airbnb and it has not been a good one. I tried to contact Airbnb 24 hour phone line but after the phone rang for ten mints I did not want to wait the full 24 hours for someone to pick up the phone. Airbnb did contact me the following day and refunded me and was very apologetic and offered to assist me to find another place."
19794	555858	9.0	9.0	1878305	"Our stay at the Historical Victorian Garden House at Seattle war great. 
Lena Chen gave us a hearty and warm wellcome. We have been very happy to stay in this deluxe house with its furnishings, kitchen, bathroom and the nice porch,  We also enjoyed our daily brekfast.
Whenever it is possible for us to come to Seattle again, we will book this old house with speacial atmosphere. 
The good bus contection to go to the downtown was quite good."
19795	555858	9.0	9.0	2155333	"This place is very beautiful -  I love old places.  Also the sun that poured into the place was great and it was in a cute neighbourhood. Lena is a very friendly and helpful host.  I'd give it a 3.5/5 if possible actually (I only gave it a 3 as you can't give half stars...).  

Just a few comments -  the place could have been a little cleaner for my high standards of cleanliness.  The bed linen and towels and stuff were all clean... just a bit more fine detail in the bathroom and kitchen would have been good.  Also, the floors seemed to have been repainted in some areas recently and were quite sticky in these areas.  This lead to dust sticking to the floor.  Hopefully they weren't permanently ruined as a result...  

Also, to make this place better they really need to stock the kitchen with a few more essentials - like a good set of knives (there were no cutting knives to speak of - lucky we had some) and a coffee pot for starters."
19796	555858	9.0	9.0	2904520	3 friends and I stayed at Qing's house and it was just lovely!  Not only did they leave towels and snacks out for us, but they were also extremely helpful with airport transfer info (advising us which trains to take and such).  Thanks Qing!  
19797	555858	9.0	9.0	5553626	The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
19798	555858	9.0	9.0	5897281	My stay went well and the house was cozy. I worked most of the day and when I was in the house, it was a great place to retreat. The room/house looked a bit different from the pictures online. The bedroom was arranged differently and the house had a room blocked off. I appreciated the cleanliness of the room and house. I would consider staying here again on my next visit. 
19799	555858	9.0	9.0	6287973	"We've got a nice apartment with a separate entrance from the back of the house on the main floor. I can't say for the other rooms in this house but our definitely worth staying in. It's calm and safe neighbourhood. Every morning we woke up like in the countryside and enjoyed our breakfast on the open patio in the backyard. 

Also worth mentioning you don't have to to share common space with a host, just with the guests like you. It makes you feel freedom of actions and doesn't constraint you. "
19800	555858	9.0	9.0	23778707	"I enjoyed my visit. Studio in large house. Private entrance,  Whirlpool (brand) jet-tub in private bath, large shared kitchen, very-firm very-comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood.
"
19801	555858	9.0	9.0	33729481	I didn't meet Qing nor Lena who is responsible for the appartment (just got the code to the door). The room was nice and the separate entrance is quite handy. Unfortunately there was no duvet cover for the blanket. The bus lines 3 and 4 which stop around the corner and run regularly towards downtown. The yard is a bit messy and finding the door to the property is a bit tricky.
19802	555858	9.0	9.0	34808491	Qing is a very nice host! The room is quiet and clean. location is really convenient. 
19803	555858	9.0	9.0	41411253	Great private room. Bed was very comfortable and big. The room has a toilet/shower but there is no partition/door between that and the main room, which could be an issue for some. There's another bathroom in the main part of the house you can also use. Overall, a great experience.
19804	555858	9.0	9.0	42934906	"A comfortable, contemporary, and seemingly recently remodeled room that is connected to the kitchen/dining room area of the main house. The entrance is behind the house but should not be confused for the guest house that is also behind the house. The bathroom section of the room is connected to the room without a divider, making bathing, showering, and using the restroom an ""open"" experience if there is more than one guest. It's not far from Capitol Hill where loads of restaurants are found; proved convenient for us. I didn't meet Qing personally but the house manager, Lena was sweet and available to answer our questions. "
19805	555858	9.0	9.0	48478424	Everything was great, just as advertised.
20278	3416217	9.0	10.0	15016191	Selma was a gracious and responsive host (fresh flowers & chocolate greet guests) and the apartment is quite comfortable, with lovely artwork all around. Also very central location in the city & the reserved parking spot was a major plus. I would definitely stay here again!
20279	3416217	9.0	10.0	15782925	This was my first time in Seattle and my first Airbnb experience. I feel truly lucky to have found Selma's sweet retreat. The space was comfortable, homey, and relaxing. She was thoughtful, helpful, and sweet. Couldn't be happier. 
20280	3416217	9.0	10.0	16121627	Selma's apartment was a great hidden spot, close to everything, a perfect place to unwind. She was a very gracious and helpful host, couldn't have asked for a better AirBnB experience overall!
20281	3416217	9.0	10.0	16919037	My friend and I had a great time at Stella's apartment. It was charming, comfortable, and conveniently located for everything we wanted to do in Seattle. Stella was flexible with our check in time to accommodate the arrival of our flights, and her partner actually hung out to let us in, show us around and give us great food recommendations on the morning we arrived. Stella was also very responsive, checked in with me about arrival and departure, and even left a helpful note with chocolate to welcome us to her place! Overall, this was a great experience with a great host and if I'm ever in Seattle again, I'll definitely look into staying here again.
20282	3416217	9.0	10.0	17139107	The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20283	3416217	9.0	10.0	17285378	Selma's house was comfy and very welcoming, she was always responsive to text with questions I had. Definitely recommend it. 
20284	3416217	9.0	10.0	17575365	Selma's place was fantastic.  The place is located in a nice quiet residential street but it is still very close to the action of downtown and nearby nightlife.  The unit was very welcoming and I felt like I was at home.  She is quick to respond to messages and was overall a great host.  Would stay again.
20285	3416217	9.0	10.0	18798330	This apartment was in a fabulous location- super convenient to all sorts of shops, restaurants, and easy access to public transportation. Selma was very helpful and gave us some great suggestions for spots to check out in the neighborhood. The apartment was also incredibly clean and very cute!
20286	3416217	9.0	10.0	19133897	Selma was a lovely host, very welcoming and informative about the neighborhood and local businesses.  She was easy to get in touch with and responded quickly both prior to and during our stay. The apartment was great as well, spacious and comfortable, and in a very convenient location near Capitol Hill. 
20287	3416217	9.0	10.0	20086188	Selma was very responsive and her place was just what we needed for our stay in Seattle. We could walk a few blocks to the Capitol Hill district and a traders joes is very close! Having the parking space was so great and her place was very cute and clean! 
20288	3416217	9.0	10.0	21990840	The experience was great. I stayed at the place for several nights with my mom. Selma is very responsive, replying to my messages within 10 minutes. Her house is cute and clean. All the basics we needed were provided, even local coffee. The  house is located on a quite block, about 25 minutes walking to downtown riverfront. Overall I am happy with the experience. 
20289	3416217	9.0	10.0	22330639	"Selma's place was absolutely amazing! My friend was in town from LA and this was the perfect location, it was centrally located yet tucked away for the times we just wanted some quiet from the city life. Her place was immaculate and she was super tentative yet respected our privacy. I highly recommend Selma's wonderful place next
Time you're in Seattle! "
20290	3416217	9.0	10.0	23265885	"We booked Selma's place for my husband's parents to stay on their recent visit. They had a wonderful stay and specifically mentioned that the bed and shower were amazing. 

Selma was quick to respond to any questions and very easy to communicate with."
20291	3416217	9.0	10.0	23647597	Perfect spot & very professional experience.  Hope to stay here next time I'm in Seattle
20292	3416217	9.0	10.0	25810184	Great host & great place.  A wonderful AirBnB experience.
20293	3416217	9.0	10.0	26942782	Another wonderful stay at this great place.  Highly recommended!
20294	3416217	9.0	10.0	28473313	Recently stayed at Sweet Retreat while visiting my daughter at SU.  Selma made the arrangement to get situated very easy. The place is very nice, clean and comfortable. The onsite parking was so nice. We regularly walked the short trip to Trader Joe's and this location was perfect. Would/ will stay here again. All the plants really brighten up a cloudy day. 
20295	3416217	9.0	10.0	28881657	Extremely nice apartment in a great location (bus stop right around the corner), wholeheartedly recommended!
20296	3416217	9.0	10.0	29217618	Selma was super responsive, as usual.  I had another lovely stay at her place.  Clean, convenient, and has a dedicated parking spot.  If you are looking for a place on Capitol Hill that is also close to the Central District, I highly recommend it.
20297	3416217	9.0	10.0	29927402	My parents stayed at Selma's during their recent visit to Seattle. They have a great stay! Selma was very welcoming, communicative, and helpful. The building is charming with a nice front yard. The neighborhood is great - quiet, but just a block from a fantastic coffee shop (Tougo) and only a few blocks to the heart of Capitol Hill. The place itself was very cute and nicely decorated. It's cozy, but not too small. One note: The bed is a double, so it's quite a squeeze for two people. The parking space came in very handy. My parents would definitely stay at Selma's again!
20298	3416217	9.0	10.0	32199224	We had a wonderful stay! Selma got everything we need in the house. The only problem we had is the toilet which sometimes the water just keep running. Other than that is very nice and cozy place to stay!
20299	3416217	9.0	10.0	33377885	We had a really great stay in Selma's cozy nicely-decorated apartment.  Would not hesitate to stay here again.  Quick walk to the bus stop, a neighbhorhood coffee place and just a short stroll to nearby restaurants, bars and grocery stores.
20300	3416217	9.0	10.0	35303855	"The flat was amazing and Selma gave us a way to get in early. We were cozy and took advantage of the kitchen, even though there were unlimited opportunities for fine and casual dining nearby (must say we visited Nue restaurant twice). The flat was quiet, private and well located, near our daughter's university. We had great wi-fi access and  a private entrance and parking. 
Selma's home was cozy and comfortable with a great ""vibe."" "
20301	3416217	9.0	10.0	35644604	"The Sweet Retreat is aptly named. I found the apartment to be perfectly suited to my needs -- with a comfortable bed and adequately stocked kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet but close to shops, food stores and public transportation. 

Selma was responsive to my emails and answered my questions promptly. We only communicated through emails, but that was fine."
20302	3416217	9.0	10.0	39006130	Despite arriving later in the evening, we had no trouble finding this cute place thanks to excellent directions. We immediately felt at home with welcoming flowers and chocolate!, walked to the nearby natural foods co-op for some supplies, and enjoyed tea and coffee at the nearby local coffee place in the mornings. It was the perfect base for us to explore the area and we could walk to so many places we wanted to visit. The parking space and internet were icing on the cake. Everything we needed was here, and Selma was the best hostess, immediately replying to messages every time. We will stay again next time we visit Seattle!
20303	3416217	9.0	10.0	39930484	Our stay in Selma's apartment was wonderful. Great location for getting around Seattle, walking distance to Capitol Hill and lots of restaurants and bars. 
20304	3416217	9.0	10.0	40749777	Selma's 'sweet retreat' provided a quiet place for planning our busy days in Seattle. The parking place was an added bonus for our rental car. Selma was quick to reply to any questions, which was greatly appreciated. We will definitely look her up when we are back in Seattle. 
20305	3416217	9.0	10.0	41754687	"Great apartment in a quiet, but convenient, location. We walked to the Bainbridge Ferry terminal one morning, right through the city centre, and it only took 30 minutes. 

Although we didn't meet Selma, she was always available online or on the phone, and was extremely helpful. 

The bed was amazingly comfy and I'd definitely use this place again. Thanks!"
20306	3416217	9.0	10.0	42827308	Selma's place was cozy and in a great location near Capitol Hill. We enjoyed our stay.
20307	3416217	9.0	10.0	43767301	Selma welcomed us with a bouquet and chocolates from Seattle. I loved the location, which was close to a ton of great restaurants and bars. We had a car and used the parking space, but we didn't need to use it much because most everything we wanted to do was in walking distance. Selma seems cool and was very responsive, though we didn't meet her in person. She left us coffee, but I recommend going to the coffee shop around the corner.
20308	3416217	9.0	10.0	46301659	We had a great time at Selma's. We never met Selma, however her communication was excellent. Arriving and getting inside was simple. The place was immaculately clean, and very nicely laid out and decorated. The location was great too, two minutes from an excellent coffee shop, and a 5-10 minute walk to many many, bars cafes etc. A bus that goes downtown was right on the corner. Definitely recommend.
21451	877203	9.0	8.0	3932125	Both Laura and her home r awesome. My mom and I stayed there for 8 days.  Everything is amazing. Super clean, quite convenient for going out to the attractions, or just (email hidden), washing clothes, do your work.  My mother and I nearly cooked everyday, and Laura is quite nice and helpful, since  my mother cannot speak English. One day Laura even baked a delicious quiche  inviting us to try. After all, It's just a great time there.
21452	877203	9.0	8.0	6452546	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
21453	877203	9.0	8.0	6485631	"Laura is one of the most friendliest and open minded gung-ho grandmother I've met! She makes you feel so welcomed and comfortable just like living at home. Her place is clean, cozy and centrally located near downtown Seattle about 20 mins bus ride away. I will definitely stay here when I visit Seattle again! Thanks so much, Laura for a wonderful stay and experience in Seattle :-)
"
21454	877203	9.0	8.0	9535869	"I stayed in Laura's house for a little more than 3 wonderful months.
Let me start with the house. It has everything you need and Laura allows you to use them. There is no TV, but for me it was no problem, because I worked most of the day. I felt absolutely at home there, if I didn't want to be disturbed, Laura respected that and I had my own space and time when I wanted.
Now about Laura, she is a wonderful person, you can talk about a lot of different topics and the talk would keep going and going and had to stop so we could get some sleep for the next day. If you need anything, she will try to help whatever you need. She helped me so much, because this was a big change for me and she made this it went really smooth.
I would recommend this house for all my friends coming to Seattle!"
21455	877203	9.0	8.0	10842772	She's absolutely amazing, and so is her home and neighborhood. You will feel so at home here.
21456	877203	9.0	8.0	11379896	I loved staying at Laura's house. It was very cozy and comfortable and the room was lovely. Laura is an adorable host as well! I had a great stay and will be staying with her in the future!
21457	877203	9.0	8.0	11502028	Laura was nice and she was very busy and tried to do as much as she could. i did not realize it was a african-american neighborhood,  though close to international district. It was not up to my cleanness and comfort standard, but considering the room rate,  her place  was good for the traveller with a budget
21458	877203	9.0	8.0	11821708	I had a great time in Seattle thanks in part to Laura's easy and flexible check in. I only saw her on the second day but she was super friendly. The room was very cozy with a comfy bed, it is a bit far from DT but if you don't mind walking then its not that big of an issue. Plus its a great way to experience each little corner. If you're flying in take the light rail (2.50?), also rent a bike from Timbuk2 (free! with a deposit), get out n check all the usual Space Needle, Pike's Market, etc. I would def stay here again, however, consider its a good 30 min walk to DT. Thanks Laura
21459	877203	9.0	8.0	12464745	"My stay in Seattle was to see an old friend. The location to him was perfect, just around the corner.
The house was clean and tidy and the room had all I needed, especially a very comfortable bed.
There was a little trouble with the plumbing in the shower but Laura was on to it as soon as it happened and there was another shower to use, so I wasn't put out at all.
I loved Seattle and wouldn't hesitate to stay their again if my friend was in the same neighborhood, Thanks Lynn, Australia "
21460	877203	9.0	8.0	17118615	Amazing place to stay! It's really clean and lovely! Safe and convenient neighborhood  
21461	877203	9.0	8.0	17639383	Laura was very friendly and responsive. The room had a big table and splendid WiFi. I was able to get the work done, and enjoyed my stay.
21462	877203	9.0	8.0	17946838	This was our third stay with Laura.  Again, she provides just what we need--a comfortable bed, a nice shower, a bright, pleasant home, a big smile.  She is a delightful woman.
21463	877203	9.0	8.0	18201942	Laura was really easy to communicate with even on some last minute changes from me.  The room was as described nice, quiet and clean.
21464	877203	9.0	8.0	18366562	Nice place, clean, good neighbourhood close to downtown. Would stay again.
21465	877203	9.0	8.0	20494408	"Laura is great, I stayed four weeks in her house, she leaves you your space, but if you want a chat or if you need anything she'll be ready to help. She's a lot of fun and cares about others. Great Host !!!
Everything listed is accurate, and the house is really clean and comfortable."
21466	877203	9.0	8.0	21855303	I had a great stay. Laura is friendly and accommodating. The place is very comfortable, close to where I needed to be, and with ample parking. I would not hesitate to stay here again. Thank you.

Thank you very much for a great stay at your place!

21468	877203	9.0	8.0	28127413	This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a success from start to finish. How nice to feel welcome in someones home. Laura Gonzalez was a wonderful Host. She made me feel so comfortable and  answered all questions I had. Her home was perfectly located for my visit. My room was lovely and light and I will hopefully be able to stay there on my next visit to Seattle.
21469	877203	9.0	8.0	28729792	Laura is a friendly and gracious hostess. Staying In Jimi Hendrix's Neighborhood quickly felt like home! The neighborhood has easy access to public transportation with a grocery, drugstore, and library nearby. It's a great place to start in Seattle!
21470	877203	9.0	8.0	32857429	"Laura's place was great and exactly as advertised. The room was spacious and had a lot of natural light. A good place to lounge on a weekend. The house was well connected to the bus routes and a walk away from Seattle Uni (which came in good use for my football games). There were a bunch of nice places to eat and Laura was helpful and guided us in this regard. 

Laura is well traveled and it shows across when you speak to her. She had so many books and movies in her room! And I added a bit to the list of movies she had on her watchlist. She gave us our space but was always there when needed. On weekends she is lounging on her hammock :P Loved her place and would have continued to stay if only it wasnt booked for the next 2 months! "
21471	877203	9.0	8.0	35459986	I could not recommend a stay with Laura more. Laura is not only a wonderful host, highly concerned with your comfort and happiness, she is a remarkably kind person. Here home provided both wonderful accommodations and a sense of real relaxation at the end of the day. 
21472	877203	9.0	8.0	38473259	The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
21473	877203	9.0	8.0	40198020	Ho soggiornato da Laura per più di un mese ed è stata davvero una bella esperienza. La casa è carina e ben fornita; una cucina ben attrezzata, un giardino sul retro e la camera è carina, con un letto comodo ed un ampia scrivania per lavorare.  l'accoglienza di Laura è al top. Lei è una persona molto socievole e generosa, ci tiene che non manchi nulla al tuo soggiorno. Il quartiere è tranquillo a pochi passi da supermarket, lavanderia, farmacia e altri servizi. Venti minuti a piedi per raggiungere downtown oppure il pratico bus a due passi. 
21474	877203	9.0	8.0	40664415	"Laura was very accommodating to our arrival schedule as since we were on a road-trip we were unsure of our arrival time.  Also, being that we visited during the extreme heat wave and there was no AC, she kindly gave us a fan for the room.  If you are just looking for a good place to sleep and don't spend on being in the house much this is a nice option.

The house was located in a good area for access downtown (quick drive or about a $10 uber ride).  It was a little farther out from Queen Anne and Ballard.

While the listing does say private bathroom, I would point out that Laura also has another listing for a second room in this same home.  If a guest is also staying in the second room then you end up sharing the bathroom.  This was not clear to us and we ended up sharing the bathroom with a mother and her young son.  So if you are looking for something more private this is not the spot."
21475	877203	9.0	8.0	48506291	"Laura has a very cute, clean house with nice rooms available. I slept in a room (not pictured) with two beds. The bathroom is shared with the other tenant, which worked out fine. I was up too early to enjoy the advertised homemade breakfast.
If you aren't familiar with Seattle, please be warned that the Central District is not the cute little cafe neighborhood I expected. It's dangerous to walk at night, and while the bus system is very close, you will be sharing your bus ride with some interesting characters, so that wasn't always a great option either. I didn't have my car, so this was an issue and the added expense of using Uber to get around between the hours of 6pm-6am is something to consider. "
21476	877203	9.0	8.0	50782484	Laura was a very nice host and has a great place to stay!
21477	877203	9.0	8.0	56657762	"I stayed there for 2 months. It was a convenient place near from Red Apple, Walgreen, and a brewery (especially for me).
Laura was a good host. I enjoyed food, beer, and some activities with her and other guests."
22460	5415077	9.0	10.0	28053296	"Greg was an awesome host. I had just moved to Seattle, and he made me feel very welcome. The place is in a great location (Pike Place Market is awesome), and the building has a ton of nice amenities. The (very detailed) instructions were super helpful in getting settled into the place, and there was no confusion during check-in. 

The place itself is great, with a nicely sized room, your own bathroom, a fully equipped kitchen (with fresh k-cups for local sources!), and a HUGE patio, which Greg was nice enough to invite me out on for a drink. Awesome view. The sample sized toiletries were a nice touch as well :-)

Overall, very satisfied with everything. Would definitely recommend.  "
22461	5415077	9.0	10.0	28187993	"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Greg's place.  The location is perfect- a block from Pike Place Market and public transportation.  The views of the Sound and sunset from the private deck are spectacular.  The condo was clean and had everything we needed.

Greg was a great host and a nice guy.  He was easy to communicate with and welcomed us into his home.  He offered us anything he had to share and was very helpful. "
22462	5415077	9.0	10.0	28429243	"Greg's apartment is everything we needed for our exploration in Seattle. Very clean and quiet with an incredible location just around the corner from Pike's Place Public Market.

We got the key downstairs from the concierge without a hitch and had no problems with getting in. The apartment itself has a nice common space and access to an amazing public balcony that has a view of the market and the water. Really beautiful!

The only potential downside is that the bed itself doesn't have a frame and so is low to the ground, which may be a problem for some guests, but wasn't too much of an issue for me and my husband!

All in all, a great location, reasonable amount of space (not a huge room but definitely sufficient!), great experience in the center of Seattle with easy access to the whole city!"
22463	5415077	9.0	10.0	28536573	"Greg is a very friendly a nice guy and his aparment is just great!

I really don't think you could find another place located like Greg's, you are practically just a few steps away from everything."
22464	5415077	9.0	10.0	28624833	Greg is a great host.  He had wine waiting and made me feel at home.  Perfect location, right in the thick of Seattle.  Awesome jog in the morning along the waterfront.

The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, the building's amenities were a great perk, and the location was perfect! It was great to be within walking distance of so many Seattle landmarks, especially Pike Place. Definitely consider renting out Greg's place!
22466	5415077	9.0	10.0	29316201	"Greg has an amazing condo in the heart of downtown and is a great host.  His instructions were spot on and helped make our first Airbnb experience relaxing and memorable.  You cannot beat the view of the market and (on a clear day) Mt. Olympia.  Walking distance to Pioneer Square, Capitol Hill, the waterfront and the Space Needle and made for a stress free vacation.  The condo also has a pool/hot tub, large workout room and rooftop patio with gas grills.  Everything you could want from a hotel without the high cost.  I'd recommend this location and host to anyone.

22467	5415077	9.0	10.0	29565592	It was a nice experience to stay in Greg's place. If you are not driving, there couldn't be a better location, it is close to all the famous places in Seattle, and only 30 mins to the airport by Link Light Rail. It is a modern apartment, just like the pictures, well equipped and very clean. Will recommend it if you want to stay in the downtown of Seattle. 
22468	5415077	9.0	10.0	29801345	"Greg's place is great. The location is extremely convenient especially if your taking in the train from the Airport, he is just a 5min walk from the University station. His apartment is just two blocks from the famous Pike Place Market and walking distance to many attractions, great restaurants, and shops. 

Greg was very hospitable, and even though the living space was shared, we never felt uncomfortable at any time. He was very respectful and easygoing. 

One thing that was very polite of him was to allow a earlier check in time due to us arriving on an early morning flight and also late check out to accommodate our red eye flight. "
22469	5415077	9.0	10.0	30311071	Greg was extremely helpful by giving additional advice on getting there and very welcoming. The place was as listed and the neighborhood was vibrant, exceeding expectations.
22470	5415077	9.0	10.0	30779283	Location is key and this place was literally steps away from Pike's Market Place! And it is above a Target so it was really convenient. Parking was a little hard to find but it is in the city so parking is hard to find anywhere. Greg was really nice and energetic. He was communicative and I had no problems during my stay! My Seattle trip was amazing.

He sent quick, thorough communications and continued to provide helpful tips and tricks for having a good trip to Seattle during my stay. Greg warmly welcomed me when I arrived even though I got in late on a Saturday -- really, really kind of him to do. I was so delighted to have such a quick, straight walk to the Convention Center for my conference (just a few blocks!), and ALSO be steps away from Pike Place Market. My fellow conference attendees were so incredibly jealous. I cannot recommend staying with Greg enough. 
22485	5415077	9.0	10.0	39612644	Stayed for a couple nights and we enjoyed our stay. Greg made sure of our comfort during out stay. He also accommodated our request regarding check in. And the best part of our trip was being steps away from all the action. Location doesn't get any better than this one. Will definitely stay again!
22486	5415077	9.0	10.0	40924489	"Couldn't ask for a better location! Minutes walk from everything! Would definitely stay with Greg if we ever go back to Seattle. He made us feel welcomed but also gave us our space. Due to us having a earlier flight in and a later flight out he was able to accommodate us with early check in and late check out b/c he did not have a guest the prior night, nor the day we checked out. He was kind enough to let us know ahead of time that the carpet had a stain on it from a prior guest. The stain had no effect on our stay there but thought it was a nice gesture that he let us know in advance. Most of our time at the apartment if almost felt as if we had the place to ourselves because Greg would be out most of the time. 

We were able to use the pool, hot tub, sauna and gym during our stay. Gym was a plus for me because all we did on our mini vacation was eat so it was nice to be able to walk a few feet to get a quick work out while my lady was getting ready.

Would highly recommend!"
22487	5415077	9.0	10.0	42523856	Great place! close to everything! Greg is very nice, even made us coffee in the morning. We had a great time there!
22488	5415077	9.0	10.0	43244493	Greg wasn't home on the weekend we arrived but trusted us with his beautiful condo. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable..and the travel sized amenities were a bonus. The location was prime! The market and waterfront are in walking distance, and any other touristy attraction was no more than a 7 dollar Uber ride away. He gave us great recommendations and when we met him on our last day, he was easy going, welcoming, and very down to earth. When we are back in Seattle, we would definitely try to stay at his place again!
22489	5415077	9.0	10.0	43933057	Wow, this apartment is INCREDIBLE! Very clean, great view, private bedroom and bathroom with toiletries stocked, and that location literally cannot be beat. After two days of walking miles and miles around the city, the hot tub in his complex was a perfect way to end our stay in Seattle. I am so glad we chose this place. We only met Greg briefly but he was awesome and incredibly welcoming. We couldn't have asked for a better stay!
22490	5415077	9.0	10.0	44916750	Awesome location and Greg is a great host. Recommended!
22491	5415077	9.0	10.0	46129258	Great location and nice host. Was able to allow us to check in early so we could go see the town. Would recommend staying here.
22492	5415077	9.0	10.0	46590355	"As others have pointed out, Greg is a very warm host and opened his condo to me and my girlfriend for a couple of days/nights.  I’ve stayed at numerous airbnb’s and his pre-arrival instructions and communication are top-notch.  

The best part is definitely the location, which as others have mentioned, is literally a stone’s throw away from Pike Place.  It’s super easy to get to from the airport via the light rail (only $3!) as well as returning from our adventures on foot into the city.  Building facilities, which include a decent sized gym, a grilling area with a view, and a hot tub/pool/sauna, were all a nice plus.  There’s also a Target at the bottom of his building in case you forget any odds and ends.  Note: the pictures don’t really do the view from Greg’s patio deck justice.  The fresh air was amazing and I wish we would’ve had the time to cook a nice dinner, open a bottle of wine, and enjoy the sunset.  

One other thing worth mentioning: the place itself is pretty austere in terms of furniture and décor.  Everything is super functional and it kind of felt and smelled like my apartment with four dudes in college (which was oddly appropriate since I was there for my old college roommate's wedding).  It wasn’t so bad since we spent most of our time out in the city, but for those needing trendy/chic, I might look elsewhere.  

In any event, we had a great time and were blessed with fantastic weather.  The place is definitely a great jumping off point to tackle all of the coffee, oysters, and food that Seattle has to offer.  Thanks again for your hospitality, Greg!
"
22493	5415077	9.0	10.0	47781557	Greg was there to greet and make me feel at home with a brief tour.   I didn't see much of him after that because I was in tourist mode.   Greg's place is simple, straightforward and perfectly situated for a quick weekend on the town; exactly the way I like it.   I didn't use any amenities as I was there to see the city, not use a fitness room.    
22494	5415077	9.0	10.0	48565798	"Greg is a great host.  I highly recommend him and his place and would stay there again for sure. 

From the time I reached out about the booking, we had excellent communication, and he also shared wonderful tips and insights about what to see and do. 

The apartment is easy to get to from the airport using public transportation. It's in walking distance to the convention center,  ferries and art museum and lots of great dining venues. It's bright and spacious and has a relaxed vibe such that you are right in the middle of things, and his place is a calm oasis. 

Thank you Greg for a wonderful stay! 


"
22495	5415077	9.0	10.0	49639253	Greg's place was really convenient for my short time in Seattle, close to the Pike Place Market and the water. The room was as described and even had a great conversation with Greg about coffee. Would definitely recommend his space if you're in the Seattle area!
22496	5415077	9.0	10.0	50052308	"Greg was above-and-beyond welcoming, and made sure my stay was comfortable and flexible. The room itself is clean and cozy, and has a big window for morning sunlight. The apartment is spacious, and though I didn't take advantage of it, has lots of space for relaxing and watching tv. And finally, there's a solid fitness center and pool available on the same floor...awesome!

I couldn't have asked for a better host or a better location! I'll absolutely stay here again when I'm back in town."
22497	5415077	9.0	10.0	50857795	"I had a very nice stay at Gregs ideally located place - Greg is friendly and the room + bathroom are providing real privacy.
I will get back to Greg for my next Seattle visit"
22498	5415077	9.0	10.0	52595663	Greg was a great host, he was very communicative leading up to the stay and once we were there, checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. This location can't be beat, Pikes place is literally around the corner, and it is only two streets up from the train station. Plus, the Target downstairs was super convenient for anything we didn't pack. 
22499	5415077	9.0	10.0	54504797	"Greg is a super great host, he and his beautiful girlfriend are enthusiastic, do help us a lot. 
Their lovely apartment is fantastic, easy the reach from the airport, really close to Pike's market, very easy to catch buses, a big supermarket locates in downstair,big Macy's in 5 mins walk. The view from the deck is fabulous. There is a super comfortable coach in the living room. The kitchen is really great for everyone who loves cooking. They also provide wash machine so that we do not need to walk a long way to do the laundry.
The bed in our room is comfortable, a big window makes the room bright. The big bathroom is a highlight of the apartment as well.
All in all, Grey's apartment should be everyone's first choice in Seattle."
22500	5415077	9.0	10.0	55903321	Greg was great with communication and we were able to have everything we needed. You can't beat the location.
22501	5415077	9.0	10.0	56527042	I would recommend this apartment to anybody! It was nice and in a great location. The hosts were supper friendly and organized! 
22502	5415077	9.0	10.0	57122050	Greg's place was amazing! It was in a perfect location and was overall very nice. The condo had everything we needed, was clean, and was also very quiet. Greg was extremely nice and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here! 
22868	7067650	9.0	10.0	43864264	"Jarred was incredibly helpful with all aspects of staying at his place, even leaving us an awesome goodie back of coffee, red-vines and a few brews in the fridge!

His place is super comfortable (the most comfortable bed we slept in our entire trip), water pressure is great, and its very conveniently located.  Just down the street was a great breakfast spot called Louisa's.  Across the street is an AWESOME sandwich and beer spot called Mammoth (growlers, bottles and drafts).  You're a convenient and short (10 dollar Lyft) from Fremont or Capitol Hill.  It's an absolutely great place to stay.  

Our only issue was finding the door.  It's a 1/2 address so the entry was really from the alley.  Once we figured that out everything else was smooth sailing.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
22869	7067650	9.0	10.0	45154800	"This place was extremely tidy and comfortable when we showed up. Jarred was super gracious by offering really good suggestions for places to go and providing some snacks/coffee in a care package.

I highly recommend staying here if you want to be in a beautiful part of Seattle that isn't right in the middle of downtown."
22870	7067650	9.0	10.0	45541342	"Everything about this experience was outstanding! Jarred & Tess are so lovely, so easy to communicate with and they made the process super easy and fun. They left detailed information, a charming welcome package, and were so helpful with recommendations for restaurants, bars, music venues, transport options, anything I needed.

The bungalow is so comfortable and cozy, exceptionally welcoming. There are thoughtful touches everywhere and the décor is eclectic and unique, you really get the feeling that you're in a good friend's place that happens to have excellent taste. Although it is described as a bungalow it feels spacious and there is great natural light. Comfortable bed, well stocked kitchen, super clean, I had absolutely zero complaints.

The location is also very cool. It is in a quiet neighborhood but is a minute's walk to a bus stop that will have you Downtown or in the University District in ten minutes. The buses are frequent and so convenient. A taxi or Uber to or from Downtown, the U District, Belltown or Capitol Hill is also super easy and affordable.

I will absolutely stay here again! Jarred & Tess are a delight, as is their beautiful space. Thanks so much for everything, you two! :)"
22871	7067650	9.0	10.0	46017631	"Tess and Jarred have encapsulated the essence of good AirBnB hosts: creating a homey but hotel-like experience for guests. My boyfriend and I spent 4 days and nights in Seattle, and could not be happier with our stay at the charming bungalow. We felt welcome from the get go with a friendly note waiting for us, along with beers, wine and fancy coffee beans (Stumptown, my favorite!).

The house was clean, cute, tastefully decorated with zero clutter and beautiful plants, and matched the description and the pictures (yes, the guitar was there too!). The entrance is through the alley, but it doesn't feel like some back alley house behind an apartment complex - in fact, the whole street is double lined with cottages, apartments and houses on both the alley and street side. If you are concerned about the proximity to the freeway like I was - fear not. Inside the house you cannot hear any freeway noise, and although sitting out on the patio you certainly hear it, it's not distracting and goes with the city vibe.

The bed is comfortable with a cushy down duvet and pillows, and the kitchen has all basic necessities to cook meals (the frying pan had seen better days but it did the job for simple morning scrambles). There is a library of modern classics that you always thought you should read but never got around to (I started on some Vonnegut, but didn't get through it in 4 days), along with tons of quality TV shows and movies on DVD. In the bathroom, the beautiful, rustic claw foot tub was an awesome surprise!

The location is great - close to everything, yet you feel like a true Seattleite walking down the street to your neighborhood cafe or corner market. Lake Union is a few blocks down the hill with house boat marinas lining the shore, but there is a nice enough path for walking/running. We didn't try out public transportation since we had a car rental, but parking was convenient right by the house.

Both Tess and Jarred were incredibly quick responding to my messages and texts, even at midnight on the day we arrived, but since we didn't encounter any problems during our stay (running out of toilet paper isn't really a problem..), we only chatted before and after our stay.

I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to friends looking for a private, comfortable place filled with character, hosted by a wonderful and considerate couple.
"
22872	7067650	9.0	10.0	46656848	Staying at Jarred and Tess's was really great. The house was clean, comfortable, private, and spacious with a lot of natural light. Our hosts were easy to reach throughout our stay, and even provided us with a lot of great suggestions for places to eat and sightsee, with a goodie bag and some beers left in the fridge as an additional plus! Especially helpful, they were flexible to our special requests, and seemed happy to help us out in any way they could. Would definitely stay here again. 
22873	7067650	9.0	10.0	50306995	Jarred and Tess's place is awesome. Not to mention they are both amazing and so helpful. My husband and I were moving to the Emerald City and needed a place to stay while we were house hunting. When we realized it was going to take longer than our initial booking, we immediately reached out to them to discuss our situation. When they got an offer for the time after our booking ended, they texted us and asked if we wanted to extend our stay, so that we weren't without a home. Their place is very cute and even our pets loved having the outdoor space to relax. All in all, we highly recommend Jarred and Tess's bungalow for any length of stay.
22874	7067650	9.0	10.0	52127165	Charming place in a great location + off street parking. Unfortunately, there was a strong pet odor, which we did get used to, but I would not recommend this place for anyone who is sensitive to smells. Hosts were very responsive and recommended some great places to eat in the neighborhood.
22875	7067650	9.0	10.0	52525571	Great location, complete kitchen facilities, and fun art work and instruments.
22876	7067650	9.0	10.0	52870454	We had a great weekend at Jerrod and Tess' place! The apartment is cozy and perfect for the two of us and our dog, Frank. We especially loved walking down the hill to 14 Carrot for breakfast and Mammoth for some excellent sandwiches and a great beer selection.
23582	2693137	9.0	9.0	14376387	Mark was a very nice host. He gave great recommendations about places to eat and was very accommodating!
23583	2693137	9.0	9.0	14587602	Mark was incredibly hospititable. He made us very comfortable in our space and gave us great advise about the city. We experienced a some great moments based off his advise. 
23584	2693137	9.0	9.0	14894744	Unfortunately Mark wasn't there. But his friend Mario welcomed us and was awesome, the place is really great, close to the center, comfortable. A very good spot in Seattle.
23585	2693137	9.0	9.0	15071035	"The apartment was exactly as advertised, great location, clean, and awesome hosts! Mark was very quick responding to our initial emails and the check in/out was very easy. We will for sure stay at the Eastlake apartment next time we are in the Seattle area! 

Ps. The cat Queen Elizabeth is such a ""cool cat"" and a well behaved cuddle monster, almost wanted to steal her and bring her home with us!  "
23586	2693137	9.0	9.0	15354452	"We stayed at Mark's place for three nights. My previous Airbnb experiences were all superb. Unfortunately, this time it was a less than nice experience. I will start with the positive. 
Despite the host not being there, an acting host named Mario welcomed us. He was very nice and helpful. Although not very familiar with the city he tried to provide with useful tips. The apartment has a nice view and is in a good location if you want to be near downtown, not so much if you want to take a walk or grab a bite in the surroundings though, because it is right across the street to a major highway. Parking was a bit of an issue because other people took the spot that was assigned to us. Mario told us that should've not happened because that was the host's spot as well. He suggested us to park around the corner in the back parking lot of the apartment complex, and it worked. However, we noticed we took someone else's spot so Mario suggested to put a piece of paper to let them know, and I had to leave my name and phone number in a visible place inside the car so they could call me in case they wanted to park their car. Fortunately, no one called. The bed was comfortable and two clean towels were provided.
There were two main issues we had. Number one was cleanliness, or the lack of thereof. The entire apartment needs a cleaning,  especially the carpet floor. Even more so the bedroom. Moreover, the bedside tables in the bedroom were covered in dust and there were backpacks and shopping bags all over the carpet floor.
The second issue was the pets, and let me explain why. When we saw the listing we knew there were a cat named Elizabeth in the place, which sounded great to us because we're huge animal loving people. The problem is that she and her recently born kittens, they all live under the bed. So all three nights we had to deal with the miaows from under the bed, which can be a real inconvenience for someone trying to sleep. Moreover, Elizabeth is used to come in and out of the bedroom at her will, so we had two choices: sleeping with the bedroom door open or having her, in the middle of the night, sitting in the bed, or on our chests, moving and making sounds for us to open the door. It may sounds fun, but it wasn't, specially when one is looking to sleep and relax. 
All in all the place has potential, but it needs serious cleaning. I'm not sure what to suggest about the cat. As it is right now, I could not, in a good heart, recommend this place for someone to stay at. "
23587	2693137	9.0	9.0	16312441	My boyfriend and I stayed with Mark while we were in Seattle and had a lovely time! Mark was very nice, made us feel at home in the apartment and shared lots of great information about the city. We loved our stay and I would recommend it to anyone :) 
23588	2693137	9.0	9.0	18221853	Mark was a fine host.  My plans changed somewhat and I ended up showing up later than anticipated; and Mark waited until I arrived so I could find the place and he could show me amenities.  He provided some simple stuff for breakfast, which was nice.  His place is clean and in a good, safe location; close the interstate so it has good access to other parts of the city.  Only stayed 1 night, but I would have no problem staying there again if in Seattle.  
23589	2693137	9.0	9.0	18360322	Mark was friendly and the place was nice. He gave me some space but was available if I needed anything. The neighbourhood is great and really easy to get downtown from.

23591	2693137	9.0	9.0	18667721	Really cool guy. Actually picked me up from the airport the first day! Gives you space but is also very hospitable and welcoming. As nerdy as it sounds, I feel like I actually got a friend out of it lol. If I can I'll definitely stay with him again next time I'm in Seattle.
23592	2693137	9.0	9.0	18878979	"Mark was the best hosts one could ask for.  Polite, courteous, fun and giving.  Had supplied me with keys, a place to park and a bagel, all before I met him.  Even though I was barely there for 3 days, we had some great conversations and Mark made me feel like a friend staying with him rather than a airbnb guest.  

The place was tidy and very clean.  Great view of Seattle, Lake Union and the Space Needle.  The couch was comfortable.  He provided sheets, pillows, blankets and a towel.

The cat, Queen Elizabeth, was cute and soft, very well mannered.  She even slept next to me the first night.

Do not hesitate to contact Mark about your next Seattle stay as I will not.

With the home theatre, the comfy sofa, the great view out the window and the pets, home is exactly what the place feels like.
Mark is a friendly guy and I enjoyed chatting with him.

Elizabeth needs a separate mention. 
If you like cat's, you will LOVE elizabeth ! She is one playful cat who will come running to you the instant you sit down on the sofa !

P.S, Seattle isn't on a plain and there are many slopes around the city. Mark's beautiful  place is on the top of a slope (hence the views). So if you have heavy baggage with you and are taking the bus, avoid taking any of the (phone number hidden) irrespective of what the maps suggest.
The #25 is your best bet and stops very near the house."

I am glad I booked the Bnb with mark. Mark and River were the most friendly person I've ever met. I was new to Seattle, but mark provided many great suggestions for places to eat and things to do. Will definitely recommend staying with mark if you are looking for a place to crash in Seattle.

They both made me feel very welcomed and helped me quickly adjust to a new city (teaching me about the different areas, bus routes, music festivals etc etc). Their home is in a great area with a fantastic view and some very sweet animals. I truly only have positive things to say about these two and my time staying with them - Thanks, guys!

When we showed up the place was a bit disheveled, but that could have been due to having unexpected overnight guests. We also ended up having to cancel one night, and he was flexible and understanding. He gave us a lot of recommendations on places to visit in the area, as neither of us had been to Seattle before. Also, the view is pretty amazing!
I would add that we knew beforehand that a cat lived in the apartment but when we showed up there were also three kittens. So if you're not a cat person, this probably isn't the place for you. His dog Luke was a sweetheart though. "
23618	2693137	9.0	9.0	31156013	Mark was very accommodating and friendly. Great view, nice vibe. 
23619	2693137	9.0	9.0	31481432	Mark was a very nice host. His home is a very comfortable place in a beautiful neighborhood. Easy to go to downtown by bus. My girlfriend and I enjoyed very much our stay. Thanks a lot Mark!
23620	2693137	9.0	9.0	32086116	I loved my stay at Mark's Apt, Mark keeps an incredibly clean and welcome place for visitors.  The apartment is in a great part of city close to bars, restaurants and the lake view is awesome.  I intend to come back to Seattle, I would definitely work with Mark again.

처음부터 끝까지 마크와 리버는 우리를 친절하게 대해줬고 전혀 우리생활에 지장을주거나 불편함을 주지않았다. 시차가 거의 반대인 나라라 우리가 새벽에 잠을 못이뤄서 불편하기도했을텐데 그들은 우리에게 전혀 불만도 없었다. 

불편한 사항들을 이야기하면 바로 도움을주었고 이 곳에 있는 듬듬한 강아지 루크와 매력적인 고양이 엘리자베스는 항상 사랑스러웠다. 

비가올때나 날씨가 좋을때나 전망이 좋은것이 가장큰 장점이다. 집주변에 카페나 식당이있고 간단하게는 샌드위치가게도있다. 그리고 집앞에있는 마켓이 한국인이 운영하던 곳이라 더욱 좋았다. 

다음번 시애틀이 갈일이 있다면 다시한번 이 곳에 머물고싶다. "
23622	2693137	9.0	9.0	32927993	Mark and River were great hosts!  I will stay again in June and am looking forward to it.  The apartment is modest but clean, very convenient, with a great view, and a great value over a hotel.  Very close to downtown and UW campus, in the very cool East Lake area. My room and bed were comfortable, the shower was hot, and the fruit they shared was delicious.  I got to experience a great new neighborhood and meet some new friends, something that would not have happened in a hotel!
23623	2693137	9.0	9.0	33286476	My bf and I had a wonderful stay at Mark's place. The apartment is clean and the location is great. You can see the lake and Space Needle from the window. Mark gave us some great travel suggestions, and River made us delicious hot tea. The kitty was friendly and so adorable. 
23624	2693137	9.0	9.0	33537128	Mark and River very great host in seattle! mark's house is so comfortable, clean, so beautiful! and their cat Elizabeth, dog luc are great mate in seattle. Mark and River gives me great memory of seattle. talking with me long times, give me information of seattle tour, and they recommend seattle's beautiful tour spot! if i going to seattle again, i will going mark's house again. thanks Mark, River! 
23625	2693137	9.0	9.0	34708404	The view over Lake Union was even more amazing than described, and Mark was an excellent host! Communication was easy and fast, and Mark was very easy-going and helpful when needed. River and the pets were nice too. I had a lot of freedom coming and going when I liked. Location was good, and it was easy to get to Capitol Hill / downtown / University district by buses. I can sincerely recommend this place! 
23626	2693137	9.0	9.0	34875246	Another great stay with Mark and River.  They are very warm, welcoming, and make you very comfortable.  The fresh cherries were delicious and the Jelly Belly's a nice treat.  Their location is so convenient and there are great coffee places, restaurants, and convenience stores a short walk away.
23627	2693137	9.0	9.0	35090387	Mark and River are lovely. The place is clean and comfortable, and the view from the living room is gorgeous. I wasn't there often, but I encountered no problems in the time I was there. I'd certainly recommend staying here if you're visiting Seattle.
23628	2693137	9.0	9.0	35662992	Mark and River were very kind and welcoming. The room was clean as well as the bathroom. The apartement is close to public transportation and interstate 5. At night, we would suggest to turn the fan on in order to mask noise coming from I5.
23629	2693137	9.0	9.0	35892923	Mark and River were very acomodating when I needed somewhere to stay at short notice. They were very hospitable, and their kitten was adorable
23630	2693137	9.0	9.0	36033549	Mark and River were very hospitable to my boyfriend and I. Mark had many good suggestions to give for Seattle. We really enjoyed our stay at their place, a real plus point too if you're an animal lover. Their poodle luc and their cat are both adorable. 
23631	2693137	9.0	9.0	37170868	Mark was a cool, easy going guy with cool pets. The spot was nice and cool, and the view was great. 
23632	2693137	9.0	9.0	37436565	Mark's home was very quiet and cozy. We didn't see him much but he provided us with everything we would need for our stay. Particularly loved the cat and dog -- neighborhood was very cute and green, and had a good breakfast place nearby. 
23633	2693137	9.0	9.0	37506717	Mark was very welcoming, lots of ideas of places to see and things to do.  Loved his dog and cat too!  Mark was great about helping us find the place and feel at home.  
23634	2693137	9.0	9.0	37570299	Great location and neighborhood. A bit tricky to find as Google maps seems to not find the address but once we got there it was no problem. Free parking on site was great. Mark and his partner were helpful and checking in was super flexible and easy. He gave me some things to check out in town and great place to go for breakfast. Their kitty Elizabeth is such a cutie pie we fell in love with her. 
23635	2693137	9.0	9.0	37698780	Mark and his husband River were great hosts. Their apt was very clean, quiet, and we were welcomed home by the cutest little kitten. 
23636	2693137	9.0	9.0	38269600	Mark and River were very welcoming, and the kitten greeted us with joy each time we came through the door. Mark had many good suggestions to give for Seattle, and invited us along for a night out. We really enjoyed our stay at their place: the location is wonderful for everything we wanted to do, and easily accessed without a car. The view is amazing and can't be adequately captured in photos. 
23637	2693137	9.0	9.0	38651762	His hospitality was pretty good :) I had a great night. I would love to come back!
23638	2693137	9.0	9.0	38733499	Mark and River were so welcoming when I stayed with them. Their pets are also equally as welcoming! We didn't stay for very long, but enjoyed it nonetheless. 
23639	2693137	9.0	9.0	38951795	"Sorry to say, our experience wasn’t good and I wouldn’t recommend this place to friends. I originally asked for my daughter, her husband and their 3 month old baby. The listing said “kid friendly” and Mark was most friendly and encouraging that the baby would be welcome, so we confirmed. Fortunately, because of an afternoon event that conflicted with check-in time, we picked up the key early. Seeing that there was not enough room for a baby, two adults, and their combined luggage, my husband and I switched accommodations with my daughter. 

When we returned in the early evening, no one was home. With a fan on, the power blew in the bedroom when we tried to turn on a light. I called Mark, who said he’d fix it, and we went out. I’m sure Mark and River are very nice and helpful, but we barely saw them. They arrived just after midnight, thinking that they would get there before us to fix the power outage. We were on our way to bed. I’m capable of flipping a circuit breaker, but it’s hard to hunt for a fuse box in the dark. 

It was a very hot weekend, and things happen. But I was disappointed again in the morning when I found the kitchen sink so full of someone else’s dishes, pots, pans, etc. that I couldn’t get my water bottle under the tap to fill it. (Rule #1: clean up after yourself in the kitchen!) We left by about 8:30 with no sign of our hosts.  

The inside of the apartment, sheets and towels were clean, but cluttered, with no place to sit in the small bedroom and only an open futon to sit and enjoy the view, the featured draw of the location. This may be OK if you need a clean bed and don’t mind the freeway noise, but not if you expect a bit more.

Recommendations to Mark:
1)List the correct apartment number and get the locks fixed – took us quite a while to get the doors open. After a while, I saw that the door was a different number than listed w/airbnb, so we tried the other apartment – no luck. We then returned, knowing that the “décor” on the floor outside your apartment was distinctive and had to be correct.
2)Provide guests instructions for “free parking”, that was not obvious, ahead of time. If the “back alley” is best, it would have been good to have directions for how to get there and how to get from the alley into the apartment
3)Would be nice if you could get the carpets cleaned. That was a real turn off.
4)Clear the clutter from the rooms (including picture frames between the bed and the window wall) or be honest that the space can only sleep two with only a small amount of luggage. And warn guests about the power!

23640	2693137	9.0	9.0	39138659	Great apartment in a great location with great hosts! We got a lot of good tips and suggestions to where are all the cool places. Very clean and nice apartment with great view
23641	2693137	9.0	9.0	39315684	Mark and River were excellent hosts! Mark  gave us tons of pointers on where to go in Seattle.  Walk to the space needle was not bad at all, very flat and the weather was perfect for it. Their pets couldn't have been any sweeter. Great experience, would absolutely stay with them again!
23642	2693137	9.0	9.0	39415981	My girlfriend and I spent one night with River and Mark. We actually didn't see Mark as we came home kind of late and left early. The apartment is as nice as shown - everything was great. River was nice, the pets were nice, the space was nice.  A good first airbnb experience.  If we had to pick something we didn't like it would be the proximity of the highway, but that didn't bother us.
23643	2693137	9.0	9.0	39730253	Mark was a great host! Whenever there was a concern he was easily reachable, and he warmly welcomed us into his home. The location is quiet and close to bus lines. It is also conveniently located near the entrance to the highway, making for a stress-free drive to the house! Also, his cat is truly the best cat I have ever come into contact with :). 
23644	2693137	9.0	9.0	40137520	Mark and River were absolutely accommodating and delightful. We had poor communication in contacting them, yet they still were prepared for us. I appreciate their presence in the house, and they have a gorgeous view!
23645	2693137	9.0	9.0	40334409	"We had a good time at Mark's house. Mark was very friendly, helpful and we had a nice chat with Mark. His cat is very very cute. :)
To downtown it's about 3 miles. You can walk or you can take the bus. The public transport system in Seattle is not much as good as in other city but if you have a bit time than it is ok. In the neighborhood there are a few restaurants."
23646	2693137	9.0	9.0	40516822	I enjoyed my brief stay with Mark and River. Their place is comfortable, clean, and quiet; the location is well-served by public transit.
23647	2693137	9.0	9.0	41206439	Mark and River have been responsive and helpful in catering to my various requests.
23648	2693137	9.0	9.0	41733905	Great host and was very accommodating to when my friend had to crash with me for a night and my other friend showing up the next day. Clean place and friendly pets
23649	2693137	9.0	9.0	42413240	Mark I use Chinese to write reviews, because the Chinese to express my gratitude to you.Mark和他的丈夫是一个非常好的房东，西雅图是我们这次美国之行最喜欢的城市，没有之一。我们抵达西雅图的时间稍晚，但Mark还是来机场接了我们，并且在我们没抵达西雅图之前，想办法帮我们安排车辆去波音公司，这是非常棒的，特别热情与热心。昆明小哥（可以这样形容吗），我们有看到你的画，是要多么细心的人才能画得那么精致，虽然很想开口让你送我一幅，因为真的太漂亮了。谢谢你们俩对我们的照顾，下次西雅图再见。
23650	2693137	9.0	9.0	42669785	"We stayed for two nights at Mark's place. The house itself is perfect, with a very impressive view over the lake. The room is clean and the bed is nice.  The location is great too, you can easily walk to downtown and capitol hill  (great for food) is even closer.  Mark knows a lot about the direct area as well a the rest of the city. We followed some of his suggestions and all of these were perfect. 

Would recommend a stay here to everybody and wouldn't hesitate to book again."
23651	2693137	9.0	9.0	42898780	Mark and River were amazing and accommodating hosts, the view was even better than advertised and especially beautiful at night. Mark's restaurant recommendations were spot on, and the pets were both adorable temporary companions!
23652	2693137	9.0	9.0	43245737	Mark and River were the cutest, nicest, and most welcoming hosts! Even tho we were only there to shower and sleep we felt right at home! They have a gorgeous view of Lake Union and the apartment was very cozy. Transportation to and from was very accessible. We would highly recommend people to stay here and will hopefully be returning sometime in the future!
23653	2693137	9.0	9.0	43963874	"Mark was very accommodating for our late arrival. Apart from the rapid chat that we had to welcome us in, because of his timetable and our plans, we actually did not see him at all for the two days that we stayed.

The pictures represent well the place, which is conveniently located. We walked most of the time."
23654	2693137	9.0	9.0	44908182	Mark was very welcoming - he was home to greet me and got me settled in my room and answered my questions about all things Seattle  where to go, how to get there, etc.  Eastlake is a great neighborhood, I felt safe walking alone at night as a solo female traveler.  
23655	2693137	9.0	9.0	45308184	We had a great stay in Seattle! Mark's home was clean & cozy. He made us feel right at home & offered lots of great suggestions for eating & sight seeing. The view was amazing & the location was an easy bus or Uber ride to everything we wanted to do.
23656	2693137	9.0	9.0	45498766	"Mark and River are nice guys and gave me a warm and easy going welcome. Parking is no problem at all, the bed is cozy and the room is quiet. Don't worry if you read that interstate is very close by. You will not notice if you close the window.
The view from their apartment is simply breathtaking.
Special thanks to River with whom I spent a couple of hours tasting beer and laughing.
You'll find everything you need within 5 minutes walking: breakfast, diner, beer.
Do not hesitate to get in touch with Mark and River if you want to spend a few days in Seattle."
23657	2693137	9.0	9.0	45569806	Check-in was easy, bed was comfy, and view from the living room was amazing. Close to two bus stops (one is at the top of the hill and one is at the bottom). Has one very cute dog and a tiny kitten. Thanks Mark and River for a great stay!
23658	2693137	9.0	9.0	45662301	River was there waiting for me when I arrived. He was very nice and welcoming.  It is a good place to use for a quick overnight stay in Seattle. 
23659	2693137	9.0	9.0	46754029	The neighborhood was a great location. Super close to main attractions. Mark and River were very friendly and accommodating. They told us about an underground tour that we did that was so fun and we wouldn't have known about it otherwise. The space was clean and quiet. I would stay again. 
23660	2693137	9.0	9.0	46983963	Host Mark was welcoming, and the view and the friendliness of the pets were certainly as described.  However the listing could be clearer that what is offered is simply a second bedroom in a small condo, and that the bedroom does not seem to be reserved for visitors nor particularly set up for such use. There were, for example, no side tables or reading lights, and hosts' personal items remained in the room. Visitors share the bathroom with hosts, and in spite of best intentions, it is hard not to feel constrained to avoid the kitchen or living room as long as those are also in use by the hosts.  The bed is a double, but surprisingly noisy, so that every movement by one occupant tended (in our case) to wake the other.  In general this accommodation is best for friends of the hosts, and less ideal for strangers.
23661	2693137	9.0	9.0	47151145	"Mark was helpful in responding before arrival.
His cat was not willing to give me the room and hid under the bed.  As soon I lay down the cat jumped up on me... Had to keep the door closed. It is by a very busy freeway however the noise is regular. "
23662	2693137	9.0	9.0	48286496	"Mark's feedback of my question is so fast & kind. 
The place is so peaceful & comfortable.
As you see, the window view is so good. (I see the view so long, every morning & night)
I couldn't meet with Mark, but River is welcoming me & so kind all the time.
Because of Mark & River, my first impression of Seattle remained in my mind! Nice holyday! Thank you! May meet again^^"
23663	2693137	9.0	9.0	48722606	It's a neat little apartment in a great location. We came and went as we pleased. The cat and dog were very friendly. 
23664	2693137	9.0	9.0	48923952	Mark and River were very friendly and hospitable, they were good in communicating before and during my stay and easy to talk to. The house was in good condition and in a great neighborhood, I enjoyed my stay at their place. 
23665	2693137	9.0	9.0	49154814	The short stay with Mark and River was great. The place is clean with a great view of the river. The dog and cat are very friendly.
23666	2693137	9.0	9.0	49637699	"The place has a fantastic view on the lake and the space needle. Mark was very kindly and help us for everything (even some medical advices). To reach the pike place market amd downtown, it's easy with a bus line 200m from the appartment. 
And it's true, the cat made us her slave!"
23667	2693137	9.0	9.0	52261152	Mark and River are amazing and friendly hosts. It was great to end the days chatting with them and their pets. He had good recommendations on what to check out in the city, and the view at their place is indeed amazing!
23668	2693137	9.0	9.0	52599595	"Mark and River are awesome hosts! Super friendly and very accommodating when we first arrived. The view, as everyone described, is beautiful. I was out of the apartment for a majority of the time, however it was always nice to come back and chat with Mark or River about the day.

The bedroom itself was just enough room to unpack and relax. The bedroom, bathroom, and overall apartment was clean. Since I went to visit people in UW and did tourist attractions downtown, the buses by their apartment was extremely convenient. 

Last but not least, Luc and Queen Elizabeth were the starts of the apartment. My friend and I enjoyed playing with them everytime we got back. Super friendly pets and hosts :) Overall, if I'm in Seattle again, I'd definitely stay at Mark and River's!"
23669	2693137	9.0	9.0	54226249	Amazing hosts, great location (40 min walk to downtown)
23670	2693137	9.0	9.0	55316447	Mark and River have a lovely house with an even lovelier view of the lake! I couldn't stop admiring the view, honestly. The cat and the dog are adorable, and will definitely keep you company! This home is situated close to restaurants and such within walking distance, and was perfect for my one night stay- everything was ready and clean as it should be! They were both very welcoming hosts, and I couldn't have asked for more :) Thank you so much for your hospitality, I really appreciate it.
24000	5330475	9.0	10.0	48831356	Anna was very nice and welcoming. Even though she's in London, she tried her best to keep in contact with me to make sure my stay was the best. Her roommates were very friendly and helpful. The place was clean and the bed was amazing! I would definitely stay here again!
24001	5330475	9.0	10.0	51340787	Anna is an awesome host! The room was even better than I expected. The entire apartment and my room+private bathroom were very clean, and had lots of space for me to keep my luggage. The neighbourhood has many things within walking distance, as well as bus routes and bike rentals (Pronto) right in front of the building. Anna also has great roommates who were fun to hang out with and took the time to show me around and answer all of my question. Overall, great place to stay!
24139	2263643	9.0	9.0	14257948	Friendly host and great location! Parking was a cinch.
24140	2263643	9.0	9.0	15235411	Tessa was very friendly and thoughtful, trying to help me in anyway she could and making me feel very welcome in Seattle. She respects your privacy, but we also had good chats and fun together. The room and the shared bathroom were clean and her place is in a quiet and nice neighborhood. The bus stops are really close.
24141	2263643	9.0	9.0	16386274	"Tessa was very communicative and flexible -- I booked the room the same afternoon I wanted to check in! She generously asked what I might want for breakfast, and met me outside when I arrived. Her place is right next to a huge, tree-filled park with a lighthouse and a little beach, and it's a nice place to run (or take a walk), if a bit hilly. The bus that goes downtown also comes right in front of the building, and it's a straight shot (no transfers). If you have a car, parking is pretty easy around her place. 

The photos in the ad are accurate. Tessa is a great host -- happy to chat if you want to chat, but also happy to let you do your own thing. 

Thanks again, Tessa! "
24142	2263643	9.0	9.0	16593183	Tessa was wonderful!  I got a bit lost in the maze that is Seattle, but when I finally made it to Tessa's place I was greeted with a cup of tea and a very clean and cozy room.  Tessa was a pleasure to chat with and I even got to see her amazing patio garden.  If you're driving, parking is a cinch, and the neighborhood is lovely. Thanks Tessa!
24143	2263643	9.0	9.0	17079550	"I really enjoyed Staying with Tessa. She is the perfect host, very caring and always concerned if I needed anything during my stay. The room was very big for my standard and had all I needed. There was enough space to leave my backpack and even a table to work on my computer. Tessa""s place is clean and convenient. There are several busses which stop one block away so it is a very short walk home. The area is very safe and I felt comfortable anytime of the day. Its about a 20-30 bus ride to the center of Seattle but there are nice neighborhoods close by to explore.
I would stay with Tessa anytime again as she makes you feel like home and it is  very easy to get along with her. I enjoyed our chats and hope to stay with you next time in Seattle :).

"
24144	2263643	9.0	9.0	17316850	I was nervous about utilizing a service like airbnb, but Tessa was a perfect host!  The room is just as described and very tidy and clean.  Tessa was always available and quick to respond to my messages; she was very laid back, helpful with suggestions and super sweet- she even offered to make me breakfast and take me to the weekend neighborhood market with her!  She lives in a lovely neighborhood right outside of Discovery Park for those looking to take quiet strolls and explore the beauty of the area.  Getting to downtown Seattle was very convenient; I had rented a car and it was about a 15 minute drive or so.  There is also a bus stop RIGHT in front of her apartment in case you don't rent a car (which I wish I hadn't!) and there were plenty of local markets, restaurants, etc. within 10 minutes away.  All in all, a lovely host, a lovely, great location, and a fabulous stay!
24145	2263643	9.0	9.0	17419255	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
24146	2263643	9.0	9.0	17727945	My host was nice all the time. She made me feel very welcome and happy to be there. The description of the room is perfect. A very nice experience. Tessa and the apartment are great!
24147	2263643	9.0	9.0	18159709	I needed a last minute place to stay for the night and Tessa responded right away. I also needed to drop my bags off before an event; unfortunately she was away and unable to allow me to bring my bags by. This was understandable as my request was only an hour or two in advance. I was able to stay with a friend elsewhere and she allowed me to cancel my reservation. 
24148	2263643	9.0	9.0	18381393	I had a very nice stay at Tessa's! When I arrived, she met me outside the building so I knew I was in the right place. She offered tea and then gave me my space to settle in. I was up early and home late each day. The building and neighborhood is quiet and felt safe. I would text Tessa when I was on my way back each night to make sure she was looking out for me. There was plenty of street parking. It's a small apartment and Tessa sleeps just in the next room, so I was careful to be quiet in the morning. I would not hesitate to stay there again.
24149	2263643	9.0	9.0	18915638	Quiet bedroom on third floor of a complex. Make sure you get full address or last name when booking accepted or you will have no idea who to buzz! Bus service is direct to Seattle Centre but ends quite early at night. It's a $20 taxi from downtown otherwise. Tessa is friendly and flexible about coming and going hours.
24150	2263643	9.0	9.0	19060120	I had a very nice time at Tessa place it was clean and homie . I was waiting for my Apartment to become avaliable and she was able to let me stay for 3 nights I got to spend time seeing the magnolia where her apartment/ airbnb is the Discovery park is right by her so I was able to walk in the park in the evening after work. I enjoyed tea with her and and chated one evening it was every nice. She also opened up her Kitchen for me to make Coffee in the morning and I was able to keep things in her Frig. She does a lot of home cooking but she always had room for my stuff and for me to make things to eat...
24151	2263643	9.0	9.0	19579009	The place is very nice. Pretty closed to the discovery park which is gorgeous during summer. But a little bit far away from downtown. 
24152	2263643	9.0	9.0	21109411	very nice host, I have one more water bottle friend now:) The place get me know more about local Seattlties other than downtown and Starbucks.
24153	2263643	9.0	9.0	21646936	Tessa is a very friendly and welcoming host. Her apartment is in a quiet area right by Discovery Park and a great grocery store! Nice stay.
24154	2263643	9.0	9.0	23090090	Tessa was a great host, and was able to accomodate us at short notice.  The room was quiet, and near Discovery park. Simple room, and a shared bath and kitchen. Street parking was adequate. 3rd floor condo, FYI.
24155	2263643	9.0	9.0	24691658	"First things first. As a first time guest at an airbnb, I couldn't be more happier to have stayed at Tessa's place. The room, and the entire apartment was lovely. She made me feel very welcome, and any questions I had, she had an answer for. She was super nice. And that was great, because it was also my first time in America, so it was a little overwhelming coming to Seattle in the first place.

As for the neighbourhood, it seems like a great place to live. It was very clean, and I felt safe there. There was a nice little convenience store some five minutes up the street, and it was a great place to grab some food or any other items one would need.

A thing worth mentioning, the bus transportation was great. It leaves often, but the last bus from downtown to Magnolia leaves 10.30pm. So if you like to stay out after that, be prepared to grab a cab or a uber or something like that.

I can definitely recommend staying at Tessa's if your looking for a comfortable and a nice friendly stay in Seattle.

Thank you, Tessa :)"
24156	2263643	9.0	9.0	33042080	Staying with Tessa was a pleasure! The small suburb of Magnolia is locally situated in relation to many key locations in Seattle and is beautiful in terms of the scenery. I thoroughly enjoyed riding the 33 into Queen Anne each day due to the very scenic route.  Tessa made me tea upon arrival and explained the lay of the land to me.  She is a fantastic host and I would definitely recommend considering a stay with Tessa should you be traveling to beautiful Em City! 
24157	2263643	9.0	9.0	33343100	Nice place in a nice neighborhood. Incredibly close to an enormous park, a forest that goes down to the shore. Tessa also seemed very nice. One disclaimer, though: I was asked to arrive by 8:30, so people booking should check beforehand whether their schedule is compatible with Tessa's (I kind of wish I had).
24158	2263643	9.0	9.0	33618666	Tessa's place was great and she was a great, relaxed host, and welcomed us with a comfortable and clean home. The location is good too -- a quick bus ride away from downtown, but quiet and right next to discovery park. 
24159	2263643	9.0	9.0	33746240	"Tessa is a great host. She was very welcoming, accommodating and communicative. The room is exactly as described and the area is quiet, beautiful (near a park) and quite easy to get downtown if you have a car. I don't know if it's challenging with out a car, but for people renting a car it's the perfect location! I enjoyed my time at Tessa's place and the conversations we had. Nice to meet a New Zealander :)  Thanks again!

24160	2263643	9.0	9.0	33887129	Tessa is a great host and wonderful person! Very welcoming and helpful. The room was cozy and clean, and upon my arrival I was greeted with a cup of tea. The bus ride is only 20 minutes to downtown and the place is right next to a beautiful park. Tessa was quick to respond and easy to communicate with. I really enjoyed my stopover in Seattle and highly recommend staying at Tessa's. 
24161	2263643	9.0	9.0	34086649	"Staying with Tessa was absolutely wonderful, it's like home away from home. She is incredibly kind and welcoming. I enjoyed our talks, especially about books and Game of Thrones … it was a lot of fun. The room/appartment is exactly as described. The area is nice and quiet and downtown is easy to reach by bus. If I ever come back to Seattle I would book with Tessa again. Thanks for everything.
"
24162	2263643	9.0	9.0	34743492	Tessa was a lovely host and gave a lot of great tips of what to do in the area. Discovery Park was even more gorgeous than I imagined and the bus system near her home was convenient and easy to figure out for an out-of-towner.
24163	2263643	9.0	9.0	34992207	Tessa was a gracious welcoming hostess. There was plenty of street parking and it was very convenient to Magnolia and Ballard. I would love to stay with her again. 
24164	2263643	9.0	9.0	35339052	Tessa is a great host and the room was very comfortable. She had the room ready along with a cup of tea. I also enjoyed talking with her when we where both there.  Magnolia is a beautiful area and close to Seattle. I had no problems parking on the street and I left my car there during the day so I could use the bus to get into town.  
24165	2263643	9.0	9.0	35502185	"Tessa was an amazing host and the place was lovely.

Neighborhood: Very safe and has easy bus connectivity to Downtown. Has a great convenience store about 5-6 minutes walk away.

Apartment: Very cozy and comfortable, and features some interesting pieces of furniture/souvenirs. 

About the host: Very responsive on text and email. Very warm and welcoming. Very accommodating with check in and check out times. We had a great time chatting about food, celebrity chefs and Game of Thrones!

Tips: Have clear dialogue on checkin and check out times with Tessa so that it's smooth for you and her both. Be prepared to take a cab back to her place if it's too late at night (this applies not just for her neighborhood but many places in Seattle in general)."
24166	2263643	9.0	9.0	35756888	I felt welcomed immediately by the host, Tessa. It had been a long day for me so i went to bed early and was on my way early after a very good nights sleep. Thank you, Cathy
24167	2263643	9.0	9.0	36463426	Tessa was a wonderful host. The location was perfect - quiet, quaint and literally right next to the park. Tessa let us use the kitchen and was very gracious about opening up her home to us. If you are planning a trip to Seattle I recommend this place !!
24168	2263643	9.0	9.0	36716625	10/10.  Tessa was great.  Location perfect.  Room clean and comfortable.  Exactly as advertised.
24169	2263643	9.0	9.0	37010480	Thanks very much Tessa for having me :-) You were very welcoming and provided me with a spacious & clean room, I loved the location being within walking distance to the lovely Ballard district (which has lots of great pubs & concert venues) and with the convenient bus stop right in front of your house that'd bring me downtown and back anytime.
24170	2263643	9.0	9.0	37893554	"It was very good to stay at Tessa's place. Safe and peaceful area! The public bus stop is right in front of her place and it only takes 25-30mins to Downtown. quite convenient. 
Tessa was very welcoming and kind host. Wish I can stay again. "
24171	2263643	9.0	9.0	38301386	"This is a really good location if you're taking public transit but don't want to pay the higher prices closer to downtown. There's a bus stop in front of the apartment with a direct bus that will drop you off three blocks from Pike Place Market downtown. You can also easily walk to Discovery Park or the Chittenden Locks from the apartment. 

I was a bit disappointed with the apartment itself. It was not clear from the description that there is only one bedroom in the apartment, for the guest, and Tessa sleeps in the living room. The kitchen is open to the living room, so if you get up early to make breakfast, you may have to worry about waking her up. The breakfast is included in the price, but it was kind of a strange combination — duck eggs, oatmeal, plums, and apricots. It would have been nice to have something simple like bread or cereal that didn't require cooking. 

The apartment was not very clean. I don't expect perfection at an Airbnb, but there was gunk on the bathroom and kitchen fixtures and it was clear they hadn't been cleaned in a while. On the positive side, the bed was comfortable, it was very quiet at night, and there was plenty of room to unpack."
24172	2263643	9.0	9.0	38644789	Tessa was great. Very friendly, totally hospitable, and the room was just what I needed. She's located in a very nice area, and had plenty of information provided for me. An excellent experience.
24173	2263643	9.0	9.0	38790397	Tessa is a gem!! Very hospitable and welcoming, she offered me a cup of tea as soon as I arrived and we had a nice chat. Thank you for helping me find my way and providing a place to keep my bag during the day while I explored Seattle!
24174	2263643	9.0	9.0	39209340	"Tessa was great :)
I felt welcome, she was very helpful with directions and a few activity ideas, and she seemed genuinely excited about the opportunity air bnb gave her to meet people. Her neighborhood is a little far from DT but the bus is literally right outside her apartment plus magnolia is a beautiful neighborhood and you can walk around discovery park. Room was clean, her balcony garden was lovely - I would stay again in a heartbeat."
24175	2263643	9.0	9.0	39453098	Tessa is incredibly sweet! Had a wonderful stay with her. 
24176	2263643	9.0	9.0	42017993	Tessa was a great host with a fantastic personality.  After a day of exploring the city, she'd offer me a cup of tea and ask about my day.  The bedroom was very clean and she even included some information about the area.  Her home is located new Discovery Park with offers some pretty amazing sunsets. 
24177	2263643	9.0	9.0	42351047	Tessa was a great host. Very welcoming and generous and happy to provide information about things for tourists to do and how best to get around. Check in was very smooth.  Room was exactly as listing described. It was private, comfortable and safe. Great neighbourhood, with a fantastic park nearby.
24178	2263643	9.0	9.0	42723212	Wonderful stay with Tessa! She was a fantastic host. The room was clean, spacious, and cozy. Tessa was very accommodating, prompt to reply to communication, and so gracious. Thanks!!!
24179	2263643	9.0	9.0	43238850	"Tessa is a wonderful person. She gave me clear info on how I can reach her pace and how I could check in even when she was not there. 
The neighborhood is really quiet, just the way I like it. Tessa really likes conversing with people and making them feel welcome with everything. The room is exactly as mentioned, lots of space, and a really comfy bed, the perfect place to have a great sleep after the whole day's activities. 
Don't expect a hotel room. It is a personal apartment and is as good as a personal space can be and I really felt at home. Tessa even let me keep my bag there after checking out so I could take it later.
Altogether, it was a wonderful experience at Tessa's."
24180	2263643	9.0	9.0	44659658	"I had a great time here.  Tessa was very forthcoming with useful information on places to go, buses and such.  
The room was just like the picture, it had a nice comfy bed and the area was very quiet.
There was a bus stop just around 200m away, with direct buses into downtown area, all quite easy to do."
24181	2263643	9.0	9.0	45541569	Tessa was very accomadating and great at communicating with me. She was such a pleasant person to be around. I'm very glad I could meet her.
24182	2263643	9.0	9.0	47882504	"Tessa treated me with kindness and respect. She is a wonderful person, and I found it very easy to get along with her. I especially enjoyed our conversations while we drank coffee on her lovely veranda.
The location is beautiful in a very calm neighborhood. There is a lot of nature to admire, and the nearby Discovery Park was fantastic. The park is huge with basketball and tennis courts if you're into that. The bus stop right outside the building was also a good way to visit downtown Seattle.
I would recommend visiting Tessa's to my friends should they visit Seattle one day. I genuinely felt sad that I had to leave."
24183	2263643	9.0	9.0	48148777	"Tessa is a very kind and welcoming host, she's very interesting to talk with, and I met nice other airbnb traveler there. The location is nice for seeing Seattle, and the park one block away is fantastic! great trails, open fields, views of the sound and Mt. Ranier...
the bed's a little on the firm side, but not too bad. Thanks Tessa!"
24184	2263643	9.0	9.0	48625091	Tessa was a charming and caring host. As a great fan of the Discovery Park the location was ideal and very convenient.
24185	2263643	9.0	9.0	48755492	The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
24186	2263643	9.0	9.0	49167305	Tessa is a lovely hostess. She is an excellent communicator and flexible.  I highly recommend Tessa's flat for those interested in exploring Magnolia, Queen Anne and Ballard or those who need a quite place to sleep after a busy day downtown working or site seeing.  
24187	2263643	9.0	9.0	50104151	The listing description was accurate. We were tow female guests and Tessa made us feel welcome right away: she came out of the bldg to guide a way and even help us with our luggage. We were met with fresh flowers from her balcony garden, bottles of water and candy. The neighborhood is a vast Discovery park, a treat for any biker or a hiker. Within just 35 min of walk there is the most western tip of the Seattle shoreline - West Point beach with a lighthouse. Two buses 2-3 times per hour run straight to downtown, just 25 min. It has been a restful and enjoyable stay for us after 10 day road trip. Thank you, Tessa!
24188	2263643	9.0	9.0	50375015	Good value & great location for me as it was really only a 5-15 minute drive from anywhere I wanted to go. Bus stop right outside too. Discovery Park (literally right outside the front door) is beautiful and the Locks which are a picturesque 5 minute walk away are definitely worth checking out. Tessa is a warm and welcoming person who made me feel right at home. The bed was a tiny bit short for me but I am 6 foot 4...!  Would stay again!
24189	2263643	9.0	9.0	50821267	I had a really nice time at Tessa's place. The room is very pleasent and cosy. Located in a nice neighborhood easy to access and very close to the beautiful discovery park. Tessa was a wonderful host very nice considerate and thoughtful  she instantly made me feel at ease.  
24190	2263643	9.0	9.0	50999663	Tessa is a wonderful host, I felt welcomed and more at home than ever at her place!
24191	2263643	9.0	9.0	54025203	Tessa is a wonderful host. Staying at her BnB was a wonderful experience. It has a warm and positive energy about it with great attention to artistic detail.  The location next to Discovery park is excellent and there is a grocery store a block away and many restaurants south or north 8-10 blks. Its also close to the Ballard locks and waterway with a nice paved path.
24192	2263643	9.0	9.0	56062863	Tess was wonderful! 
24193	2263643	9.0	9.0	56226284	Tessa has a nice home, in a very convenient location for checking out discovery park or fisherman's terminal. I enjoyed my time there.
24194	2263643	9.0	9.0	56617896	I greatly enjoyed my stay at Tessa's.  She was very hospitable and made me feel welcome immediately.  A wonderful conversationalist and she provided excellent recommendations for things to see/do around the city.  The room was very comfortable and clean and was as described on the listing page.    
24195	2263643	9.0	9.0	56752619	Tessa makes me feel like a friend, not a guest. the room is clean and lovely. 
24271	5164581	9.0	9.0	26270072	Luyao is a super sweet and attentive host. Her place is warm, clean, quiet, and very pleasant. I was very comfortable and had a terrific night's sleep. I look forward to staying at her place in magnolia again.
24272	5164581	9.0	9.0	26377279	The place was great for what we needed. Nice and simple. Luyao was very accommodating and friendly. Thanks for the stay! 
24273	5164581	9.0	9.0	26713534	"The host was friendly and helpful.
The room, bathroom/shower, and kitchen area were clean and had all I needed.
If you prefer to sleep with an open window (as I did) there will be some occasional sound carried from the railway line. Being a heavy sleeper, it did not bother me, but might bother a light sleeper. Closed window means quiet, however.
WiFi access fine.
Overall, recommended."
24274	5164581	9.0	9.0	26805982	I enjoyed my experince from when I got there to when I left. My hosts boyfriend who took care of everything I needed to know while at the 3 story home was very friendly and informative. I was able to take the 33 bus downtown which was only 2.25 each way and was only a couple hundred feet from the house. One street up the hill then !boom! there is the bus stop on to the left. I took full advantage of the beautiful trail that is very close to the home to walk back after my excursions to downtown Seattle each day. Great views of Sound and little parks along trail. Takes 1 1/2 hours to walk back to home from Seattle. Home was very clean and well organized for guests. Temperature was very comfortable. Long shag carpeting felt great between my toes in the bedroom. I slept well on the bed. Liked the provided Starbucks Vanilla K-Cups to get me going in the morning for my days adventures. Good food choices close by. Pizza!
24275	5164581	9.0	9.0	27064265	Luyao was sweet, kind, and accommodating looks just like the pictures. Clean bathroom with soap and shampoo. Beautiful view. The air through the window smelled amazing. Cool neighborhood, cool condo. 
24276	5164581	9.0	9.0	27185959	Luyao and company were great hosts. The house was clean and orderly.  They had tea available (cold or hot) all day.  Despite being a few blocks from a train yard, the house was pretty quiet while I was there.  The bed was the firmest I've slept on via AirBnB.
24277	5164581	9.0	9.0	28561059	The hosts of the place were warm, kind, friendly; they kept the place very clean and organized, and they were readily available to answer any questions about the place as well as my stay there. I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend the place to anyone who is looking for a short or long term stay in the nice Magnolia neighborhood. 
24278	5164581	9.0	9.0	28682603	"Very nice and quiet couple. I had an issue with my car on arrival and Tao drove me to the closest mechanic to get help, it was really nice!!The house is clean and the bed very comfy. Perfect area to stay only 20 min from downtown by bus ! Nice neighborough. You have access to the kitchen for the meal when your host are not there. The host are a bit shy or may be just want to respect your privacy so don't except long talk, it can be a great thing if you want to relax or you are not talkative yourself ;) 
Finally I think the price is good for what you get!
I recommend this place"
24279	5164581	9.0	9.0	28749290	Luyao and her husband were great! The space was clean and they were very accommodating with our check-in time. This is a great place to stay in Seattle!
24280	5164581	9.0	9.0	28839659	This was my first experience of airbnb and it could not have been better. Luyao and her husband were so understanding of almost any adjustment we made to our plans! We were there for just one night but I could see the immense changes they had made  to their entire house to make a guest feel comfortable for a long stay. I highly recommend their place, its clean, exactly like the posting and the neighbourhood is quite accessible from downtown even in late hours. We got back at 2am by bus and had no trouble getting home.
24281	5164581	9.0	9.0	28966409	Very welcoming, accurate description of a lovely home, nice neighbourhood with a bus to town every half hour or so.
24282	5164581	9.0	9.0	29061741	I had a good stay at Luyao's place. She was flexible with my late arrival and was very friendly when I arrived. The room was spacious and brightly lit, with more closet space than I needed for a one night stay. 
24283	5164581	9.0	9.0	29498938	"Comfortable room with lots of closet space! The bathroom is shared, so make sure you are respectful of other guest's schedule. This can be tough if you are in a rush and someone's in there! Just something to keep in mind. 

We did not meet Luyao till the last night we were staying there due to our conflicting schedules, but her husband was working from home and was downstairs if we ever needed anything. They were both suuuper accommodating and helpful throughout the whole trip!! Hosts are great about guests using their kitchen space. Everything is labelled in the kitchen for guest use (i.e. cabinets, drawers in fridge, toaster, etc.) and there are definitely utensils and what not for use!

Bus stops were only about a block away and even though there were some nights where we out late, it was really not a problem getting back to their place. I would definitely recommend if you don't mind the public transportation!"
24284	5164581	9.0	9.0	29715767	Luyao and husband were very helpful and welcoming.  The room is as described, quiet and close to downtown.  The bonus is there's plenty of off street parking if you have a car. 
24285	5164581	9.0	9.0	29740654	Luyao's house is pretty and quite. We had a great living experience there. Everything is clean tide and convenient. 
24286	5164581	9.0	9.0	29844843	"We had a wonderful short, but sweet, stay with Luyao. The neighborhood was convenient and she prepared a nice clean room for us to stay in. If you're traveling to Seattle, I reccomend staying here!

Thanks again,

Julia"
24287	5164581	9.0	9.0	30417391	"I appreciated the flexible check-in time. This was adequate for budget lodging. Room itself was as described. Location was quiet and safe, street parking was available for no added cost.
""Access to"" the bathroom here really means Shared bathroom with other airbnb bedroom rented on second floor. The one review that pointed this out was written after I booked this, unfortunately. Listing is not quite accurate on that. So I was not prepared to share a bath but it worked out fine and there was only one person in the other room luckily. 
The bus line downtown is just one block up and very convenient 10 minutes to downtown, however some planning is required depending on your destination. Mine was Seattle Center all weekend and the bus only ran every hour with last bus to get home at 10:24p even on a Saturday, not 2:00am like another reviewer commented. 
Overall it is a good choice if you need an inexpensive place to sleep."
24288	5164581	9.0	9.0	30876538	"Had such a wonderful time staying here! Luyao and her husband are lovely people and very accommodating. The room was nice and in a quiet neighborhood, but very easy to get downtown via public transportation. 

Would  recommend staying here and I would definitely return."
24289	5164581	9.0	9.0	31115861	The room was clean and nice. We didn't meet Luyao, but her husband was in the house to greet us. Sharing a bathroom can really be inconvenient sometimes, but we knew what we are getting into. The house is easy to find and get to, but if you come late, parking is limited, you might need to park on adjacent streets. The neighborhood is nice too.
24290	5164581	9.0	9.0	31524764	Very nice room & house in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood. Luyao made us feel welcome and was very hospitable and helpful with our questions. Supermarket, restaurants, and bus connection to the center were close by. I'd recommend anyone to stay at Luyao's place!
24291	5164581	9.0	9.0	32068863	"The host couple are very nice and friendly. They always tried to help me get the directions and transportation information. The room is tidy and neat. Wifi and detailed information/direction of the house are properly provided which has made everything easy during my stay.

Thank you so much for making my stay in Seattle so wonderful.
 "
24292	5164581	9.0	9.0	32173112	We had a great stay with Luyao & Tao. Their home is neat and clean, the room is cozy, and the bed is comfortable. They live in a nice neighborhood with easy public access to/from downtown via the 33 bus so you can get around without a car. We walked to the grocery store nearby and cooked a few meals in their kitchen. We would definitely stay again if in Seattle! 
24293	5164581	9.0	9.0	32296254	Comfortable and economical place to stay. Luyao was quick with communication and arranging check in which made for a smooth stay. Thank you, Luyao!
24294	5164581	9.0	9.0	32681558	Luyao was a very accommodating host! We were out most of the day each day to see Seattle so we did not get to interact that much. The room was perfect and the bed was comfy! The bus stop is so close which made getting around a breeze Luyao also provided transit books  and attractions which came in handy for us! Would stay again, great experience! 
24295	5164581	9.0	9.0	32866354	Luyao and her husband were great! The room, bathroom and location are as described, and it was a close drive to downtown. She was very flexible with check-in time, and we were very happy with our stay! 
24296	5164581	9.0	9.0	32974534	The Check-In was quick and easy, the room was clean and the bed very comfortable. It is not located in the city center, but there are busses or you can go by car in 20 minutes. We had only one night at Luyaos place but I could really recommend it!
24297	5164581	9.0	9.0	33650613	Comfortable and clean house to stay.  Even you don't have car, transportation is still convenient. Host are really nice and hospitable. 
24298	5164581	9.0	9.0	34146140	Great room! I recommend this place when you want to visit Seattle. Next to the house, there are many services (bus, shops...etc.). Luyao was very flexible with check-in time. Thanks Luyao for everything.
24299	5164581	9.0	9.0	34274944	Luyao was a great host. The place is in a really good location if u want to visit downtown or if going in a cruise like we did. The only caveat is that it is in the second floor so if u have a lot of luggage it is a little challenging. 
24300	5164581	9.0	9.0	34445948	Thank you so much to our host for greeting and inviting us we had a comfortable safe and secure stay right outside of central Seattle.  Plenty of closet space a comfortable bed and if you take a lift ride into downtown Seattle it's about 12 bucks for two people. A nice condo community with wifi
24301	5164581	9.0	9.0	34794092	"The room was very clean, the bed was perfect and there was plenty of space and shelves for luggage and other things, even more than I needed. Luyao was very flexible with check-in and check-out times and responsive about any question I had.

The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, with a couple of very close (2 - 5 minutes walking) stops for buses going in different directions. There is also a very nice pub close by, where you can have food and drinks any time of the day.

In conclusion, a very nice accommodation, which fitted perfectly in my first ever Seattle experience."
24302	5164581	9.0	9.0	35261571	Luyao was a great hostess. Her place is in a nice neighborhood with easy parking, and she was very kind and accommodating. Our only interaction was when we first arrived, but during that interaction she was warm and friendly. 
24303	5164581	9.0	9.0	38978498	We really enjoyed our stay -- Luyao provided us with everything we needed-- a clean bedroom with plenty of closet space, towels, etc. Luyao was flexible about a late arrival which we needed due to a late flight! We also really liked the neighborhood -- it was extremely easy to take buses downtown or to other parts of the city. We didn't spend much time at the BnB because we were extremely busy with our stay, but it certainly provided us with everything we needed! 
24304	5164581	9.0	9.0	39276956	This was my ver first Airbnb experience. I'm glad I got to experience this with Luyao and her husband Tao. They were very friendly and ver inviting. Their home was lovely in a very nice part of town. 
24305	5164581	9.0	9.0	40336888	My wife and I really enjoyed staying at Luyou's place. The place was clean, comfy and very easy to get in town as it's described. The area is safe and quiet. We didn't have chance to meet Luyoa but we met Luyou's husband. He was a nice guy. I would recommend this place to my friends and whoever is looking to visit Seattle.
24306	5164581	9.0	9.0	40638843	Luyao was very accommodating and friendly! The room was clean, with more than enough storage space, good bed, and a good bathroom. The location is pretty good as it's a simple bus ride or Lyft to downtown , Discovery Park, Ballard/Fremont, etc. All pretty awesome places. Of course it was all capped off with Luyao and her hospitality. 
24307	5164581	9.0	9.0	40897162	Luyao and Tao were very nice hosts and the place was clean and quiet. Starbucks and a couple good restaurants nearby. Great value!
24308	5164581	9.0	9.0	41924411	First time using Airbnb was a pleasant one. Luyao and her husband were very accommodating, although I didn't interact much with them due to our different schedules. The room was cozy and clean and the bed was large (always a plus). The area was quite nice as well, very quiet. Would definitely stay here in the future!
24309	5164581	9.0	9.0	43232778	This was my first time using airbnb, and i'm glad to report it was a positive experience! (Admittedly i don't having anything to compare it to yet, but i was very happy with my stay.) Luyao and Tao were very kind and welcoming, the accommodations were as advertised, and the neighbourhood was safe and quiet. I was initially worried the street parking might be an issue, but i was always able to find a spot nearby. I would definitely consider staying here again.
24310	5164581	9.0	9.0	43553004	Our stay at Luyao's was very pleasant and exactly what we needed for our short time in Seattle. Luyao and her husband were friendly and helpful whenever we encountered them. Luyao was very responsive when I later realized I had forgotten my passport in the room too. Their neighborhood is quiet and had good street parking. We found it easy to get into the city from their house, about a 15 minute drive. We did share the bathroom with other guests but that wasn't a problem for me. I'd recommend their place to others looking for a quiet place to sleep after exploring the city.
24311	5164581	9.0	9.0	44300738	Luyao and her husband are wonderful and kind hosts. The room we stayed in was comfortable and they washrooms had the basic essentials provided for by host. It was wonderful to return to their home after a busy day exploring to rest. Thank you!
24312	5164581	9.0	9.0	45244925	"I really enjoyed staying with Luyao. The neighborhood seems to mind their own business, the home was clean, cozy, and comfortable. I cooked a little for myself, but I was usually out most of the day every day. The room was clean, bed was comfy, and was pretty bright while there was sun outside. No complaints here!

The only trouble I ever had was parking, but there isn't anything Luyao could have done about that. There was only street parking available, but my issue was finding a place to park. Especially at night. My advice for anyone coming with a car, park on the street, and leave your car there. Take uber/lyft. It will save you money and hassle."
24313	5164581	9.0	9.0	45937284	"Luyao and her husband were very accomodating to my girlfriend and I :) There was ample space in the fridge for our groceries, the living areas were very well maintained, and we even got to enjoy a few episodes of a hilarious chinese trivia show with them. A downtown-bound bus stopped one block from their house and there's a pleasant grocery store a few minutes walk away. 

I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone who would like a low-key visit to Seattle. "
24314	5164581	9.0	9.0	46393670	Luyao's room is wonderful and she is a great host.  Communication prior to our arrival was excellent, too. The neighborhood is quiet and convenient. I can highly recommend it.
24315	5164581	9.0	9.0	48002288	Although we did not get to meet Luyao during our arrival, however, we were welcomed by her husband Tao who was accomodating. He showed us where are room was and that was basically it. We got to meet Luyao, I believe the following day or the day after. Both husband and wife are very friendly and Luyao made sure we were comfortable. I am a light sleeper, so the noises outside kept me up half the night. But, for the most part the drive to Downtown area and Ballard and to many attractions was not bad at all. We had a great time!
24316	5164581	9.0	9.0	48330684	Great experience, fine room, convenient location, wonderful hosts! 
24317	5164581	9.0	9.0	49137357	"I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough. The room and house are very clean. Soap, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips and toothpaste are all provided for those staying. The room has shelving in the closet which makes it very easy to keep the room from feeling cluttered while you stay. Another thing I liked was that there was a desk in the room. I had homework to do on my trip so this was very convenient. 
Another cool feature is that if you aren't familiar with Seattle you will have no problem getting to the down town area from the house. The bus stop is about a minute walk from the house and a single bus ride will take you into the downtown area. Also there is a variety of restaurants, a gas station and convenient store within a 5 minute walking distance. 
Luyao and her husband were both very nice. I hope they are both making a lot of money off this Airbnb because this is a great place to stay!"
24318	5164581	9.0	9.0	52464626	Luyao and her husband are a very sweet, young couple! Helpful, friendly and cheerful. A quiet, clean, uncluttered condo. The neighborhood is very quiet. Well placed for the Ballard, Queen Anne area. I was only 7-8 minutes from Key Arena where my concert was. The coffee was nice perk, plus some room in the frig. I would return.
24319	5164581	9.0	9.0	53014067	Luyao was a great host and the room was just as described. Great location and very convenient. The bed was comfortable and we had a great stay. We'll be back!
24320	5164581	9.0	9.0	53689206	Luayao was very welcoming! The room was spacious, tidy and warm for the cold/wet weather. The nice thing about staying here was the bus lines (33,31, & 24) were very close and take you pretty much everywhere. There is a grocery store near by, Starbucks, gas stations and other restaurants near by. Also, there's a Pizza place and a burger joint about 9min. walk away that are pretty good. This trip was a success thanks to Luyao's place.
24321	5164581	9.0	9.0	53859533	The host made me feel as if I was in my own home. Everything was very clean and the bed was comfortable.
24322	5164581	9.0	9.0	56852368	Luyao was a great host! I stayed for two weeks after just moving to Seattle from the east coast and I was thrilled to stay in such a nice place for such an amazing price. I was pleasantly welcomed and was helped with whatever I needed. Nice, quiet area in Magnolia/Interbay and would recommend to the next guest.
24323	5164581	9.0	9.0	57065087	Great host! She was very quick at responding to my messages. I felt comfortable and safe. She was organized with before and after instructions. I would definitely recommend someone to stay there. 
24324	5164581	9.0	9.0	57232186	Luyao is a very very nice landlord! She responded very fast whenever i had a question. The room is clean and tidy and there is a good view looking out of the window. The kitty pet in the house is super cute!!! When i opened the door in the morning i always saw her lying in the middle of the hall and she is not shy at all. Super cute. Recommend this airbnb to everyone. 
24325	5164581	9.0	9.0	57412377	Never met the host, but the place is in a nice neighborhood. It's a 30 minute bus ride from downtown. 
24326	5164581	9.0	9.0	57697948	The rom meets my expectations in term of size and as described. The ceiling to floor window provides feeling of spaciousness and some view of a small mountain and surrounding. The closet is relatively huge ang very functionable. It has many section that can handle different type of clothing and supply enough room for storage. Luyao provides a few sort of shampoo and body wash. After first day of introduction, The cat is so close to us that it wants to come into my room. The next day it was policed and is only allowed on third floor. The good part of Luyao ' house is that it is so close to downtown that it only takes 15 to 20 minutes by ONE bus to very core part of commercial.shopping streets. The best is that you will enter the border of downtown only 8 minutes after you get in the bus and enjoy the vivid modern city life. This impressed me as you may not know that many part of Seattle looks very countryside and infrastructure is underdeveloped . So luyao's house location also give sense of security to many first timer to Seattle.   On the other front. Luyao spent considerable amount of time chatting with me on how they settle,grow and develop in Seattle, which benefit me a lot.
24327	5164581	9.0	9.0	58028547	Luyao was a sweet, thoughtful hostess who provided me, a newbie AirBnB user, with a fantastic experience. Simple, safe, stress less - the trip was exactly what I had hoped it would be. 
24328	5164581	9.0	9.0	58565345	it was very nice to stay with Luyao and her husband. very clean and comfortable. Thank you guys!
24494	685600	9.0	10.0	17267116	Nikki is a great host and room is quite private with its own patio, which was great during summer. Location is super quiet and convenient. Bus nearby and groceries within walking distance. We didn't need a car during our stay. Park across the street is amazing for runs and long walks.
24495	685600	9.0	10.0	17656376	"Nikki was an absolutely wonderful host and the room was exactly as promised in the description!
From the first moment we felt welcome and at home. The kitchenette was great to get us started with tea, coffee and oatmeal in the morning, and there was even the possibility to sit outside in a private space and enjoy the good weather.
Since the room and bathroom are connected to the rest of the house only via a small entry area, one can be as private as one likes. At the same time Nikki was always happy to answer all our questions, suggest places to see and things to do etc. The discovery park right across the street is really a must-see!
The neighborhood and the area around the house are really nice and quiet. A grocery store is in walking distance and Magnolia Center with Starbucks, Subway and a few pubs/places to eat is about 15 to 20 minutes on foot. Downtown Seattle is easy to reach by bus.
We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Nikki's place and we'll definitely stay with her again next time we're in Seattle!"
24496	685600	9.0	10.0	17982144	I would definitely recommend Nikki's place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle! She is just outside of downtown in a beautiful neighborhood that is quiet and peaceful yet easily accessible to downtown. Across the street is Discovery Park, a sight that must not be missed! It has the best view in the entire area. Nikki was very accommodating, giving us tips for where to eat and how to navigate traffic. Her room is very private, off to the side of the house.
24497	685600	9.0	10.0	18998817	Das Zimmer war wie beschrieben und die Umgebung ist super!! Wir sind erst sehr spät in Seattle gelandet, aber das war kein Problem. Nikki kann sogar deutsch! Sie hat uns kurz alles geziegt, weil sie dann weg musste. Das Zimmer ist sehr schön eingerichtet und das Bad ist sehr sauber. Nikki hat sogar Duschbad und Shampoo zur Nutzung im Bad gehabt. Auch eine Mikrowelle und Wasserkocher waren vorhanden. Kaffee und Oatmeal hat sie dür uns dagehabt. Das Zimmer hat einen Ausgang auf die kleine Terasse, so das wir abends noch draussen sitzen konnten. Die Umgebung ist sehr ruhig und genau am Discovery Park, den wir am letzten Tag auch angesehen haben. Auf jeden Fall einem Besuch Wert!! Am zweiten Abend haben wir Nikki und ihren Mitbewohner angetroffen und uns mit ihnen unterhalten können. Beide sehr aufgeschlossen und freundlich. Wir haben uns von Anfang an sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Haus ist zwar hellhörig, aber wir haben die zwei kaum mitbekommen. Alles in allem eine tolle Unterkunft. Es war unsere erste Erfahrung mit Air B&B und wir haben es nicht bereut! Wir würden jederzeit wieder bei Nikki übernachten. Sie hat auch sehr schnell auf all unsere Emails geantwortet. Sowohl vorher als auch während wir bei ihr gewohnt haben.
24498	685600	9.0	10.0	22271165	Nikki was great, very open and welcoming. The house is located in a very nice quiet and safe neighborhood right next to the park. The room was cozy and well equipped with all I needed to stay there comfortably without interrupting the flow of Nikki's regular activities. Everything was great. 
24499	685600	9.0	10.0	25994018	Nikki is, beyond being an excellent host, just one of the coolest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. The room is very comfortable for 1, plenty of storage space, and was beautifully clean when I moved in. Nikki took a genuine interest in my life and how I was doing, but was also totally willing to leave me to my own devices, which I appreciate. The proximity to Discovery Park is another bonus! If you can work around Nikki's completely reasonable teaching schedule, you will absolutely love it here.
24500	685600	9.0	10.0	28784775	I had an amazing stay here.  Nikki was very kind and curteous, I really felt she wanted me to have the most pleasant stay possible.  The room was cozy and the private bathroom and personal sliding door out onto the patio were also pluses.  The proximity to Discovery Park (across the street) was something I utilized on nearly a daily basis.  The park is truly special and the sunsets I saw from the beech there were spectacular.  With a great host and wonderful location, I highly recommend staying here.
24501	685600	9.0	10.0	31321886	"I had a great stay with Nikki and her place was perfect for my needs.  The room is large and comfortable with plenty of closet space and also has it's own bathroom which was convenient.  Since I was staying for a few weeks, I also took advantage of having the mini fridge and microwave set up in the room.  Magnolia is a really beautiful neighborhood and this particular location is just across the street from Discovery Park.  I took the bus downtown every day and was happy to find a stop so close to the house.  

Nikki is super sweet and friendly, you will feel at home right away!  We didn't see each other too much because of our schedules but she was always up for a fun chat when we ran into each other.  I would be happy to stay here again if I'm in the area!"
24716	5559643	9.0	10.0	28682467	No contact from host on our arrival, despite our emails and texts it was two hours before we heard from them.  Not enough pillows for our family (which we eventually received at 830pm), could not find towels, blankets.  No available wi-fi, for which host did contact cable company the next day and when issue not resolved, told me I would have to call them directly, and that I could go to Starbucks. This was an issue for me since I was planning on doing business work at the house. House cleanliness in general was not up to my expectations.  Broken cabinet in kitchen. Expired food in the refrigerator.  Open food pieces in kitchen cabinet.  
24717	5559643	9.0	10.0	29083159	Beautiful place in a nice neighborhood. Close to downtown but not filled with the usual city buzz. Great breakfast places and amenities within walking distance. Owner is quick and responsive. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a nice get away. Also wifi is quick as hell
24718	5559643	9.0	10.0	29924594	"We absolutely love this cottage!  It's clean, very comfortable, and in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood, close to shopping restaurants, and Discovery Park.  What you don't see from the pictures is how big and private the outside area is...perfect for children and just hanging out.  Washer and drier came in handy as does the dishwasher.  Lots of sun and big windows (and even a solarium).  

As a host, Ella has outdone herself.   She's very easy to reach and is extremely helpful.  She even made special accommodations for us when we were in a bind. We will definitely be back!!"
24719	5559643	9.0	10.0	32239623	This charming home was a real find!  And Ella was a wonderful host --- even letting us stay longer than we had planned :-) and making a bike available for us.   Thank you, Ella!  The house is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood (and a quiet street) near Magnolia center and Discovery Park.  There's plenty of room for a family and both front and back yards are fenced.  Very comfy and clean with a gas fireplace, TV , and great wireless.  The larger bedroom even has a separate toilet.   we will definitely stay there again.     
24720	5559643	9.0	10.0	33585653	We really enjoyed our stay in Ella's Seattle Cottage.  We were there for five nights.  We have two young girls and they thoroughly enjoyed the play room and stuffed animals, as well as the bunk beds.  The house is in a great neighborhood, within walking distance to a community pool, coffee, bars, and other necessities, like ice cream.  I took the bus in and out of downtown (#24) for work.  The stop is nearby and takes about 1/2 hour each way.  Ella was responsive and helpful, and everything went smoothly.  We were very pleased and would stay here again.
24721	5559643	9.0	10.0	34910589	Ella was extremely responsive and helpful. My first time using Airbnb was a success thanks to her! 
24722	5559643	9.0	10.0	35048602	Ella made it very easy for us to get into the home and enjoy our time in Seattle. She communicated well and made for a great experience. Great location in the Magnolia neighborhood as well!
24723	5559643	9.0	10.0	35313751	We enjoyed staying at the cottage very much!!  Ella was very prompt in getting back to us and made the stay welcoming and personal.  
24724	5559643	9.0	10.0	36282170	Everything is just perfect, the accommodations were as described the neighborhood is just perfect the people who clean the place even gave us a great place to have lunch had a marvelous time thank you so much
24725	5559643	9.0	10.0	37633014	The host canceled this reservation 49 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
24726	5559643	9.0	10.0	40428421	We stayed here for one month and it was great. It is perfect for families with small children. Magnolia is a great neighborhood 4 or 5 miles from downtown. Everything you need is walking distance, restaurants, parks, and grocercies. There is a bus stop to go downton nearby.  The house was clean and well stocked. The kids loved all toys and we felt very at home. Ella was a wonderful host. We really enjoyed staying here.
24727	5559643	9.0	10.0	41731557	We had a great time at Ella's place in Seattle.  Short walk to a bus line that can take you wherever you need to go.
24728	5559643	9.0	10.0	42205700	Very nice house, great location, family friendly and well equipped. Very suitable for a longer stay. 
25533	19611	9.0	9.0	31048	"We had a fabulous time. #338 Urban Oasis is a great unit for four or fewer people. I traveled with my two daughters and a friend and it worked out great. The unit is nicely decorated and the kitchen has all of the utensils and pots/pans we needed (we made chocolate linguine from Pike's street market and put it over Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from the grocery just down the block . . . absolutely delicious). The unit is within walking distance of great shopping (Norstrom Rack, H&M, etc.) and the secure parking is a great feature. We hope to stay there again in the future and may even try to figure out how to ride the bus in the ""ride free zone."""
25534	19611	9.0	9.0	131119	Everything was wonderful and comfortable.  We had all we needed to have an enjoyable time. Fully stocked kitchen and a nice welcome package. The bed had a temperpedic topper that was very comfortable. Directions to the apt were clear and the bus line was just outside the door.  The area was a little down but not enough to be afraid of our safety.  My only complaint and it wasn't with the accomadations  The fees that Air bnb charges was not clearly stated and the cleaning fee wasn't included in the price of the apt.  I spent closely to 200 a night so that should have been absorbed.  But over all I was very pleased with out time there. 
25535	19611	9.0	9.0	168876	Lovely apartment, great kitchen, amazingly quiet given the sometimes bustling street scene outside. We appreciated the laundry facilities after a few days on the road. Our party of four was a bit crowded but comfortable. Proximity to transport, entertainment, markets, shopping and eating was excellent. We really enjoyed it. Thanks for a wonderful stay in fascinating Seattle. 
25536	19611	9.0	9.0	445563	Very comfortable unit. Convenient location with an easy walk to Pike Place Market or Downtown for some endless shopping. Checking in/out was a breeze because the instructions were so clear and concise and the welcome package, which included a map of all sights in Seattle, was a nice little touch. I thoroughly enjoyed the balcony overlooking 3rd Ave. It was a little noisy when the windows/balcony door was open because there is a bus stop directly in front of the building, which is actually a positive for those without a rental. We had a rental so it was nice to have secure parking in the building. The rest of the amenities of the building were amazing. I absolutely fell in love with the rooftop deck. My only complaint about the unit was that there was a strange smell possibly coming from the garbage disposal, which may have been from the tenants before us. We also had some difficulty with the wireless but immediate help was just a phone call away. Overall we had a positive experience. Until we meet again, Seattle. 
25537	19611	9.0	9.0	678527	"we were just moving in from France. first 15 days in town !
very good experience
all was very well at Darik's place !
near everything downtown"
25538	19611	9.0	9.0	898126	Nice place.  Great kitchen, but who needs a kitchen in this neighborhood?
25539	19611	9.0	9.0	1126845	"We had a lovely stay in Seattle and the Oasis was in a perfect location for our brief trip. The room was comfortable, clean and well-decorated. We took advantage of the kitchen with its fully-stocked supplies & utensils and made a dinner fresh from Pike Place Market. The condo is located in the center of Belltown and within blocks of the market, many of Tom Douglas' wonderful restaurants and several department stores. 

If you have a couple days to sight-see, I highly recommend a Savor Seattle food tour of Pike Place Market, a quick drive up to Kerry Park for a phenomenal view of the skyline and a day-trip to Everett for a whale-watching tour. 

We had a great time in Seattle and would stay at the Seattle Oasis again without hesitation!"
25540	19611	9.0	9.0	1266214	 Never met our host but the instructions on checking in was very clear so no problems there.  It is a great place to stay!  You can get anywhere within 10-15 minutes by foot if you're just planning to stay downtown.  The room is very clean and has almost all of the amenities that you'll need.  Highly recommend!
25541	19611	9.0	9.0	2946508	Good flat, good location, everything went smooth.
25542	19611	9.0	9.0	3193151	We had a great time, and the apartment was perfect for the two of us.  Great location for walking around the city, and nice, clean accommodations.  
25543	19611	9.0	9.0	3310926	The apartment is fantastic, very well decorated, comfortable and clean. You feel like you're living in a model apartment, designed and decorated by a professional. The host was very gracious with the instructions on how to arrive, park the car, reach the apartment, etc. The building was also nice and we regularly used the gyms in the morning (it was mostly empty). The location was a plus and a minus for the apartment: for day attractions, you're blocks away from the Space Needle, many museums and coffee shops, about 15min walk to Pike Market, so no complaints there. During the night, though, if you walk in the wrong direction the neighborhood can get pretty sketchy - don't try walking to Pike Place Market at night for dinner or you'll cross some strange, strange intersections. Luckily there were a few nice restaurants for dinner just a few blocks way on 1st and 2nd avenue.
25544	19611	9.0	9.0	3331867	"This was my first time having a GREAT AirBNB experience. I had booked once before and was horrible experience so I was hesitant to try again, but so glad I did. 
This was a great property that truly thought of everything for the guest and was super easy process. The unit had everything one needs: kitchen with all appliances, utensils and even bakeware.  Also had sponges and dish soap and dishwasher too. The stacked washer and dryer was so convenient and even had detergent and fabric softener. 
Welcome kit had all instruction details for unit, coffee, microwave popcorn and 2 bottle each of sparkling and still water. SUCH A NICE TOUCH!
Place was a little noisy being at a bus stop, but can't beat location so was worth it and there is no where else in city where you could park for free in secure covered spot. 
Can't say enough good things. Would highly recommend!"
25545	19611	9.0	9.0	4183467	This was an amazing space and location.  Darik was awesome.  I would recommend this or any of his properties to anyone.  I truly felt at home.  
25546	19611	9.0	9.0	7296702	We stayed here for  two days while we explored Mount Rainier and Pike Place. The condo is nicely decorated but had a hotel feel to it which we were trying to get away from by using AirBnB. It was well stocked and centrally located. We liked the secure parking. My issues would be that the condo was unbearably hot and has no air conditioning. Being on a very busy street you can't open the windows and get a good nights sleep so for that reason I would not stay here again. Another small issue is that I was charged a cleaning fee yet I was left with instructions to take my garbage out, wash my bed linens and towels and start the dishwasher all before I checked out. 
25547	19611	9.0	9.0	7988223	Good location, we'll equipped lovely little place, no hassle to check in. Was quite warm at night but overall ideal for our mini break
25548	19611	9.0	9.0	9978971	My family and I greatly enjoyed Darik's condo. The check in and out procedures where clearly described via email. I was not in personal contact with Darik since check in and check out was automated. The room was clean, had a well equipped kitchen, and had all the conveniences of home. The neighborhood was lovely. I would stay here again.
25549	19611	9.0	9.0	10717187	Very clean and comfortable, felt right at home. Excellent location. Couldn't have asked for anything better!
25550	19611	9.0	9.0	11090466	great spot! clean, well decorated and stocked. would stay here again in a second! 
25551	19611	9.0	9.0	11162190	"The location and roof top deck with spectacular views and great outdoor furniture make this a really super downtown rental.  You can walk everywhere from here - we left our car in the underground garage the whole time.  The kitchen is well stocked - better than I have experienced in any airbnb to date and the bathroom comes well supplied with loads of towels.  

We missed the personal airbnb touches (meeting the hosts or emailing with them) but did find everything went very smoothly from booking, to checking in and checking out.  

We did find the master bedroom a bit noisy at night  from outdoor traffic and pedestrian noise (we had the window closed) and the apartment/building was on the warm and stuffy side.  It is on the small side as well…too small for our family of 4 …but would be a great size for one or two.  The bathroom door is a sliding door which isn't the most private (it has privacy gaps on the sides) and it slipped off the hinges a couple of times.  The apartment, appliances and contents were very clean and tidy.

All in all a professional rental."
25552	19611	9.0	9.0	21442244	This is very much a corporate housing type of Airbnb. The apartment is nice and appears as the photos but is quite a lot smaller than one would expect. It was easy to gain entry and nice that they had a small welcome basket. Unfortunately some parts were not functioning such as the sink which was clogged the entire time. If you're looking for somewhere that is nice for sleeping and in a close proximity to downtown this works.
25553	19611	9.0	9.0	23643728	"We checked in late around midnight. The instructions were super detailed and we found everything with ease. It was extremely cold that night and our heater wasn't working. We ended up sleeping without the heater and coming from California, it was unbearable. We called the number provided and the lady was instructing us to locate the breaker and make sure everything is on. Well, being 3 girls, we didn't know very much about circuit breakers. We ended up turning off all lights except the bathroom and kitchen lights and had no power anywhere else. We eventually gave up and just went to sleep. Also, we didn't have parking pass in our apartment like the instructions said we would. Everything ended up getting fixed the next morning and they made it up by giving us a $20 gift card to a local bakery.

The apartment does look smaller than in pictures but the appearance of everything was on point. The kitchen is fully equipped, plenty of towels and blankets. The towels feels extremely soft! 4 toilet rolls were provided. Care package was also provided which included 2 bottles of water, 2 Perrier, some green tea packets, york chocolates, popcorn, other snacks. Location was PERFECT. Close to many restaurants and grocery stores. Couldn't ask for a better stay. "
25554	19611	9.0	9.0	23896232	I liked that they called me when they haven't heard from me. The place is easy to get to and easy to get to the parking garage. However, the suite was smaller than I expected. The curtains were of poor quality and kept falling off every time I opened the window. The bed was very comfortable, but I agree with everyone else that it gets really stuffy in there and there's no AC or ventilation. If you do open the window, expect a lot of street noise. The bathroom door is horrendous. It's just a sliding Japanese door and doesn't close all the way. If you're staying with other people, don't expect any privacy. The kitchen was well stocked. The living room is in dire need of a coffee table. Anything with a flat surface would've been great actually. They had two ottomans but you can't put anything on it without it falling over. They had these individual fold-able tray tables, but I find that cheapens the place even more. The worst part about my stay is that they had given me an expired parking pass and I ended up getting a ticket for parking in their garage. Even though it was resolved quickly, it just seems like an inconvenience of my comfort and time. 
25555	19611	9.0	9.0	28699616	The apartment is cute, clean and pleasant. Both the bed and the pull-out couch bed are large and comfortable. I really appreciated the kitchen, which has pots, pans, knives, pretty much everything you'd need to cook—but bring your own bottle opener, I couldn't find one! There were 4 of us staying here and it was perfect for us. I would say that if you're traveling with people who aren't your close friends, this apartment might be a little difficult for 4 people. It is on the small side and as other reviewers have mentioned, the sliding doors on the bedroom and bathroom really don't provide privacy. That said, we had a great time there and loved exploring the surrounding neighborhoods.
25556	19611	9.0	9.0	31867961	"A standard vacation rental in the heart of Belltown. The pictures are accurate. Close walks to Pike Market and Spaceneedle. Yummy restaurants and coffee shops all around. Its a great deal for what you pay. Even if the reviews are correct- it gets a bit stuffy in the apartment with no AC and the street noise is significant if you need to have the windows open.
Overall a very enjoyable 2 weeks in one of my favorite cities!"
25557	19611	9.0	9.0	46155706	Fantastic location in Belltown! Everything (sights, restaurants, bars, etc) is within walking distance. Great apartment for a weekend getaway. We loved the rooftop patio as well!
25558	19611	9.0	9.0	53743517	Although we never met, Darik (and Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals by extension) made us feel very welcome. The rental, however, was a different story. It's a lot smaller than the pictures let on, the cleaning crew was not done by check-in time, and there's cosmetic damage to the paint and furniture that resulted in paint chips on the floor. If this is your first time in Seattle, this location is fantastic as it's within walking distance of a lot of big downtown Seattle attractions (Pike's Place market, Space Needle, Starbucks Reserve Tasting Room, several bars, underground tour, etc.)
26662	59827	9.0	9.0	158093	"My girlfriend and I stayed at the Urban Oasis Condo the week before Christmas 2010. We chose this property from the many listed in Seattle based on the profile on AirBnB and we weren't disappointed.

First the good things:
Darik and Sally were very professional and efficient: we knew how to get to the building (although the directions were from the south and we were coming from the north), we had explicit instructions on what to do once we got there and what to do upon leaving -- all before leaving our home.
The suite was very clean, simple, comfortable, tastefully decorated and, geographically, was at the centre of things. Although we drove to do a bit of shopping, we walked for everything else. There were plenty of pubs and restaurants within walking distance (try the Sky Lounge for drinks, skip the Two Bells Tavern).
The building was clean and well kept. Although we read reviews on this site that said the area around the building wasn't safe, we certainly never felt that way no matter the time of day or night. We didn't get up on the deck while visiting; it closes at 10pm and we arrived at 10:05. Likewise, we didn't use the games room although it looked very comfortable.
The kitchen is very well stocked for the meals you're likely to prepare on your trip. We ate breakfast in the suite, prepared a few lunches and the final dinner before departure. We didn't find anything we needed that was missing from the kitchen.
The wireless Internet service was good. I did a bit of work remotely and we made several VoIP calls without any problems.

A few things that weren't as good as they could have been but weren't horrible:
My girlfriend is a light sleeper and I like to sleep with the window open. Of our four nights in the suite, she had trouble sleeping on two of them because of the noise outside (there's a firehall a few blocks away and the sirens can be loud). I'm a deep sleeper and wasn't bothered by the noise at all so, you're mileage may vary.
The bed is very firm. Again, this wasn't an issue for us, but, if you need a soft bed, this might pose a problem. Also, it's a double bed, not a queen.
The suite isn't as big as the pictures make it seem. Although it was very comfortable for two, it would, in my opinion, be cramped for three or more.

In summary, we would stay at the Urban Oasis again in a heart beat. The few negative points were minor and were far outweighed by the positive things we experienced."
26663	59827	9.0	9.0	179325	Great apartment - clean and very well maintained. Darik and Sally were both very helpful which helped to make our stay particularly pleasant. The apartment is located in a fun part of town with great restaurants and music. Highly recommended!
26664	59827	9.0	9.0	307765	The apartment was very clean and instructions (once we got into the unit) straight forward. Wifi and TV connections are a great add. We were there with our 18month old and really enjoyed it.
26665	59827	9.0	9.0	401772	Had a wonderful stay, everything you could want is here in this condo. Location is the best, walk to all attractions easily, we had a car but didn't use it once. Would recommend!!
26666	59827	9.0	9.0	667483	"Nice location to explore Seattle Downtown without a car. It is easy to walk to the waterfront, ferry terminal, Seattle center etc. The roof deck was a great place for our 2 yo to run around. That is the good part.

The place was clean when we arrived, but apparently, we never got entered as staying there in the rental agency computer. A cleaning person came in the middle of our stay to collect some sheets that were in the washing machine, and was surprised that we were there.

A number of light bulbs were out when we arrived. Calls, emails, and texts to the host were not returned. Finally, we got someone at the main rental property office and there were surprised that we were in the unit since we weren't on the calendar. The lack of attention to our stay put a damper on our stay. (One upside was that it was easier to request a  late check-out). But, based on other reviews, I'm guessing that our stay was an anomaly. 

A note for those travelling with younger children, there is no kitchen table, but a bar with high stools and some collapsible ""tv dinner"" tables that can be used with a couch.

26667	59827	9.0	9.0	1149659	Derik and the staff @ Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals are the consummate Rental agency in Seattle providing a 5 STAR quality experience in a homely yet urban atmosphere.  Communication was seamless throughout the entire experience -- at times it was concierge like .  Location was fabulous as it is virtually center stage (and walking) distance to ALL of the main Seattle attractions/shopping/nightlife.  Water front Views from this location were very nice and even better from the upper terrace.  Enjoyed the fitness room, pool, spa, interior courtyard and many more unmentionables.  Parking was indoors and secure with easy access to the elevators.  The interior was nicely appointed with everything you could ever want and need down to a lint remover and umbrellas..  They provide you with an impeccable (and most impressive) GUIDE book that literally covers everything from the location of the nearest hospital/drug/grocery stores to best recommended restaurant/attractions/entertainment by budget class.  I highly recommend the “1 Bedroom Fantastic View Oasis” experience – you will not regret it..
26668	59827	9.0	9.0	1428728	The apartment was in a great location. Very close to many great places to eat and very easy to get to most attractions (Pike Place Market, Space Needle, etc). Also, the provided parking was greatly helpful and easy to access. If I were to revisit Seattle I'd consider booking again.
26669	59827	9.0	9.0	1593023	I must say it was a good experience, and the unit was very well stocked with kitchen and incidental items. Location is very good for walking the whole downtown area. Light rail from airport was excellent and convenient to the unit. Darik provides good instruction on transportation and was accommodating on arrival arrangements. A really good alternative to a hotel as it allows your to cook and to travel light.  Washer/dryer was great.
26670	59827	9.0	9.0	1620911	"The condo was perfect. My parents and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay! It is quite close to everything- the market, the space needle, EMP, lots of shopping and fantastic restaurants. There is a very informative binder in the condo with great suggestions, too. The accommodations were excellent, clean and the building is very secure. We especially enjoyed the rooftop to hangout and enjoy a coffee or glass of wine. It was also nice to have a space to park the car in the garage since cheap downtown parking is hard to come by. 

Darik and Sarah of Seattle Oasis were very nice and the check-in and check-out process was super easy. They made us feel welcomed and comfortable during our stay and were available for any and all questions that I had. Both Darik and Sarah are true professionals and provided stellar customer service. Thank you again for such a lovely place to stay!"
26671	59827	9.0	9.0	2176455	Checking in was very easy, everything was explained thoroughly, and we had everything we needed in the condo. I called for help a few times (to change parking arrangements) and the customer service was spot on. The bed was SUPER comfy and we had plenty of bedding, Wi-Fi worked without any issues, the place was very clean, and there were more ammenities than what we used in the building. The building is closer to the convention center than I expected -- great place to stay for PAX. The only challenge is the shower -- it seems to be a bit of a puzzle to get the shower going :P
26672	59827	9.0	9.0	3232919	"The unit was immaculate and the amenities of the building were an added bonus. We loved the location, a bit of a walk to some Seattle attractions, but we took several taxis and they were very reasonably priced. 

We had a bit of trouble getting our check-in instructions...after booking and  getting a confirmation email we were told to await our check-in instructions, which never arrived. When I called to inquire, there had been a glitch in the automatic system, so they were not immediately aware of our reservation. Eventually it all got sorted out and we enjoyed our stay!"
26673	59827	9.0	9.0	50648020	Fantastic stay at Darik's apartment! We had a bunch of pain-in-the-neck requests before we arrived which Darik was super accommodating of. It really felt very full-service and communication was always quick and helpful. The apartment was exactly as described neat, clean, and stocked with everything we needed and more. My husband and I slept on the pull-out couch while our toddler took the master (I know, I know...). But it was definitely the most comfortable pull-out I have ever slept on, maybe even more comfortable than the 'real' bed! There was a nice welcome basket when we arrived which we took advantage of, and also enjoyed eating dinner on the lovely roofdeck. A wonderful first trip to Seattle. Thanks Darik!
26674	59827	9.0	9.0	56961005	Its a good place to stay. The location on the Airbnb site is off from where the actual address is. There is amazing bakery one block away run by real french people - Parisian.
31189	935671	9.0	10.0	9713401	We enjoyed the location and apartment facility's of the room we had. Our room was not like the photo's 
31190	935671	9.0	10.0	9957140	My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights. The apartment is absolutely wonderful. It fitted all 6 of us with no problem. The place was cozy and nice. It has a very nice view of the Ferris wheel and it is close to Pike Place (we went there everyday). The gym downstairs was great as well. Some of us actually used it everyday. StayAlfred was very quick at responding to any of our questions and was very helpful. 
31191	935671	9.0	10.0	10451426	"The two bedroom apartment at Harbor Steps, just blocks from the waterfront was perfect for us.  Plenty of space, a great pool for the kids to swim in, convenient to Pikes Place Market and the waterfront, and a kitchen so we could save money by eating in.  The beds were comfortable, especially the king size in the master bedroom.  The queen size sofa bed was NOT at all comfortable and only suitable for the kids.  I would not advise an adult sleeping on it. The room was very quiet (we never even heard our neighbors or those above us at any point during the weekend).  The space was clean, and the people at the front desk of Harbor Steps were helpful.  There is a small grocery store/deli on site and a Target with groceries 1.5 blocks away.

Keep in mind the the kitchen is equipped only with the basics.  If you needs any staples, spices, etc. bring them from home or plan on purchasing them.  There was a small container of sugar that was almost empty and a few sugar packets.  We wished we had brought our blender and our electric skillet for making pancakes because the frying pan provided only allowed on pancake at a time.  This is not a complaint -- just making sure guests know what to expect.  

The only negative for us was that the hot tub in the swimming pool area was out of service the entire weekend we were there.  We certainly had been looking forward to soaking while the kids swam, so that was a disappointment.  It was certainly an issue that could happen at any location, but we were disappointed that Harbor Steps did not take action to fix it more quickly.  

There were not pool towels, but there was a dryer in the unit, so it was not a problem.  Guests may want to consider brining their own pool towels from home.

We'd definitely stay there again, and would likely choose a view unit.  Reservations can be made directly through StayAlfred as well, but we could not find any two night stays through them (perhaps they have a 3 night minimum  on their site?) Even with the Airbnb reservation charge, we saved money doing it this way because we found a great Airbnb coupon to use and did not have to reserve for 3 nights.  "
31192	935671	9.0	10.0	11228688	A perfect place to live. Convenient and comfortable. We like it very much. A small suggestion to you, you are supposed to tell different guests their exact address to get the key. The general address you provided online is not accurate. We spent an hour to target it, but failed. Until 11:30p.m, we called you several times, no answered. Then called service, finally we got there. Anyway, it is really a good house. We love it.
31193	935671	9.0	10.0	11790170	It was really excellent.  Communication was great.  Everything came as promised.  Super location, and the people were very friendly.  No complaints at all!
31194	935671	9.0	10.0	16828909	We had a fantastic stay in Seattle. The apartment from Jordan was really great, centrally located and very comfortable. Jordan provided clear instructions and checking in and out was a breeze. Would definately look to stay here again on another visit.
31195	935671	9.0	10.0	17106398	"This is a great location and residence, convenient to shopping, Safeco Park, waterfront, etc.

In-room air conditioners worked well, providing cooling and white noise. Comfortable for 5 or 6 to sleep."
31196	935671	9.0	10.0	18789323	As expected. No personal touches as it's through Stay Alfreds, but the experience was exactly what we were looking for. Itself was generally well-kept and all the basics were covered.
31197	935671	9.0	10.0	24347123	Listing was accurate.  View was lovely and neighborhood was easy access to Pike's Place, dining and shopping even on Christmas Eve.  Jordan accommodated our dog at the last minute and we really loved having her with us.
31198	935671	9.0	10.0	24864431	Perfect location to enjoy downtown Seattle—walking-distance to the Art Museum, nice coffee shops, restaurants, the Pike Place Market, the Crab Pot, the aquarium, the ferry terminal... There are so many things close by we didn't have time to check out any of the amenities in the building. The apartment was very spacious. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare breakfast. The two bedrooms are comfortable and private, and having two washrooms really made getting ready to go out a lot more efficient. The balcony has a great view of the ocean and the Ferris wheel. I would definitely stay here again when I travel with my siblings and my mom, who all enjoyed our short vacation together. 
31199	935671	9.0	10.0	27456920	"I was thrilled with staying at the Harbor Steps in Seattle. We had a two-bedroom suite with a full kitchen, dining area with table/chairs, living room, and an open area outside one of the bedrooms/bathrooms. One of our bedrooms had its own bathroom with a very large closet area in which were two fold down beds.

The entire apartment was very clean (save the kitchen drawers). It was quiet, we had a great view, and it was so very, very convenient to downtown. We caught the bus easily, when necessary, but mostly just walked downtown and around the Capitol Hill area. Pike's Place Market was only a couple of blocks away, and we had more than enough restaurants to choose from - all of which were excellent. 

I cannot say enough good things about this place. I would not hesitate to stay there again at any time. The concierge was very helpful, also, which was great when we had to get to the airport."
31200	935671	9.0	10.0	29722026	The check in process was very easy. Wonderful facilities, great location, great view. If you are doing business at the conference center or symphony hall, this is so much more pleasurable than a hotel!
31201	935671	9.0	10.0	30801762	Had a great time in Seattle! This place was awesome, it's in the heart of DT Seattle, you got pikes market down the street, the art museum across the street, it was such a great location to stay at. The apartment was very nice, the complex was very well kept and clean, the concierge was very accommodating. Won't think twice about staying any where else when I'm in Seattle! 
31202	935671	9.0	10.0	31129933	Absolutely perfect location with great instructions as to obtaining keys and getting access to the unit.  Seattle is a beautiful city with so much to offer.  The beds were very comfortable with a satisfactory apartment.  Some of the amenities need attention, but everything was comfortable and felt like home for the duration.
31203	935671	9.0	10.0	32690497	"Great location, no complaints, didn't get to use the pool facilities as was in other building (2min walk away) and was too busy sight seeing. Place was clean and comfortable. Very minor mix up with car park access but was sorted straight away and was not an issue. 

I would stay here again."
31204	935671	9.0	10.0	35229199	Best place! Awesome place.. Great communication from Jordan. This place is right there in Downtown Seattle with amazing bars and coffee shops. They even have a deli that opens at 7 AM and closes at midnight .. Best place for all the action. Thanks Jordan!
31205	935671	9.0	10.0	36083286	This apartment was located in the perfect spot and we took advantage of being in such a convenient spot. Our first delight was seeing the Seattle Art Museum right across the street. Then, 3 or so blocks from Pike Place was striking gold. The three days we were there, we were able to walk to almost everywhere: the ferry, the Waterfront, the Seattle Aquarium, Chinatown/Stadiums, the monorail and more!  The condo comes with use of the great gym and indoor pool  (which were not crowded when we used). Although we did rent a car, an added plus and savings for those driving U.S. The included garage parking spot. From booking to questions, our host Jordan was very prompt in responding and the StayAlfred was very interactive in communicating with us by text, email and phone leading up to our stay. Would definitely stay there again should we plan another trip to Seattle.
31206	935671	9.0	10.0	52423729	Great location! Unit was very clean and staff was helpful! Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the downtown area. 
31207	935671	9.0	10.0	52987639	They were able to accommodate my earlier check in request, which was really helpful. The place was gorgeous- but the pictures are not what you get in this location/room. I was a little bum that I wasn't walking into this sanctuary that the pictures were giving me a vision- but nevertheless, we were able to live here comfortably for about four days. It had everything that you'll need to live like a home from the kitchen, to bathrooms, to washing machines, and most importantly, free wifi! We were so close to everything in downtown Seattle. It's a perfect spot to stay at while visiting town. 
31208	935671	9.0	10.0	53612521	"(2bd, 2ba, 6 people)
This location was perfect! Our trip to Seattle was definitely more enjoyable thanks to the apartment's central location. All amenities listed were available and the space looked better than the pictures provided. 

Jordan responded quickly to any questions I had and my encounter with the StayAlfred staff was beyond wonderful. We actually couldn't figure out how to open the door to the apartment so Amy at StayAlfred sent over the city manager to help us out. 

This apartment was quiet, secure, convenient, and cozy. I would definitely stay here again. "
31209	935671	9.0	10.0	54008093	great location.  great unit.  easy to check in and out.  parking is a little tight and can be a challenge but manageable.  the concierge was very helpful.  our garage card was not working.  I called twice to get a replacement but they were not able to get in a replacement over the weekend.  it was not a big deal to us but it was more confusing and annoying to the parking attendant getting us out of the garage.  i will definitely stay here again. 
31210	935671	9.0	10.0	55224714	It is a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery nice place to stay during our 3-day visit in Seattle. Thank you. You make my stay in Seattle so warm and unforgettable!

The neighborhood can't be better, we walked pretty much everywhere and didn't need a car nor taxi. We love to come back and visit again. Thank you.
"
32023	3592838	9.0	10.0	17586287	Great place, amazing view. Easy to meet up and manage logistics with Tony. Neighborhood is super convenient. Would stay again! Thanks Tony.

Tony has a spacious one-bedroom apartment on a high floor, with ‘helicopter views’ of the Seattle harbor.  The apartment, with its private balcony and a stone shower, is in top-notch condition.  The indoor garage in the same building is a huge convenience. Easy walk to everywhere.

Tony is a gentleman and a very nice person.  My wife and I had a fabulous stay.
"
32025	3592838	9.0	10.0	17872265	This is a great apartment with stunning views of Seattle and the waterfront.  It is a nice building, reasonably quiet (since it is on the 19th floor), and has easy access and parking.  The location is perfect, easy walking to downtown, Pike Street and the Space Needle.  We loved the place and would be delighted to stay there again.  Tony was a great host and very responsive, although there was nothing  major that we needed.  The apartment is clean, spacious, comfortable furnishings and has everything you need for a great stay in Seattle.
32026	3592838	9.0	10.0	18077704	"Tony was awesome!! He was at the apartment when we arrived and let us in. The location couldn't be better and the apartment itself is absolutely amazing! Having breakfast and watching the sunset over the water was a perfect added bonus to the trip.
We walked everywhere! The apartment is literally between the space needle and pike's place market!"
32027	3592838	9.0	10.0	18199316	We had a great stay at Tony's apartment. The location is hard to beat, just a few minutes walk to Pike Place, Belltown restaurants and cafés along 1st Ave. The view from his cosy 19th floor apartment is incredible. The unit is clean, modern, comfortable and the building has a BBQ on the 7th floor with a pool, hot tub and basic gym. Tony was responsive to one request we had (there were no plates in the kitchen, so he went out and bought some and dropped them over to us) and generally made the stay there easy and stress free. I'd definitely recommend it! 
32028	3592838	9.0	10.0	18340074	"Tony is a great host and his place is amazing. My friend that lives in Seattle thought it was the best view of the city and sound that he's seen so far. Clean apartment with everything you need.
I would definitely recommend (especially since most nearby hotels were more expensive)."
32029	3592838	9.0	10.0	18454315	Tony was flexible with my arrival time.  The view is as good as the other reviewers say it is.  The apartment is very comfortable.
32030	3592838	9.0	10.0	18560223	Great view and apartment, Tony very helpful, no aircon though, can be a bit loud at night from street below with windows open.
32031	3592838	9.0	10.0	18668274	The apartment itself is wonderful, and the location is perfect. Tony was very nice and hospitable. He checked if we need any help and provided a lot of info for the restaurants and stores. We had a wonderful time!
32032	3592838	9.0	10.0	18816404	Tony was friendly and responsive.  Having lived in Seattle for many years, I can say the location and view are outstanding.  Having access to parking is very helpful for downtown.  Hope to return another time - thanks Tony.
32033	3592838	9.0	10.0	18926369	Tony's place was wonderful and the view was spectacular as advertised. I felt awful I didn't get to town until super late but Tony was extremely gracious. I recommend his place highly.
32034	3592838	9.0	10.0	18975594	Tony's place was great - views were as advertised, interior very comfortable and nice.  Central location with lots of good restaurants and access.  Tony was a welcoming and responsive host.  Thank you for a great visit.  
32035	3592838	9.0	10.0	19037988	Great host, wonderful location, spectacular views of the city and waterfront. Amazing upscale amenities & lots of privacy.  Within walking distance to Pike Place Market, Century Link, Safeco Field and many restaurants and coffee shops in Belltown.  By far, the best place we've stayed in Seattle for years!
32036	3592838	9.0	10.0	19298841	Tony was very kind and his apartment is really awesome. I had a great time with this place.The view of this apartment was so much better than the picture that I saw online.  I strongly recommend this place to travel Seattle!
32037	3592838	9.0	10.0	19471917	Tony was very responsive and extremely pleasant. He went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and that our stay was perfect. I was skeptical that the photos might have exaggerated the view from the actual unit, but it turns out that that are completely accurate; you can easily see downtown, the space needle, and the sound while sitting on the balcony. It really is breathtaking. The neighborhood has many fantastic places such as Bedlam Coffee and Bathtub Gin Company. I've already recommended this property to other friends who will be visiting Seattle soon.
32038	3592838	9.0	10.0	19581647	Breath taking views of Seattle, I could smell the ocean from the balcony. Great location. A short walk to Pikes Place Market. Tons of bars and restaurants near by. Very clean condo. I would stay there again. Very little interaction with the host, but that was okay with us.
32039	3592838	9.0	10.0	19879944	"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Tony's place.  The view is spectacular and the location couldn't have been better.  The condo is very clean and comfortable.  Tony is extremely responsive and accommodating to our requests.

The neighborhood is nice and relatively quiet with many interesting restaurants - my favorite is List on 1st Ave, about 3 minutes' walk from the condo.  We walked or took the public transportation during the entire stay.  There is a small grocery store conveniently located at the corner.  The building has a swimming pool at the 7th floor so don't forget your gear."
32040	3592838	9.0	10.0	20042336	Tony was also very accessible and responsive via phone for any questions we had and was there to greet us upon arrival and walk us through the building and unit. The unit was just as pictured and the view from the balcony is not to be missed.
32041	3592838	9.0	10.0	20169836	Great apartment with amazing views.  Easy walk to everything.  Tony accommodated a late arrival time and was there to walk me through the space.  Would rent again.
32042	3592838	9.0	10.0	20289308	"Tony's place is terrific.  The view is spectacular, and the location is perfect.  And on top of all that, it has a secured parking space for those of you that need a car, which I did.  Yes you can walk to just about everything in the downtown area or take public transportation to destinations in the city, but I needed to visit a few places outside of Seattle proper.  Parking on the streets is expensive and challenging at times, so that parking space was golden.  

The condo was clean, and Tony is as interactive as you need him to be.  I would definitely recommend Best View In Seattle to anyone planning a visit to Seattle.  The unit is perfect for a couple, but you can also sleep two more people on the couch, although not as comfortably as the bed."
32043	3592838	9.0	10.0	20434688	everything went well - amazing view! easy to walk around downtown or to the space needle from this location. tony was great!
32044	3592838	9.0	10.0	20622100	Listing was as described.  Incredible views.  Disclaimer needs to be made regarding park spot, very tight fit.  We often stay in Belltown at the Ace, but decided to try ABNB for a change.  Tony was pleasant, although my significant other was apprehensive at first...
32045	3592838	9.0	10.0	20760648	Tony's place was amazing. The views were incredible and the location is ideal. Walking distance to cool restaurants and bars, Pike Place and the Space Needle/ Seattle Center. The shower was great and the heated bathroom floors was a nice plus. Tony was very kind and flexible with check in and check out. He even built our portable crib for us, which really helped us out and was beyond expectations. I would highly recommend this unit for a visit to Seattle.
32046	3592838	9.0	10.0	20835297	Our stay at Tony's unit was amazing!  The view has got to be one of the best in Seattle!  The space was incredibly clean and convenient to local restaurants/bars/coffee shops (literally right out the door) and Pike's market (about a 8 minute walk).  The balcony view allowed you to easily see the Space Needle, downtown and the harbor.  Sitting on the balcony watching the boats come in/out was a huge highlight.  We arrived earlier than planned and Tony was super accommodating to meet up early.  I can not recommend this place enough!  Our favorite AirBnB experience yet!
32047	3592838	9.0	10.0	20935840	Well, the description is entirely correct. It IS the best view in Seattle. The place is great and close to Pike Place. Walk to everything. Tony is great and low stress. A great value.
32048	3592838	9.0	10.0	21126498	"Tony was ready and waiting when I arrived.  Much appreciated! He was friendly and informative which also helps in a new location/ neighborhood. But it is really the view which moves this place to the top of the list.  I have visited Seattle before and stayed via Airbnb.  This time I spent a little more and got so much extra.  Didn't want to leave the apartment but there is a lot ""happening"" close by and so convenient.  Definitely recommend Tony's place."
32049	3592838	9.0	10.0	21201173	A+++
32050	3592838	9.0	10.0	21434917	My recent visit went very well - Tony was in touch with me throughout the stay and the place was very clean. Beautiful view and great coffee nearby. Highly recommended.
32051	3592838	9.0	10.0	21518372	Awesome views, great location within walking distance of all the best Seattle has to offer. Private parking space was a plus and the condo was tidy. The only downside was there was no hand soap or toilet paper... Luckily there was a grocery store next door! Lastly, Tony was accommodating when we showed up early.
32052	3592838	9.0	10.0	21647956	"The condo was as described - wonderful views, great location in proximity to everything, safe, clean and beautiful! Tony was extremely easy to work with, responsive to text, dependable, etc.  It was my first time renting through AirBnB and it was overall a terrific experience. I would rent this condo again!
"
32053	3592838	9.0	10.0	21885729	"Belltown Seattle is a great area for food, drinks, and shopping. The place was a great spot for a weekend in the city. The views are amazing and it is close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. 

Heated floors in the bathroom were nice!"
32054	3592838	9.0	10.0	22094095	Luxury condo, best view, communicative host. This was one of the nicest condos I've ever stayed in, if not THE nicest. I definitely got to enjoy the luxury of the city from the 180 degree view through the floor to ceiling windows. I could walk out on my balcony and see everything across the ocean all the way to the Space Needle. Beautiful! I would stay again and definitely recommend to all.
32055	3592838	9.0	10.0	22256852	"Tony's condo is beautiful.  It's exactly as described, view is awesome, location is perfect as far as main tourist attractions.  My son and I felt comfortable in this condo, it's upscale yet cozy.  The sofa was sooo comfortable and fun, you will find why out when you rent the place yourself.        Tony was very sweet, he met with us to show the place and make sure we understood how to
get in and around the complex.   
I would suggest more cookware to go with the gourmet kitchen ;) good job Tony we will visit again ;)"
32056	3592838	9.0	10.0	22475078	Excellent host and a fantastic place to stay while visiting Seattle.  The place is truly in an ideal location.  There are tons of great bars and restaurants within walking distance, the Pike Place market is only about 1/3 of a mile walk and there is a CrossFit gym right on the same block which was a plus for me.  Tony was very accommodating and getting into and out of the place was a breeze.  I will definitely be staying here again!
32057	3592838	9.0	10.0	22526609	Tony was great! No problem checking in at all.
32058	3592838	9.0	10.0	22842972	The view was amazing as stated.  The place was a great place to stay, very clean, with short walks to anything you could imagine.  After that a quick cab ride.  Tony was a great host and very responsive.  Having a parking spot was awesome as well.  
32059	3592838	9.0	10.0	23084647	This condo exceeded my expectations. The view was great, the location was perfect and the listing had everything I needed. Tony was flexible with my checkin, and walked me through everything I needed to know. The condo is in a good part of belltown, but walking distance to everything downtown, or a cheap cab ride. The view overlooks the best parts of Seattle. I even had a chance to use the hot tub and sauna. The parking was great, especially because downtown Seattle is very expensive. Looking forward to staying here again. 
32060	3592838	9.0	10.0	23234510	"""Best View in Seattle"" did not disappoint!  The views are spectacular! The master bed was very comfortable.  What a treat to wake up to such an amazing view!
Kitchen looked fun, but with such a short stay we opted to try different restaurants.  We followed one review suggesting ""List"", a few blocks away.  Great suggestion.  We also enjoyed happy hour at ""Rob Roy"", also local.  For breakfast it was Sound Foods Cafe in Pike Place Market's lower level.
Tony was prompt with initial contact and meeting us.  The parking spot was a HUGE bonus!  
We love visiting our old hometown and plan to rent Tony's condo for numerous  future visits!"
32061	3592838	9.0	10.0	23259454	Beautiful view, clean condo, comfortable bed and Tony was very friendly and accommodating to my later than expected arrival time.  He also gave good advice on places to go and our car was safely parked off the street in a parking garage in the building.  Overall,  everything was perfect and I'd stay again!  Thanks Tony.
32062	3592838	9.0	10.0	23335351	OH MY GOODNESS--the views!  the pictures don't even do it justice!  We were so cozy in the unit and loved drinking water looking at the space needle, the bay, the mountain range in the distance, the skyline...  i took as many pictures from the balcony as I did just walking around Seattle!  It was such a special experience, thanks Tony!
32063	3592838	9.0	10.0	23605763	We stayed at Tony's place for 2 nights. It was exactly as shown in the pictures - great view, large space, nice decorations. The location was really convenient for ppl who wanted to explore Seattle. There was a hiccup in check-in but we did appreciate Tony's effort.  
32064	3592838	9.0	10.0	23818490	"Tony's place was as pictured, with amazing views of the city and water. The bed was super comfortable and we enjoyed using the building's communal pool and hot tub.
Due to an emergency with one of Tony's co-workers we had to check in a couple of hours later than planned but he was very apologetic and offered a full refund if we chose not to wait.
Overall we would definitely stay here again! It's a great location in downtown Seattle, just a short walk away from Pike Place Market and great restaurants, shops and sights."
32065	3592838	9.0	10.0	23943783	"Check in was easy and Tony was waiting for us when we arrived. The condo has the best location. It is close to everything! You really don't need a car, if your feeling lazy, uber it anywhere for a few bucks.

The reviews are spot on in terms of location and views. The views really are amazing! better then the photos."
32066	3592838	9.0	10.0	24836501	"Despite being out of town himself on our day of arrival, Tony had put plans in place to make our access to the apartment stress free and uncomplicated. Everything went to plan and he stayed in touch by e mail to make sure everything was ok. He let us know as soon as he was back in town and was available to give advice re daytrips and eating out. The apartment was in the BEST location with almost everything on our 'bucket list' within walking distance and lots of restaurants, bars and coffee shops nearby. There is a grocery store on 3rd Ave on the next block but it is quite expensive. We did hire a car for a few days and the parking space was a great bonus during that time. We hired from SIXT on 2nd Ave which was easy for pick up and drop off with good service and NO pressure to buy 'extras' As everyone else has said previously, the views from the apartment are priceless. The various forms of transport on the water, sky and even on the road provided constant entertainment, better than TV at times! We also benefitted from a spectacular view of the Space Needle at midnight at New Year lighting up with fireworks in addition to all the activity on the rooftops, streets and water below, it made an New Year to remember. The apartment was very spacious. I had been a bit concerned about storage for all our bags as we have seldom taken so much stuff on holiday (ski gear and winter woollies). These concerns were allayed and the cupboards easily absorbed all our stuff. The bathroom is gorgeous, under floor heating, beautifully tiled, spacious shower cabinet with a nice little seat. The kitchen is spacious and has great storage. The washer/dryer was a bonus during our 8 day stay. the lounge was also spacious with a VERY comfortable reclining sofa which seats 2 (the middle 'seat' is a storage compartment). There is an additional office chair and kitchen chairs. My 15 year old son opted to sleep on the fold down chair as he prefers to have a completely flat bed and not sleep on a 'leather' covered surface. He was quite happy on this for 8 nights. Sleeping on the reclining sofa would also be possible for those who prefer. The double bed was very comfortable. The highlights of our trip were:- THE SPACE NEEDLE (very nice lunch - was a bit expensive but not too bad when you consider that it includes access to the top which would cost $20pp itself, so deduct this from your food bill. Try the ice cream it is a special experience). To give you an idea of how good it is - my IT addicted son was rather disparaging about another young man who did nothing but play on his game boy. ""how can he just look at a game with views like this out of the window!!"" he exclaimed...."
32067	3592838	9.0	10.0	26107265	"Tony was a great host and the apartment is actually even better than described. It's hard for the pictures to do justice to the view, it really is spectacular. 

Well situated in Belltown, so the area is 'lively' around the apartment but always very safe in my experience. Very walkable for restaurants, bars and most of the popular tourist spots. 

Tony was on hand to meet me on arrival and responded very quickly to a couple of queries I had. 

An unreserved recommendation. "
32068	3592838	9.0	10.0	26189503	"Tony was a great host. He was there to greet us and show us around. His Condo was very comfortable. The view was spectacular...We would love to own a place like his...until then. We will return and enjoy his diggs...BTW the free parking  was a great score!!!

Thank you for everything Tony!"
32069	3592838	9.0	10.0	26296471	This location is excellent. It's in an area of Seattle that I've stayed in many times and that I know well. The location is very convenient to the local downtown sites. The view is great.  
32070	3592838	9.0	10.0	26369000	Tony was great. He was easy to reach and very flexible with check in and check out. The apartment was clean and cozy and the views were amazing. Highly recommend this apartment for your next trip to Seattle. 
32071	3592838	9.0	10.0	26526612	What a great apartment!! The cleaners were running a little late the day we got into town so we had to wait around a while before getting in. Tony was very apologetic and said we could have a late check out to make up for it. He was friendly and met us at the building to show us around, give us the keys and the garage opener. The neighborhood is centrally located and within walking distance to lots of restaurants and tourist sites. Having a designated parking spot in the building was a life saver!! I would recommend getting an economy sized car because the spot is fairly small and could be difficult or impossible to fit a large car our SUV. The inside of the apartment is totally updated! The heated floors were a nice touch. You can't say enough about the views. The pictures don't do it any justice!! We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to this amazing city.
32072	3592838	9.0	10.0	26815789	A great apartment, location AND car space in Seattle... Need I say more? Tony was easy to deal with and the reservation went without complication.
32073	3592838	9.0	10.0	26898506	great view and perfect location. ideal for walking to all the sites in downtown. the apt is clean and modern. very good communication with Tony. Will definitely recommend this place.
32074	3592838	9.0	10.0	27031384	Tony was very responsive to our inquiries.  The unit was very accurately described in the listing; there were no surprises.  The location (especially the view) is WONDERFUL.  We will be renting this unit from Tony on our next visit to Seattle.
32075	3592838	9.0	10.0	27084140	This is a really fantastic unit. The views are wonderful, over the Sound, the Space Needle, the Cascade Mountains in the distance. The bed is comfortable, the place is clean and furnished with everything we could have needed. Our host was generous with his knowledge and availability while not being remotely intrusive. A really great overall experience.
32076	3592838	9.0	10.0	27147388	"Tony's place was great. Nice finish and beautiful views - just like the photos.

It is walking distance to a bunch of cool bars and cafes. Great condo in a great neighborhood."
32077	3592838	9.0	10.0	27444531	I had a great time staying at Tony's condo in the Belltown area. The rooms were just as shown in the pictures and the view was amazing.  It is also really convenient to have your own parking spot in the middle of the city. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for something a little more fancy.
32078	3592838	9.0	10.0	27477549	"This was my first airbnb experience and it was truly amazing! For starters Tony was great with communication. He is personable and prompt. 
The apartment was perfect! It was clean and spacious. Morning, Noon or night, the views are hands down breathtaking. A nice touch was the heated floor in the bathroom. 
The walkability of the apartment was spot on. We could skip down to Pike's Place and a great doughnut shop is two blocks up. 
Lastly, FREE parking was an added bonus that in the great city of Seattle. 
If you want something more than what a hotel can offer I highly recommend this location and listing. "
32079	3592838	9.0	10.0	27490506	Tony's place was the perfect getaway for my girlfriend and I for a weekend in Seattle. I called Tony the day we arrived in town to make arrangements to meet him at the condo. He responded to all enquiries promptly and met us at the agreed upon time. The apartment was great and the view was as advertised. I think the photos I took are even better than what is shown on the site. It's about 10 min walking distance to Pike Place Market. I also liked that a parking stall came with the rental. Saved a lot of hassle trying to park downtown. Would definitely recommend this condo if you want to be central in Seattle.
32080	3592838	9.0	10.0	27673896	Experience was great! Tony came by and gave us the key and always responded quickly if we had a question. Home was beautiful and the view is breathe taking! Would definitely stay here again! 
32081	3592838	9.0	10.0	27764039	We had a great stay in Seattle and Tony's condo made it that much more special.  It's in a great downtown location within easy walking distance of many attractions and dining options.  The view from the 19th floor is hard to beat!  Everything went well and we look forward to staying here again some day in the future.
32082	3592838	9.0	10.0	27868948	Gorgeous views, comfortable condo in the heart of Belltown - easy to drive or walk anywhere.  Great spot, I'll be back!
32083	3592838	9.0	10.0	27976594	Between the location and the free parking spot, this spot is ideal for easily exploring all that Seattle has to offer. Within easy walking distance of a multitude of attractions, including excellent bars and restaurants. The true highlight of this Air BnB is the view: rain or shine, balcony or bedroom, the panoramic sweep of city & sound is truly magnificent.
32084	3592838	9.0	10.0	28097926	Tony was great! Communication was seamless, Tony was at the apartment with the keys ready for our arrival. Upon arrival, Tony had the place already cleaned and provided clear instructions as to how to go about parking and leaving the apartment. The apartment was absolutely gorgeous! Just like in the photos, the place is modern and the views are incredible! Thanks to Tony, our trip to Seattle was amazing! I highly recommend Tony and his apartment!
32085	3592838	9.0	10.0	28381114	Great view and close to alot of things like bars and restaurants.
32086	3592838	9.0	10.0	28475842	Nice place. Unfortunately the host's work schedule prevented us from utilizing the benefit of the units parking. Check in was delayed til almost 6pm. We understand this was unlucky with a mix of seattle rush hour.  Great views. Cool pad. 
32087	3592838	9.0	10.0	28549610	"The views were amazing and the location was perfect!  Will definitely try to stay here every time we're in Seattle.  Parking spot in the building is a great perk, even though it's easy to walk everywhere from the condo.

Tony was super accommodating, even though our schedule kept changing.  He was easygoing and helpful, and made our stay very comfortable and relaxing.  Great apartment and host!

32088	3592838	9.0	10.0	28591771	"Tony was great, and the apartment was incredible!

Gorgeous views, excellent location, and amazing price.  We had a bunch of scheduling problems and Tony was super flexible and accommodating.  Will stay there again every time I visit Seattle if possible!"
32089	3592838	9.0	10.0	28697433	The apartment was perfect - very well stocked, beautiful view, clean, comfortable, and convenient. Tony went out of his way to get us in a little earlier than planned. Will stay here again and recommend my friends here as well.
32090	3592838	9.0	10.0	28834068	Tony was great to work with. He was very responsive and communicated thoroughly with us. Tony made our first experience with Airbnb a very positive one. The apartment was more beautiful than pictures can do justice, very well kept up, and had all of the amenities you could need. The only way the building could be better located is if it was attached to the Pike St market itself. We decided not to rent a car for our stay in Seattle and are so glad, because we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. 
32091	3592838	9.0	10.0	29037696	"Place was just as described. Beautiful views, walkable to so many great places, and spacious. 

Would definitely stay here again if and when we find ourself back in Seattle."
32092	3592838	9.0	10.0	29970806	Great apartment and an example of why airbnb works so well
32093	3592838	9.0	10.0	30116071	Stay here. This is what you are looking for. I am sure.
32094	3592838	9.0	10.0	30193022	Tony is fine host - a bit late letting us in, but all was in order. Please was AS advertised and at least half the pleasure there is the view. Location is IDEAL for DT Seattle and for those willing to pay this price it is worth it to have lovely kitchen, bath, bedroom, etc.  Better for TWO than three......futon not great.
32095	3592838	9.0	10.0	30989381	"The apartment was great, the most amazing views ever! It's really nice, comfortable and clean, and in a great location too.

Tony is the best host ever, he's very helpful and responsive, he even drove over late at night in order to replace the batter of the fire alarm, which was beeping. He very well deserves his Superhost status."
32096	3592838	9.0	10.0	31546010	The apartment is absolutely beautiful and in a perfect location. Tony was very accommodating. I definitely recommend this apartment and host!
32097	3592838	9.0	10.0	31693332	Awesome views, just as pictured!  Great place to take in gorgeous views of the city with lots of places to eat and things to do within walking distance.
32098	3592838	9.0	10.0	32392868	Great view of water. Fun urban area of Seattle. Tony was very accommodating for key pickup. 
32099	3592838	9.0	10.0	32529907	Great place! Tony made himself available if needed and was accommodating in meeting us to check in.  Fantastic location, clean place, great coffee shop around the corner (Bedlam Coffee), minutes from everywhere.  Having a parking space is clutch, as public parking costs a fortune downtown.
32100	3592838	9.0	10.0	32776359	"The apartment was very comfortable!  The panoramic view was amazing!  We loved staying here and would love to come here again.  We appreciated the quiet surroundings and were very relaxed.

Walking distance to many great restaurants and shopping. "
32101	3592838	9.0	10.0	33065439	Tony's apartment is wonderful! It is in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. There are many restaurants and shops nearby, and Pike's Place Market is a short 5-10 minute walk away. It is centrally located so we were able to walk almost everywhere. The views from the private balcony are truly magical. Overall, a great apartment in a perfect location.
32102	3592838	9.0	10.0	34110445	Great apartment with amazing views and location. The place was very clean and comfortable. I really appreciate how accommodating the host was with my late check in time.
32103	3592838	9.0	10.0	34170977	If you can stay here, do so!  I can't imagine you'd have any regrets.  Well equipped, bright, and everything to love. The views, the location, and really everything made it first rate.  It was especially helpful  as we had only short time in Seattle and wanted to make the most of a great location. We discovered that the best way to contact the host prior arrival is via text message/ SMS.   
32104	3592838	9.0	10.0	34279786	Tony provided a super easy care-free stay for us. From check-in to check-out the whole process was quick and simple. The apartment is so amazing, and as others have said you can't beat those views! We loved having coffee on the porch everyday during our stay. Don't hesitate to stay here, such a great experience!
32105	3592838	9.0	10.0	35085515	Host was on time and helpful via texts with prompt response on a few items.
32106	3592838	9.0	10.0	36180641	The apartment was clean and the furniture was comfortable.  The views from the balcony are some of the best in the city.  Tony was very easy to communicate with and made us feel welcome.  The building's security features made my wife feel safe. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying at Tony's place.
32107	3592838	9.0	10.0	37893548	Tony was easy to contact and responded quickly to messages. The view from the suite is spectacular and the building secure. The free parking made access really easy. A perfect place to explore Seattle.  The apartment is lovely-spacious, and modern with lovely bathroom and kitchen. 
32108	3592838	9.0	10.0	38252633	"This was my first experience of booking through Airbnb and it couldn't have been a better introduction

Tony was an excellent host and great at replying to messages. We were able to keep in touch initially by email and then mobile when we arrived in the city. He was very helpful and flexible about check in and check out times, working around the other guests

As far as the apartment goes, the word VIEWS says it all. Stunning views of Puget Sound, Seattle Center including the Space Needle and downtown. The photos tell the story. The apartment has full cooking facilities and a comfortable double bed, perfect if you would like to self cater though there are so many great eating and watering holes nearby

We also loved the swimming pool and hot tub on the 7th floor. A free parking space was available for our use though we didn't need it

And the best thing is the price is cheaper than nearby fancy hotels which offer much less for your buck"
32109	3592838	9.0	10.0	38716409	We arrived in Seattle 2 hours later than expected due to accidents on the highway. Tony was very accommodating and ready to welcome us when we finally rolled into town! The apartment was easy to find. It is on the corner of 2nd and Blanchard so approach it from 1st/Blanchard and park - temporarily - anywhere close enough so you can check in and get access to the secure parking and secure building. The apartment is very clean, modern, comfortable, within walking distance to all major attractions, and has everything you'd need. We were a party of 3 and found the sleeping arrangements comfortable with plenty of space to relax in and enjoy the view. Yes, the view is a breathtaking 19th floor vista overlooking the water. If you are looking to cook your own food the apartment has everything you'll need. Coffee, tea, basics are in the apartment so use one/leave one is a great strategy! Alternatively, you are in Seattle and it would be a shame not to enjoy the many restaurants you can find within walking distance. Thank you Tony! We will return!
32110	3592838	9.0	10.0	39143967	Anton was a great host, and the apartment was excellent. The views really have to be seen in person - they're better even than the photos. Everything was clean, the location was great and the bed comfortable. I would stay here again.
32111	3592838	9.0	10.0	42244287	"We enthusiastically endorse Anton and his apartment, and would be happy to have the opportunity to use this Airbnb site in the future!
Anton made it easy for us to enter and use the place.  It was well represented - and had all the great features that it advertised.  The 19th floor gave a spectacular view, and being on a high floor wasn't a bother because the two elevators were speedy. The location was good for folks like us who like to wander on foot, which we did. The Market, the space needle, even Chinatown were easily reached by foot.  The place was clean and neat, and arranged so that we could (and did) have guests join us for meals without feeling crowded. A big plus for us was that the bed was comfortable! An extra we hadn't counted on was having a trash/garbage chute handy.  Plenty of dishes, glasses and cookware. All we missed having was a can opener and a cutting board.
Great place - great location - and we will visit again when possible! 

One other thing - the hot tub and heated pool on the 7th floor was a great addition.  We used it daily and had it to ourselves each day during our two week stay!"
32112	3592838	9.0	10.0	42505490	The unit was as described in the listing. Great views and location!  Just a little hot this mid-August with higher than normal temps without air conditioning.  
32113	3592838	9.0	10.0	43033120	Neighborhood right in the center of Belltown and the view was perfect. Condo setting gave less of a tourist feel while visiting and a few of our favorite restaurants were in walking distance.  Anton was very communicative throughout the process and a superb host. 
32114	3592838	9.0	10.0	43374266	The view was great as was the location. Was not impressed at all with the condo cleanliness. Toni seemed distracted when we met him and getting information from him was scant although he was better via text.
32115	3592838	9.0	10.0	43600122	Nice place, just as described. Easy walking to wherever you want to go and to transportation. 
32116	3592838	9.0	10.0	43751044	Apartment is situated close to the city with great views.  Really a two persons accommodation (we had 3 adults)
32117	3592838	9.0	10.0	44762286	"I booked this with the understsnding as stated in the ad that it was 1 bedroom and 2 beds and slept 3. Not true as there is only 1 doubke bed and a futon that does not lie flat and a lounge that does not pull out flat.Our adult daughter had to sleep on floor.Not good and this unit is only suitable for 2,so do not beleive the ad.Also their was no electric kettle or toaster,so had to boil water in a saucepan. And no wine glasses to enjoy a wine with tge view,sorry but the onky thing good is the view and location.
"
32118	3592838	9.0	10.0	45653293	The place was very nice and we felt welcome.  The apartment was in a good location and the views are magnificent.  
32119	3592838	9.0	10.0	45935589	Nice clean place with an amazing view of the water and space needle. Host was very informative. Balcony has chairs and a table to hang out. Fast WiFi. We didn't cook, but it looks like the apartment has all the necessary kitchenware.
32120	3592838	9.0	10.0	46463948	Anton was a great host, very attentive, very helpful. The apartment was very neat and tidy and had all the amenities we needed. Fantastic views and a good location being about 10 minutes walk to Pike Market and the other nice shopping areas.
32121	3592838	9.0	10.0	46869869	We really had a great trip, and the views were spectacular. The apartment was pretty comfortable. The check in process was really easy, and Anton was very flexible with check in and check out times. The parking spot was a great bonus, and the garage seemed very secure and safe. I loved the location because it was a five minute walk to Pike's Place Market, and is surrounded by many wonderful restaurants. We walked everywhere and enjoyed our time in Seattle. We would come back.
32122	3592838	9.0	10.0	47632124	Crazy beautiful location, view and apartment!!
32123	3592838	9.0	10.0	48163987	"Awesome location, unbelievable view.  Anton met me at the place, gave me the keys, explained how parking worked quickly and painlessly.  The appliances and furnishings all worked as expected, nothing broken or damaged.

What sets this place apart is the views of the sound.  They are spectacular.  Would definitely rent again if I went back to Seattle."
32124	3592838	9.0	10.0	48676104	This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was wonderful!  Tony was a gracious host who provided everything we needed for a great trip.  He met us as a prearranged time and had everything ready to go.  The apartment was perfect for our needs - spacious and with an outside balcony that gave us a fantastic view of the water and surrounding islands.  We watched a couple of incredible sunsets from it!  The location was perfect for us as well-close to great restaurants and within walking distance of the waterfront, Space Needle and shopping venues.  Overall, a great experience! 
32125	3592838	9.0	10.0	50159913	"Stayed for a week early October 2015. Pro's: Anton helped to make our arrival easier by texting me instructions; but, he should've been THERE AT THE UNIT to facilitate our access ! The views from the unit were good. Con's: The small, 1 bedroom condo was FILTHY! It took our entire first day there to clean the slimy cabinets, microwave, sink, washer/dryer, fridge, (visible residue was on all cabinet doors, drawers, and handles) etc.... there was rotting produce left in the fridge along with 7 or 8 other old food items that should've been cleaned/removed; the food residue throughout the fridge had obviously been there for months! One of the things you'd expect from an airbnb place is the ease and convenience of a functional kitchen.....NOT HERE! There was no coffee maker and no toaster; no coffee and bagels for us! We couldn't even cook breakfast due to lack sufficient of utensils and pots and pans! ""Oh well, we'll have to go out for breakfast just as if we had stayed in a hotel; at least hotels have room service"". The toaster we bought was worth the $12, along with the coffee cone and filters ($8), the pillows ($15) and the cleaning supplies (bleach, soap, Lysol, wipes etc... $30). Well worth it considering we were living there for 1 week. Sorry future guests; we DIDN'T leave any of those things behind! We gave all those items to the homeless people directly outside the building (We didn't want Anton to get the credit for a functioning kitchen and nice, new pillows). The floors were completely covered with dirt and cat hairs; we had to mop the floors twice to get the animal hairs down to a manageable level. There is a large music venue DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE BUILDING (The Crocodile Club) with VERY LOUD acts every night! It's OK unless you like to go to sleep before 2:30 AM. The small full size spring mattress was dirty and ancient; it hadn't been rotated for years, if ever; very worn and extremely uncomfortable! Pillows were old and nasty, we bought our own pillows along with all the cleaning supplies we HAD to use! I'm envious of the tenants following us; that place has NEVER been as clean as we left it! The sliding glass door leading out to the balcony didn't have a handle on it; instead there was a crude, strap tied through the holes! It broke our 2nd day there. No screens on the windows; but the bugs were an added source of protein! Only 1 of 4 lights working in the tiny bathroom, but the fire from the candles we had to use wasn't too serious! The washer/dryer all-in-one unit was weird; it took 3 to 4 hours to wash and dry a small load of laundry; stuff smelled better going in than coming out! Please spend the extra $$$ to avoid this uncomfortable, old and unkempt unit from ruining your stay of more than 1 or 2..."
32126	3592838	9.0	10.0	51885501	Neighborhood was a bit sketchy but ok. The unit had fabulous views.
32127	3592838	9.0	10.0	52473110	Anton worked with me on my late arrival into Seattle and greeted me at the property to provide me with the keys to the unit and a quick walk-through.  The unit was easy to find and well situated in downtown Seattle.  The view is great and is represented well in the pictures.  The unit was clean.  The best part is the balcony.  Too bad I didn't have more time to enjoy it.
32128	3592838	9.0	10.0	53035505	Great apt with a great view of Peugeot Sound as well as downtown Seattle. Anton was reliable and professional, very convenient parking situation as well. All pictures are very accurate. Exceptional value here; would have spent twice as much for a similar space at a local hotel. Essentially unbeatable at this price.
32129	3592838	9.0	10.0	53587510	Anton was very responsive, helpful, and communicative.  He got me setup in the apartment quickly - the check-in and check-out process was a breeze.  I had a great time staying in this apartment... it really does have a fantastic view and location.  The space is comfortable and luxurious, especially the kitchen and bathroom.  I'd certainly stay again on another trip to Seattle.
32130	3592838	9.0	10.0	54013468	"The place was exactly as described and truly ""Unbeatable Location"". My Wife and I absolutely loved the views, nearby restaurants, bars, and overall proximity to everything. We basically walked everywhere (Pike's, Space Needle, Downtown, ETC) or grabbed an Uber once or twice. Anton was super easy to communicate with and even checked us in late due to our delayed flight in. Overall awesome experience and can't beat it if looking to be right in the middle of everything Seattle has to offer.  "
32131	3592838	9.0	10.0	55634668	Great stay, excellent location and beautiful view. Exactly what you should expect from listing.
32132	3592838	9.0	10.0	56325587	Anton was great, and very helpful, the place was clean, and overall it was a great experience. Would definitely stay here again!
32133	3592838	9.0	10.0	56412055	The apartment was clean and as pictured with awesome views. Location was great and near lots of shopping, sight seeing places, and restaurants (walking distance in Seattle is a plus). I didn't get to meet Anton but we communicated via text and directions were clear and easy to follow on how to get in and out of the apt. The apartment had floor based radiant heat and somehow it just felt a bit too cold for me and I did't know how to fix it (could be operator error here). Just an observation if you have little ones and/or get too cold yourself. Parking on site was a plus, just note that the parking space is small in case you have a big vehicle like me (it fit but it was very tight, i had to climb to the front seat via the trunk of my SUV). Only stay one night but recommend it if you are planning to stay somewhere close to everything in downtown Seattle. 
32134	3592838	9.0	10.0	56692306	"Let me start by saying this place was awesome!! The views and the photos are accurate, making this place a true gem for the money. I would stay at this place again in a heart beat. It is the perfect location for walking to most destinations. Parking is included and is in a locked parking garage which makes you feel secure. It was wonderful working with Anton. He allowed for easy communication and was very flexible with our check in and out times. It kind of feels like you're borrowing a friends place for the weekend. We didn't see him but once and only had communication when there was a need regarding check in and out times. I struggled on the 4 vs 5 star rating with this review because I LOVED this place; however, there were a few items in the unit requiring maintenance (such as lights and a missing door handle for the balcony). I'm sure he will have  those fixed in no time and the place will return to a 5 star stay!

For those of you who like some (email hidden) husband and I were only staying for 1 night. We really enjoyed the Pike's place market (Matt's was delicious!) be warned, though, several places require a reservation to get a seat as they stay very busy! We also enjoyed the space needle lookout and the Underground Seattle tour (I wish we had more time in this area as there were several nice local odd/in stores). Lastly, my husband really liked dropping in at the Crossfit Gym that's also within walking distance of this unit."
32135	3592838	9.0	10.0	56794179	Anton was very helpful and attentive. The apartment and neighborhood are fabulous. I am from Seattle originally and loved staying at Anton's place. The view from the apartment is incredible. Anton was a great host. I would definitely stay here again. 
32885	1163345	9.0	9.0	5003632	Great location. Nicely renovated space. The neighborhood is a little noisy, but hardly the fault of the owners. Had a great stay. Recommended. 
32886	1163345	9.0	9.0	5280177	"Darcy and Sean are absolutely fantastic. Great hosts and the apartment is clean and tidy. There is a full kitchen (although no microwave) and laundry facilities (SO helpful!)

The only drawback about this place is that it's very noisy - it's right over a club - and that the neighborhood isn't very nice. 
There are lots of homeless people on the streets surrounding the property and you might want to be a little cautious if you're travelling on your own.

All that being said though, if you know that the neighborhood isn't perfect, this apartment is excellent. And, as one of the other reviewer's said: the location really isn't the fault of either of the hosts! They're marvelous :)"
32887	1163345	9.0	9.0	5328643	"Darcy is awesome. So welcoming and friendly. No hassle getting in or out of the space. It was spotless and everything was incredibly comfortable. The space was great. And the price was just right.
Let me say this though. There is a club downstairs. And it can get very loud on the weekend. So if you aren't prepared for that or have kids I would suggest not staying at this location."

If the opportunity presents itself again, I want to go next."
32890	1163345	9.0	9.0	7511852	"Darcy's apartment was clearly beautifully renovated recently and it was perfect for our stay.  An excellent location for anyone traveling for football and baseball-- or any kind of tourism; we saw multiple tour groups passing by to talk a little bit about the building and area.

Have a beer at the Merchants Cafe!  Darcy and her colleagues made us feel very welcome and I look forward to staying again on a future trip."
32891	1163345	9.0	9.0	7805588	The reservation was canceled 50 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
32892	1163345	9.0	9.0	7838347	The apartment was very cool and well located.  Darcy was a pleasure to work with.  The restaurant downstairs is tasty!
32893	1163345	9.0	9.0	8084373	This was my first time using airbnb and it was great.  I had a great trip Darcy was there to meet me even though my times keep changing. The apartment was above a club so I was expecting it to be loud but it was so not a factor. The apartment is in a great location and close to the light rail which made it really convenient.  Darcy also allowed me a late check out.  All in all I would give my stay a 10 out of 10. I would definitely stay there again.  
32894	1163345	9.0	9.0	8373107	Awesome stay, great location, easy check-in/check-out!
32895	1163345	9.0	9.0	8825436	Darcy and the place were both wonderful!  Darcy's bar and restaurant downstairs was both tasty and convenient. Darcy was so easy to work with and went out of her way to make our stay extra-special.  Great location too!
32896	1163345	9.0	9.0	9505003	"I went to Seattle for a Seahawks game and rode the train up.  This location couldn't be more convenient for arriving by train or for attending games at the stadiums.  It's right on Pioneer Square, and walking distance to more bars, restaurants and activities than you could possibly do in a weekend.  

The place was clean, the bed was fine, and access was convenient. It had free wifi and coffee available.  Very nice.  

Darcy and the team at Merchants Cafe were friendly and helpful.  

Only downsides: there is a nightclub just below this apartment that thumps pretty good until the wee hours on weekends.  If you're a light sleeper, that may be a problem.  Also, since the place is in Pioneer Square, there are plenty of homeless folks around. Like homeless everywhere, they are mostly harmless, just trying to make a living in their own way.  "
32897	1163345	9.0	9.0	10685738	"I stayed at Darcy's apt. with three other young women for a conference that was being held at the Convention Center and we had a great experience. We are students on a budget so this apt. is a great value. Checking in and out was very easy because we picked up and dropped off the (email hidden) downstairs. Darcy was very responsive, flexible and a great host! 

Hop on the light rail at the aiport for about $3 and get off at Pioneer Station which is a 5-minute walk to the apt. The apt. is about a 20-minute walk to the convention center or a $7-$10 cab ride and is also very near to the International/Chinatown district. It is a 10-minute walk to Pike Place. 

I would say it can comfortably fit four people. Two of us shared the queen bed in the bedroom the other two stayed on futon mattresses in the living room. 

Some tips for travelers: We packed light and was able to wash our clothes in the washer and dryer. It was great to have a kitchen. We bought food at the Target on the way to the convention center so we could save money on lunch when we were at the convention center to use later for all the great eats Seattle has to offer. I would also recommend looking into car2go and registering an account before you go to Seattle so you can rent smart cars by the minute to navigate around the city. They'll send you a card to unlock the cars in the mail.  

Like the other reviewers said, the music downstairs can get loud, but we were so tired from our days exploring the city and attending the conference that sleeping was not a problem at all. If it is for you, this may not be the place for you. But, if you're looking for a great place for a great value with an awesome host, book it!"
32898	1163345	9.0	9.0	10854711	"
Very nice room to stay and Darcy is a very friendly lady. I changed my schedule last min, but Darcy is very kind to help me get my key to check in. When I arrived the house, I was surprised I got a whole apartment with one living room, one kitchen, one bedroom and bathroom. Wash machine and dry machine are available, all cooking facilities are available in kitchen too. There's TV and DVD player in living room too. The sofa in living is bendable, I guess it could become a bed. So this apartment could fit 4 people maxim. 

The building is next to Underground tour center, just cross the street. Darcy's cafe bar is downstairs. Starbuck is only 1 min away, 7/11 convenient store is 2 min away, a very interesting kid toy store is 2 min away, also some good clothing store around. I really like a restaurant named Bengodi, Italian food, only 3 min away, I went twice in two days.....haha

Taxi is accessible, Darcy helped me to call yellow cab, only 5 min waiting. Bus is also around, 3 min walking to bus station, get #1, #2, #13  to city center and space needle. King Street station is 10 min walking distance or spend 5USD taking taxi. 

There is a big parking area next to Darcy's house too, very convenient. 

Pike market is not far away, I was shopping and walking on the way back from Pike market to Darcy's house, there are many stores on the way. "
32899	1163345	9.0	9.0	11159066	Our stay at Darcy's place was amazing. The check in and check out processes were very smooth. We were comfortable during our stay and will stay again in the future!
32900	1163345	9.0	9.0	11372033	I recently traveled to Seattle to attend Emerald City Comic Con and I wanted to stay somewhere centrally located in case I wanted to hang around the city. The convention center is a short 20 minute walk from Darcy's place and you can also use public transportation if you don't want to walk.  Darcy was very helpful and cordial. I had read previous reviews commenting about the noise, but this was a non issue for my family and I.  I sometimes have trouble falling asleep after an exciting day, but this was not the case at the apartment. There is some noise due to the fact that you are in a city but it isn't a big deal. I would certainly recommend this nice and clean apartment. 
32901	1163345	9.0	9.0	11484631	The rental was smooth and without a hitch. It was a nice one-bedroom apartment with a kitchen and washer & dryer (a big plus). As an added bonus there was even a bar downstairs. Very positive experience overall.
32902	1163345	9.0	9.0	11560471	"Wonderful place, centrally located... Walk to Pike's Place Market, restaurants, groceries, nightlife, etc... Easy access, safe, comfortable.  Darcy was a great host, helping to accommodate us, by providing assistance in stocking some light groceries prior to our arrival. 

Only difficulty is parking.  "
32903	1163345	9.0	9.0	12032862	This was an awesome space! I felt safe and the room was clean. The shops in this area of town were also very quaint as are the places to eat. The host was nice and her staff great. I would stay again and may soon. 
32904	1163345	9.0	9.0	12093389	Darcy is a very personable and helpful host.  The accommodations were just what I was looking for. The place is interesting, comfortable, well-located, well-priced, clean, fully-equipped and with help/service nearby.  I slept well!
32905	1163345	9.0	9.0	12444334	Great space, great location. Easy to work with. Cheers!
32906	1163345	9.0	9.0	12831480	My wife and I had an incredible anniversary weekend at Darcy's apartment. Right from minute one she was helpful and friendly. We got to the apartment from the airport later than expected and didn't have much time to eat before the march to the Sounders game started. Darcy immediately helped us out by putting in a stat order for a couple burgers and even let me wear her Sounders jersey to the game. The apartment was in the most perfect location - easy walking distance right in between the stadiums and Pike's Market. The music from the club next door really wasn't an issue at all and Darcy will continue to make things better and better with the sound proofing the apartment. It seemed like every accommodation was thought about and taken care of - towels, linens, pots/pans, dinnerware, even shampoo and conditioner. I would HIGHLY recommend staying at this apartment. Not only was it beautiful with the natural exposed brick walls and high ceilings, but Darcy was amazing and helped so much in making our experience unforgettable. 
32907	1163345	9.0	9.0	12931727	"The apartments are clean and spacious. Darcy is a friendly host. We had a lunch in her restaurant. It was tasty.
It was vary interesting to leave in this home, cause home is very old. But it well designed and it had everything we need."

Backpacking it? Need to do wash? There's a washer and dryer!  I came downstairs for a beer while I washing clothes and Darcy picked up the tab!  So nice.
The room has tons of character and charm.  Super clean. If you're hanging about Pioneer Square, Pike Place or Belltown.  This is a great place to stay!"
32909	1163345	9.0	9.0	13935532	We stayed at Darcy's only one night, but wish it was longer! Getting in was so easy, and the (email hidden) downstairs were so friendly! The location could not be better, and the suit itself was clean and comfortable with all amenities. There was even a parking garage right across the street. We would definitely book again!  
32910	1163345	9.0	9.0	14268803	Did not have a chance to meet Darcy, but working with her over email was very easy.  Checking in and out at the Merchant's Cafe was also a breeze.  The unit was very charming and had all the amenities we could ask for (including washer and dryer!).  The only downside, as others have mentioned, is the Trinity club nearby that has music playing until approx 3:30a, but since we knew about it ahead of time we planned around this.  Great location and price, and the unit is comfortable.
32911	1163345	9.0	9.0	14368506	We loved our experience!  So cool to be in such a historic building.  Great location and so fun.
32912	1163345	9.0	9.0	14477653	"What a great place, people and overall atmosphere in the heart of Pioneer Square!
We loved the room and was super comfy in all aspects.  The folks working downstairs in the cafe were excellent and always there to help answer questions or needed anything.  Darcy  is wonderful.  There was a renovation(carpet and paint) in hallway but staff were apologetic and very kind and the renovation is looking great!  Cannot wait to come back and visit!  If you want to be in the heart of Pioneer Square; this is the place."
32913	1163345	9.0	9.0	14610651	"Great place to stay, nice location. The room was nice, but there were renovations going on. In the hallway. Some times were kind of noisy. I don't know how long they will last. It should be very nice when they are finished. 

There is some kind of club next door which also had some noise at night. Nothing that stopped me from sleeping though. I do consider myself a light sleeper. 

The merchant cafe employees were very helpful and pleasant. We needed some toilet paper later in the evening and they gladly helped us out. 

I would recommend this place to anyone. Overall good experience. "
32914	1163345	9.0	9.0	15087961	"The apartment: Wonderful historic apartment -- the history oozes out of the walls. Nicely decorated and comfortable. We stayed in late June 2014 and would leave the window open at night so we could wake up to the call of Jonathan Livingston Seagull -- being from El Paso, TX this was a treat! Will definitely be staying here on our next visit to Seattle!

The location: Perfect location to explore downtown Seattle: Klondike Gold Rush Museum, Underground Tour, Pioneer Square bars, ball parks, Pike Street Market, Metropolitan Grill. We even walked to the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project.

Darcy Hanson: Couldn't ask for a better host. Always available, responsive and goes out of her way to please. Most people probably don't need an ironing board when on vacay, but being anal about my shirts, I needed one. My girlfriend called Darcy and she brought one right over. Not only that, but she had to scramble to locate a historical ironing board to go with the historical bldg. Thanks Darcy!"
32915	1163345	9.0	9.0	15173132	Darcy was great and very helpful getting us situated into our apartment. The staff down stairs is also very nice as well. The location of the apartment is great and very close to pike market!!
32916	1163345	9.0	9.0	15215038	Darcy's place is in a great location in Pioneer Square. It is easy to walk to anything and there is a lot going on nearby. The apartment has wonderful decor and character in a cool historic building. Checking in is easy by picking up keys in the bar/restaurant downstairs. Everyone that worked there was helpful and friendly and we were able to drop off our bags before check in. We stayed there 1 night before and after our cruise and it was great. Thanks Darcy and staff at Merchants Cafe.
32917	1163345	9.0	9.0	15445777	Great location, great room, and a great little bar and bistro down below would definitely stay again , and Darcy is very obliging
32918	1163345	9.0	9.0	15487561	"The location couldn't have been better. We were able to walk to pikes market (short walk) and the space needle (long walk). The neighborhood of pioneer square is also amazing lots of great shops and restaurants. The apartment itself was clean although a little warm in July. They did provide a fan in the bedroom so that was helpful. 
The staff at merchants cafe was amazing. So helpful and friendly. They let us leave our bags with them on our last day since we had a late flight. "
32919	1163345	9.0	9.0	15531784	Cool place.  I love the fact they are restoring an old heritage building.  The area is a bit rough so I'm not sure I would stay there with my young kids but I would certainly stay there again to go to a baseball or football game.  It's also very close to the train station.  They have done a nice job fixing up the rooms with wonderful exposed brick.
32920	1163345	9.0	9.0	15672011	The room is very cool!  High ceilings, brick walls, heritage building, it was really great.  The location is fantastic if you are going to catch a game (close to the stadiums).  Darcy was very welcoming and the staff downstairs were really nice as well.  
32921	1163345	9.0	9.0	15872243	We had a great stay! The apartment was gorgeous and looked just like the pictures. Darcy was wonderful and spent a lot of time explaining the history of the restaurant/apartments to us. Location is very convenient to Pike Street Market. Would definitely stay here again!
32922	1163345	9.0	9.0	15905465	We really enjoyed our stay here. The location is fantastic and check in is conveniently downstairs in the bar. 
32923	1163345	9.0	9.0	15958383	It's about a 15min walk to Pike's market and downtown.  Very centrally located.  A beautiful neighborhood.  Pretty safe to walk around and find stuff.  Overall, I had a great experience staying here. 
32924	1163345	9.0	9.0	16307807	Darcy's place is perfectly situated downtown, walkable to pike place market, shopping, and all the major attractions. The home has a ton of character and all the needed amenities (although wifi was difficult to connect at times). Parking can be difficult to find but there are many lots within walking distance. All in all, I'd definitely recommend Darcy's place! 
32925	1163345	9.0	9.0	16514147	Highly recommend. Close to the bus lines, ferry, Pike Place, stadiums. Very clean and the bartender downstairs was very friendly and accommodating to our needs. Darcy allowed us to leave our luggage in the cafe hours before check in time. If you like old historical buildings, this studio is definitely the place to stay.
32926	1163345	9.0	9.0	16829724	Great location!   Clean room,  and the bartenders down stairs were super helpful with anything we needed. I would recommend Darcy,  she was a great host.
32927	1163345	9.0	9.0	17819149	"Perfect location !
The noise from the club nearby wasnt that bad. We loved the apartment very much.
Clean, like the photos, easy communication, perfect stay for Seattle.
 
"
32928	1163345	9.0	9.0	17934715	Darcy communicated very well, she always answer question and she let us leave our luggage in the cafe downstairs until 6pm for our evening flight. We got the apartment on 3th floor instead of 2th floor. Apartment itself is nice and clean. Major problem though is that it's a very steep stairs, luck of AC, also bedroom doesn't have window. When we entered apartment at night it still was very hot and stuffy. There is also no screens on window, so some fly entered appt. Window looks into another building window and garbage truck came very late at night to pick up garbage with associated smell from the open window. We were not able to operate TV (not a big deal for me). We didn't like neighborhood because of a lot of homeless people, but it's close to everything like Pike market (20 min walk). I would not recommend this apartment for the above reasons.
32929	1163345	9.0	9.0	18164239	Great place to stay in a fascinating part of the city. The apartment was spacious and comfortable. I'd definitely stay here again. 
32930	1163345	9.0	9.0	18405636	"We stayed above the Merchants Cafe in August.  As specified we asked for the (email hidden) and were quickly given the code and the keys.  Easy and efficient. When we got in the window was wide open and there was a breeze which is a relief when you are from Texas.  The apartment was clean and neat just as pictured.  Great location with easy access.  As in any city you need to be aware of some curious characters.  Great price for an historic building.

The only downside was that there are a lot of stairs and the noise from garbage trucks woke us at 3:45 AM.  "
32931	1163345	9.0	9.0	18887571	We never met Darcy because she told us to work with her staff downstairs upon arriving.  We checked in with the bartender downstairs and she told us that we were in room 302 although the Airbnb listing stated 203.  I told the bartender that we were in 203 but she said that my name was for 302.  The bartender gave us the room key and didn't take us upstairs to explain anything about the unit - she just pointed that we had to go up the second flight of stairs.  When we unlocked the door, the place look ABSOLUTELY nothing like what was advertised on Airbnb.  The place we had was covered in pink and green with pink couches, rose paintings/pictures, rose shower curtains, rose sheets, etc.  I don't know whether or not Darcy uses the same pictures of one unit for all the units she rents out in that building but I felt cheated because it was false advertisement.  Darcy didn't even bother to tell us that the room would look different than what was advertised - no communication, nothing.  I not only find the lack of communication unacceptable but it's also exceptionally inappropriate to provide your guests with a place that was not advertised.  The kitchen, bathroom and bedroom were clean for the most part but the end tables in the living room had a thick layer of dust on it and used paint cans were left throughout the unit (such as on the kitchen counter).  Neither the bartender nor Darcy said anything to us about wifi even though the listing states wifi (one of the main reasons why we chose this place).  We had to text Darcy asking for the wifi information and the wifi worked only about 25% of the time - making it pointless for us because we were counting on wifi on our laptops to plan our trip.  The hallway and staircase for the building needs to be cleaned more often because it smelled of urine during our whole stay.  Overall, I would never take a listing from Darcy again nor would I ever recommend this place to any of my friends.
32932	1163345	9.0	9.0	18946603	Location was good, pioneer square can be rough but I never felt unsafe.  It's a quick walk to pike's place market.  It was a little noisy in the building, a little hot.  The couch was very hard, the bed not a queen size as listed - actually a full.  It was super easy to check in, Darcy was very nice and we were able to do laundry which was nice.  It was a decent stay.  
32933	1163345	9.0	9.0	19634505	The apartment was awesome! Very clean and identical to the description. Parking was a little tricky but in a city that's expected. The lady who showed us upstairs was very nice and helpful! I would recommend this place!
32934	1163345	9.0	9.0	19760968	"This is a great apartment, with very high ceilings and beautiful woodwork. Everything was clean and nice, including the bedding and towels. It is super easy to pick up the key, since you get it from staff in the Merchant Café and Saloon downstairs. 
The location is great; right in Pioneer Square. Parking was easy right in front of the building (and free after 6 pm). We had fun talking to Alicia the bartender. I would definitely stay here again!"
32935	1163345	9.0	9.0	19811321	The apt was very unique, beautifully appointed, and a fabulous place to stay. It's right next to Pioneer Square and walking distance to the waterfront.   Looking forward to returning!
32936	1163345	9.0	9.0	20100461	"First thing that needs to be noted is that the building is (or rumored to be) haunted. Ghost tours walk by the building and talk about its history. For some this may be a draw, for me, had I known, I'd have gone elsewhere. I feel like visitors really should be told this in advance.

The room was spacious, but to have a cooler room, the window needed to be open and the garbage truck woke me at 3am. It's a rougher part of the city and parking is difficult (but you can park in the lot across the street). It's quite a hike up the stairs, so unless you're traveling light, be prepared for a haul.

I wouldn't recommend staying here, only because the hauntings/hot air made me very uncomfortable. "
32937	1163345	9.0	9.0	20330242	Our stay at Darcy's place was what we expected. We never met her but since all the bartenders can help you to check in and out it was not a problem at all. The condo is beautiful and pretty spacious. We had everything described on the pictures. As we stayed 3 nights between thursday and saturday, it was indeed very noisy as advertised. We couldn't sleep without earplugs because of the nightclub. The location is great in regard of the city (not far from the activities) but the neighbourhood seemed not so secure. Nevertheless we never had a problem and we enjoyed our trip in Seattle.
32938	1163345	9.0	9.0	21326041	This apartment is in a beautiful historic building in the heart of downtown. It's an easy walk to Pike Place Market and Seattle Center, so it's perfect for tourists. We loved staying here! 
32939	1163345	9.0	9.0	22461850	What a great place to stay in Seattle. I love the location, Ray walk to lots of activities and dining. Check in was easy and friendly, the apartment has everything you could need and is very clean, and I didn't have any noise issues. I'll definitely be back.
32940	1163345	9.0	9.0	22489601	Really cool location and space. Loved the exposed brick and location near public transport. It was located above an old bar. No noise issues during our stay. Easy to check in downstairs. Thanks for hosting and keeping in close communication. 
32941	1163345	9.0	9.0	22572390	Really enjoyed the stay at Darcy's historic building. It is an authentic Pioneer Square experience. Darcy and her crew are very welcoming and helpful, and the color of the place is excellent. If you're looking for a homogenized room with disco staff you might try the W, but if you're looking for a place with character to stay after going out in downtown Seattle you will enjoy it as much as we did. Pioneer Square is rough, the night club noise runs late. But if that's not an issue you should sign on for the spacious, clean rooms that Darcy has set up. Cheers!  
32942	1163345	9.0	9.0	22861544	My boyfriend and I were blown away by Darcy's beautiful space - it's much more charming and spacious than it appears in the photos! The apartment was very clean upon arrival and we had everything we needed during our stay. Picking up the keys at Merchant’s bar downstairs was very convenient. We didn't notice the noise from the adjacent nightclub, though we were out most nights. We did, however, get woken up early both mornings by loud footsteps from the guests upstairs, but this was no fault of the host and seems unavoidable in a historic building with wooden floors. Next time I reserve with Darcy I'll try to rent apartment 303 upstairs to limit the amount of noise heard from other guests.  Overall, highly recommended! Darcy's building will be my new go-to accommodation whenever I'm in Seattle. 
32943	1163345	9.0	9.0	23057268	Darcy was great and helpful. She stopped by early that evening to make sure I got in ok and that the check in went smooth.
32944	1163345	9.0	9.0	23609621	Darcy was well organized and was prompt with responses.  Directions to get to apartment were clear and we had no issues.  We got into town early and were able to leave our bags until check-in so we didn't have to carry them around the city.  Apartment was in a lovely neighbourhood and was a lovely place to stay.  The only minor issue we had was that the cleaners must have left the windows open after cleaning. It was quite a cold day so the apartment never was able to fully heat up to a comfortable temperature.
32945	1163345	9.0	9.0	23703888	Experience was as advertised. Merchants Cafe below was cool and bartender was super friendly and hospitable. It was like staying at a friends apartment that you didn't know.
32946	1163345	9.0	9.0	24259760	The apartment was great! It was exactly as advertised in a great neighborhoor. This was just like staying in a hotel, the staff at Merchants Cafe handles keys, check in, check out and everything we could possibly need. 
32947	1163345	9.0	9.0	24609831	Second time we stayed in this building, and an easy, very positive experience. The apartment's right downtown, roomy, clean, very pleasant. Even parking was easy. 
32948	1163345	9.0	9.0	25033702	The room was lovely. The saloon staff were very pleasant and cheerful. Location was great, 2-3 mins from the airport train, 8-10 mins to Pike Place Market, 15-20 mins to Convention Center. Plenty of spare linens and towels.  The music does get thumping on weekend (as mentioned in the description), so light sleepers beware, but I slept through it without waking up! Darcy was especially helpful in moving our bags to our new room while we were busy at conference and couldn't get back in time for checkout/checkin.
32949	1163345	9.0	9.0	25162964	This was an awesome place to stay.  This was my first trip to Seattle and had no idea where in the city would be good so i wanted to stay downtown but all the hotels are very expensive. This location was very cheap for what you get: a whole apartment to yourself in the historic, centrally-located district of Pioneer Square.  I hardly ever had to take a cab or bus, I walked everywhere!  The biggest sights are right nearby.  Check-in was easy and the place was quiet. If you want fancy, nice and new, this place is not for you.  If you like the magic of a historic building in a beautiful city, you will never want to leave. This place was worth every dollar!  
32950	1163345	9.0	9.0	25344614	I had a very good customer service experience with Darcy. I don't want to be too specific, so as not to set up specific expectations for others. But we had some of our own problems with our travels  Darcy has gone beyond what is expected to make sure we could make use of our time and expense. I can definitely recommend Darcy based on Customer Service.
32951	1163345	9.0	9.0	25636181	We didn't meet Darcy, but the people working at Merchant's Cafe downstairs were plenty helpful. We tried to rent room 201, but it got booked simultaneously. Darcy was kind enough to move us up to 301 without issue (stairs, no elevator). Room 301 has a nice view Pioneer Square. It was plenty of space for two of us for a couple of days; bed, kitchenette, and dining table all in one space, with a separate bathroom area (with washer/dryer). It's a comfortable, old room. Towels and bedding was clean. 10% off at the restaurant for staying there. We didn't have an issue with noise on a Monday and Tuesday night. Would recommend these apartments for a quick stay, for sure. 
32952	1163345	9.0	9.0	25749548	"The apartment was great! It had everything we needed and the location was unbeatable. There are bars, restaurants, coffee shops, attractions, and more within a five-minute walk of the place.

Although I didn't meet Darcy, the Merchant's Bar hostess was very attentive and helped us with questions about the apartment and to store our luggage."
32953	1163345	9.0	9.0	26023478	Listing was as describe but felt more spacious than images show. Loved the location! Close to pretty much everything downtown or with in a cheap cab or walking distance. Right in the heart of Pioneer Square it's an authentic Seattle experience and we'll be renting again! Easy key pick up/drop off from staff at the cafe and they were very nice. 
32954	1163345	9.0	9.0	26595524	The apartment was great and Darcy was very friendly. Although there is a club next door, and you can hear it through the walls, it wasn't as loud as the transients outside and the recycling truck at 4am. I would stay again.
32955	1163345	9.0	9.0	26761391	Staff at Merchants was great. Darcy was great. Place was great. Great.
32956	1163345	9.0	9.0	27222728	We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our visit.  The tall ceilings and 100 year old brick made for a great ambiance.  The shower was hot and the bed comfortable! Would definitely stay again!
32957	1163345	9.0	9.0	27689312	We never got a chance to meet Darcy but we only stayed for a night and were pretty much in and out. We did not do research into what merchants cafe was since the apartment is over merchants cafe. We should have done that since there was a soccer game playing when we checked in. We could hear the music and cheering from downstairs throughout the afternoon and evening when we were needing some rest time. We enjoyed the central location and building style. However the bed was not comfotable at all. We could feel the metal springs while laying down. The actually bedroom was not clean (carpet, under the bed, etc) but the rest of the Apartment was so maybe it just missed by mistake. 
32958	1163345	9.0	9.0	27785013	Darcy's apartment was warm and cozy, and _perfect_ for what I needed! I was in town for meetings and this was the perfect place to relax after a long day. Picking up the keys from the bar downstairs was incredibly easy, and the bartender even helped me up the stairs with my bags! I will absolutely look into staying here again the next time I'm up at headquarters.
32959	1163345	9.0	9.0	27825366	Excellent location, clean, old fashioned and stylish, awesome design.  Check in was easy and there in a giant parking facility across the street if you have a car.  
32960	1163345	9.0	9.0	28780198	Located in the heart of Pioneer Square, this is one heck of a find! Everything was close by, including Starbucks (of course), and a few mom-and-pop restaurants (Planet Java diner was just a few blocks away and was fantastic!). The staff at Merchant's Cafe downstairs were nothing short of awesome. I will come back to this spot again! Thank you Darcy for everything!
32961	1163345	9.0	9.0	29082737	Darcy's place in Pioneer Square was very clean and more spacious than the images provided. The brick walls and high ceiling made a great ambiance. The listing mentioned possibly loud music on weekend nights, but my friend and I did not find it much bothersome (even on Thursday night before the Easter long weekend). Very easy check in and out with kind staff at the Merchants Cafe. Location was quite convenient as it is close to downtown. Overall, a great Seattle experience!
32962	1163345	9.0	9.0	30336212	"The instructions for getting to the apartment from the Airport were clear and helpful, and it was very convenient to pick up the keys from the bar below.
We liked the location and the pictures represented the place accurately."
32963	1163345	9.0	9.0	30500544	The Merchant Cafe was in walking distance to most everything we wanted to do including Pike Market, Coffee and the Space Needle.  We took the Bolt Bus in and it was close to the drop off point as well.  It was really spacious, and had lots of kitchen space. My first time in Seattle & it was the perfect place.  The key pickup was easy and quick.  Close to a convenience store and Elm  coffee roasters ( awesome coffee ). Stayed Tues-Thurs and it was pretty quiet. Would definitely stay here again.
32964	1163345	9.0	9.0	32161916	My partner and I were so happy with this space. What's in the pictures and the descriptions is what you get –– a lovely, spacious suite in a nice building, well located in downtown Seattle. It was a great jumping off point for all our activities, nearby to the Pike Place Market, the stadiums, and the ferry, and was a fine place to get to come back to. Having folks around to make check-in, check-out, and any questions in between extremely easy is an added bonus.
32965	1163345	9.0	9.0	33404987	The place was great! A cool hip and historic spot within walking distance of all your tourist needs. I had trouble finding the apartment, so I called her number listed and was pointed in the right direction. The bar downstairs was also very helpful.
32966	1163345	9.0	9.0	33719108	Awesome location. Very easy check in process by the folks in the restaurant/bar downstairs. The room itself was perfect for our needs and quite a bit larger that what we thought based on the pictures. Very cool space. The noise from the nightclub didnt bother us but we were out late the night we stayed there. 
32967	1163345	9.0	9.0	33991081	"Great place. Spectacularly convenient. Spotlessly clean. Really good, historic restaurant.  
I just wish it stayed open later. I was working and never got ""home"" before 11:30 at night."
32968	1163345	9.0	9.0	35365499	Clean, fun, and convenient!  I would definitely recommend staying here if you're in town for a show.  We stayed on a Wednesday night and the apartment was pretty quiet, just normal city sounds. There's an overnight parking garage right across the street which is awesome.  Loved the exposed brick and decor!  The bartender who gave us our keys and showed us in was friendly and professional.  
32969	1163345	9.0	9.0	37313592	Great location right in Pioneer Square! Great vintage Seattle feel with exposed brick and an open layout. Everything we needed for our short stay.
32970	1163345	9.0	9.0	37674743	Had a fun time and the place was great!
32971	1163345	9.0	9.0	37743283	Darcy's apartment was great! The pictures were exactly like the unit. The staff at Merchants Cafe were wonderful and easy to work with for check in and check out. They even allowed us a safe place to store our bags after checking out. The apartment itself was in a wonderful location. Easy walking distance to the Space Needle and Pikes Place Market. I would definitely stay here again.
32972	1163345	9.0	9.0	39204489	Spent a great night in Seattle. The location is great. The waterfront and Pike's place are only a short walk. The staff at the cafe were very accommodating. Only negative was that the apartment was a little stuffy but that can be attributed to hot July weather.
32973	1163345	9.0	9.0	40579991	Apartment was just as advertised. Check in was very easy. Relatively cheap parking was a little difficult to find in the area. The apartment had everything you could ask for, however, we were there towards the end of July and, even with the fans on full blast, it was very hot inside. All things considered, would definitely stay again.
32974	1163345	9.0	9.0	40729505	Space was clean and inviting. 
32975	1163345	9.0	9.0	46697314	Great apartment. Nice location. Looks exactly like the pictures and the guy from merchants cafe that let me in was really nice.  It was clean and I had no issues there. Would go again if I'm ever back in Seattle.  
32976	1163345	9.0	9.0	46922305	What a cool place, so much history!!! Perfect Pioneer location. Thanks again! 
32977	1163345	9.0	9.0	47209468	This is a fantastic place to stay, really gives you a great feel for Downtown Seattle. No question, stay here and enjoy. 
32978	1163345	9.0	9.0	48030814	Apartment just as is described. Easy check in/out. I was only there for one night. A bit stuffy upon entrance, just turn on fans and open window. Steep stairs to apt. pack light or travel w/ a friend who will lug your bags. 
32979	1163345	9.0	9.0	49585803	Everything held up to my expectations. The place was easy to find, clean and in a good location. 
32980	1163345	9.0	9.0	49797674	An amazing place with such character! Located close to everything, was a great place to experience Seattle. The staff at Merchants Cafe were extremely helpful! 
32981	1163345	9.0	9.0	50032972	Beautiful place, great neighborhood and very friendly and helpful staff right below at the Merchant's Cafe. 
32982	1163345	9.0	9.0	50213663	My husband and I had a great time staying here! We loved the exposed brick and vintage feel of the place, and especially loved the overall antiquity of the building. We were an easy walk to Pike Place where we had dinner reservations at Radiator Whiskey and we had a lovely time exploring the shops and bars between there and around our apartment. When we come back to Seattle, we'll be looking up a stay in Darcy's apartment again! 
32983	1163345	9.0	9.0	50320222	Great location and awesome apartment. Staff at Merchants were very helpful. Would definitely recommend.
32984	1163345	9.0	9.0	51437062	"Seemless check-in getting the key from the bar. Place is cool with exposes brick, as it looks in the pictures.

The fold down couch isn't the most  comfortable to sleep on, so probably best for people who will only need the bedroom.

Location is perfect for exploring Seattle, walk to Century link field for a Seahawks game, do the underground tour just  around the corner, plenty of bars nearby. Short uber rides up to QueenAnne or for the night life in Capitol Hill.

Enjoyable stay all around! Thanks Darcy"
32985	1163345	9.0	9.0	52642047	The listing was accurate, and the apartment was clean. Check in and out were easy, thanks to the restaurant staff downstairs. 
32986	1163345	9.0	9.0	53214113	Great space and location!  Super clean and cozy, a perfect place.  Maria, who works in the bar downstairs, was a huge help.  Don't worry about the stairs- it's worth it.
32987	1163345	9.0	9.0	53400239	"The location of this airbnb was great - super easy access in a cab even when it was raining, and it worked out well for us. Check in was a breeze thanks to the friendly bartender at Merchant's cafe.

While the first impression/design of the place was really cool, we found some basic amenities problematic: the bathtub clogged only after a minute or two of showering, controls for the heater and fans weren't easily accessible, the bed and sofas were very low quality. For the listed price, this was disappointing, and we wouldn't pick this place again."
32988	1163345	9.0	9.0	55622142	"The location of this apartment is very good – close to everything, however, the neighbourhood is a bit sketchy, especially when it gets dark. The apartment itself is large enough and clean, yet we found it to be rather gloomy and unwelcoming. The sofa in the living room is extremely uncomfortable – we wouldn’t recommend to rent this apartment if there are more than 2 of you. 

There’s no parking on site, but you can park across the street – expect to pay a lot for it, as it’s downtown."
32989	1163345	9.0	9.0	56176072	The apartment has a great ambiance, as seen in the photos.  The ceilings are high, and it's quiet (we were there on a Tuesday night).  We arrived late (after midnight), and they were very accommodating in getting us the key.  The only drawback was that the WiFi connection was slow.
32990	1163345	9.0	9.0	56278013	"Best host experience to date. Arrived late due to travel issues, Darcy arranged for an after hours key pick up and GAVE ME A 2ND NIGHT FOR FREE. This was an unexpected level of top notch service, hosts like this is what makes airbb amazing.

The room was the most elegantly charming stay I've experienced. Aesthetic was flawlessly simple, and the location cannot be beaten. No questions asked, my next stay in Seattle will be in one of Darcy's rentals, the hostess with the mostess."
32991	1163345	9.0	9.0	56344987	Darcy was very friendly, and the place was nice. Very convenient location! I would recommend it to others. 
38534	226495	9.0	9.0	1193276	"This tiny spot was perfect for me and my coworkers. We ran to Seattle for a two day trip and this crash pad was perfect. The communication was easy and the vibe was chill. When we all ended up there after our event at 3am--and it took us a while to settle in (cold pizza and laughs anyone?) they were awesome about our late arrivals. Such great guests---the kind of people that make you feel like you are staying with friends. We all crammed into this place and it was great.

The one and only drawback---it was cold. Don't worry they have space heaters---but yikes...daddy was freezing.
"
38535	226495	9.0	9.0	1576319	Lovely apartment in a great neighborhood.  Close to great restaurants  and even found a Zumba class within walking distance. Apartment was very clean and had all the suppies we needed. Owners went out of their way to accomodate our arrival time and make us feel welcome.
38536	226495	9.0	9.0	1692770	"We had a great time and felt very comfortable in the ""fun""  apartment. Clean, nicely furnished and well appointed. Our hosts wee charming and made us feel very welcome. Would recommend."
38537	226495	9.0	9.0	1722535	This brightly decorated basement abode was perfect for our summer family stay in Seattle. Great balance of convenience, functionality and price.
38538	226495	9.0	9.0	1984660	"The apartment was easy to find. Check in was a breeze, The hosts, Glen and Rose Marie, are nice friendly people! There was plenty of space for two adults and two teenage girls. The beds are comfortable and I slept like a rock. The property is well maintained and the area is safe and relatively quiet for a major city. The kitchen is well equipped with more than one wine bottle opener - whew :) We did not want for anything. There are extra blankets, plenty of pillows, dvd's, plenty of towels, hand towels, washclothes, etc. If you go swimming or any summer water activity then bring beach towels. My boyfriend and I went for a late evening walk every night and felt like we were at home only 30 degrees cooler. This property is conveniently located and we could be in downtown Seattle within minutes. This is my fourth or fifth visit to Seattle and I would love to stay in the property again on future visits. Thanks Glen and Rose Marie!

On things to do: Ballard Locks, Fremont Flea Market, Fremont Troll, the rose garden at the zoo are just a few of the few things we did for FREE. The park adjacent to Ballard Locks has free live music during the summer on weekends - check w/ parks and rec...they even provided folding chairs! The view from Bank of America Bldg Columbia Center is cheaper than the space needle and it's the tallest buidling in downtown Seattle with a nearly 360 degree view. It's not for people that are terrified of heights..just riding the elevators to the 73 floor makes my tummy squeamish :) but I lived thru the experience. It's quite the view. $9 for adults, less for students and children. Cheapest downtown all day weekend parking is the City Centre/US Bank parking garage near Pike/Pine/Union I think? The entrance is a pain to find but well worth only paying $6 to park all day. It's a short walk to PIke's Place, the waterfront and tons of shopping."
38539	226495	9.0	9.0	2071371	Rose and Glen met us at the apartment and gave us a walk-through. They were very friendly and we had a good conversation about things to see and do. Our stay at the apt was very nice and the accommodations were just right. Would definetly stay here again!
38540	226495	9.0	9.0	5731680	"We stayed in this wonderful apartment for six days during our trip visiting friends on the Seattle area.  The apartment easily accommodated myself, my wife, or two young kids, my sister-in-law and my brother-in-law.

The apartment was convenient and an easy drive everywhere we needed to go.

Being partially below ground helped keep the apartment nice and cool during the heat wave that hit for part of our stay in July.

We would not hesitate to stay here again."
38541	226495	9.0	9.0	5863900	Lovely hosts, kitchen fit the bill, slept like a babe. My sister and I shared the place for a week, we both loved it. I think you will need a car to see downtown Seattle but others might be able to negotiate public transit. 
38542	226495	9.0	9.0	6058783	Rose and Glen were superb hosts.  The apartment was perfect for a quick business trip with an ideal location in the hippest neighborhood.  The apartment itself was an urban oasis with an adorable outdoor in the front and back.  Although there is a kitchen, I didn't get any use out of it except for the microwave, which did not disappoint.  The first night I was there, Rose and Glen drove me into Fremont (totally unexpected!) and I was able to easily find my way back on my own.  I would highly recommend this cute apartment!
38543	226495	9.0	9.0	6419705	Glen & Rose's Ballard house was cozy and tidy! They were friendly and helpful. We loved our stay there and would come back!
38544	226495	9.0	9.0	6913960	We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Glen and Rose were very quick to respond to our queries. Great appartment. We used the 28 bus into Seattle, bus stop was very close and buses were on time. Would recommend to others. Great holiday. Thank you.
38545	226495	9.0	9.0	7011185	Very handy, pleasant space with room for everyone and excellent facilities for cooking or BBQ. Appreciated meeting glen and his friendly tips for getting around and loved finding the local map book in the suite. It was convenient to downtown Seattle, and pubs and restaurants & groceries were within walking distance. We only wish it were closer to the groovy heart of old Ballard. Would recommend to anyone to stay. The main bed was super comfortable. Thank you Rose & Glen
38546	226495	9.0	9.0	7336686	Very comfortable home with all the necessities. Close to a few stores and near bus routes, which can take you downtown or to other neighborhoods in Seattle. Rose and Glen were also awesome with their communication and making sure we felt at home! Thanks!
38547	226495	9.0	9.0	8996100	It is a cheery little place that makes you smile. Had everything we needed and a great location. We will definitely return! 
38548	226495	9.0	9.0	12737392	The reservation was canceled 111 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
38549	226495	9.0	9.0	13868346	"Rose and Glen were wonderful! They greeted us at the door and showed around the place. The apartment was charming and our 6-person group fit there nicely. The neighborhood was nice and quiet with a good grocery store closed by.

We really enjoyed our stay! :)"
38550	226495	9.0	9.0	14157581	"I had a wonderful stay at Rose and Glen's place. They are very kind and nice to talk to. Whenever there is an issue or question, they are very quick at responding or resolving it. They also don't live on site, so I feel I have great privacy. The place is neat and clean. It's not new and shiny, but it's very cozy and charming. The bed was comfortable and kitchen is well stocked with cooking utensils, and there are plenty of glasses and chinaware. The bathroom is very clean and has lots of towels!

The place is not without any caveat. One thing is that it's near a major road, so it could be loud for the whole evening. I absolutely have no problem falling asleep, but my mom had a hard time. Additionally, since the upstairs unit may also be occupied, one can certainly hear them if they get a bit loud. Maybe they feel the same thing about us."
38551	226495	9.0	9.0	14488403	We stayed there for three nights. The location is good and it's easy to find. The host is nice. We will come again in the nearly future if possible. 
38552	226495	9.0	9.0	14580901	Great hosts and a wonderful spot thank you guys much for making our trip complete would definitely stay here again Thanks
38553	226495	9.0	9.0	14969953	This is an easy place to stay if you plan to be visiting various locations in north or central Seattle. It's very easy to get to and always had parking right outside. Most importantly, the beds are comfy and water pressure is great! We would stay here again!
38554	226495	9.0	9.0	15261401	Rose was very nice, place was clean, all essentials are provided.  Liked the private patio out back.
38555	226495	9.0	9.0	15625543	Our host, Glen, was very pleasant. The neighborhood was great. The apartment was cozier than expected.
38556	226495	9.0	9.0	15780910	"We really enjoyed our stay in Ballard.  The apartment had everything we needed.  Rose and Glen made us very welcome and made sure we knew where everything was. They were great re changing our check out time as well.  Easy public transport to Downtown and Ballard has a lovely park and beaches and some nice individual shops.  The apartment is close to a great bar (1000 beers!), cafes and Safeway.

"
38557	226495	9.0	9.0	15928536	The apartment was clean and conveniently located to the University of Washington.  It would of been nice to know ahead of time that this is a basement apartment with tenants above that share the hot water heater and that this apartment is on the corner of a fairly busy street.
38558	226495	9.0	9.0	16250366	Très bon accueil, en français svp.  Appartement très correct dans un quartier proche de la ville par bus 
38559	226495	9.0	9.0	18092584	"Email replies were very quick from the hosts.  In person, Rose and Glen were polite and very friendly.  The place was clean and provided what we needed for a place to stay.  It was the right size for our family of 4.  
I will say that if you want to be in Ballard, near the busier scene, you have to drive there."
38560	226495	9.0	9.0	18170127	We had a terrific experience staying at Rose & Glen's lovely place in Ballard.  Glen was exceptionally friendly and made us feel immediately welcome.  The apartment was as nice as described and fit all 6 of us (close friends doubling up) comfortably.  The location was convenient and parking was no problem at all.  I would highly recommend staying here.  
38561	226495	9.0	9.0	18551980	Rose and Glen were very friendly, nice hosts! My family enjoyed their stay at this house very much. Parking is always available for one car in front of the house so you don't have to drive around the block to find a spot. I also liked the neighborhood. 
38562	226495	9.0	9.0	21704060	The apartment looks really nice, with a unique interior design and all the utilities needed for a long stay. Rose and Glen are very warm and helpful, answered a lot of questions that we have about the apartment and the area around, since it' our fist time in the city. And it is located in close distnce to I-5, which makes it convenient to go to everywhere. I would recommend this apartment to anyone that's going to stay in Seattle for long.
38563	226495	9.0	9.0	27660988	A very well-laid out and clean space in the heart of North Ballard.  Stayed there for about a month and had no complaints--functional kitchen, comfortable bed, everything one needs!  
38564	226495	9.0	9.0	27947814	Apt was as nice as pictured. Plenty of hot water and towels. Close to our family living in Ballard. 
38565	226495	9.0	9.0	36009126	Rose and Glen were very nice.  The Apartment was great for what we needed it for. We have a full crew of people and we all fit nicely. The Apartment is close to Chuck’s Hop Shop, which is a great little place to unwind.  We found ourselves there multiple times during our stay. 
38566	226495	9.0	9.0	36218215	Pros:  Clean space with comfy beds at a fair price; friendly hosts hard at work to assure a clean unit when we arrived; groceries and some restaurants walkable; hosts were responsive during our stay; we flubbed the checkout time by 30 minutes and then left with the key - which we brought right back - and hosts were understanding. Cons: Noticeable, sometimes loud, street noise when the (ground level) windows were open - this is a partial basement - although air stuffy when windows were closed; footsteps of main house guests overhead may disturb some (our party was divided on this); washing machine broken and we could not start dishwasher. Although we would opt for a non-basement when options abound, this place was safe and clean and met our needs at a busy time of year. 
38567	226495	9.0	9.0	36544178	Rose & Glenn were great hosts.  The apartment location was perfect for our needs and the neighborhood was quiet and easy for parking. We would def. stay there again. :)  
38568	226495	9.0	9.0	38261602	The host met me on site and showed me the amenities of the  apartment. It was perfect for four adults. The neighborhood was safe and there as ample parking. Washer/dryer and dishwasher were included, which was very handy.
38569	226495	9.0	9.0	39157783	This cozy apartment was nice a clean upon arrival! It's a basement apartment, so it stayed nice and cool in the scorching summer heat which was a plus! The neighborhood was nicely located near fun bars and restaurants. Bathroom was wonderful- lots of fresh and fluffy white towels. When we had an issue getting the washer going, the hosts were more than accommodating about getting it working for us in a jiffy! 
38570	226495	9.0	9.0	40202511	"Rose and Glen were great communicators, extremely friendly, and a pleasure to work with. We were scheduled to get into Seattle before the check in time and they were more than accommodating and let us drop off our bags early so we wouldn't have to carry them around with us. Due to personal circumstances, they weren't able to show us around the property personally when we checked in, but we had no problem getting the key and getting settles. 

Seattle has very strict rules about recycling and garbage disposal that Rose and Glen did make us aware of--if you're not from a similar area you may find this a challenge to remember--but there are signs posted that we found helpful. 

The only negatives were the washer that was broken--they did try to work with us on this and graciously offered to wash clothes for us--and the dishwasher that we only discovered was broken as we went to press ""start"" the morning we were set to check out. These were minor inconveniences, but still a little inconvenient when those are two main benefits of renting an entire house. 

The other note I would be aware of is that a lot of sound comes through from the apartment above. The first few days there were people staying who liked late nights and lots of giggling. It was very difficult for us to fall asleep--especially still on East Coast time. The second group that stayed was not as bad, but we still heard every step they took or joke they told. The red bedroom is also a bit warm at night.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and really appreciated the lengths that Rose and Glen went through to accommodate us and communicate despite their own change in plans. I would recommend this place to others for sure, just beware of the noise factor."
38571	226495	9.0	9.0	40895826	Great little basement apartment. It remained pleasant, despite the record-breaking heat wave. There were box fans to keep the air moving, but opening windows at night kept the temperature down. The location is convenient to several neighborhood shopping areas and an easy trip downtown. We could occasionally hear the family upstairs, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. We would stay here again when visiting our family.
38572	226495	9.0	9.0	42135918	Nice apartment not too far from the main Ballard restaurant/bar/market area. Glen was friendly and easy to communicate with; he met us at the unit, let us check in a little early in order to get to an event, and even recommended restaurants and a Lyft driver. The apartment was clean and well appointed with two nice outside areas. My only complaint would be that the walls are pretty thin and the people staying (or living- I wasn't sure if it was a rental or home) upstairs were loud, stomping around early in the morning and late at night.
38573	226495	9.0	9.0	43940079	Host was very accommodating. Property was clean and fully stocked with necessities and any inquiries were responded to quickly. Great location.
38574	226495	9.0	9.0	45264323	"""Fun apartment"" met all expectations. The unit, smaller of two, is downstairs from a somewhat larger unit. Rose was always responsive, and was there to show us the details of our space when we arrived. With 2 bedrooms and a fold out couch in the living room, we were able to accommodate the 5 of us. One bathroom did create a bottleneck at times. ""Fun apartment"" served our needs well."
38575	226495	9.0	9.0	46138073	The place was great and the neighborhood was awesome! We had a great stAy here. At one point, rose happened to be at the place (with my welcomed permission) during a wardrobe malfunction (long story) and she went above and beyond to be helpful. I recommend this as a great affordable option to stay in Seattle!  
43046	5580773	9.0	10.0	33146788	Nilda let us know we'd be greeted by her renter living in the unit above. It was easy to get in touch with both of them. Nilda left the  the door key and an informative note describing the unit. The apartment is perfectly located in Beacon Hill near the light rail station, which makes travelling into downtown Seattle easy. The two bedroom unit was personal, clean, and cozy. The deck sits high on the property overlooking a beautiful garden-a great place to relax. Nilda was very responsive and helpful in all of our text message contact. Thanks for a great trip to Seattle! 
43047	5580773	9.0	10.0	34545897	We had a great time in Seattle. Nilda's place was conveniently located. Check in was easy even when we arrived at Nilda's place around mid night. We had a rental car so parking was a breeze. Beautiful views of the valley and rocky mountains from the backyard. Cozy and comfortable place to 3 to 4 people. It does require keeping the windows open when the temperature is a bit higher to keep the ventilation going but it works well and good sleep after windows are opened,
43048	5580773	9.0	10.0	40217074	Wonderful welcome and stay. 
43049	5580773	9.0	10.0	42699265	Nous n'avons pas rencontré Nilda mais elle a tout fait pour que notre arrivée soit facile ! Nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce quartier tranquille et très accessible à Beacon Hill, très facile de se déplacer dans le centre de Portland, à 3 minutes de la station de Link Light Rail). L'appartement est superbe, décoré avec soin et caractère, très propre et spacieux. Gros bonus pour le jardin et la très belle terrasse avec vue (ils ne figurent pas sur les photos). Cuisine spacieuse et salon cosy, en bref c'était parfait, merci Nilda !
43050	5580773	9.0	10.0	45372127	Everything was great with Nilda.  She welcomed us and even though we were very early for our check-in she had the place ready quickly.  She even told us where a great coffee shop was so we could wait.   Left our bags with Nilda.  The house was exactly as advertised.  Great internet service/wifi speed.  Nice neighborhood with a lot of stuff walking distance and VERY close to the train.
43051	5580773	9.0	10.0	50795143	Nilda's apartment is lovely and we felt at home right away. Also, Uber works perfectly in Seattle and I usually paid about 10 $ to go to downtown. Sorry for scaring you with the door again!
43052	5580773	9.0	10.0	53038654	The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
43053	5580773	9.0	10.0	55207985	We really enjoyed our stay at Nilda's. The apartment was clean, comfortable with a lot of character.  It was also the perfect location for us! We would happily stay there again!
44592	366301	9.0	9.0	36615939	We really enjoyed staying here!! The apartment has a lot of atmosphere and we felt welcome immediately. The space is very comfortable and spacious and the neighborhood is quiet, very friendly and have nice bars and coffee shops etc. The public transport options to the city is excellent and we will be happy to stay here again for our next visit to Seattle. On top of all this Dawn was very informative and helpful all through the process. Thanks!!
44593	366301	9.0	9.0	41374281	Dawn's apartment looks exactly like the pictures: filled with old world charm and personality. The unusual recent heat wave turned out to be a non issue since the airflow within the apt was sufficient. We do appreciate the extra fans Dawn provided. The bed was very comfortable with amazing pillows amazing, and the couch good for short stays. Neighborhood is residential but can get noisy from airplanes passing by overhead, neighbors (occasional), and utility trucks (occasional) . We particularly enjoy the park across the street, taking evening walks, seeing children playing, family gatherings, etc.. Going into Seattle (downtown, international district, etc) is a snap with a rather reliable city bus (#36) and even Alki Beach (#50 40min). Supermarket, library, coffee shops are, as advertised, within walking distance or a quik 5 min drive. All and all, we had a good stay. 
44594	366301	9.0	9.0	42542580	"The listing was exactly as described. The location is great, the kitchen was well stalked & it is quite roomy for a one bedroom. There was good communication from the beginning even though Dawn Marie was out of town when I came so her friend managed keys, etc. they even left sweet welcome gifts & a packet of info about the apartment/neighborhood.  

I was very happy there & would definitely recommend it to friends if they were coming to Seattle. "
44595	366301	9.0	9.0	42904960	"Dawn's apartment was the perfect spot for our two night trip to Seattle. It was well kept, peaceful and relaxing and we both appreciated her artistic and unique style. The apartment was spacious and comfortable and would be a great home base for anyone exploring the city.  The building itself is a great heritage building so it can be expected that the water pressure in the shower was a little weak and the floors creak a bit here and there, but we thought it was charming. 

We were in town to go to a Seahawks game and it was so easy to walk to the light rail station and ride just a few stops to the stadium (and just a couple more to downtown). 

Beacon Hill itself was a nice little neighbourhood with a couple of restaurants/bars, a grocery story and Jefferson Park (just across the street!) which had great views of the city. 

Dawn's friend Sarah was a great host: clear communication, great recommendations and very welcoming. 

We would not hesitate to go back to Dawn's place and give it a high recommendation. That said, if you are a light sleeper it is important to note that it is close to the trains and also under a flight path, so there is some ongoing noise, but some earplugs would probably take care of that. We weren't bothered. 

Overall - a fantastic experience. Thank you Dawn and Sarah!"
44596	366301	9.0	9.0	43391012	We didn't actually meet the host or her neighbor, but they texts were prompt and instructions were very good.  The location is a perfect jumping off point and is located in a bohemian/hipster area with lots of parks and character.  Parking wasn't as difficult as I thought, but the location is an older building so EVERYTHING squeaks including many of the floorboards.  If you're looking for new and modern, this is not the spot for you, but if you like eclectic and shabby chic then it's the perfect place.  There is no television but you have access to internet to stream movies and it works very well.  The couch makes a lot of noise, but it's really comfortable and the bed in the room is better than the one I have at home.  This is a good home base if you're moving around the city and don't want to be downtown in the middle of the mess.  The local was pretty good and easy to find.
44597	366301	9.0	9.0	43652226	Dawn was out of town so I was mainly in contact with her friend Sarah. Sarah was extremely helpful and kind. I did not get the chance to meet her but she was very responsive through text. The place is exactly as pictured. The stay was very enjoyable and finding parking was a breeze.
44598	366301	9.0	9.0	45562186	We spent two wonderful weeks at Dawn's place. Although she wasn't available, her friend Sarah coordinated everything smoothly answering questions and leaving us the keys. The apartment is large compared to other places we have stayed. The living room is filled with plants and vintage music.  The kitchen seems to have everything. The Beacon Hill neighborhood has interesting history, a grocery store, a library, and sound link station all within 15 minutes walking.  Just down the street there are nice places to eat and drink coffee. Although the clothes washer wasn't available, Dawn provided directions to the laundromat that served us well.  I recommend Dawn's place and would stay there again.

45883	7936712	9.0	9.0	44378451	Beautiful condo, comfortable beds and lots of natural light. Fully equipped kitchen. Host was extremely responsive and easy to work with. Conveniently located near the park and bakery/coffee shop. Very happy with the property and will stay here again next time in Seattle. 
45884	7936712	9.0	9.0	45332958	Jolanta was very welcoming and easy to work with.  When we had questions she responded quickly.  The apartment is very nice and comfortable.  While the location isn't really central, it is very easy to get to by car or bus and near a lot of conveniences such as U-Village shopping center and a deli/coffee shop on the corner.  The park across the street is nice and easily accessible.  The covered parking was nice to have in rainy weather, though the spot was a little tight.  We would happily stay there again.  
45885	7936712	9.0	9.0	45618495	It was a dream! Spotless and chic with huge windows and tons of room and walking distance to the cutest bakery and beautiful walking trails at the U of W. Jolanta was friendly, attentive and so sweet. Next time I'm back in Seattle, I know where I will be staying!
45886	7936712	9.0	9.0	46032207	We had a wonderful experience staying at the Magnuson Park Condominium.  Jolanta was very attentive and welcoming.  The condo was very clean, comfortable and spacious.  Just perfect for my needs.
45887	7936712	9.0	9.0	46522689	We had a great experience - beautiful apartment in a lovely neighborhood, with a very responsive host. Would definitely recommend!
45888	7936712	9.0	9.0	48741308	"Jolanta is really a wonderful host. She's very kind and passion!! 

As we are four girls with poor English ability, but she is patient and helping us step by step through each of our question. 

Her condo is very comfortable, clean and well prepared. Supermarket is also close to it and we can get everything we need for our daily use easily. 

If we have another chance to go Seattle again, I'll definitely choose Jolanta's condo to stay! Moreover, she drives us to the airport by her big toy Hammer 2!! 

Jolanta's condo is really your best choice when staying in Seattle! We have very good experience for the past three weeks! Thanks so much Jokanta~~"
45889	7936712	9.0	9.0	49379168	good place to be !! 
45890	7936712	9.0	9.0	55355420	"This is a great space!  Really well done up for Air BnB guests, and Jolanta the host could not have been more accommodating.  We had an extended stay here, and we truly could not have asked for a better scenario for ourselves.   The Burke-Gilman trail is literally right behind the Condo complex, and Warren Magnuson Park is walkable as well.  (Which is right on the water.)  The exceptionally almost floor to ceiling windows allow for an amazing view overlooking Sandpoint way.  (And don't worry no one is opposite you looking in.  The inside of the condo looks freshly remodeled and whether or not it was, it does feel that way, which is nice.

This is a no brainer - great place to stay.  Cheers, Nicole"
45891	7936712	9.0	9.0	55825726	Listing was as described in a charming walkable neighborhood.  Beautiful, clean, comfortable, and very safe.  Jolanta was attentive and detail-oriented.  I had a great experience and will definitely use this place again should the opportunity arise.  Thank you!  
45892	7936712	9.0	9.0	56784154	A fabulous place to stay!  This Magnuson Park condo was a perfect place for me to stay for a week of work in the area.  It was clean, comfortable, well decorated, and in a safe area.  The kitchen is appointed with all of the dishes and cookware that one might need.  Jolanta’s communications were clear and very welcoming.  I will be staying again!
45893	7936712	9.0	9.0	57133283	The house is clean and cozy. It is a little bit hard to find at first, but some very friendly neighbor help us find the house. The house is same as the pictures, and very homy.I definitely love the house and Jolanta is very helpful and sweet. It is unfortunately we don't have a chance to meet her, but she is definitely a nice woman. We enjoy our stay very much. 
51102	486344	9.0	9.0	1576215	The room is perfect and clean, and the traffic is also very convenience! I would like to go again if have chance!
51103	486344	9.0	9.0	1645241	Lara and David were very kind, fun, easy to get along with and hospitable. They gladly left the key for me to in a hidden location so that I may access the house while they were not home upon my arrival. The room was cozy and adequate for a short stay, and the house was very clean. They even have a dog, so if you're a dog lover, then you'll enjoy staying here!
51104	486344	9.0	9.0	1699607	My stay was pieceful and comfortable, although I only stayed two nights, and didn't get to see much of the city.  If your stay is brief, and you want to see the more diverse parts of Seattle, I would recommend chatting with Lara or David first - they are very friendly.  The 120 bus outside takes you straight downtown.  I would recommend using a bus tracking site to determine the arrival time, since it arrives once every 20 - 25 min.
51105	486344	9.0	9.0	1721631	I was in town for a Wedding and needed a place to crash for the night. Ashley's basement room was perfect, and a great deal. Nice people to stay with!
51106	486344	9.0	9.0	1800127	"The room was very nice - the bed was comfy and cozy, and Lara was very friendly and made things easy on me (let me do a load of my laundry, keep things in the fridge, etc).  The hosts were out a lot - which made me feel like I often had the place to myself, which was great. 

It's a quick & easy bus ride into downtown, or to Alki Beach.  It's also very easy to take the lightrail & bus to/from the airport to the house - which can save you about $35 in cab fare.  I would definitely recommend this place to others. "
51107	486344	9.0	9.0	1838958	I was in downtown Seattle for a conference this past week, and I was able to stay here for 5 days for the same price a hotel would have cost for one night. The house is 3 stories, clean and quite cool; the bus stop is a 30 second walk away and will get you to downtown in 15 minutes. Lara helped me get settled very quickly and helped me navigate Seattle (and the public transit system) throughout my visit. This is a great place to stay for anyone visiting the Seattle area. 
51108	486344	9.0	9.0	1919785	I had a great stay with Lara and David in Seattle for 3 days, with a car you can reach downtown in 12 Minutes. A good seperate room, interesting talks in the evening, I defenitly would come back. Thank you. 
51109	486344	9.0	9.0	2011213	Lara and David were friendly and helpful.  Their place is delightful and clean - a 3 storey townhouse in West Seattle.  It lived up to its description and photos and is situated in a pretty, pleasant and quiet part of Seattle.  There are bus stops to downtown almost at the front door and Seattle is easy to nvaigate by foot and public transport.  It is easy to get to their place from either the Greyhound terminal or airport by public transport and quite inexpensive.  The waterfront and anywhere near the water in Seattle is beautiful and there is much to see and do.  Their place was quiet and due to their working odd shifts, they were not often there.  Even when they were, they spent most of their time on the third floor, so the place was always very quiet.  I have no hesitation in recommending their place to anyone who wishes to visit Seattle and if I ever returned, I would want to stay there again.
51110	486344	9.0	9.0	2058950	Great quiet location, nice dog,  was there for three nights.   The dog owns the couch, but he'll share. 
51111	486344	9.0	9.0	2153448	I stayed three days at Lara's place. The room was very comfy and it was a pleasure to talk with Lara.
51112	486344	9.0	9.0	2440429	I stayed at this cute townhouse for a week. The room is small, but I don't really need much space either. Parking on the street, close to downtown and alki beach. David and Lara are very nice. The dogs are super sweet. The only thing that was a little disapponiting is the shared bathtube was clogged during the whole time I was there. It was really incomvenient. 
51113	486344	9.0	9.0	3459550	I just needed a simple room for 2 weeks when I moved to Seattle,  and Lara's place fit the bill perfectly. The hosts were gracious, and I can unreservedly recommend this place if you need a no frills place to lay your head.
51114	486344	9.0	9.0	3597836	My trip to Seattle was very short notice. I was literally at the airport trying to find a place to stay. Lara's place was a great find. Affordable, quaint and cozy the room is separated from the rest of the house, so I could come and go as a pleased without having to worry about disturbing anyone. (The room also has its own thermostat, for those chilly Seattle nights) Lara and David were also very nice and respectable. The bus stop was half a block away. The ride into downtown and all the tourist attractions was just 15 minutes. Highly recommended. You must be a dog lover.
51115	486344	9.0	9.0	3810623	Lara and David are great. Photos and description are very accurate. The room was perfect for my needs. 
51116	486344	9.0	9.0	4788017	"When it came to move 700 miles away to Seattle, I stumbled into this room offering while my own rental opened up.   Great location right in West Seattle with easy access to the freeway (and to top it off there's a great local coffee shop very close by).  
The house and neighborhood were very quiet, I never had an issue getting a good nights sleep (and this is over the course of 3 weeks).  The 2 pups are well behaved and friendly, and while the room is not as large as some, it's plenty big enough and cozy.

Lara and David were great to rent from, was a great experience."
51117	486344	9.0	9.0	5227227	The room is nice and quiet as its description. Lara and David are really nice and it was pleasant stay.
51118	486344	9.0	9.0	5888858	Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.
51119	486344	9.0	9.0	6056037	Lara and David were excellent hosts. I stayed in their private room for 7 days and it was everything that I needed. The location is great, close to downtown, a block from direct public transportation to anywhere you'd want to go, and West Seattle is a nice little area to explore as well. The room was clean and large enough for my needs. No need to think twice about staying with Lara and David in West Seattle! 
51120	486344	9.0	9.0	6122205	David was a fantastic host; the accommodation was very welcoming! Perfect position to visit seattle; easy ride to towndown (15min); awesome coffee and muffins are guaranteed in the neighborhood cafe  :-) everytime again!!
51121	486344	9.0	9.0	7609339	Lara and David are such awesome and chill people. Very accommodating and super friendly. The place is at a great location if you need to commute to downtown Seattle by bus. And not to forget their awesome dog, Carlo! 
51122	486344	9.0	9.0	7855678	I was very pleased to stay with Lara and David in North Delridge for about 10 days.  Their location is about 20 minutes from either downtown Seattle or Burien depending on which way you choose to go on the 120 Metro bus.  Within short walking distance, I could reach either of two coffee shop, two mini-markets, and a well maintained Vietnamese restaurant.  As for my room, I found it to be very adequate for my needs.  It was quiet and easily warmed up by using the wall thermostat.  The WiFi did need to be restarted occasionally but this was easily achieved by unplugging the router upstairs.  I was especially impressed by Scarlet who occasionally came to clean the apartment.  She was very thorough.  
51123	486344	9.0	9.0	8753736	My stay went well.  I was only there in the evening and all was very quiet.  I missed getting to meet Lara.  It is in a residential area, a distance from resteruants and stores...a car would be helpful but the bus is nearby.  
51124	486344	9.0	9.0	16754469	"Amazing amazing amazing place to stay for nights!!
The place is so clean and comfy!
Check in was easy , and they have a lovely dog!!
Totally recommend it !"
51125	486344	9.0	9.0	18725855	Clean, comfortable, good hosts. Great location for commute downtown.  Quiet neighborhood. Good experience for my first airbnb.
51126	486344	9.0	9.0	19042664	Lara and David were very nice, helpful, and welcoming. Lara communicated well beforehand. Carlo, the dog, is a love. A half hour trip to downtown but bus service is good and close. Interesting to be in a real residential neighbourhood. Bed is good- slept like a log.
51127	486344	9.0	9.0	23189050	Had a great time at Laura-Ashley's place and everything went smoothly. Dog is super nice. :) 
51128	486344	9.0	9.0	28622629	Immensely enjoyed my time with Lara and her roommate. The house is very nice, they're very friendly and quiet! The room is advertised and the bed is as comfy as you could imagine. Also, Carlo (their dog) is amazing! Would definitely recommend. 
51129	486344	9.0	9.0	29075241	Lara-Ashley was a wonderful host. The room was cozy and quiet and the bed was comfortable. The toilet was right at the top of the stairs on the second level. The full bath was on the third level. I would definitely stay again and I would highly recommend it for others.
51130	486344	9.0	9.0	29715280	It was a great time! Lara and David were very cool! Just nice people. The room was great, it was all I needed. Thanks guys!
51131	486344	9.0	9.0	29897019	What a great experience! Laura and Dave are super cool people, very laid back. Carlo the dog is sweet. The room was perfect and comfortable. It was all I needed:) I highly recommend!
51132	486344	9.0	9.0	30163230	I had to come in very late and Lara was very accommodating. My trip involved early raising and late nights. So really I just slept there. That being said, the room was well taken care of and quiet. I would stay there again. 
51133	486344	9.0	9.0	30346954	Another great experience, would stay again for sure! Thanks guys!
51134	486344	9.0	9.0	30432023	Another great experience! Thanks guys!
51135	486344	9.0	9.0	30651105	It's a great place to stay. Would stay again. Very comfortable with amenities.  
51136	486344	9.0	9.0	32259468	Pretty comfortable room
51137	486344	9.0	9.0	32442049	"Lara was very welcoming, friendly and just a perfect all around host. My first experience and won't be my last. Place was very clean and organized, cute friendly puppy and easy to get to. The day bed is large (I'm 6'3"" and fit just fine) and comfortable. Highly recommended for staying just outside the city only 5 min from downtown. You'll definitely see me again :)"
51138	486344	9.0	9.0	40671666	Lara was kind and welcoming; she answered all my questions and made me feel at home.  It was bonus having the half-bath upstairs to myself (had not expected that!).  The room is small but comfortable and conducive to a good night's sleep; I do wish there had been a desk lamp for the desk, however.  There are little fans that help keep the room fresh & airy.  Parking is good, the apartment is easy to find, and the wireless connection easy & seamless.  Lara was really nice & lent me her travel iron; also I was able store my food in her fridge, which had plenty of space.  The Ritz it ain't, but quite OK for my needs & the price is certainly right.  Thanks Lara! 
51139	486344	9.0	9.0	44634868	The listing was accurate, my room is very peaceful and I have a lot of privacy to myself. The sheets and covers are better looking than in the picture. It's very convenient to commute from this place, at least I find many major bus lines that run through right in front of this house. The kitchen is huge and you have your own bathroom (with no shower, however). Shower is shared. Their dog Carlo is extremely friendly and it was a good stay.
51140	486344	9.0	9.0	44970582	This was quite a nice visit. The home was easy to find, and more importantly, very comfortable. I was welcomed upon arrival, and shown around. The room was situated in the home such that I came and went without much hassle and any thought of bothering the hosts. The dog was quite large, yet very friendly. If you are looking for a quiet, nice place to stay while in Seattle, I highly recommend this listing.  
51141	486344	9.0	9.0	45348306	Nice place to stay. Great price for close location on bus line to downtown Seattle. Thanks
51142	486344	9.0	9.0	46084379	Great room with easy access to West Seattle. Felt very comfortable from the moment I got there.
51143	486344	9.0	9.0	47793365	This was my first Airbnb experience, and a great one. Lara was super friendly and accommodating. The room is quiet and comfortable.  And if you happen to like dogs: they have the sweetest one!
51144	486344	9.0	9.0	48934754	Lara Ashley's place was great! She was quick to respond to any of my questions and made the check in process super fast and easy even though I got in late at night. The room as well as the rest of the house were nice and clean and just as described. The bus stop was less than a minute walk away so that was really convenient for me since I didn't have car around. Overall a great place to stay, I would recommend it to anyone traveling solo to Seattle!
51145	486344	9.0	9.0	49374834	"Lara was so friendly and welcoming! The room was very nice and I had my privacy since the main living space was upstairs. She had everything provided and the bus stop is only half a block away from the house. Not a bad commute to downtown Seattle if you're looking to live in a cheap place close to the city. Only thing to note is that you should load up your Orca card (public transport) since there aren't any locations nearby and the website takes at least 24 hrs. 

Overall, I'd definitely stay again and would recommend Lara and her beautiful house!"
51146	486344	9.0	9.0	50052456	Laura was east to reach once we got in touch, quick to respond. The place was nice, clean and private being on the first floor. Had everything I needed. Carlos the dog was really chill. It was a quick and easy bus ride into downtown, also was able to walk a ways (nice neighborhood walk) to get to some good food and music. Great view of the city from the top of the hill a couple miles out. 
55528	6646894	9.0	10.0	36452489	"We had a great time in Seattle for pride weekend! Her space was very artsy and modern! The rooftop patio was gorgeous and we took our breakfast up there one morning. The apartment was very nice, although I would say it was pretty cramped with 3 ppl and our luggage too...cooking with that many ppl and bags plus 3 cats was a bit tight. I'd suggest 2 in this space only. We were under the impression it had a bedroom but it's one open space. The patio off the unit was also asked not to be used and next time I'd prefer knowing that prior to purchase as the unit was a bit stuffy and hot and the side patio would have been nice.

There's a lounge area down the hall though and that had air conditioning too so was nice. And there's a gym so definitely a great space for the cost and location.

The location was amazing! Right in Capitol Hill and you could also walk to everything!

Taylor was very accomodating and a great host-showed us around the building and had little accessories in the home for us.

Her cats were very sweet. And her space was very clean! The building is also very safe!

Although the appt can sleep 4, it is cosy for 4 especially if all 4 persons have large luggage. Would definitely recommend for 2 visiting Seattle.

Thanks!"
55531	6646894	9.0	10.0	39803162	"Seattle is awesome! Taylor's apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle. The view from the rooftop of the building is easy to access and has an awesome view of Seattle's skyline. The rooftop deck is nice even without the view. The apartment is walking distance to a bus stop which made is very easy to get around the city.  We enjoyed the cats. (I wouldn't stay here if you dislike cats but they do keep to themselves if you are not a cat person) The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. The bed is also extremely comfortable. Taylor was very easy to contact and responded timely to any of our questions. We would recommend staying here if you are passing through Seattle.

59780	7435912	9.0	10.0	44972350	Host was great, responsive and flexible.  The location is near cafe's and restaurants and walking distance to downtown.  The place did not feel like it was worth the $120 a night fee, so I would not repeat the experience for that amount - but I would for a more reasonable amount.
59781	7435912	9.0	10.0	45850267	"Arnaud was a great host. 
We were in town for a music fest and it started pouring, he left us an umbrella to use. 
The space was great. The room was very comfortable and it was nice that it had it's own private bathroom. Everything was clean. 
Arnaud lives a few blocks away from great bars and restaurants. You're a 15 minutes bus ride away from downtown. 
Arnaud was very flexible about checking in and out, I would stay here again."
59782	7435912	9.0	10.0	47222877	"Arnaud is great guy, very helpful. His place very clean, simple but comfortable.
Great location right in the middle of Capitol Hills but away from all the noise.
Having parking included with the room is a huge plus. I'll definitely come back."
59783	7435912	9.0	10.0	52775658	The host was extremely accommodating and everything went smoothly. The place is spacious, clean, and it is pretty central in Capitol Hill, within walking distance to pretty much anything we needed, bars, restaurants, parks, yoga studios, etc... 
64993	7455706	9.0	10.0	54546500	Stacy and bob were great! I had a fire at my house and was in need of a unit for a week and Stacy was very quick to respond. When I arrived the unit was clean, and was stocked with bags of pretzels and chips to munch on, as well as a coffee maker with coffee. Nice TV with an XBOX 360 made the down time while I was there very enjoyable, and the hosts gave me my privacy but were very attentive to any questions or needs I had. Not far from the UW, with a  good price, I highly suggest staying here.
64994	7455706	9.0	10.0	55648270	Stacy and Bob were very nice. We enjoyed our stay.  Clean and comfortable we would definitely recommend choosing their place for a relaxing get away.

64996	7455706	9.0	10.0	56209279	Stacey has a very nice split level home. We stayed in the bottom level. She arranged a wonderful basket of chips, cheetos, cookies, popcorn and pretzels. Also provided toothbrushes, toothpaste and soaps. After a long 4 hour drive it was refreshing to see this kind of hospitality. After checking in, we were headed out to see the Sand Point Tennis Club and Stacey had caught us as we were leaving. She gave us a warm welcome and told us if we needed anything, we could knock on her door. We would definitely stay here again and also recommend guests to Stacey's home.
67113	8340819	9.0	9.0	47019609	"We had a really wonderful time at Suzanne’s and Dennis’s home. Suzanne and Dennis are very welcoming hosts. They made us feel right like at home (but better!) from the moment we arrived. The house is very zen, full of light and cozy. The bedroom was very nice, with an amazing spacious shower that make you feel in a natural cascade! All was perfectly clean, we had everything needed (coffee in week-end's mornings, the room has a desk, organic shower products were there too). 
The kitchen had all we needed to cook, and a space in the fridge to keep our food.
Their two dogs are adorable, very quiet. We spent 3 days in Suzanne's home during our house's hunting (we just moved from Fairbanks to Seattle) and it was the best of the four airbnb we booked in Seattle! We (a French couple in their 28-29) highly recommend this airbnb!"
67114	8340819	9.0	9.0	55253811	Suzanne's place is cozy and nice, best part is the rain shower! We stayed in the winter and it was quite warm and comfy. It is kind of near the street, the noise didn't bug me but in case you are a light sleeper.
68009	3040278	9.0	10.0	13446192	The pictures did not do this place justice. Place was beautifully decorated without leaving the comfortable homey vibe. Jenn was very responsive from the time of inquiring about her space to the time we checked out. Not only did she have a binder filled with places to go and restaurants to try, but she also took the time to tell us about everything that was nearby that was worth checking out. This space is in prime location. Everything was walkable. Space needle was a 10 minute (leisurely walking). Pike Place 25-30min walk. I would totally recommend others to stay here.
68010	3040278	9.0	10.0	13889640	"Jenn was a stellar communicator throughout the whole booking process as well as the stay. Her beautiful condo was the perfect place to get away, in the heart of Seattle. Walking distance from the space needle, restaurants and grocery stores, as well as yoga studios (home yoga is great).
  Jenn was very helpful, she provided everything needed to make the stay super comfortable. The condo itself is gorgeous, and decorated with a intellectual/romantic/worldly vibe. Lots of art on the walls, candles, and tons of books about wine and travel.
  Last but not least, the view! I was lucky to visit when the weather was just perfect and from her balcony the view of elliot bay/west seattle and the Olympic? mountains were simply stunning. 
I would definitely stay here again."
68011	3040278	9.0	10.0	14174386	We had a wonderful time and loved this place. The view was simply amazing. Jenn was so nice and everything worked out perfectly. We will certainly go back.
68012	3040278	9.0	10.0	14527506	"Hi all,

We love our stay here. Very nice, safe and nicely decorated apartment.

The place is strategically located near to happening places and main attractions.

Space needles, fish market and etc are all within walking distance.

Will stay here again once in Seattle.

68013	3040278	9.0	10.0	14748344	"A friend and I visited Seattle for the first time and Jenn's apartment looked perfect. Having made an enquiry she emailed straight back and made things very easy throughout the whole process. Although we didn't get to meet, Jenn left very easy instructions and other contacts should we need them. 
The apartment was superb! Perfect location near the space needle and just the right size. There even a couple of local beers in the fridge!
Thank you Jenn!!"
68014	3040278	9.0	10.0	14805733	"The apartment is great, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It is equipped with all you might need. It is clean and cozy and you fell at home as soon as you get in, like staying at your friend's house (but better looking than my friend's place... :^D).
The Murphy bed was extremely comfortable, a pleasant surprise as i was a little worried after my experiences in other apartments, i had a great night of sleep.
The location is also great, just a couple of blocks from the Space Needle and the Olympic Sculpture Park and close enough to Pike Place.
The pictures are very accurate, it might even say i liked it better in real life, and the view from the living room/master bedroom is beautiful.
Having an attached garage was also very comfortable, you can part and walk or take a cab pretty much everywhere.
As for our hostess, Jenn was superb. Communication was perfect and she was really helpful. When we got into the apartment we found nice notes from Jenn around the place and in the kitchen counter a very nice binder with extremely useful information on what to do, see, eat and drink in Seattle.
A great experience, I just wish i had stayed longer !!
Thanks for everything Jenn, I'll definitely try to stay at your place next time I'm in Seattle."
68015	3040278	9.0	10.0	14869993	This was a great find. I can't imagine a better value for the neighborhood, comfort of place, and hosting of Jenn anywhere in Central Seattle. It was almost a too good to be true sort of place. The beds were both incredible comfortable, the view fantastic, and all of the amenities offered by the host were fantastic. Building and neighborhood both incredibly safe. Large enough for four adults (two couples) to not feel cramped in the least, which was an initial concern of mine when booking, but definitely not the case. Communication with Jenn was simple and prompt. Although she made herself available for questions and help with our stay, my only real regret was not getting a chance to talk with her more, as she seemed really cool and interesting. Strongly recommend, and will hope it is available again on my next trip to Seattle.
68016	3040278	9.0	10.0	15045790	Jenn was a super host — helpful and sweet. The apartment is snug, but perfect for using as a basecamp to explore the city. There's a bus stop right out the front door and some of the most authentic Thai food, bars and a grocery store just up the block. It's a quiet, safe neighborhood very close to the Space Needle and the museums of Seattle Center, only 10 min by bus downtown and about 5 min's walk to Olympic Sculpture Park. Would highly recommend it, especially if traveling with friends or family.
68017	3040278	9.0	10.0	15141281	The apartment was clean, just as described, had a great view, and very homey! Jenn was a fantastic host, she was very proactive in communicating, offered some great recommendations, and was super professional. The location also can't be (email hidden)ny things were within walking distance or a short cab ride away. Thanks, Jenn, for making our short Seattle stay a great one!
68018	3040278	9.0	10.0	15264865	Jenn was a great host. She was really communicative before my arrival and met me at the apartment when checking in. She was full of great advice for my stay in Seattle.  Her apartment was clean, well appointed and in a really central and convenient location.
68019	3040278	9.0	10.0	15536254	We had a fantastic time staying at Jenn's! Great location close to Safeco, Century Link field, the Space Needle, Kerry Park and many great restaurants. Jenn was amazing to deal with and provided us with many suggestions on restaurants and things to do in the city. We'll definitely be back. Thanks Jenn!
68020	3040278	9.0	10.0	15648178	"What a great place! Jenn was awesome! Although we barely got to interact with her, due to our hectic schedule - Jenn was accommodating and basically got us in earlier than we originally anticipated. 

This was my first time on air BnB and what a great experience. Jenn's home was beautiful with hard wood floors. Although it was a little hot at 90degrees - my husband didn't mind at all - the night time was great with all the windows opened. 

The balcony had a great view of the ocean. Jenn was very generous and we had a great time! "
68021	3040278	9.0	10.0	15683935	Jenn's place was incredible for our girls get together.  The apartment was tidy and beautifully decorated, and the view is amazing!  We wish we'd had more time to sit on the patio and enjoy the view!  Thank you Jenn!
68022	3040278	9.0	10.0	15871435	Great apt - great size & GREAT views from the apt (we sat on the balcony both evenings we stayed & watched the amazing sunset). Buses for downtown & capitol hill leave from outside the door. We got the monorail back from downtown which is a 5 min walk from the apt (beside space needle). Jenn has a great welcome pack & a welcoming note encouraging use of all facilities. I never met Jenn but her friendly nature was apparent and her home is lovely.
68023	3040278	9.0	10.0	16248862	Host provided a ton of information regarding sightseeing in the city, as well as availability for questions from us. Great option for walking distance to anywhere in the seattle centre. The apartment was very clean, had great views and comfortable beds!
68024	3040278	9.0	10.0	16305057	Jenn was very helpful when we arrived as we were confused about getting in.  It was so great to have a secure parking space in the middle of the city with bus access and walking.  A couple of great restaurants close by (the Greek one especially) but walking to Pikes market was easy which we love to do.  The view is indeed spectacular and the rooms very comfortable.   We had an extra person join us at the last minute from Brazil and Jenn was very accommodating.   
68025	3040278	9.0	10.0	16666374	Jenn's Seattle place was great, clean and efficient with easy access to public transport and sightseeing destinations.  She was easy to contact and helpful throughout our stay.
68026	3040278	9.0	10.0	16770345	"Jenn's place is amazing, it's clean and tidy and the view is to die for! It's in a rear location and Jenn was very helpful with pointing out all the best locations to visit. I also love the book she has put together with everything to do in Seattle! There is no way you would miss anything that is happening!
Highly recommended. 
Thanks again! "
68027	3040278	9.0	10.0	16985457	The apartment was perfectly located, well-appointed, bright, comfortable, clean and felt very welcoming.  Jenn was really helpful with arrival instructions and overall incredibly friendly and helpful.  We would stay there again in a second upon a return trip to Seattle.
68028	3040278	9.0	10.0	17273269	Jen, you are an awesome host, the apt and it's beautiful view is really an great experience. The airbnb concept is vacation changing, it is the future. My family was more comfortable, vacation experience starts instantly, location is perfect. Apt really cool, million dollar view, Seattle is just great! We really had a great time and really appreciate your hospitality. 
68029	3040278	9.0	10.0	18054195	Jenn is great as a host.  Her place was just as the pictures show & the view is amazing!  The building is secure & having our own parking was a huge bonus.  If you are going to be in Seattle, you can't go wrong with this place.  Convenient to everything and only a short walk to the waterfront!
68030	3040278	9.0	10.0	18122959	"Exactly as advertised.
Clean, safe, accommodating, friendly and close to pier 69 for our trip to Victoria.
Highly recommend "
68031	3040278	9.0	10.0	18310234	"We didn't get to meet Jenn because we were late arriving in Seattle, but she was immediately available by phone every time we called or texted with a question. She gave us great restaurant recommendations and provided lots of information in the apartment about what to do in Seattle and how best to enjoy her home and neighborhood. And having a safe reserved parking spot was incredibly convenient.
The apartment is beautifully furnished with comfortable beds and linens and provided plenty of room for the four of us to relax and enjoy ourselves. A twenty-minute walk got us to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle is even closer.
I highly recommend Jenn's Seattle place and would love to go back again some day."
68032	3040278	9.0	10.0	18409728	We only stayed briefly for one night, so we didn't have much interaction with the host, but the place was great and everything went smoothly.  I would be willing to stay here for a longer duration on a future trip.  The place is well kept and beds are comfortable.  The parking space in the garage below is super convenient.  There are decent restaurants within a close walk.  Seems like a good choice if you want to spend some time in Seattle and need 2 bedrooms.
68033	3040278	9.0	10.0	18537605	Jenn's apartment was just lovely to stay in. Super-comfy beds !  and everything could need at hand .  Jenn was there to meet and greet us and left us lots of info about Seattle.  The apartment is walking distance to all the tourist attractions and in a safe neighborhood. We had an absolute ball in Seattle and would recommend Jenn's appartment and Seattle to anyone thinking of going to Seattle!
68034	3040278	9.0	10.0	18651691	"Jenn's place was lovely!  From booking the condo initially to when we arrived Jenn made it a simple and fun experience!  Jenn accommodated an earlier than normal check in mid-afternoon and met us at the condo promptly after letting her know we were 15 minutes away.  The parking spot was great to save money on downtown Seattle parking and she gave us detailed instructions on how to enter and exit the building and to use the garage.

Once we arrived Jenn gave us a quick tour of her place, let us know where things were we might need and gave us some recommendations on some good restaurants and nightlife spots close to her home.  The location was perfect to see the Space Needle, Chihuly Glass and Garden exhibit and Seattle Center!  

Seattle was a great time and the condo was perfect for myself and my siblings who were visiting.  The next time I am in Seattle I will definitely look to stay here again :)"
68035	3040278	9.0	10.0	18937786	If you visit Seattle, staying with Jenn is a MUST. Beyond having an unbelievable charming and comfortable condo (with laundry!), Jenn is the kind of host you dream of having in a new city. If you want the DIY approach to travel, her guidebook of things to do and places to eat will set you off on the perfect path to self-selected exploration. If you'd like something a little more hand's on / the true local experience, Jenn has genius ideas and tips for that too. You can't ask for a more walkable location, inviting condo, or delightful host - I can't wait to stay with her again.
68036	3040278	9.0	10.0	19016491	Jenn was an amazing host and made us feel right at home. If we had any questions, she always answered back right away. The apartment was beautiful and clean. The views were  wonderful. Also, Jenn provided us with a great book that had everything from coupons to local restaurants to how to check out. It was a great experience.
68037	3040278	9.0	10.0	19075655	Great location with good view. Jenn is a very friendly host and the appartment is amazing! The location is perfect for exploring Seattle by walk. Jenn, thank you so much!
68038	3040278	9.0	10.0	19192214	We spent 2 nights in Jenn's condo, prior to an Alaskan cruise. The location is perfect, just  a one mile walk to Pike Market, and plenty of restaurants nearby. You cannot beat the view, either. Would be glad to stay here next time I am in Seattle.
68039	3040278	9.0	10.0	19591931	"What a wonderful place. Great view and an easy walk to so many of Seattle finest attractions; the Space Needle, Museums; Pike Place, Sculpture park and many more. Jenn was a wonderful hostess. She stopped in to make sure all was good and gave us some great ideas of places to go and things to do. The building is very secure and the underground parking spot is clutch! Overall it was a great find. Jenn was great and the apartment and location couldn't have been better. 
Thanks!"
68040	3040278	9.0	10.0	19734969	My husband, William and I were so lucky to stay at Jenn's condo for our first airbnb experience! Her home is absolutely beautiful and the location perfect. We parked the car in her garage and walked everywhere. The kitchen is well-equipped and the entire place is charming with unique art work and comfortable sitting areas. The view is remarkable. Although we didn't get to meet Jenn, we'd love to at some point...and next time we're in Seattle, we'll try to book with Jenn again. She made sure it was easy for us to get into her place. Her communication was great. We felt very welcomed and right at home. Since our stay in Seattle was the beginning of two weeks of airbnb stays in 5 different homes, we were grateful for this great space and positive experience.  Thanks again, Jenn!
68041	3040278	9.0	10.0	20001913	"Our stay at Jenn's apt. was great! The location of 
her apt was very important to us. It allowed us to
walk to most places. The apt was very comfortable, everything one could need was available - except for a toaster!!??- It is tastefully
furnished, and the view of course is ""Amazing""!
Returning to Seattle is our wish, should we do so
Jenn's place will be considered. 
Thank you for making our stay enjoyable.

68042	3040278	9.0	10.0	20184402	Great view and really great location. Walking distance to Space Needle and Chihuly Glass Garden, 5 dollar Uber ride to anything in downtown, and a bust stop downstairs. Apartment is equipped exactly as listed, very comfortable and includes anything you would need on a Seattle trip. Jenn was very helpful and accommodating in the check in process. My friends and I would definitely choose to stay here again if we return to Seattle.
68043	3040278	9.0	10.0	20548864	"We fell in love with this place the moment we walked through the door.  It had everything we needed to feel comfortable after an exhausting week of cruising the San Juan islands.  Our hostess left explicit and timely directions on how to access her unit.  With the help of her copious materials on Seattle, what to do, where to go and where to eat we enjoyed our brief visit to the Emerald City to the fullest!

The sleeping accommodations were wonderful and the kitchen was well equipped. The unit is conveniently located close to Seattle Center and Space Needle and offers an expansive view of Elliot Bay with the comings and goings of ferries and cruise ships.  There is public transportation on the street in front of the unit.  While parking was offered to us, we felt no need for a car as buses took us wherever we wanted to go.

My son, his wife and I hope we can return again for a longer stay.

68044	3040278	9.0	10.0	20626558	The apartment is located just a short walk from the Space Needle which was the main reason my family chose to stay there. The design and decoration in the apartment was lovely and very homey. Jenn was out of town and wasn't able to meet us in person but by simply staying there makes me feel like I already know her. It really reflects her character and I think that is what makes the apartment feel so homey. The apartment is clean and secure. I only wished I planned by stay in Seattle longer. I will definitely return and stay in this apartment again.
68045	3040278	9.0	10.0	20987884	I was in Seattle for a wedding with a few friends, and we stayed at Jenn's place for about a week. The apartment is absolutely wonderful, with a great view of the Sound. Jenn was great - made check-in/check-out extremely easy, and was always easy to reach with questions. The apartment is in a very central location, and within walking distance of great restaurants/shops, etc - we had a lovely time! I've recommend this to anyone interested in finding a great location for their Seattle travels.  
68046	3040278	9.0	10.0	21028789	This was our second trip to Seattle and the first time with our 7 and 8 year old boys. Jenn's place was perfect for the four of us. Jenn is very friendly, welcoming, and thoughtful. She even helped us recover a stuffed wolf that got left behind after we checked out. It is a 5 minute walk to Seattle Center which made it easy to check out the Children's Science Museum. My only regret is that we were only able to spend one night here. Next time we come to Seattle we'll definitely be checking if Jenn has availability. 
68047	3040278	9.0	10.0	21103381	"Jenn was a great hostess and was very attentive.  I was amazed at how communicative she was throughout the process at staying at her place and how willing she was to supply information on good local restaurants, bars, etc.   The apartment was beautiful with a lot of cute details and very nice decor.  The location was was also amazing... a short walk to the space needle, chihuli exhibit, the Bill and Science Museum, Melinda Gates foundation, etc.  Centrally located in downtown.
"
68048	3040278	9.0	10.0	21196911	Greatly enjoyed our stay at Jenn's listing over the weekend. Although we did not meet she was always prompt in communicating and she was a great resource. To top it all off she was very accommodating and understanding of some last minute requests that we had. We really enjoyed this neighborhood as there were lots of walkable places nearby and if you are not a walker (or if you just get a little lazy like we did) downtown is just a short/cheap cab ride away (we took a Lyft, it was $5). The best part about this listing was THE VIEW! Definitely enjoyed relaxing and watching the sunset out of the living room. Nice amenities, comfy beds and a great view! 
68049	3040278	9.0	10.0	21317904	Jenn was an amazing hostess. She was very efficient in getting back to me with any questions I had. She made our stay very welcoming! I would definitely recommend her abode anytime you want to enjoy the sights and scenery of Seattle!!!! Great views from the Condo too!
68050	3040278	9.0	10.0	21376886	"Location, Location, Location! as promised by sweet Jenn. Although we didn't get to meet her in person every aspect of Jenn's communication (response time, restaurant recommendations, local attractions, etc) were""spot on"" as was our expectation of her delightful condo. A quick 2 block walk to the Space Needle, IMAX, Chuhuilly Exhibit, Monorail,music, coffee houses and restaurants all situated in a very walkable,safe neighborhood-or take a short 5 minute cab ride to Pikes Market. Ride the Monorail ($2.25 p/p) that whisks you to the motherlode of shopping options (Nike Town, Nordy's, Macy's, high-end and funky, art galleries, etc-we did our level best to support the local economy!) The condo is nicely decorated with all the amenities we could have asked for and more. Nice to have the secure parking garage, although we never moved our car as everything was so accessible on foot. A generous, honest hostess. We felt like we were staying in the home of a good friend. Jenn even arranged for great weather-although we can't promise that for every Seattle visitor! We will be back.

68051	3040278	9.0	10.0	21462641	Jenn was a fabulous host. She answered all questions we had leading up to our trip in a very timely manner and was super helpful. Her apartment was gorgeous, very inviting, and super comfortable. The view was even better than expected and we couldn't have asked for a better location. We walked everywhere we wanted to go during our 2 day stay. I would definitely recommend this lovely apartment as the perfect centrally located place to stay while visiting Seattle.
68052	3040278	9.0	10.0	21652831	Everything Jenn suggested was spot on. The apartment was exactly as described; amazing view and amazing location! I would highly recommend this listing for anyone visiting for the first time.

When we walked in the door, we relaxed instantly. There were little post-it notes all over with comments, smiles, hints, etc. She left a book on the counter with tons of area recommendations. The place is very small, but this added to the coziness. I would definitely head back up to Seattle and stay at Jenn's place! Thank you, Jenn, for a wonderful stay!
68055	3040278	9.0	10.0	22356053	I've never been in this area of Seattle, and I really enjoyed it!  Close to Pike Place Market.  Very nice, secure building with underground parking garage.  The small but nicely appointed apartment was cozy and welcoming.  The view from the balcony was beautiful!  We walked to many cute shops and delicious restaurants, and there are grocery stores nearby as well.  We did not cook, but there is a full kitchen with anything you might need.  The master bed was super comfy.  I would rent this apartment again.  The description listed by the renter is accurate.
68056	3040278	9.0	10.0	22494574	Jenn's apartment is very nice and exactly as described. Instructions for everything were very clear with a detailed book of attractions and places to eat.

68060	3040278	9.0	10.0	23503438	First, Jenn's condo is a great location. Walk to tons of things, and a central location for places you need to drive to north or south. Second, what a great view! Jenn was great with responsive communication and this 2 bedroom condo was perfect for me, my wife and our 3yo over the Thanksgiving holiday. Great instructions, along with a ton of recommendations for nearby amenities. We come back often, and we'll check to see if Jenn's place is available before we search for other options.
68061	3040278	9.0	10.0	23570960	Jenn's place is super cute and in a perfect location... Especially if you are going to an event at the Key Arena! We will definitely be staying here again!

Jenn made us feel welcome, and as our travel and arrival plans changed, was quick and responsive to make sure our arrival was easy--even though a delayed train had us arriving at 1:30am!   Really wonderful to finally arrive, and find a beautiful living space, comfortable beds, kitchen ready for our use.
  
 It's a great location for getting around Seattle and yes, amazing view.  Jenn was available for questions and help at any time, but we found her notebook with suggestions and guidance met all our needs."
68065	3040278	9.0	10.0	23957768	Jenn was so helpful and responsive as our travel plans changed -- adding and subtracting a family member guest, arranging a late arrival, accommodating an even later arrival due to delayed train!  When we finally arrived we found a warm, lovely living space, perfectly appointed, beautiful view, great beds, kitchen with every possible need considered.  Jenn provided a binder of information on restaurants and other logistics.  The location was ideal for us: the Seattle Center and Seattle Rep Theater is within easy walking distance, and the bus stop for downtown is right outside the door. Wonderful restaurants nearby - we were very happy!
68066	3040278	9.0	10.0	24022640	This was our first air B and B stay and the bar is set unbelievably high. Awesome location, comfortable place, so inviting and warm. I not only would use air B and B again but I would love to stay at Jenn's place. 
68067	3040278	9.0	10.0	24125937	Perfect location for a stay in Seattle: views of the Puget Sound, walking distance to the Pikes Market and the Queen Ann neighborhood. The parking spot makes it easy for everybody arriving by car to safely store the car every night. The apartment was spacious and equipped with everything listed. We had a great stay, thanks Jenn.
68068	3040278	9.0	10.0	24229906	Staying in Jenn's apartment was a delight.  It is in an excellent location that felt very safe and was within walking distance of most of the places we wanted to go.  Inside, it is very comfortable and attractive, and its wonderful view of the Sound makes it feel much larger than it actually is.  It also has the kind of TV and music devices one would want.  While it is small, the three adults in our party did not feel cramped.  The bed in the second bedroom is not as comfortable as in the main bedroom, but the other features of the apartment compensate for this, unless one has a significant difficulty with sleep.  Jenn was very easy to communicate with regarding our visit.  Since we arrived later than planned, we were not able to meet her, checking in was a snap anyway.  I would highly recommend this apartment.
68069	3040278	9.0	10.0	24458668	"Jenn was a fantastic host and was available to answer any questions that we had at any time. Jenn was able to share her knowledge of the area and suggest things and do and transportation. 

The unit is in a fantastic location and it is very easy to get around. We stayed as a group of four- 2 adults and 2 children and found the unit great for our needs."
68070	3040278	9.0	10.0	24520820	Great time, great apartment and location. Easy to find and we all really enjoyed our stay. 
68071	3040278	9.0	10.0	24686255	We had a great time at Jenn's apartment! The apartment was clean and roomy, the location was awesome like everyone else has said. The check-in and check-out process was seamless and easy, despite us not knowing exactly when we'd arrive and our really early morning departure. She also recommended 2 really delicious restaurants that I look forward to returning to on my next trip to Seattle. I would definitely recommend Jenn's apartment to someone staying in Seattle.
68072	3040278	9.0	10.0	24704244	"What an amazing location!  Jenn was so gracious and easy to work with.  She was incredibly accommodating, and really made us feel at home.  The condo has an amazing view, and is walking distance to so much that Seattle has to offer.  We stayed with my parents, a tween, and a toddler.  My dad said that the pillows in the ""blue room"" were the best he's ever slept on, and asked me to ask Jenn where we could find them.  :-)

We really enjoyed Jenn's space, and will definitely stay again the next time we are visiting Seattle!"
68073	3040278	9.0	10.0	24850967	Jenn is an accommodating and responsive host. We loved her cozy condo with a great view. She provided us with excellent detail to park and get checked in. We were close to the Seattle Center with lots of really good restaurants. Jenn helped make our visit to Seattle both fun and friendly. We will happily recommend her to our friends and come back again. Thanks Jenn. 
68074	3040278	9.0	10.0	25248902	"This place is awesome! And Jenn is awesome too. I'd rent this place every time. Everything was as advertised - great location, beautiful and clean apartment, and very reasonable rates. AND I had easy, positive communication with Jenn. 
THANK YOU JENN!

68075	3040278	9.0	10.0	25330584	Everything is like what's described! Cozy apartment with amazing view. Jenn has a book that documents everything you need during your stay in Seattle, very helpful! 
68076	3040278	9.0	10.0	25632221	Jenn was very helpful. She gave us a detailed decription of her place and helped us to get in. She responds to text in a timely fashion and is always so friendly and helpful. Her place has a georgous view and is so tastefully decorated. She provided us with everything we needed. We really enjoyed our stay here and spent a significant amount of time in door especially during the stormy weather :) we highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back again!
68077	3040278	9.0	10.0	25853641	Jenn was terrific to work with before we even got to Seattle.  She was so warm and friendly at check in and was a plethora of  great information about the city.  Really great tips on restaurants.  We absolutely loved the accommodations.  Fabulous location - we pretty much walked everywhere we wanted to go!  The view is spectacular.  We were three, and we were all extremely comfortable in her apartment.  Jenn has done a great job of making her place warm, interesting and comfy.  It was impeccably clean and well appointed.  We would highly recommend her place and would definitely return!  Thanks for a wonderful weekend, Jenn!
68078	3040278	9.0	10.0	25907069	"Jenn's place is epic. Stayed there with a friend for two nights, and it's an incredible way to experience Seattle. The place itself was spotless, and the view from the bedroom and the balcony is breathtaking; make sure to catch the sunset over the water. It's only a couple blocks walking to great food and the Space Needle, plus public transport is just a few steps away from the front door.

Jenn was extremely welcoming and gave us a quick tour of the place before leaving us with tons of great recommendations and suggestions. It's obvious that she loves the city, and it was great to share in that enthusiasm. My only regret is not having more time to spend there. I can't recommend Jenn's place highly enough!"
68079	3040278	9.0	10.0	26010245	Wow, what an incredible space! (The view!) Jenn was an amazing host, and welcomed us to Seattle in the most incredible and informed way. Her space was perfect, and just as described.
68080	3040278	9.0	10.0	26080223	"I loved this place.  It was the perfect place in the perfect location.  Jenn really scored a beautiful view, and we enjoyed every minute of it.  Unfortunately, our Super Bowl win dreams were smashed.  But this stay was a trip saver.

As a new host, I know what I need to do for my guest to have the best experience.  

Thanks Jenn"
68081	3040278	9.0	10.0	26168155	Staying at Jenns lovely place in Seattle was like being home. Quiet and comfortable but close enough to walk to many of the happening things in town. My only wish is that we could have stayed longer. Thanks Jenn.
68082	3040278	9.0	10.0	26677711	Jenn was the best host! Very attentive to our needs, she made time to meet us and make sure we were comfortable. Jenn also had great tips on areas to hike, eat & sight see.  The informational binder at the Condo was amazing & so helpful.  We loved her beautiful home, the view & the whole atmosphere. We will be sure to return, it made our trip much more enjoyable.
68083	3040278	9.0	10.0	26859294	The property was amazing.  It was in a great location.  It was totally clean and convenient to everything.  Its a great place to see Seattle from!
68084	3040278	9.0	10.0	27047933	Jenn gave us a nice orientation to the neighborhood to supplement the really-together binder she provides with many of the best (and close!) things Seattle has to offer (including some fun quirky things).  We were 2 couples coming from 2 locations so she gifted us her extra private parking spot too.  All 4 of us agreed her place was awesome and we could find nothing to not like about it.  Super nice to just hang out in, and the perfect weather meant gorgeous views of the snow-capped Olympics.   We'll be back! 
68085	3040278	9.0	10.0	27325667	"We loved our AirBnB experience with this rental!  Jenn was an excellent host from the moment our request was accepted.  She provided information about the unit and the neighborhood, provided excellent instructions to ensure a smooth check-in, and made it easy for us despite a late arrival (10:30pm).

The neighborhood was perfect for our visit to Seattle!  Walking distance to the Space Needle and numerous excellent restaurants.  The view of the Sound and Olympic Range beyond was beautiful.

"
68086	3040278	9.0	10.0	27461683	Jenn was a terrific host. She was very communicative and clear with directions on how to find her place and how to access it. She even met up with my group and explained all of the details, along with giving us some great suggestions about what to do during our time in Seattle. As for her apartment, it was absolutely perfect. Our entire group absolutely loved it, and the view is much better than the photos show. The apartment is ideally located for exploring Seattle as well, being walking distance to both Seattle Center (where the Space Needle/EMP Museum are) and Pike Place Market. I would definitely stay here again on a future visit to Seattle. 
68087	3040278	9.0	10.0	27534578	"Jenn was awesome and responsive as a host! Her condo is beautiful and had such a lovely feel to it. My husband loved its decor and we both loved the location. We walked pretty much everywhere--we loved that we were so close to everywhere we wanted to go. 

For being in the middle of the city and part of a condo complex, it was remarkably quiet and peaceful!!

I would definitely stay there again if we make it back up to Seattle!"
68088	3040278	9.0	10.0	27887030	Jenn was a fantastic host! From the beginning, she was reachable, helpful, and knowledgeable. She is full of great advice for the area, and my Seattle experience was great because of both Jenn's advice and her apartment. The apartment was clean, well-kept, and felt like a home away from home, and it was in the perfect location - near many nice restaurants and in a walkable place. I will be recommending Jenn's apartment to friends and family anytime they visit Seattle. Thanks so much, Jenn! You're awesome! :)
68089	3040278	9.0	10.0	28058045	"Jenn was great and the flat was amazing!  There really were ""Amazing views""! Jenn was very helpful and was in contact with me as soon as I submitted my request. She was quick to fill me into all of the details and checking in was a breeze. The home was put together so well, very clean and very comforting. My friends and I had a mini reunion from our trip to Spain last month and this was the best place. walking distance from anything you wanted to do and you can relax and enjoy the view of the water, space needle and PI Building. Beautiful location, great host!! And competitive pricing.

I will definitely rent again and recommend my friends to Jenn! "
68090	3040278	9.0	10.0	28160686	Great neighborhood.  Pretty close to walk to things, nice neighborhood.  The view is wonderful (better than the pictures!).  Jenn was very accommodating, and the place is lovely.  Love the balcony!
68091	3040278	9.0	10.0	28464064	We thoroughly loved our stay at Jenn's apartment during our time in Seattle! Jenn is super welcoming and friendly and provided us so with so many ideas and places in the area to visit and eat. Her apartment is super clean and in a perfect location to park your car and walk to the main attractions! Beds are also super comfy : )  Would definitely stay here again. 
68092	3040278	9.0	10.0	28611895	Jenn was incredibly hospitable and sweet. Her place was a luxury for us (and my dog!) -- very comfortable beds, amazing view, every amenity you need. Our stay in Seattle was too short, but we never had to get in the car -- so much great stuff can be reached on foot from this lovely condo. Jenn's Seattle pride is strong and she has an endless list of suggestions for places to visit. (Chihuly was fantastic! Tiny Bigs rocks!) I'd definitely seek out Jenn on another visit to Seattle. Thank you, Jenn!!!
68093	3040278	9.0	10.0	28666929	we will happily stay in this unit again. Jenn met and quickly oriented us upon arrival and also has a large binder full of useful tips about the neighborhood and seattle.  the view truly is great and there is much to do - virtually all accessed easily by foot - in the neighborhood. nothing difficult at all about this rental. it helped to make our trip very pleasant.
68094	3040278	9.0	10.0	28932896	The apartment was fantastic, exceeding all of our needs (primarily location-based). For the most part, we were able to get around without a car, though the parking space downstairs was very helpful. The apartment was well-furnished and homey. The host was extremely helpful, both in providing an abundance of good information for visitors and in making sure all our needs were met. Overall, we had a great time in Seattle, and this apartment was a big part of that.
68095	3040278	9.0	10.0	29233147	"Since I have lived in Seattle before, I knew this location was in a safe neighborhood right near Seattle Center. The building and parking were both very secure as well, and there was plenty of ""temporary"" parking when we first arrived and got familiar with the entry/exit procedures. The view is much better in real life than the picture! The owner made us feel very welcome, and we did try to schedule an in-person meeting after we arrived.  But our schedules didn't quite match up.  Nevertheless, we stayed in steady contact throughout our short 2 day stay, and did not experience any unanswered questions.  There were plenty of clean towels and informative strategically placed notes to help us out too. It was very comforting to be staying in a place that felt very much like a ""real"" home instead of just a hotel.  "
68096	3040278	9.0	10.0	29335482	Wonderful hospitality. Jenn was very attentive to our questions and made the stay very easy. Wonderful view, wonderful location!  Would highly recommend to all to stay here for a great Seattle experience. 
68097	3040278	9.0	10.0	29605923	We loved the location of this fabulous condo. The space was perfect for our group of four, and everything we needed was within walking distance. We even took our time one day and strolled all the way to Safeco Field, making some fun stops for lunch and refreshments along the way. Jenn was a very accommodating host, which made our first airbnb experience better than we could have expected. We will definitely look to stay here again. 
68098	3040278	9.0	10.0	29972281	"We were met by Jenn shortly after we arrived at her home and were able to ask lots of questions about Seattle, getting around, things to see in the neighborhood. Jenn was welcoming and knowledgeable. The condo had the view that is exactly featured on the website and it was spectacular. We loved having the small deck available but were unable to use it because of the weather. The location was ideal. We walked downtown, to the Pike Place Market and along the waterfront. 
Because we were visiting our daughter and friends we needed to rent a car. We found Hwy 99 convenient for getting into and out of town and it dropped us off a few blocks from the condo. Having parking under the building was a huge help. We are looking forward to booking this condo again in the future."
68099	3040278	9.0	10.0	30381498	Jenn, met us in person and gave us a some great ideas of what the city had to offer. She provided info, suggestions and directions to things. She was also available by text if anything came up.
68100	3040278	9.0	10.0	30861623	Best experience ever! The view is fantastic. And you have everything you need in the apartment. Jenn is very detailed and provide us a lot of stuff.(even an eye cover) We enjoyed every moment in the apartment. I would definitely recommend all my friends go this apartment if they are traveling to Seattle.   
68101	3040278	9.0	10.0	31211587	Jenn's place was AMAZING...the best location possible. She had a ton of great information on Seattle sites and restaurants throughout her place. We were never without options. Jenn had also recommended some Tom Douglass restaurants and he we hit one location and loved EVERY bit!
68102	3040278	9.0	10.0	31667644	Jenn was a very thoughtful host. It became very clear that she wanted her guest to make the most out of their trip. Very friendly with great communication throughout the stay. I greatly appreciate how she systematically put tips and instructions in the binders about how to get around and her recommendations on nearby attractions. Her place is awesome, just a short walk to the Seattle Center and very accessible to all the major attractions. I'm thankful that we got a chance to stay here and hope we will get another chance to visit this beautiful city and be her guest again.
68103	3040278	9.0	10.0	31730841	Jenn's apartment was fantastic! In a great part of town that allowed for us to park the car and walk around the entire downtown. Very clean and well equipped for 2 couples. I was very pleased with an easy check-in and check-out process. Would recommend to anyone looking in the area! Laundry is a bonus! Ohand the view, Great lil patio!
68104	3040278	9.0	10.0	31760296	Beautiful condo, perfectly located, and everything was as it should be. We loved our stay here and would again if we come back to the Seattle area.
68105	3040278	9.0	10.0	31897024	This was a perfect intro to airbnb. The apt was as described- amazing view and amazing location! Jenn was responsive about timing questions and very helpful with excellent suggestions for activities/restaurants. We felt like we were staying at a friend's place while they were out of town. Everything was comfortable and clean. Thanks Jenn!
68106	3040278	9.0	10.0	32446014	"Ótimo apartamento.
Localização excelente em Seattle. Fácil de se locomover aos principais pontos turísticos da cidade e próximo ao porto (Princess Cruise). Não usamos transporte público, mas foi possível notar que a localização do apto é boa para qualquer tipo de transporte.
Apartamento grande, ideal para 4 pessoas, não mais que isso pois tem apenas um banheiro.
Garagem boa, fácil de estacionar e segura.
A vista da sacada é muito agradável.
Jenn nos recebeu pessoalmente, mesmo nosso voo chegando depois das 21h. Jenn é uma ótima anfitriã, além da recepção deixou diversas dicas da cidade.
As toalhas eram boas e a casa é bem servida de equipamentos de cozinha."
68107	3040278	9.0	10.0	32741353	"I whish i could rate 6 stars. Everything was just perfect. Jenn is a very friendly and caring host. Her place is just amazing and right at the Space Needle! Next time we go to Seattle, we'll try to stay at Jenn's place.
"
68108	3040278	9.0	10.0	33228487	What impressed us was not only sea-view but also Jenn's indoor decoration and lots of books and info about wine. Truly everything one needs in Seattle.
68109	3040278	9.0	10.0	33491523	What can I say? My first Airbnb experience was amazing thanks to Jenn and all the special touches to make sure our stay was comfortable and fabulous. Location was perfect (walking distance to Key Arena) and check-in/check-out process was a breeze. Would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle. 
68110	3040278	9.0	10.0	33773466	"Jenn and her apartment in Queen Ann were absolutely perfect. My family and I were traveling the Pacific Northwest, and had stayed at Jenn's place. We loved the neighborhood immediately. Tons of great local and must-see restaurants right nearby. This is the perfect experience for those who don't want to be in a tourist hub OR too far outside of the city.
Listing description was more than accurate, and had more amenities than we expected.
We left for Vancouver for a weekend, and returned and it felt like home.  If that's not a home-run, I'm not sure what is."
68111	3040278	9.0	10.0	33979154	Jenn was a great help, guiding my father and I into her downtown apartment late at night as we drove from the airport, and was very kind and patient as she walked me through the steps of getting to the location and entering it. The apartment itself had everything we needed, was tidy and well furnished, and the morning view was an exceptional introduction to the city and the wider Pacific Northwest which we were to explore. A great start to our travels and a place I'd recommend to all.
68112	3040278	9.0	10.0	34282592	"Amazing view, and location,location location.
Close everything. the house was great and Jenn was there for what you needed. would stay again"
68113	3040278	9.0	10.0	34575995	"Compact condo with all you need. Absolutely a great place to stay. From the start Jenn's communication was excellent. 

Our transcontinental flight put us in Seattle early in the day but Jenn worked to get the condo ready for us early so that we could tour without the burden of our belongings. Although we weren't able to meet in person, Jenn made it easy for us to feel at home. 

Jenn's place is very comfortable, features a great view of the Sound and the Olympic Mountains when nature cooperates (as it did for us).  The condo is in a great location and Jenn's recommendations list on restaurants was quite helpful.  Jenn was always just a text message away. 

Jenn, thanks very much for your concern relative to our comfort, for your recommendations on things to do and see and for the fresh fruit!"
68114	3040278	9.0	10.0	34690264	Access was made very easy despite late arrival.   Great location with views just as promised. Much personal type stuff around the apartment which gives the definite feeling of staying in Jenn's home despite having the whole apartment to ourselves.
68115	3040278	9.0	10.0	34849101	Jenn's condo is gorgeous, it is close to so many touristy things, we walked everywhere. It truly was like staying in a friends home. Jenn's communication was amazing, she really cared about our experience in Seattle. Just remember people, you are a guest in a home, make sure you treat her home with the respect it deserves. Leave it as beautiful and clean as you found it.
68116	3040278	9.0	10.0	35382156	Although I only stayed one night at Jenn's apartment, it was still a great experience. It has a great location where you can walk to all of the major sights. Major benefit that it has a parking space - just leave your car there and walk everywhere! There was a bit of confusion in the time before we got our keys to the place and parking garage because there wasn't any available street parking nearby. One of us ended up sort of parking illegally while the other person grabbed the key. Finding the right garage door took a couple of tries too, but once we were settled in it was well worth it. While I did not meet Jenn, she was available for all of my questions. The apartment is clean, comfortable, and homey. Another benefit for me was being able to do laundry inside the apartment. Also, the view is amazing! I loved seeing the water from the living room and balcony. All in all I would definitely would recommend this place. 
68117	3040278	9.0	10.0	35535244	Jenn's condo was everything we expected and more. Description and photos are very accurate and might not due the space justice. Walking distance from downtown or a $5 Uber ride. View and beds were first class. Can't thank Jenn enough for her correspondence and hospitality . Would not think twice about staying here again. Loved our stay
68118	3040278	9.0	10.0	35665998	"Jenn is a great host! Great place! Great city!

Would definitely stay here again!"
68119	3040278	9.0	10.0	35999963	We can't say enough about Jenn and this apartment. It was perfect! Clean, comfortable and the most amazing location. We were absolutely thrilled with everything. And while we never got to meet Jenn she answered our many questions and took good care of us. 
68120	3040278	9.0	10.0	36167955	Jenn was a lovely host at an amazing apartment. She provided super tips on local eats, where to go and what to avoid. Special shoutout to the balcony views, a perfect place to watch the ferrys at sundown.  Would stay again. 
68121	3040278	9.0	10.0	36282280	Jennifer was a fantastic host!!  She was very accommodating and had tons of ideas for first time visitors. The home was exceptional!  Super comfortable beds, all you need in the home in the way of accommodations, and boy oh boy... that view!!!!  If we ever move here we will try to buy this condo from her as it was perfect in every way. We will definitely stay here again! 
68122	3040278	9.0	10.0	36814822	Jenn and Jenns place were fantastic.  Beautiful place, perfect to see the waterfront.  Jenn was extremely well organized and getting in was a breeze.  I heavily recommend staying here.
68123	3040278	9.0	10.0	36938766	Jenn was amazing.  She let us check in early, let us leave the car in the lot late, left unbelievable amounts of information about the city for us to read, and was easily reachable.  What's more, these pictures do not do this condo justice.  It is unbelievably beautiful and comfortable.
68124	3040278	9.0	10.0	37128863	Jenn was very easy to work with.  She made sure the condo was very clean upon our arrival.  She was able to be flexible with our travel schedule, making our stay that much more comfortable.  The condo is very homey, and there was lots of good, easy to find information so we could maximize our time there. Definitely will consider staying again, should we need a place in downtown Seattle.
68125	3040278	9.0	10.0	37295908	Not much else can be said but phenomenal.  The two bedroom unit has an amazing view, wonderful kitchen to cook, and just a lovely ambiance to relax and enjoy.  Highly recommend NOT renting a vehicle if able to walk on foot.  Just minutes (walking) to EMP and downtown.  Would highly recommend this place, and hope to visit again. Seattle is gorgeous! 
68126	3040278	9.0	10.0	37637820	Jenn's condo in the Queen Ann section of Seattle was perfect...great location, an amazing view day or night as advertised and a comfortable, beautifully decorated apartment with everything we needed for our stay. Jenn herself was great, providing us with lots of useful info and suggestions. It was a pleasure to have the chance to meet and chat with her.
68127	3040278	9.0	10.0	37751797	Great place - very convenient location!  Jenn was great about providing information about check-in and lefts tons of info in the condo regarding restaurant recommendations, places to go see, etc.  It was pretty warm when we were there, and there is no a/c, but she did leave fans there, and in the evening there was a nice breeze due to the location so we were fine.  Would definitely stay here again!
68128	3040278	9.0	10.0	38253653	Great view and Jenn was available to help with any questions we had!  
68129	3040278	9.0	10.0	38406169	Amazing place, great location. Would definitely stay here again and Jenn was so helpful and friendly!
68130	3040278	9.0	10.0	38579701	"Jenn communicated fully and immediately once our booking had been made, as well as throughout our stay. She has plenty of guides and materials about the city of Seattle on hand, and she is complete in her instructions about the condo. The photographs and descriptions of the flat are detailed and accurate. The neighborhood is quiet and the condo is situated very close to the sites and the bustle of the downtown. The view from the small balcony is wonderful--we sat out there for coffee in the morning and for drinks well into the evening. The condo itself is outfitted with everything you might need. We would definitely book to stay here again. Thanks for such a wonderful time!

68131	3040278	9.0	10.0	39142285	"100% recomondation to all visitors of Seattle. 
Pros: all sightseeing could be done by foot, great view from the balcony, style of the flat
Cons: none"
68132	3040278	9.0	10.0	39738437	Awesome time.   Location great.  We walked to pike place market through sculpture park.  We walked to space needle.  We took bus to safeco field.  We had rental car and ventured to Fremont woodland park Rei store and Ballard locks.  Jenn place center to it all. 
68133	3040278	9.0	10.0	40194105	A great place to stay, with a lovely view.  Lots of handy hints and whimsical notes left by Jenn were so helpful.  
68134	3040278	9.0	10.0	40419068	'Amazing View' was everything we wanted for our stay in Seattle.  The apartment has a great view of Elliot Bay and the shoreline was a safe walk distances away.  In this day of 'IKEA' furnished places, it was refreshing to stay in a place that was personalized and comfortable.  
68135	3040278	9.0	10.0	40568113	"Jenn's place was terrific-the view and location not to be surpassed!
Everything we needed-"
68136	3040278	9.0	10.0	41192906	"First, let me say that I would recommend this listing to anyone.  It is conveniently located and a quality apartment at a fair price for the location.  I felt the host was a very good communicator and very prompt in her responses.  Any questions I had were promptly answered and she always made herself available.  

I liked the following things about the apartment: 1) The view off the balcony.  You can seat two on the balcony and honestly if I was sitting in the apartment it was on the balcony. 2) The host has many kitchen items available for use if you would like to cook. 3) There is onsite parking in a secure garage.  You never have to worry about your car.  4) The location is a couple blocks from the Space Needle and the Science Center.  In a whim we decided to go to an IMAX movie and it was a 3-4 block walk.  5) Pike Place Market is about 1 mile away.  We took a cab/Lyft/Uber to the market and walked back.   6) There was a large grocery store nearby if you need anything. 7) The furniture was classy looking and comfortable.  8) The wireless internet was fast and reliable.

Only one thing struck me as a (email hidden)ere is no air conditioning.  This is clearly stated in the listing so there is no deception...just take note if you plan to visit in July and August.  The apartment is exposed to the afternoon sun and it heats up quickly.  This is not normally an issue in Seattle as the weather is usually cool.  But, I traveled at the end of July and August when the outdoor temperatures reached 90.  There was also no rain during my 2 week trip to the Pacific Northwest.  However, the host does have numerous fans for your use (2 in the master bedroom, 1 small one in the living room, and 1 in the guest bedroom).  After the sun went down the apartment quickly became more tolerable as there are many windows.

Overall, I would not hesitate to rent this apartment again especially at cooler times during the year."
68137	3040278	9.0	10.0	41426487	"Jenn gave a detailed message on how to arrive to the apartment. 

She met us at the garage and took us up to the apartment to give us a tour. She also gave us great recommendations of where to eat, visit, and catch a good view of Seattle. 

We walked along the waterfront to Pike's Place, it took about twenty minutes. The Space Needle and Chihuly Glass & Garden is about a ten minute walk. 

The only bummer about this place is we didn't stay longer! Would love to come back if we ever come back to Seattle.

68138	3040278	9.0	10.0	41717053	Lovely unit very close to the major attractions, and it was easy to get downtown. Nice view overlooking Puget sound.
68139	3040278	9.0	10.0	42244726	Jenn's Amazing View, Amazing Location holds up to the name. We found the unit to appear as advertised in the photos,tidy and clean. It is close to the touristy activities (seattle center,space needle) and about a $6 uber ride to the sports stadiums/pike place market. Jenn has a binder she prepared with a bunch of her local suggestions on food/drink locations, the ones we tried were on point! We had a great time and the unit felt like home! 
68140	3040278	9.0	10.0	42515682	Jenn's place is fantastic - it feels very homey, has a great view and is amazingly located in a quiet neighborhood just a door away from many of Seattle's attractions. And Jenn is such a thoughtful host, anticipating our needs, answering our questions promptly and making great suggestions (that binder of hers demonstrates such care). We would definitely book with Jenn again. Thanks again for a wonderful stay.
68141	3040278	9.0	10.0	44088955	"Great host, stunning view. Jenn was very responsive, caring and very helpful indeed. The condo is in a great, lively location, walking distance to the places of interest and a great supermarket.
Best choice for visiting Seattle. "
68142	3040278	9.0	10.0	44514927	I went to Seattle with my Dad and Uncle as we try to see  a baseball game in a new city each year and this year was Seattle.  I have used various other B&B's in other city's and have had positive experiences but Jenn was above and beyond helpful.  She was in constant contact and ensuring that we had everything we needed at all times.  The apartment itself is amazing with a great view and most importantly in a perfect location...I cannot stress how great the location is.  Jenn is not joking when she says that you do not need a car.  I am 27 and my Dad and Unlce are in their 60's and do not like to walk much more than a couple blocks.  Between Uber and the ideal location of the apartment we never needed a car and were very glad that we opted out of renting a car.  The bottom line is that Jenn is most interactive, helpful and concerned host (in a good way) possible.  Combine that with her perfect location, you cannot go wrong!  Highly recommend her! 
68143	3040278	9.0	10.0	44749805	Jenn is an amazing host and her space couldn't have been better for our precruise stay.  We arrived early and she was so accommodating for a luggage drop off.  The condo is in the heart of Queen Anne and within walking distance to all the touristy attractions.  The view was wow!  It was also very nice to have coffee and all the condiments available.  Jenn was just a text away at all times and her dinner recommendations were perfect.  We much enjoyed our stay and will be back!!!
68144	3040278	9.0	10.0	45233806	"What a beautiful condo! More amenities than I even have at home - no detail went over looked! So well decorated to make you feel completely welcomed and comfortable. 

The view was fantastic and I wish we could have stayed longer! The neighborhood is absolutely perfect. A $6 Uber ride from the downtown Westlake station and a very brief walk to ""Seattle Center"" which has the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens and Glass, Key Arena, and Armory which hosts an upscale food court, Children's Museum, and function space. "
68145	3040278	9.0	10.0	45492683	We were staying for 2 nights at Jen's place and we had a wonderful time. The place is very clean, with a great view and has more than enough space for four adults. It's location is perfect with everything easily accessible on foot. Jennifer is a fantastic host who made us feel welcome and was always available for questions/restaurant recommendations and so on. We highly recommend this place for everyone who wants to spend some time in Seattle.
68146	3040278	9.0	10.0	45652285	"Jenn and her place are awesome!

Her instructions were clear and easy to follow.

The condo location is pretty much perfect and is in walking distance of all the major Seattle landmarks (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc.). 

I was able to go to leisurely walk to Pike Place Market (twice), Pioneer Square, and Myrtle Edwards park along the Waterfront all within the course of a single day.

Much thanks to Jenn for opening up her place to visitors. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Seattle.

Everything was within walking distance to all the major tourist attractions. We really enjoyed ourselves and would stay again if we come back to Seattle!
68149	3040278	9.0	10.0	46487307	I couldn't have asked for a better experience than what we had with Jenn. She was warm, responsive, and accommodating from the beginning, helping us with early check-in and parking. She was always available for us. Her place in Queen Anne was airy, well-kept, and comfortable, with a fantastic view. I would love to come back and stay again! What a fantastic host and location. 
68150	3040278	9.0	10.0	46693959	"Location and unit were amazing.  Jenn was fabulous - absolutely flexible with a varying arrival time.  Lots of tips, notes, articles, on the city.  For my first time using Air BnB, it met and exceeded mine and my friends expectations.  So great to have a ""home"" to come back to after a long day.  "
68151	3040278	9.0	10.0	46907682	Jenn's place is great!  Great location, very welcoming, clean and cozy.  It was the perfect size for two couples.  We rode the train up from Portland for a Mariners game and a Seattle overnighter.  Had we stayed longer it would have had everything we needed.  We'll definitely try and book this place again.
68152	3040278	9.0	10.0	47139848	Awesome apartment with amazing views. Jenn was very helpful. Thanks for everything!!
68153	3040278	9.0	10.0	47621444	Jen is amazing!  Her directions on everything was spot on and the view was exactly as shown in her pictures.  The apartment was very much like a home away from home feel.  Felt relaxed immediately.  Loved the place, the view and the location is incredible for sight seeing like we did.  
68154	3040278	9.0	10.0	48162372	Very nice place to stay with an amazing view over the Bay from the balcony. The apartment really showes who Jenn is with a lot of personal touch. It made it cozy to stay at the apartment. Very close to downtown and the water. Jenn was great to communicate with and in the apartment you will find lots of recommendation for bars, restaurants etc.. We would stay at Jenn's again. Tanja and Carsten

68156	3040278	9.0	10.0	49006985	Wonderful place to stay. We had 4 adults that fit comfortably in the two beds. The place is walking distance to most of the tourist attractions (pikes place, space needle, lots of food) We didn't have a car and walked or used a quick taxi ride. We would definitely stay here again.

68158	3040278	9.0	10.0	50427358	Jenn was excellent at communication and her attention to detail is outstanding. Her apartment is really nice, very homey feel and in a great location. Jenn has so much information meticulously organised in her compendium and on her listing that you don't need to stress, she has got everything covered from transport, dining through to attractions. Jenn truly is a Superhost, best so far! Highly recommend
68159	3040278	9.0	10.0	50858972	"We really enjoyed our stay at Jenn's apartment. It was very cozy for a couple with a baby and another friend. We enjoyed the view too! 
The location is excellent. It's an easy walk to the Space Needle, the sculpture garden, Lower Queen Anne, and Belltown. In quick walks from the apartment we liked the Boat House Cafe and Petit Toulouse for eats. "
68160	3040278	9.0	10.0	51264126	Such a cozy place!  I felt so warm and welcomed at Jenn's place!  Very close to the Space Needle and all it's wonderful attractions.  A quick Monorail ride away from downtown shopping and Pike Market.  Very nice! The view from the master was a nice sight to wake up to. 
68161	3040278	9.0	10.0	51735745	The reviews speak for themselves. Everyone loves this location, accommodations, and Jenn. I agree with all the 5 star ratings. If in Seattle this is a must book apartment.

I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Saettle. Jenn is also super sweet and answered all my questions immediately. Great host, great apartment!"

We will definitely stay again and I highly recommend Jenn's apartment!

68164	3040278	9.0	10.0	54751970	Weekend trip to Seattle for a friend's birthday & booked Jenn's condo. WOW, that was a GREAT idea! Very nice accomodations & hostess!

68329	6971260	9.0	9.0	38039254	Cassie was a great host, and the apartment was perfect for my quick trip! The apartment was very nice and tidy and had an incredible view of the city. Her sweet house cat was the best, so lovable and cuddly. Nothing but good things to write about my stay!
68330	6971260	9.0	9.0	38548892	"Cass's apartment is in an excellent location, about 2 blocks from the heart of Lower Queen Anne, so we were easy walking distance to lots of great restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, ect., yet on a street that felt quiet and residential.  The apartment was basic, clean, tidy and cute and has a terrific view of the Puget Sound.  Class left a clear note with instructions regarding wifi, TV, etc.

This is Cass's primary residence and it is her cat's only residence.  So Cass left during our stay, but her cat stayed.  The cat is very sweet but I am not used to living with cats so some of the cat behaviors were a surprise to me. 

It is a terrific spot and the photos don't do it justice."
68331	6971260	9.0	9.0	38642246	Cass was a great host. Quick to respond to any messages. Cute studio apartment in a great location, walking distance to plenty of restaurants and grocery store. House cat is friendly and loves attention. The only down side, at the time I stayed at the apt, the key was not located on property and was bit of a walk, so I ended up taking Uber since I had luggage with me. Otherwise, a great place to stay:-)
68332	6971260	9.0	9.0	39071110	The studio apt was as listed .Very quaint and comfortable in an awesome district of downtown (website hidden) easy walk to the Key arena with lots of pubs and great eating spots within walking distance .Cass was very helpfull and quick to respond with help when i got lost :)  Overall i enjoyed my visit ...Colin
68333	6971260	9.0	9.0	39547032	Cass was great. Very responsive. Listing was as described. Neighborhood wasn't particularly happening but safe and clean. Safeway nearby for groceries and bars, restaurants, nearby. Apartment itself was clean, comfortable, and had an unexpectedly nice view. All the amenities I needed. Her cat is adorable and very affectionate. Actually kind of a dog-like. My favorite kind of cat but if you don't like animals or cats in particular, look out. In whole, definitely would stay here again if I visited the Queen Anne neighborhood again.
68334	6971260	9.0	9.0	39806983	Loved my stay. The place was clean, spacious, and with a great view of the water. Her directions for navigating the building were very helpful, and she was super accommodating. Plus, her kitty is the sweetest! Best snuggler ever. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks!
68335	6971260	9.0	9.0	40829264	I really enjoyed staying here.  The studio was very charming and was all that I needed since I knew I'd be mostly out and about in the area.  Cass was very kind and checked in on my frequently to make sure that things were going well.  
68336	6971260	9.0	9.0	42160684	Cass's place was a perfect pit stop for the rest of my stay.  Chester the cat is awesome (if you happen to be a cat person like me).  Cass is easy to work with & is very accommodating.
68337	6971260	9.0	9.0	43709987	Cass was very nice and communicative. She was a great host and accommodating for my late check-in. Her studio is very clean and in a great location in Seattle.
68338	6971260	9.0	9.0	44809711	Cass met us at the agreed time and was very responsive via the site's messaging app. We didn't have any issues. The neighborhood was exactly what we were looking for (walking distance to Pike Place Market, Space Needle, EMP, etc) and had several great options for dinner and coffee. We were able to spend our entire stay without driving our car. Thanks for a fun weekend Cass!
68339	6971260	9.0	9.0	45099483	Cass was great. Had everything well put together. The apartment was clean and very comfortable. She made me feel very welcome. If you need good conversation, Chesti the cat will provide (he was also pretty playful with me... apparently thought my foot was some kind of monster). And the view is pretty good.  Also, the neighborhood's great (just a few blocks from Seattle Center).
68340	6971260	9.0	9.0	48929659	Cass was awesome ! The apartment was walking distance from all the great tourist attractions. There are plenty of food and bar options in the area too which was a plus. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our stay, not to mention a great view. Her cat Chesti is adorable and loves to cuddle. Be prepared for him to cuddle with you at night. We would definitely stay here again if we came back to Queen Anne ! 
68809	4988679	9.0	9.0	43912787	Maggie was very welcoming and helpful during our stay. She mostly left my roommate and I to ourselves, but was there whenever we needed something or had a question.
68810	4988679	9.0	9.0	44602331	"While I do not necessarily have anything poor to say about Maggie, herself - she was extremely responsive to my questions that I had before and during the stay - I do feel the need to inform others what to expect from this place, in general.  I really hate to leave poor reviews, but I am hoping that it will help others looking for a place to stay as well as the host as she continues to strive to improve her guests' experiences.

First, I was dismayed to find parking very inconvenient.  Nothing in the description of the property speaks to parking.  The street the unit is on is very short and parking is at a premium.  There is no garage access with this property.  You can park on the main road, but be prepared to move it before 7:00 am unless you don't care about getting a ticket.  

Additionally, the apartment/condo appeared as if people (either permanent residents or previous visitors) had vacated it just minutes before we arrived.  There clearly was no cleaning done prior to our arrival with the exception of towels and bedding, which were clean (thankfully).  There was gritty dust/dirt and debris on the floor (there are no slippers by the front door to wear, as indicated in the description), shopping receipts, mail and other personal items on the countertops, thick dust on the window ledges, etc.  The TV did not work (at least we couldn't figure it out) and we had to message Maggie to find out what the wifi network/password was.   

If you do book this property, please make sure that you get all of the pertinent information you need before arrival (TV instructions, garage access, parking hints/advice, wifi information, etc.).  It will alleviate frustrations like what we had.
 
This property really does have the potential to be an awesome place to stay given its proximity to everything.  But I would suggest going in the colder months so that you can keep the windows closed and mitigate the noise from the road and the trains.  Likewise, I think the rate is a bit high given what it is.  I have stayed at other Seattle Airbnb properties that are a fraction of this price that were almost like true B&B properties - copious information about the area, instructions for equipment, clean, etc.

It was a very unsettling evening for me since I brought along with me my 70-year-old stuck-in-his-habits father, ensuring him that everything was going to be perfect and comfortable.  It wasn't.  I was embarrassed and exhausted the next day from losing sleep over this anxiety."
68811	4988679	9.0	9.0	45087475	Maggie was fantastic and very accomodating towards us, the apartment was clean and was perfect for what we wanted. Maggie went out of her way to give us an earlier check in time.
68812	4988679	9.0	9.0	45561903	Maggie's place was a great place to stay! Only a short Uber trip away from Pike Place Market and from plenty of bars and restaurants. It was spotless, comfortable, well decorated, and left nothing to be desired. Maggie was very responsive to any questions. Would stay here again if I were to come back to Seattle.
68813	4988679	9.0	9.0	45942958	Everything was accurate about the listing. Great location and neighbourhood. 
68814	4988679	9.0	9.0	46139360	This place was perfect! I stayed here to enjoy a night close to Seattle with my parents, who enjoyed this as well. The view was incredible! Comfortable beds, a lovely porch, good location and yummy coffee make for a nice place to stay. I have nothing bad to say, except that I wish I could've stayed longer!! 
68815	4988679	9.0	9.0	46591686	Maggie's place is comfortable, clean and conveniently located.  The steps behind the building is a pleasant surprise to walk up the hill to Mercer street, a short walk to the Seattle Center and many great eateries. Maggie was easy to communicate with, she responded to our questions within minutes. We loved the location and the comfort, will definitely stay there next time!
68816	4988679	9.0	9.0	47048376	"Maggie's apartment was a great place to stay. Good location without being on top of everything. Easy access to downtown as well as further out of town.
The apartment was clean and comfortable,  with everything you need for your stay.
The only downside would be the outside noise earlyish in the morning,  if you are a light sleeper.
Maggie was easy to communicate with if needed."
68817	4988679	9.0	9.0	47494919	Maggie made it very easy for us to travel to a different city. Everything she did and said was great. 
68818	4988679	9.0	9.0	47745326	Maggie is easy to communicate with. She responds quickly and efficiently. Condo was exactly what we needed. Hard but comfortable beds, nice bathroom and shower and clean apartment  
68819	4988679	9.0	9.0	48546418	Maggie was great. She sent over a bunch of info prior to my arrival which definitely made check-in a breeze. The apartment was just as described, and was stocked with everything we needed. She even left out some magazines/print outs for recommendations nearby. Maggie definitely gets a thumbs up. 
68820	4988679	9.0	9.0	49794088	Maggie was very helpful in making our experience in Seattle a very memorable one. She sent us information for some places to visit while in town. Check in was very easy once we arrived in the city. Everything in the apartment was very exactly as it was in the pictures, with a great view of the water. The neighborhood was quiet and very enjoyable. Next time I come to Seattle, I will try to stay at Maggie’s again if possible!
68821	4988679	9.0	9.0	51277845	Not only was this a clean, lovely apartment in a great location, Maggie was great to deal with.  She gave us all the info we needed to check in, gave us advice on parking and getting around the city, and responded promptly to our questions.  We would definitely stay there again if we ever get back to Seattle.    The place was spotless and having a washer and dryer was a real bonus!  We especially liked that we were able to open the windows to bring in the cool air even on rainy days.  Thanks, Maggie!

The room and bathroom were very clean, private and comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable and restful.  The neighborhood felt safe, relaxed, and  walking distance to Ballard amenities of eating and drinking.  I would return to James room and recommend it to anyone interested. 
  "
70556	6759038	9.0	10.0	35530131	James is very friendly and accommodating. The room was cozy but with plenty of space. It's close to the train which seemed to stop between midnight and 7am or 8am. Location is fantastic! Ballard central neighborhood is lively, but he lives down a quiet street. I'd definitely recommend James, and stay there again.
70557	6759038	9.0	10.0	35601395	We felt vary welcome, and found James to be a great host
70558	6759038	9.0	10.0	35746471	Great little room and wonderful host. No complaints and very easy process!
70559	6759038	9.0	10.0	36645642	Fantastic home in great location.  James is a superb host.  We wish we had more time to hang out there. Enjoyed our conversations.  Very comfortable and would love to stay again.  Five Stars.
70560	6759038	9.0	10.0	39983884	Like staying with a friend of a friend. James made us feel very welcome, gave us lots of useful tips on what to do, and is fascinating to talk with. The room is clean and comfortable, and Ballard is an interesting and convenient neighborhood. Highly recommended!
70561	6759038	9.0	10.0	40507896	"I had a great week! James was wonderful to talk with, very welcoming, and shared lots of local knowledge about good restaurants and history of the neighborhood. There are dozens of amazing places to eat and shop in Ballard, you will never be bored or hungry, including lots of awesome happy hours. I walked everywhere during my stay and had no trouble taking public transportation to and from the airport. Proximity to locks was a big highlight for me.

The room was clean and comfortable. I especially liked the soft sheets, big fluffy towels, and strong morning coffee. Thank you James for sharing your home. :)"
70562	6759038	9.0	10.0	41154856	My first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. James is a great host and has a great little place in a fantastic neighborhood (15 min by car/25min by bus from downtown Seattle). Very convenient.
70563	6759038	9.0	10.0	41792625	James was a great host. We felt extremely comfortable and safe not only in Ballard but also in his home. We came and went as we pleased and James was always available if we had questions, needed suggestions, or just wanted to chat. The location is just west of all the shops, restaurants, and bars in Ballard and everything was within walking distance for us. If you don't need all the amenities that hotels offer and you want to explore a quieter but hip neighborhood then this is a great place. I will definitely be reaching out to James next time I travel to Seattle. 
70564	6759038	9.0	10.0	42471449	James was a gracious host. He was very prompt to respond to any messages. Additionally, he was flexible regarding a late check in, early check out, and even a change of guest. The place itself was as described. Since I needed a place in Ballard on short notice, this was a great find to suit my needs. There was no availability at the nearby hotels and this booking prevented me from needing to rent a car during my trip to Seattle. Location is very walkable with Hiram Chittenden Locks, shops, and restaurants all nearby. I would recommend this place and would stay there again.
70565	6759038	9.0	10.0	42752243	James was very communicative, flexible, and considerate. He did a great job of making me feel welcome, plus his dog is adorable. The place is in a great location, just a short walk to a number of cute Ballard bars and shops.
70566	6759038	9.0	10.0	43010729	James was easy going and made us feel right at home. Place was clean, almost like a hotel room in the room. Great walking access to Ballard nightlife and the locks.
70567	6759038	9.0	10.0	44013442	James was an excellent host, friendly, helpful and made us feel very welcome. We enjoyed staying with him very much. The accommodations were clean and comfortable, the neighbourhood is pleasant - and top marks for the location, walking distance to the happening heart of Ballard!
70568	6759038	9.0	10.0	45590530	James was super prompt responding to my request.  His location is the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle is really great, walking distance to the Locks, Golden Gardens and the shopping area.  James' home is a charming duplex.  Unfortunately, this is a smoking household.  My husband has asthma and it was a problem for us.  
70569	6759038	9.0	10.0	45916290	We stayed one night at James place. He made us feel very welcome, even invited us for a wine and gave us a tour around the amazing house he is building. James is a great guy and the room is at a perfect spot!
70570	6759038	9.0	10.0	46853677	James made us feel at home immediately! I cannot recommend his place enough. Whether hanging out at the locks, sampling the nearby cuisine or traveling into the city center, James house is perfectly positioned for all types of fun. James local knowledge was indeed a welcome fringe benefit. We only wish we could have stayed at his place for longer than we were able.
70571	6759038	9.0	10.0	48646857	Well, I have to agree with all the other positive posts about James' place - cute house, perfect location in Ballard, and courteous host. The room was just what I needed, and the bed divine. As one other reviewer said, it was like staying with the friend of a friend. Comfortable and casual. Quiet neighborhood within blocks of many great restaurants and little shops. Looking forward to booking again.
70572	6759038	9.0	10.0	49282936	We stayed in Ballard for one night and really enjoyed our experience. James was a fabulous host and made us feel at home. The house is in a perfect location - walking distance to everything we wanted to see. We would definitely recommend this listing to anyone visiting the area. 
73504	3242605	9.0	10.0	14214395	The Zen Den was the perfect spot for our little getaway. The private room in West Seattle was a peaceful retreat after a full day of touring the city and Jessica made sure to make us feel welcome while we were in her home. Public transit was nearby, as were shops and restaurants. Would love to stay again if we were visiting Seattle.
73505	3242605	9.0	10.0	14318943	We stayed at Jessica's for only one night. The room was perfect. The kitties were cute and welcoming. We didn't actually meet Jessica, but even from afar she was really helpful. We will definitely recommend the place.
73506	3242605	9.0	10.0	14997013	Jessica was a bright, cheery and accommodating host for us . . . very flexible in coordinating with our schedule that kept changing because of relatives coming from out of town. The room looks just like the photo. Didn't get to use the sauna, but it looks very nice, has digital settings. The area is super safe and quiet, more quiet because the room is clear at the back of the lot. Best night's sleep I have had in a long time.
73507	3242605	9.0	10.0	15245290	Awesome host! Awesome place! Nice cats. Would love to stay there in the future! 
73508	3242605	9.0	10.0	15292756	THe zen den was nice and clean, we weren't there long enough to enjoy the sauna but the space is lovely
73509	3242605	9.0	10.0	15410505	Jessica's zen den is absolutely amazing. Comfiest bed and air mattress for extra guests, wonderful sauna, and beautiful environment. West Seattle is a really fun mix of city and beach town. There's also an easy bus to catch down town, but coming back to such a relaxing part of the city was a huge comfort. Jessica was also so sweet and responsive to all my questions. Overall really great place to stay! I would definitely want to come back.
73510	3242605	9.0	10.0	15543736	The place was nice and convenient. Crashed there just for the night with my mom and sister on our day trip to Seattle from Portland. Never met Jessica but she provided everything we needed and the place was easy to find. Sauna was nice after a long day walking around town. 
73511	3242605	9.0	10.0	15776743	Although we did not get to see much of Jessica because we were wandering all around Seattle most of the time, staying at the Zen Den was a great experience. I would definitely go back there again and would recommend the place to others.
73512	3242605	9.0	10.0	15879028	Jessica's place was just as described - a green, peaceful oasis in the vibrant community of W. Seattle.  We loved being able to take just one bus to get us where we wanted to go downtown! Jessica was out when we were in, but we felt perfectly comfortable.  We'd definitely stay again.
73513	3242605	9.0	10.0	16106354	Even if we haven't met Jessica, she left me all the information I need to reach her house. The room was nice and very well situated, close to Alki Beach and only 20 min bus ride from the Downtown. 
73514	3242605	9.0	10.0	16259751	"Great room and a great host. We only saw Jessica the day we got there as she's pretty busy, but we did get to hang out with her for cats which were all sweet and friendly. The neighborhood was great, and it was close to Seattle Centre, which was what we needed.
Room and house were clean and having the outside deck set was nice. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. Unfortunately we didn't make use off the sauna, so I can't comment."
73515	3242605	9.0	10.0	16332328	Room was good, super easy access! Had no dramas... The sauna was nice. Cool little place to stay : )
73516	3242605	9.0	10.0	16485022	Great clean room, super quiet. Plenty of privacy for a good price. You have to walk outside on the deck to access the bathroom in the main house area, but this wasn't a problem for us. Very close to a cute retail area with lots of good restaurants! 
73517	3242605	9.0	10.0	16669505	"Jessica's place is great! The space is very comfortable. There's an outside area to sit and have coffee or hang out. It's separate from the main house, so you have access to the kitchen and bathroom through a side door right next to the Zen Den. 

The location is awesome - just a quick walk to the water or to The Junction (this area of town). Great restaurants and funky boutiques. 

We had our dog with us this trip and found both her house and the neighborhood very dog friendly. Lots of places to walk your dog. It's a 15 minute drive to one of the best dog parks I've been to (Westcrest).

We were visiting friends and family closer into downtown Seattle and the drive was quick and easy every time.

The only downside was worrying about walking into her house to use the bathroom or grab some water in the middle of the night - which is pretty typical for me in general....

We didn't see her much, but whenever we ran into her, she was very welcoming. I totally recommend her space!"
73518	3242605	9.0	10.0	16795648	The Zen Den is a peaceful and secluded room in the back of the house - the trees helped keep the room cool in the summer heat. Really enjoyed our stay. 
73519	3242605	9.0	10.0	16993294	Very good organisation for my stay at Zen Den. We could not meet with Jessica because we were on the road, but I had a very nice night in this very quiet and Zen place. Thank you Jessica
73520	3242605	9.0	10.0	17352152	First let me say this is a great neighborhood! Really fun and everything is walking distance. Alki Beach and Schmitz park are a quick busride away. If you like staying away from tourist trap areas, then this is the place for you. Host was nice and welcoming, gave us fresh towels and everything. We were four, and although it was a bit tight, it was comfortable for crashing out for the night. 
73521	3242605	9.0	10.0	17711000	The host made feel at home and welcomed. She has an open personality.
73522	3242605	9.0	10.0	17769218	The room was nice and clean and the area was very quiet at night. Jessica welcomed us when we arrived but did not see him afterwards as she was working nights. Nice place and according to description!
73523	3242605	9.0	10.0	18529618	"The Zen Den was perfect for my stay.  A quiet residential street near friends.  Just a few blocks from West Seattles main street California Ave.  The bed and space is perfect for one person but 2 could easily manage. Easy access to kitchen and bath from deck near the rooms private entrance.  The cats were sweet, friendly and very respectful.  
Jessica was there to welcome me. Checked in mid week when our paths crossed. And was so sweet and thoughtful with gift of a vegan cupcake on my last evening.  Thank you Jessica."
73524	3242605	9.0	10.0	18878027	We stayed at the Zen Den for four nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is ideal for anyone wanting a more quiet Seattle experience. Just a few minutes to Alki Beach and all the bars and shops of West Seattle. The room itself was immaculate and cozy. We never met Jessica during our stay but she was very communicative and thoughtful. Bathroom is shared and in the main house, this may not be ideal for everyone but it worked fine for us and was very clean. Overall I think this is a great airbnb and would love to stay again next time we are in Seattle.
73525	3242605	9.0	10.0	18963971	I arrived to a lovely welcome card, a bottle of water and basket of necessities, and a pristine room that looked just as delightful as pictured. The neighborhood was great, lots of excellent restaurants less than a mile away, and I had the chance to just unwind and rest as I needed to. The sauna was fantastic, and Jess couldn't have been more helpful. Will definitely go again if I find myself needing a place in West Seattle.
73526	3242605	9.0	10.0	19126379	Jessica left us a cute little greeting card which includes the information for the WiFi network. She also provided the basic necessities such as towels and various items such as little soaps and shampoos. There is WiFi, so that's a plus. Just a note, there were two cats that I encountered during my stay. Overall, it was a neat Zen-themed room. 
73527	3242605	9.0	10.0	19302932	"Jessica welcomed me in person to give me the lay of the land. There was  a handwritten note on the table, and bottle of water for me as well as a little bowl and bottle of water for my dog. Really nice touch. Jessica was great at texting me with updates and checking in (e.g., I could come over early if wanted, where it might be slippery during a rain, etc.). I appreciated that. I didn't see her much after the first intro, but I felt like she was already ready and available.

I thought the room was great and would absolutely stay again. In fact, I think the Seattle PI paper just featured it as a cool place for a potential local staycation. The room is, as noted, a separate place with its own entrance at the back of the house. Very private and quiet. Inside, the warm-colored hardwood and sunset colors make it really warm. The bed was incredibly comfortable, which makes napping very tempting. And I did use the FAR sauna one night, which is a nice bonus. My dog was also with me, and it was simple and easy. As other reviewers note, the bathroom and kitchen are in the main house. It's a 10 ft walk down the deck to the door. I was a little worried coming in the house at night the first time, but Jessica assured me it was expected. I never saw anyone when I went in day or night, and it quickly became routine. If you do want water in the room at night/in general, you could grab a gallon at the local grocery store fora buck like I did.

As for location, West Seattle is great. The main street is a short walk away, with lots of great places for food, shopping. Huge fan of Husky Deli. Great dog park 15 min away, or head down to the walkway along the sound close by or 10 min up by Alki Beach. Great views and people watching. And if you walk around the neighborhood, you can see the Sound a few blocks away. If you want to head into downtown Seattle, you're a 15 min drive away.

I wholeheartedly recommend Jessica and the Zen Den.

73528	3242605	9.0	10.0	19417660	The room was very clean. The neighborhood was nice and was in a convenient location. The only drawback was having to go outside to get into the main house to use the bathroom, but that definitely isn't a deal-breaker. We never saw Jess during our stay, but she kept in constant contact to give us advice on where to go/answer any other questions. We would, and probably will, stay here again.
73529	3242605	9.0	10.0	20005887	This was my first aibnb experience and I loved it (^; 
73530	3242605	9.0	10.0	20289302	Cozy and very private space! Close to beach, shopping, main street with restaurants. The only thing little uncomfortable ( and if the weather is cold) is that the bathroom/shower is outside the room, one has to go out through the patio to the main house. 
73531	3242605	9.0	10.0	20516286	Loved the zen den - very comfy, only saw Jessica when I arrived, very private nice space.  The added bonus for me was the furry companion that kept me company.  Perfect location in West Seattle.  I will stay there again next time I'm in Seattle. 
73532	3242605	9.0	10.0	20626108	Jessica created an awesome environment.  This was so much fun and a wonderful Zen stay.  This was such a warm place.
73533	3242605	9.0	10.0	20928815	"I didn't get a chance to meet Jessica, as I was arriving in the evening and she was out at the time, and I left early the following morning. However, we communicated by email and she was absolutely as welcome, friendly and informative as can be.  I felt very comfortable setting out to her place despite the fact that it's only my second airbnb experience.

The neighborhood is so very sweet, with lovely historic homes, as is hers. Short walk to a cluster of restaurants and bars (around California and Alaska intersection).  Extremely pleasurable setting.

The room is GORGEOUS, warm and restful -- the bed and linens so soft and comfortable. The kitties hanging outside are approachable and friendly if you're interested in interacting. The bathroom/kitchen are only a few steps away, extremely easy access.  All orderly and easy to find what you need. 

I LOVED staying at Jessica's.  She has an obviously strongly individualistic creative/aesthetic sense which makes the space of the room, the area outside, and I imagine the other spaces as well, wonderfully filled with enlivening, interesting, thought-provoking, beautiful images. Recommended with absolutely no reservations!"
73534	3242605	9.0	10.0	21642335	The place was just as described. Although I didn't interact with the host she left a nice greeting card and everything went perfectly. I definitely recommend staying here!
73535	3242605	9.0	10.0	22263898	I loved this place. The room lived up to its name- a cozy, peaceful, restful space. Beautiful aesthetic and with an infrared sauna in suite- nice touch. Jessica went above and beyond in providing some amenities, such as toiletries, bottled water, slippers and housecoats. There was free and easy access to the washroom and kitchen. I would have loved to meet Jessica, but didn't have the opportunity. Instead, I got to enjoy her charming cats :) (my choice). The place is located in a very cool neighbourhood, just a 15 min drive from downtown. There are great shops, restaurants and grocery stores around. Great value for money- I would stay again. 
73536	3242605	9.0	10.0	23521278	Jessica is just lovely. Room was exactly as described. A lovely welcome card with all her contact information and bottled water were on the little table on arrival. The location is ideal. You can walk to the Junction, with great shops, restaurants and yoga and public transportation. The views of the water and mountains during the walk are spectacular .jessica responds promptly to all requests. If you want to be in Seattle in a beautiful neighborhood in an adorable house this is the place.
73537	3242605	9.0	10.0	23715676	This place does give out really good vibes. Jessica is truly a great host but we missed seeing her. We did see the cats and they became quiet friendly. It was cold and rainy outside but the den was warm. 
73538	3242605	9.0	10.0	24023772	Room was great! Jessica had everything ready and clean by the time we arrived so there were no issues. Great neighborhood! We walked home from the bus stop late at night on multiple occasions and felt safe. Would rent again!
73539	3242605	9.0	10.0	24109775	My host was very attentive to my needs but not in my face. The zen den was warm and comfortable. It felt like home when I arrived on my way back thru Seattle.
73540	3242605	9.0	10.0	24296830	The zen den is a cozy room. When we came in it smelled great from freshly lit incense and there was a note card welcoming me since Jessica was not at home when I arrived. I actually did not see her the entire time of my stay but I did meet her roommate Dale briefly. It is a little bothersome to have to go outside from the zen den into the main house to use the bathroom, but it was as advertised. Overall I've of the nicest airbnb experiences I have had so far.
73541	3242605	9.0	10.0	24537701	Loved staying at the Zen Den!! Really loved the neighbourhood, West Seattle Alki beach. Great restaurants and places to explore. Travelling with pets is always a challenge and I can say we all had fun. Comfortable bed, easy access to kitchen, friendly cats. I like the laid back feeling. Will come again. Thanks Jessica!
73542	3242605	9.0	10.0	24964532	It had been a great experience staying over here.
73543	3242605	9.0	10.0	25269155	This experience was great! The room is exactly how it looks in the pictures posted. Very quiet. It felt like a home away from home. Usually on vacations I have a hard time sleeping but I slept like a baby! It was a good location too, 15 minute ride from downtown and 20 from north Seattle! 
73544	3242605	9.0	10.0	25506204	We had a great stay in the Zen Den!  We didn't get the chance to meet Jessica but she was very responsive to our needs and made us feel right at home.   The sauna is a definite plus on dark and rainy days.  There were a lot of special amenities to the room too like soaps and lotions, robes and sandals, candles and incense, books and games.  Would definitely recommend!  
73545	3242605	9.0	10.0	26320597	Jessica made the process very easy. The room is a great oasis, very comfortable and quiet.  I felt at home in the Zen Den.  Thanks Jessica!
73546	3242605	9.0	10.0	26561801	Staying at the West Seattle Zen Den was a nice getaway. Great for people who love cats/do not have cat allergies! The room is spacious with the sauna attached which was lovely to try out. The bathroom is inside the main house and just several steps outside of the door to the room. We did not get to meet Jessica during our stay, but she made us feel welcome with a box of Valentine's chocolates and a list of fun things to do in the area. We could not get our Wi-Fi to connect but overall we had a really positive experience! Would stay here again.
73547	3242605	9.0	10.0	26891390	The place is cute, super quiet, in a beautiful neighborhood with an amazing view of the Puget Sound. Just perfect :)
73548	3242605	9.0	10.0	27022058	Thank you Jessica for a delightful stay, the room was cozy, compfy and clean, even my puppy enjoyed his stay.  I would not hesitate to stay again. Thank you again.
73549	3242605	9.0	10.0	27478773	"Jessica is awesome! She is kind, communicative and always attentive to your needs. I love her laid-back attitude. I felt  never felt so comfortable in some one else's house!

 The Zen Den is clean, comfortable and most of all relaxing.  I love the fact that the sauna has a MP3 adapter cord that allows for you to play music from almost any device. She also provided fresh towels and bottled water whenever I needed them!

Her place is a quick stroll from the best places (resturuants, coffee shops, bars etc) in West Seattle and not too far from the water.

I enjoyed every bit of my stay and can't wait to go back!"
73550	3242605	9.0	10.0	27646117	"We had a very nice experience at the Zen Den in West Seattle, which is a wonderful family oriented and quiet neighborhood.  Jessica was extremely accommodating and had laid out waters, robes and any necessities that one might require.  We only met her one time and it didn't feel like either party intruded on the other whatsoever.  The description is very accurate the room, kitchen and bathroom were kept spotless.  The bed was a memory foam and extremely comfortable.  Easy and plentiful parking.  The only slight downside is having to go outside, on the deck which is fairly private, a few steps to the glass doors leading to the kitchen and bathroom.  We would definitely stay there again.      

"
73551	3242605	9.0	10.0	28103528	The Zen Den is exactly as described; warm and cozy and quiet. Though we did not have a chance to meet, Jessica was incredibly helpful and lovely to interact with; very responsive and accommodating. Would stay here again in a heartbeat - hopefully we will!
73552	3242605	9.0	10.0	28405713	The Zen Den was beautiful! Incense, robes, slippers, and shampoo & soap were set out neatly for us! You have to go outside to access the main house and bathroom, but it's only a 3 second walk. Had some issues connecting to the Wi-Fi, but overall our experience was great and I would recommend the Zen Den to my friends!
73553	3242605	9.0	10.0	28585618	The Zen Den was a perfect retreat for us. Close enough to the city to bike (not for beginners), drive or bus easily and the house and neighborhood were quiet and peaceful. Right down the street from a nice strip of stores and food. We had breakfast at easy street cafe which was great and about a 10 minute walk from the house. When we arrived the room was very clean and smelt nice! The bathroom and kitchen were accessible and also clean! There are cats in the house and outside which were all very friendly! I would definitely stay here again. I don't think the location and price can be beat. 
73554	3242605	9.0	10.0	28640850	"It was a pleasure staying at Jessica's Zen Den.
My 17 month son was very excited to see all the cats everywhere. "
73555	3242605	9.0	10.0	28702414	The Zen Den was accurately described. The room is very tranquil and comfortable. Jessica left us a nice gift basket. Great overall experience! And the cats in the main house were a huge plus; as we are cat lovers! 
73556	3242605	9.0	10.0	28969269	We loved our little stay at the Zen Den.  The room felt very welcoming and cozy and although we only met Jessica once, she was very accommodating!  The neighborhood was extremely quiet with beautiful houses surrounding the area and a somewhat short walk towards a few parks near the coast as well as walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  Keep in mind it is a private room but you have to walk a few steps to the main house for the restroom and kitchen!  I would recommend the zen den to my friends in a heartbeat.
73557	3242605	9.0	10.0	29350568	We stayed in the Zen Den for 3 nights over a long weekend and this was our first airbnb experience! Communication with Jessica prior to arrival was pleasant. When we arrived the room was clean, inviting and all ready and looked identical to the photos in the listing. At first we were a little leery with the shared bathroom/kitchen but became comfortable quickly due to the inviting atmosphere. We loved the cats and there was usually one wanting in or out.  There’s lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance and we had breakfast at the Easy Street Café. A quick bus ride downtown was also only steps away. The neighborhood felt very safe and is really beautiful with lots of older interesting character homes. Our dog also had a nice stay in the Zen Den.  I would definitely stay here again if we were in Seattle. Great first airbnb experience!
73558	3242605	9.0	10.0	29651684	The house was easy to find and Jessica's directions were helpful as far as getting into the room and using the main house. Loved the cats. Loved the sauna. The the west Seattle area. 
73559	3242605	9.0	10.0	30010022	The place was fantastic, probably one of the best places I have stayed at. Loved the room and the location. We found a fantastic Phó place after a recommendation from Jessica's brother. I liked the whole set up and would definitely stay there again!
73560	3242605	9.0	10.0	30165180	Fantastic space. Real close to the Junction in West Seattle. Nice and quiet. Jessica made us feel welcome and she has a lovely home. Would stay again!
73561	3242605	9.0	10.0	30428451	I felt very welcome at the Zen Den! I would definitely recommend this place for a relaxing spot in West Seattle. The location is great!
73562	3242605	9.0	10.0	31467132	The zen den was very comfy and clean. Lots of great restaurants very close, and beautiful views around you. 
73563	3242605	9.0	10.0	31611571	Easy to find and clear directions, a note and key we're waiting for us when we arrived. Really clean and comfortable and exactly what we were expecting. Perfect little retreat! West Seattle was gorgeous, and only half an hour to get down town via the c line. 
73564	3242605	9.0	10.0	31963810	"My stay at Jessica's Zen Den was amazing!!  The location was great and Jessica was an amazing host!  I was unsure of my time of arrival and arrived half an hour early but she was extremely accommodating :)
The sauna was a great plus and I can't wait to stay there again!  "
73565	3242605	9.0	10.0	32776192	I felt extremely welcomed and the room was exactly as described. Very quiet, very relaxing and so close to Alaska Junction. Got a chance to try the sauna and I miss it already! Beautiful views as soon as you step outside. 
73566	3242605	9.0	10.0	32915481	Jessica's Zen Den was a quiet, tranquil retreat in a great location. The room was perfectly sized for 2 and Jessica left us a sweet note, along with some essential necessities that were definitely an extra bonus. You can tell she takes great care in hosting and it really made us feel at home.
73567	3242605	9.0	10.0	33694360	The room was all set up for us when we got there, and it was cozy just like the photos. We were just stopping through and it was the perfect place to rest and recharge. Warm and comfortable, the den will bring you right back to earth. Jessica was so inviting, and makes her home available to you without any issues. Thanks for a wonderful stop Jessica! 
73568	3242605	9.0	10.0	34070064	Jessica's place is as accurate as the photos. It's clean and quiet. She is a great host and our communication was very smooth. 
73569	3242605	9.0	10.0	34706890	The host made us feel welcome. She left us a nice note even though she was out of town when we arrived. The listing was accurate. The room was just the right size for the two of us. The neighborhood was quiet and very close to California Ave, which had plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, and stores. 
73570	3242605	9.0	10.0	35108283	We had a great time staying at Jessica's place. Her home is very eccentric but welcoming. As a cat lover I loved seeing all of her cats in the main house. My only complaint is that the wifi signal was at times poor in our room, but this wasn't a huge issue. Jessica was very welcoming and prompt with answering all of our questions. I would definitely stay here again. Great place, great location.  
73571	3242605	9.0	10.0	35410237	Great stay, only thing is the main house had a very strong cat odor so people with allergies be aware. 
73572	3242605	9.0	10.0	36009002	Jessica was friendly and mostly absent. There are other adults around but they keep to themselves.  We traveled with cats so it worked fine that her 4 cats have free roam. Easy access to the kitchen and bathroom. 
73573	3242605	9.0	10.0	36282100	Jessica's place was welcoming and clean. The room is private and beautifully decorated. Though we didn't end up utilizing the sauna, the fact that it was there was a real treat. The house was easy to find (we traveled on foot) and in a great neighborhood that offers great views and cool eateries within easy walking distance. Jessica had a welcome note and key waiting for us upon arrival. The bed is super comfy and we felt welcome to use the bathroom and kitchen space in the house. The kitties were friendly and didn't enter the room without being invited, which we did because we liked them. Though we didn't get to meet Jessica due to a later than expected arrival and early departure, all of our questions were answered quickly via text and we never felt that we lacked anything. Excellent stay in a funky Seattle neighborhood. We will definitely stay here again when we have more time to explore the city!
73574	3242605	9.0	10.0	36688628	"I didn't get to meet Jessica (coming and going at different times of day) but she made sure I got into the suite okay and had everything I needed. 
It is in a great neighborhood and easy to find. 
The room was nice and cool in the hot summer heat. I wish it was cool enough outside to want to use the sauna...next time! 
The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of space. 
I loved visiting with the cats who were always around to great me on the deck (I have 2 of my own).  
She had lots of little extras in room and (email hidden) case you traveled lighter than you planned! "
73575	3242605	9.0	10.0	36988999	Jessica was a wonderful host!,was very promt answering all my questions. As soon as we walked in left me a cute card and the keys to her wonderful den with amazing little sauna inside. My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised. She has an awesome backyard with friendly cats , they were so cute :), also very conveniently located to some local spots! My bf and I walked to this awesome spot for breakfast and vinyl shopping called easy street records. Anyways this was truly an amazing stay! I would stay here again. Thanks Jessica!,your fantastic.
73576	3242605	9.0	10.0	37289372	Wonderful place! Perfect location and A lot of privacy! We'd stay again :) 
73577	3242605	9.0	10.0	37659160	We loved our stay at Jessica's - the room is such a perfect space! The setup is perfect and sophisticated. It is a very short walk from the bus that will take you downtown (the C) and it's near little shops and cafes. We only met briefly but Jessica is a wonderful host and you're always greeted by at least one cat anytime you are coming or going. :)
73578	3242605	9.0	10.0	38134738	We didn't actually meet Jessica, which I assume was just part of the undisturbed zen experience, but she was very nice over messages and she left a nice letter in the room with all the necessary info and tons of little shampoos/lotions/etc. It's a real little spa experience! The room is a little smaller than it appears in the photo, but it's still sizable and the bed is actually bigger than it appears, and a good bed is really all anyone needs! Her laundry machine was broken, which isn't a big deal in of itself, but considering we were coming to the close of a 3 week road trip and she knew of our situation, it would have been nice to know of this ahead of time since it was inevitable we'd want to use it. Of course that's minor, and overall we had a great stay! It's a great room with a great zen feeling and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to relax! 
73579	3242605	9.0	10.0	38592003	Had a really nice time staying in the zen den. Room had a relaxing atmosphere and everything was clean and tidy. Didn't get to meet Jessica while we were there, but she replied to messages quickly and was very helpful when we had trouble with the internet connection. Would definitely stay again.
73580	3242605	9.0	10.0	38702556	Our stay was great. The room looks exactly like the pictures. It was easy to find (both house and room) and Jessica left instructions for the bathroom/kitchen which made it even easier as we arrived quite late and left pretty early! 
73581	3242605	9.0	10.0	39400651	"We didn't get to meet Jessica but she left us a welcoming card and key. The room was as described and the neighbourhood was nice - quiet but close to restaurants and cafes. We felt slightly uncomfortable using the kitchen and bathroom without actually having met the owner but we found everything we needed.
"
73582	3242605	9.0	10.0	41271041	Though I actually did not get to meet Jessica, my stay at her place was great!  The in-room sauna after a long day can not be beat.  The room is very quaint and relaxing and the location very close to many downtown shops and amenities, walking around was not a problem.   Overall great airbnb set up. 
73583	3242605	9.0	10.0	41362197	Very cozy environment, excellent stay for my first night in Seattle.
73584	3242605	9.0	10.0	41479682	Super easy check in process. The place was adorable, clean, and the sauna was just perfect! Very comfortable, and would enjoy staying there again!
73585	3242605	9.0	10.0	41741734	Jessica was very accommodating and let us leave our luggage in her place before checkin.  She even left us a handwritten card welcoming us.
73586	3242605	9.0	10.0	42143331	"We very much enjoyed our stay in the Zen Den! Jessica was a most gracious host and sure made us feel welcome. The space was clean, quiet, and pleasant, just what we were looking for! It was a quick walk to Alaska Junction with plenty of eateries, shopping, bars, etc. We also walked down to Alki beach, a bit more of a hike but definitely doable if you're up for a long walk. 
Excellent host, beautiful space, great neighborhood, and affordable stay. We would most definitely stay again and recommend this space to anyone who wishes to visit West Seattle. Thanks Jessica! "
73587	3242605	9.0	10.0	42676333	Jessica's Zen Den was great! It was in a very convenient location of West Seattle - only a few blocks walk away from Alaska Junction. My mother and I enjoyed our stay immensely! The room had a very comfortable bed and was very private. We never saw Jessica, but when I texted her a few questions she responded promptly and was very caring and considerate. Overall, a great stay!
73588	3242605	9.0	10.0	42841336	This place is awesome! Walking distance to bars, breweries and shops but tucked away and quiet. LOVED the sauna!! Maybe the comfiest bed we slept on our entire trip ... might have been a cloud?? Just lovely. Thanks so much, Jessica!!
73589	3242605	9.0	10.0	43945826	"Staying at Jessica's was a real delight! Her instructions on how to enter her Zen Den were straight forward and clear. The room was peaceful, calm, and very clean, and Jessica is right her bed is super comfy! Jessica was very kind to let us enter in and out of her house for the kitchen and bathroom as much as we needed. I would certainly recommend her Zen Den to anyone wanting to check out Seattle. Also west Seattle is cool too. We didn't have too much time to check it out but on the Sunday before we left there was a farmer's market right in the downtown area. 

We definitely had a good time.

Thanks Jessica!"
73590	3242605	9.0	10.0	44782376	Great place!  Private and comfortable.  Thank you.
73591	3242605	9.0	10.0	44910683	This was a good spot to crash after a busy day traveling and visiting in Seattle.  Very comfortable and quiet.
73592	3242605	9.0	10.0	45370814	good. Everything is perfect.
73593	3242605	9.0	10.0	45777225	Our stay was wonderful! The neighborhood was great, very laid back vibe and we were in walking distance to restaurants and bus stops. We spent most of our trip elsewhere in Seattle and it was nice to come back to a quiet, peaceful location and rest. The cats were an added bonus: )
73594	3242605	9.0	10.0	47029968	We stayed for 6 days.  Place is as described.  The bed was cozy and sauna was excellent for the cold day after a hike.  The area is quiet and her place is close to the stores, restaurants, dry cleaner or laundry facility.  It is close to Alki beach which is excellent location for walks and bike rentals.   It is also close to the downtown Seattle to check out all the touristy spots.   Met Jessica on my last day and is very nice.   
73595	3242605	9.0	10.0	48108663	Our first trip to Seattle and our stay at the Zen Den was a great experience. The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet, we were able to sleep comfortably. There was a full kitchen available and a clean bathroom, though most of our time was spent sight seeing so we didn't need to use it. Her cats kept us company as well, very friendly.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle.
73596	3242605	9.0	10.0	48531047	I stayed here for three days and honestly couldn't have imagined a better place. The location is lovely. Walking distance to West Seattle, which is awesome, and also to a couple beaches. The room itself made me feel so comfortable. Jessica has clearly put a lot of thoughtful care into creating a sweet space. I'll definitely try to stay here on my next trip to Seattle. Hopefully sooner than later as I miss her cats already. :)
73597	3242605	9.0	10.0	49605551	My girlfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights. We did not get to actually meet jessica but she provided everything we needed. The room was great and cozy. The bed was super comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen were easily accessible and clean. The cats were very cute and playful! She lived just a few minutes from the junction were there are plenty of stores and places to eat. There was also a farmers market on Sundays that my girlfriend loved. I actually really liked the area that we were staying in. West seattle is very green and beautiful. It was a great place to stay and I would definitely recommend it!
73598	3242605	9.0	10.0	50758328	We enjoyed our stay at Jessica's den. It was comfortable and had everything we needed. We didn't get to meet Jessica but felt her hospitality throughout our stay. Her cats were so cute and friendly too! 
73599	3242605	9.0	10.0	51025820	We unfortunately never got to meet Jessica, but nonetheless the whole process was easy peasy considering. She messaged me early in the day giving me detailed instructions on what to do and where to go. It was great. She told me I could message her whenever if there were any problems, but We never needed to. We had plans to go explore downtown soon after arrival but as soon as we opened the door we were kind of grounded! The whole place had a very soothing ambiance. There was incense, meditation books, A SAUNA..all in our delightful place. Namaste was everything we needed and that's exactly what we got. There is no bathroom attached so you do have to go into her part of the house, BUT she always made it available for you to do so at any time. The bus system is EXCELLENT. We didn't even need to rent a car. It's About a five minute walk to a bus stop, Starbucks, shops, restaurants and bars. We took the bus into downtown in the middle of rush hour, but it still only took us 20 minutes AND the best part is it runs ALL night. Totally worth not staying in the heart of downtown. In fact, it was MUCH better.  Her cats are super sweet and cuddly and it was nice to be greeted by their sweet meows and loves every time we came home. Jessica has a sweet set up here, I'd suggest it to anybody that enjoys some calmness to their vacations. 
73600	3242605	9.0	10.0	51360809	Erica's Zen Den is in a wonderfulgreat location. Everything you see in pictures and described are spot on. I had a wonderful experience and would revisit this location any time I'm in the Seattle area. Thanks again and I hope to visit again.
73601	3242605	9.0	10.0	51712145	Jessica's home is a wonderful stay. Her bed is AMAZING. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever stayed in. The room is nice because it's separated from the house making it very private -- you don't feel like you are in Jessica's space at all. There's also plenty of street parking in her area. For first time Seattle visitors make sure you do your research because she is in WEST Seattle, meaning it will be a bit of a trek to get to the city at times. That being said there's plenty to do in the junction downtown (I recommend easy street records for brunch) and you can take the c line into town easily. She is super friendly and a Great host! 
73602	3242605	9.0	10.0	51944998	The zen area was very relaxing, and so cool to have a sauna in our room! This listing is in a beautiful neighborhood in West Seattle, and close to the beautiful Alki Beach. Great location! 
73603	3242605	9.0	10.0	52958439	Our visit to West Seattle was made so much better because we stayed in the Zen Den. My mother and I thought the room was great and the bed very comfy. The walls are burgundy not orange as they appear in the photos. Because we stayed for a full week, we got to meet Jessica and see her several times and she is so sweet. We had full access to the kitchen dining and bathroom. Coffee every morning and a computer on the table so I could check my email and watch a show on Hulu. I felt right at home.
73604	3242605	9.0	10.0	53792813	Nice clean room and quiet area but close to great restaurants and shopping. 
73605	3242605	9.0	10.0	53870907	"Although I did not meet Jessica personally, her response was very quick, the room was clean and cozy. Super comfortable bed. The personalized card she left for me was very nice.


"
73606	3242605	9.0	10.0	53888304	The zen den was beautiful!! It was such a wonderful location in west Seattle the street and surroundings are beautiful! The zen den itself was wonderful and such a fun place to stay! I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle!! 
73607	3242605	9.0	10.0	54007424	This was a cozy room in a nice and relaxed neighborhood. The perfect distance to visit downtown but also have a quiet, peaceful spot to rest. Jessica was a friendly and accommodating host. I really enjoyed my experience. 
73608	3242605	9.0	10.0	54304389	Jessica was wonderfully easy to coordinate with--and when we got to the house, it was perfect. Smelled like heaven and super cozy. We felt right at home.
73609	3242605	9.0	10.0	54368329	Dry sauna in your room, what more could you ask for?! We sadly never got to meet Jess however, communication with her was easy and the room was extremely comfortable and welcoming. Location to bars, restaurants, and shops is prime. Highly recommend staying here! Thank you for making our stay in West Seattle great! 
73610	3242605	9.0	10.0	54698987	As a few of the other reviews mentioned, I didn't get to meet Jess, but wish I would have. Did meet her boyfriend and he was quite helpful upon arrival. Couldn't have asked for a better little spot and location during my visit to Seattle. The bathroom not being connected to the space (as mentioned in the description) is not as big of deal as it may seem. A little bit of an older house inside, but it fits the neighborhood and vibe perfectly. The house is a 5-8 minute walk to some neat coffee shops, restaurants and convenient stores. Easy Street Records is a must visit for breakfast. PHENOMENAL. I highly recommend Jessica's place (if you could not already tell). The sauna worked wonders each morning, the bed was super comfortable, and the house is perfectly located for all things Seattle. 
73611	3242605	9.0	10.0	54883059	Great place with respectful tenants.
73612	3242605	9.0	10.0	55215679	Best airbnb value I've ever experienced. Bed was very comfy, cute greeting cats, sauna was fun to chat in, lots of privacy, cute place. good location. Only prob was wifi connection was weird for both my guest and me but not a big deal. Overall sweet place!
74158	4589654	9.0	8.0	25288340	The host was great, very responsive. The apartment was nice, and the neighborhood is an old favorite of mine. 
74159	4589654	9.0	8.0	28308586	Nice big space for a great price. Not too far of a drive from the heart of Seattle.
74160	4589654	9.0	8.0	28507832	We enjoyed the 'main floor' of this house at the edge of a pleasant neighborhood of older homes. The rooms were very comfortable, well supplied and very nicely decorated. A nice feature of this property is the multitude of interesting books available. Ms Brecht was always prompt and complete in communicating. A fair bit of aircraft noise might bother some at night depending on air traffic patterns.
74161	4589654	9.0	8.0	30155619	Cute spot. A bit further from downtown Seattle. The house is MUCH bigger than the photographs let on, and our host was very helpful. 
74162	4589654	9.0	8.0	32651989	"Travelling with our parents can be a challenge and My Mum could not stay at the loca, which I thought was fine. So we left before we use the house. 
Roda was incredible - she gave us a full discount. Service and kindness which I will incorporate into my own flat om Airbnb. 

Thank you Roda - we had a nice time in Seattle - and you have a big honour in that "
74163	4589654	9.0	8.0	33151694	The description is accurate - a sweet home away from home. Roda was quick and responsive, and though we did not meet,  let us check in early to drop our luggage since we had a morning arrival. That was incredibly kind and luxurious.The keycode access was convenient. The neighborhood definitely requires a car or public transit. It is apparent this is a pet-friendly place, (just faint pet smell) but everything was clean and the bathroom was spotless with fresh linens. Overall a great experience, very easy to book and a great base for our Seattle adventure!
74164	4589654	9.0	8.0	40058629	Roda was very kind and sweet over the phone and helpful with all my questions while she hosted me in her lovely house. Thank you so much for making my first experience in Seattle welcoming and easy. Roda is amazing and I would recommend her to everyone.
74165	4589654	9.0	8.0	45096807	The home was lovely, very comfortable, and in a good location to travel around Seattle. Roda was great with helping us to plan our trip and keeping in touch!
74166	4589654	9.0	8.0	47111966	Roda has been extremely responsive, always answered my messages almost immediately. Nice, bright, clean and spacious apartment located on a quiet street, around 15-20 minutes drive from downtown Seattle, depending on traffic. The neighbourhood isn't the glitziest part of the city, but we didn't encounter any problem. 
74167	4589654	9.0	8.0	47449668	Host was kind and welcoming. We only stayed for a couple nights but it was enjoyable. Easy access into the house but felt bad that my boyfriend and I forgot there are tenants downstairs and were watching the TV very loud the first night. Definitely kept that in mind during the second night and tried to be mindful of being respectful to the long-term tenants. Great price & location though since we were visiting family. Also loved the wine! Thank you Roda!
74168	4589654	9.0	8.0	48249996	It was clean comfortable and really easy to get to. Roda made everything great, and even threw in a bottle of wine! Great place to stay.
74169	4589654	9.0	8.0	48941245	What can I say?  My buddies and I were wowed by Roda's place!  To say that it was perfect for our trip to Seattle would be quite the understatement.  From the selection of beds to the warmth of the home and the location, we loved every aspect of our stay.  While the neighborhood may at first appear to be ho hum and maybe not the trendiest, it was quiet and a perfect distance from both the airport (about 15 minutes) and downtown (again... 15 minutes).  The proximity to highways and such was key.  We were in town to see our beloved Chicago Bears play the Seattle Seahawks, and ended up taking an uber to the stadium for next to nothing.  A 15-minute drive (if that).  All in all we had a great time, Roda was available to answer my questions, and the accommodations were as nice as they appears on the site.  This will be our place of choice if/when we come back.
74170	4589654	9.0	8.0	49526098	It's really a wonderful house. Everything is perfect. Environment is also good and there are many beautiful adornments in the house. What's more, it's also convenient if we want to go to spots. In conclusion, this house is really a good choice if you want to travel  to Seattle.
74171	4589654	9.0	8.0	53194157	Roda's apartment was perfect for us. First off, the location was great, we were working close by at Boeing. The interior is nicely done, the kitchen had all amenities and it was great returning here after a long work day. The place was very clean and communication with Roda and her husband was easy. I can highly recommend this apartment.
74172	4589654	9.0	8.0	54596430	I have to say Roda's place was nothing less than GREAT.  This old home in a historic neighborhood is so comfortable and convenient it rates A+.  Especially the hospitality Roda & Marvin give.  The little touches in this home make it a very inviting place to stay.  Cleanliness is above & beyond along with an ample supply of consumables to make the stay easy.  If there is another trip to Seattle I will check Roda's availability before checking for a flight.
74971	9156273	9.0	9.0	53290820	The room is just near the stop bus, in a very quiet place. We need only 20 min to go to downtown with the bus. Griffin and his two roomates are very friendly, fun and flexible ( we arrived at 12 pm in the house, without matter). We spend very great time with them talking, going out and they gived us some advise about Seattle. A really good and fun experience, and Seattle is really a city to go.
74972	9156273	9.0	9.0	53718661	My roommate and I stayed at Griffin's house for two nights. Both him and his roommate Charlie, were super friendly, and laid back. They gave us tons of suggestions on good places to go in the area. The house is super cute and cozy, and located in a very convenient area, everything was within walking distance. Overall we had a lovely stay! 
74973	9156273	9.0	9.0	53774644	The neighbourhood is simply adorable. We had a great time with Griffin. Griffin is super nice, kind and friendly. I recommend this place: best place to crash after a late night in Seattle!
74974	9156273	9.0	9.0	55036720	His instruction about his house rule was so clear. He sent us the information what need to know beforehand so we could check in smoothly. 
74975	9156273	9.0	9.0	55336706	Was awesome and accommodating. Griffin was perfect host.
74976	9156273	9.0	9.0	55552403	These gents were awesome hosts. Very chill group of guys who are open to hang out. For you runners, the house is within striking distance of one of Seattle's best parks.
75314	1633025	9.0	10.0	7427375	Great location, very quite and easy to get downtown.
75315	1633025	9.0	10.0	7539633	"Anthony was a fantastic host & we had some wonderful conversations.
A beautiful character home which was quiet and peaceful in a delightful neighbourhood. 
Excellent bus service and possible to walk to downtown. Close to Volunteer Park and a few minutes to restaurants & supermarket.
Thoroughly recommended!"
75316	1633025	9.0	10.0	7612623	I had a wonderful, peaceful stay in their house. I was very impressed with their generosity! 
75317	1633025	9.0	10.0	7836035	I had a lovely stay in this cozy home. I felt very welcome and Margot was so friendly and caring! I felt like at home. Breakfast was included which was really nice. I have only positive things to say about this place and the host. 
75318	1633025	9.0	10.0	7893849	I had a great stay! A comfortable room in a quiet, convenient neighborhood. Margot was super friendly, and flexible when I arrived later than planned and my brother joined me at the last minute.
75319	1633025	9.0	10.0	8030342	"My stay was brief - one night - but it was a very restful and quiet evening. The accommodations are exactly as they are represented and the hosts welcoming. I would not hesitate to stay here again. A lovely neighborhood and home that lives up to the promise of a ""cozy nook""."
75320	1633025	9.0	10.0	8069454	Margot and Anthony were lovely hosts – very kind, welcoming and all-around great people. Their clean, comfortable and cozy home is in a quiet, beautiful area that is within walking distance of many cute neighborhoods with great shopping and restaurants. We even walked downtown both days – it's really not far. (If you don't like walking, there are tons of buses nearby to choose from.) Would definitely stay again on another visit back to Seattle!
75321	1633025	9.0	10.0	8126612	My stay with Margot was fantastic. On very short notice, I needed a place to stay for a week while I started my new job in Seattle and searched for an apartment. Margot was more than accommodating to my situation. And when I finally found an apartment for myself, she gave me a ride to my new place so that I did not have to go to the trouble of moving all of my belongs via taxi or bus. The bed was comfortable, the location was great, and Margot is a wonderful person to talk to. I highly recommend staying here!
75322	1633025	9.0	10.0	8202483	Margot´s home is super nice and comfortable. She is a welcoming host and you will feel at home immediatly. The room is very clean, the bed is very good and wifi is extremely fast. The location is great, you can even walk to downtown in 20 minutes if you feel like it. Highly recommended!
75323	1633025	9.0	10.0	8220621	my first AirBnB experience!. Margot was a lovely & fun host and We so enjoyed the personal care, warm home and her super sweet pooch...she even jumped in enthusiastically to help us find music and dancing for Friday night! Staying in a room inside a home is much more personal and staying in a neighborhood rather than downtown at a hotel just made for a richer experience!
75324	1633025	9.0	10.0	8577460	Margot and Anthony were great hosts.  I enjoyed staying with them and would like to do so again.  They are interesting people.  I was busy when I was there for to race in a big rowing regatta, but their place is convenient, easy to get to downtown or the UW on the bus lines close by.
75325	1633025	9.0	10.0	8733860	Anthony is a great host.  He has a nice setup for travelers and is very accommodating.  It was a pleasure getting to know him, and I enjoyed staying in his place.
75326	1633025	9.0	10.0	9932497	Margot and Anthony were very accommodating hosts! It was always convenient to come and go, and I always felt welcome to use the kitchen and the fire pit outside.
75327	1633025	9.0	10.0	10166751	"Margot and Anthony were incredibly welcoming and hospitable. They welcomed my girlfriend and I into their home and then allowed us to find our own way offering guidance whenever and however asked. The use of their hot tub as an incredible addition to our Seattle adventure. Their house is a nice walking distance from everything that we enjoyed while still retaining a quiet tranquility. 

I would recommend their cozy nook to any and all especially for the price. It is not big and it is not fancy, but it perfectly suited my tastes. 

Thanks so much guys!!!!"
75328	1633025	9.0	10.0	10342601	"Margot and Anthony were very gracious hosts.  I stayed with them two nights, and when the first night didn't go perfectly (Margot was a little sick so not as attentive as she probably would've been), she even offered to host me for another night free of charge, which was extremely generous of her!  Of all the Airbnb's I stayed at during the week, I got the best sleep there as their futon was extremely comfortable!

Pros: really comfortable bed, own bathroom, gracious hosts, laundry on site, ample street parking, pretty central location, large/nice TV in room

Cons: other amenities not readily available: coffee/coffee maker, condiments (but you do have full run of the kitchen), no closet/hangers"
75329	1633025	9.0	10.0	10396527	Margot was a phenomenal host! Her warmth, knowledge of the city, and interest in me getting my needs met as her guest made this a fantastic experience.  Margot went out of her way to help me navigate my trip within and leaving the city.  I highly recommend staying at this location!
75330	1633025	9.0	10.0	10650399	An amazing first airbnb experience. Anthony & Margot's house is a sweet spot to land in. Anthony is a warm, helpful, kind host (Margot was out of town)...he offered info on buses, local coffee shops & more. I felt at home and welcomed and enjoyed our conversations, but also felt I had privacy and could be in my own zone. A wonderful balance! The room was simple, clean and comfortable and the house is a bright, welcoming space. Highly recommended!
75331	1633025	9.0	10.0	10718258	I had the opportunity to stay with Margot & Anthony for three nights beginning Feb. 28th.   Their home was centrally located to the bus stop and to my son, that lived a few blocks away.   The bedroom/house was quiet, the bed comfortable, the bathroom is right next door, and Lily is a very sweet greeter dog!  I would recommend their home.   
75332	1633025	9.0	10.0	11110591	Margot and Anthony were the perfect hosts for what was a thoroughly perfect vacation. They were warm, helpful, funny, and totally easy going. We were even treated to warm cinnamon buns and banana bread! How awesome and delicious is that?! They also have the most adorable dog in the whole world who goes by the name of Lily. Good lord, what a muffin! She is the canine equivalent of cinnamon buns and banana bread. That being said, we do NOT endorse eating her! The house itself made us feel instantly at home and was just a stone's throw away from all the wonderful things that Seattle has to offer. We will assuredly be contacting Margot and Anthony the next time we visit the Emerald City in the not too distant future because they were simply the best!
75333	1633025	9.0	10.0	11588394	Very friendly and natural hospitality!! I will come again.
75334	1633025	9.0	10.0	11765122	"I felt Margot's warmth and caring even before I moved in to ""The Cozy Nook"".  She sent me messages to let me know that they were eagerly awaiting my visit.  Both Anthony and Margot made me feel very welcomed in their comfortable home. Margot gave me some eggs, which were freshly laid, by their own hens in the yard. 
The room is spacious and the bed is comfortable. It was a plus using the washer and dryer on my stay. Unfortunately, I was not able to use the hot tub, but will try again on my next visit. Their newly remodeled bathroom is gorgeous! I look forward to coming back to Margot and Anthony's ""Cozy Nook"" the next time I visit Seattle. And even if you don't stay at their home, be sure to read Margot's book, PARADISE IMPERFECT, about the family's year living in Costa Rica.  I am truly enjoying it!"
75335	1633025	9.0	10.0	12077269	Margo is the best host. Very kind and helpful. You should really go to her place to visit Seattle. Close to eveything, a really nice neighbourhood and the house is lovely. You will really feel like home. Big room, new bathroom, i had the most wonderful journey. I wish i can go back next time i'm in Seattle.
75336	1633025	9.0	10.0	12308521	"I had a great experience staying at Margot & Anthony's place.  Margot was very accommodating to my late check-in (between 10pm-10:30pm) which I really appreciated.  Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Anthony, and I only spent a short while talking to Margot.  Margot was lovely and very helpful with all my questions and gave me lots of recommendations for what to do in Seattle (it was my first trip there).  She was very friendly and I would have enjoyed having her around for the rest of my stay, but she was leaving town for a few days so I had the house to myself for the weekend.  

The room is situated in the back of the house behind the staircase, so even though it's on the first floor, there's a sense of privacy.  Also, the private bath is newly remodeled.

Excellent location - beautiful, quiet, charming residential neighborhood.  only a 10-15 min. walk uphill to 15th Ave., or a 7 min. walk downhill to a few more shops and restaurants.  It's also very close to the Arboretum, which I got a peek of and it looked beautiful.  A few bus stops are within a block or so, and it's a short bus ride to downtown and the tourist sites.

Amenities: 
At first I didn't care too much for the hot tub, but using it was really nice after a long day of sightseeing.  I was glad that they don't use chemicals in the hot tub.  Coffee and tea were provided for the mornings.  Margot even offered use of her guest passes for the Y.

You can't beat the price for what you get.  When I return to Seattle, I would definitely consider staying here again."
75337	1633025	9.0	10.0	12501319	Margot and Anthony were great hosts.  Since I was there during the week, they were of course busy with work for a lot of the time, but we managed to meet up and chat throughout the week.  I was in town for some job fairs and Margot was very encouraging and offered suggestions for further connections. The room is fairly private and quiet, so it's a great place to stay and sleep.  The location is perfect for public transportation and walking. Since I was there during nice weather, I found myself walking down to Capitol Hill quite a bit. And Lily is a super dog. I'd often find myself working on my computer and glance down to find her curled on the floor next to me.
75338	1633025	9.0	10.0	12807043	"Anthony was delightfully accommodating.  We had a crazy whirlwind schedule and didn't actually get to the house until pretty late but with good communication we minimized the impact on the house hold.  Lilly (the dog) was nice too :)  The room was adequate, the layout of the house worked well for having guests and the house is welcoming.

Thank you for hosting us and your flexibility Anthony - take care.

P.s. The yard/garden looks amazing already.  I think I need to come a harvest some of that rhubarb for you

I would have preferred if there was also a table, as it was pretty hard to use my laptop in the room. Alternatively, you could use it in the living or dining rooms. All in all, I would highly recommend this place."

Harry and Ivy where very friendly and kind also, I really enjoyed my stay and was made to feel like one of the family. When I return to Seattle I will always choose the Cozy Nook!!!

I feel like I have made lifetime friends and cannot express enough how much I enjoyed my time with this family. Thank you Margot, Harry, and Ivy for making my stay at your home so enjoyable!!!!

Margot was a very sweet host, room was tidy, everything was in order where it needed to be. GREAT bathroom. Sofa was enough for 6' dudes, Bed surprisingly comfy. Hot tub in clean and working order.
Lots of plants and flowers, gotta dodge bumblebees in and out, but I'm a wuss.

Connected to city from bus just an easy 15-25 minutes away. Would definitely stay again."

Rented a bike for the days I was there and this made me really flexible in what I wanted to check out. Recommend staying in lovely Capitol Hill, and having a chat with Anthony.
75349	1633025	9.0	10.0	19592257	Anthony was very welcoming. I felt comfortable coming and going from the house and doing my own thing. The place was clean, quiet and beautiful. Lovely yard and gardens and tiled front wall. I felt right at home. Used the kitchen twice, very convenient.
75350	1633025	9.0	10.0	19803477	I stayed one night in Margot and Anthony's house. They have a charming  house in a quiet neighborhood, located about 2 blocks away from the nearest bus stop. The room was comfortable and spacious, the bathroom was very clean and new, and amenities such as wifi were very welcome. Anthony was very welcoming upon my arrival. Their dog Lily was adorable and never disturbed me in any way.
75351	1633025	9.0	10.0	20043694	This was my first experience as a Airbnb guest and Margot & Anthony made it a smooth process. Extremely clean & modern bathroom. The room was clean and was exactly as described w/ a big flat screen tv. If you want privacy then this is the place for you. Anthony was available to answer all questions that you may have even though i checked in late and checked our early to catch my flight. Definitely would stay again.
75352	1633025	9.0	10.0	20192765	I appreciated the convenience of this location -- many major bus lines were a hop, skip and a jump away.  There was a grocery store a few blocks away and nearby restaurants as well.  The wi-fi log-in info was much appreciated -- so much easier to learn about what was where when you are connected! Lily, the resident dog, is a doll!  Such a wonderful happy presence and a joy to play with.  
75353	1633025	9.0	10.0	20876526	"Margot and Anthony were very responsive from the start.  They answered questions about their home and their neighborhood and I knew it would be a very good fit.
Everything was ready for my arrival and had the fortune of hanging out with their super cute dog!!
I am sorry I did not get to meet Margot but Anthony was very nice.
Their home is in a beautiful neighborhood and they have a super nice garden and swing in their porch

75354	1633025	9.0	10.0	21101135	Anthony was delightful and welcomed me warmly, as did his lovely dog, Lily, who was indeed the best welcoming dog to a stranger that I have ever met! The cozy nook was quite comfortable, and the home is in a lovely neighborhood. A wonderful place to stay!
75355	1633025	9.0	10.0	22549027	I enjoyed staying with Margot and Anthony. They were very warm and welcoming! The room was spacious and clean. I found everything to be just as was listed. Highly recommended!
75356	1633025	9.0	10.0	25717440	"Anthony is very friendly, helpful & like his sense of humor.  Location great, just 2 blocks away from bus to downtown.  I was gone each day 8am to 9pm, so just having a private bedroom suited me fine.  Adjacent bathroom has had a lovely remodel. I never used the kitchen or other ""family"" spaces so no comment there. Street parking was never a problem.  I wouldn't hesitate to rent this ""cozy nook"" again!"
75357	1633025	9.0	10.0	26668579	Great location walking distance to Capitol Hill fun. Cozy house with warm and generous hosts. Look fwd to returning sometime. 
75358	1633025	9.0	10.0	26727846	I agree with all the other 100% positive comments about this cozy situation. Anthony was really friendly and helpful, didn't meet Margot. Wonderful neighborhood, great views on the walk I took. Close to cafes, pubs etc. Added plus - they have a really cute, friendly doggie! 
75359	1633025	9.0	10.0	26771240	The cozy nook was my first and so far only experience with Airbnb. It was fantastic - Anthony was really friendly and generous, very quick to reply, and made the whole experience very easy. It was quiet and comfortable. He offered me tea and coffee and fresh eggs from his own chickens. 100% positive experience.
75360	1633025	9.0	10.0	27292429	This is a great choice for a Capitol Hill-focused low budget trip. Margot and Anthony were very accommodating regarding a last minute change. The room was nice and clean, the home seemed very comfortable and it was nice to have a guest bathroom right next door. We also loved being greeted by their ridiculously cute dog in the morning. Great communication. Thanks!
75361	1633025	9.0	10.0	27612635	Anthony made us feel very welcome our first night and answered all of our questions about the local area. The house was beautiful and exactly as described in a very nice quiet neighborhood setting. The free parking was a huge bonus for us because we drove to Seattle and we would recommend staying here to all of our friends. 
75362	1633025	9.0	10.0	29151465	This place was great. The neighborhood was peaceful and adorable, but not too far from downtown, so it was a perfect place to stay the night. They were very accommodating, and even though I came in very late, they were thoughtful and left a treat for me to give Lily at the door (though she never even barked - just snuggled!). I loved it here and would definitely stay here again. 
75363	1633025	9.0	10.0	29584619	"I had a wonderful experience at Margot and Anthony's. Sadly Margot was out of town during my stay but Anthony was a delightful host and made me feel incredibly welcome - as did Lily, the resident dog who is truly the sweetest and most loving animal I have ever met. 

The house itself is stunning and you can't ask for a better location - a few blocks from the Seattle arboretum (gorgeous) and a three minute walk to major bus lines that take you straight through hip and fun Capitol Hill to downtown Seattle / Pike Place Market.

The room I stayed in was impeccably clean and larger than I expected.  The bed was surprisingly comfortable and despite my jet lag, I woke up incredibly refreshed and ready to start my day (it helps to wake up to beautiful songbirds and a gorgeous blooming garden outside your window). 

The room also has a private bathroom, which is newly remodeled and fancier than most hotels. That said, if you are looking for a gorgeous, relaxing, safe and quiet environment in the heart of Seattle, look no further - this is the place for you.

75367	1633025	9.0	10.0	33543296	I had the best time staying in this cozy room. I didn't get to spend much time with Margot but Anthony was a fantastic host. They made me feel right at home and I was actually very sad to leave. Their home is surrounded by beautiful gardens and friendly neighbors. It is a perfect escape out of busy downtown seattle but is still walking/biking distance to all of the restaurants and fun the city has to offer. The room is also a good size with windows on both sides so you get a wonderful breeze. I couldn't recommend this place more. Both the place and people greatly exceeded my expectations. :)
75368	1633025	9.0	10.0	33723237	Great place, close enough to downtown that it was a pleasant walk in summer but far enough away that it is peaceful at night.

75369	1633025	9.0	10.0	34876854	Margot and Anthony were wonderful hosts. The house was conveniently located on several frequent bus lines and within walking distance of the main parts of capitol hill. The room was comfortable, quiet, and clean.

We really liked the neighborhood and were within a mile of most things with easy access to bus or light rail.  We would definitely stay again.

75377	1633025	9.0	10.0	50824561	I booked this just as I was pulling into Seattle  so I'm fortunate Anthony was able to accommodate me on short notice. Anthony is a super nice guy who answered any questions I had, provided me with some ideas on what to see in Seattle and beyond that just let me do my thing.

We really enjoyed the space, everything was clean and it felt like home.  This is not his private residence so there was a lot of space for our things.  Kitchen and bathroom were clean and all appliances worked great.  
I loved the back porch (when it wasn't raining) and we had no problems parking our 16' truck in the street. Great cafe and coffee shop a block away and walking distance from nightlife and restaurants on 15th st.  Short 10 min drive to downtown. Cameron always responded promptly with questions.  Great place, I would stay here again."

We loved the location of the Garden Suite.  Walking a block down to Tully's Coffee Shop was so fun, and we enjoyed Greek food at VIOS across from Tully's.  I fell in love with the kitchen, as it was very well equipped and easy to use.  Cameron even brought down a blender after I asked if there was one.  Roanne spent time showing me how to work the appliances and the fun French press for making ""gourmet coffee"".  The location was close to the University, Trader Joes, Central Co-op, Safeway and, most importantly, our new granddaughter!  :).  As soon as we have dates from our daughter, we would love to book Cameron's place again in October.  It was perfect (and very roomy).  All linens, toilet paper, laundry detergent, etc. were provided--even a vase for flowers.  All the comforts of home. . . parking was easy- right across street - and never had a problem finding a spot.  Could not have been happier.  Sincerely, Elaine Newton"

No waiting time.  The apartment was spotless and uncluttered and everything that I needed (plus a few items that I hadn't thought of--corkscrew, press coffee maker) was easy to find.  The set up of the apartment was great.  I would happily live there permanently.  The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous.  Bus service #10 on 15th; #12 on 19th is very convenient.  It is also great to be by the parks.  i highly recommend this apartment,

The backyard is wooded and private, we spent most of our time out there (we were fortunate to have a whole week of hot, summer days). Although a quaint neighborhood, it's an easy walk to coffee houses, cute shops (check out the Red Balloon on 15th if you have kids), and groceries. Plus, it's only three blocks to the awesome Volunteer Park. Our 2 year old spent hours at the playground and wading pool there. 

We would love to stay here again the next time we're in town as it's within 15 minutes of almost anywhere you might want to go in Seattle. The only thing I worry about is if our 2 year old was too loud for the upstairs tenant (you might want to check with the host first if you have kids).

76034	722537	9.0	10.0	17816130	"Cameron's place is fabulous and we had a fantastic 8 day stay in a modern, self-contained apartment with a great seating and BBQ area in the garden.  This place has all the amenities you could want and plenty of room (there were just two of us but easily sleeps 4).

It is light and airy and has great furniture, beds, linens, towels and cooking facilities (if needed).

The place was spotless and well kept to the highest standards.  If we return to Seattle this will be our choice of venue.  It has a great location with three great bars and restaurants just a 5 minute stroll in one direction on 19th with loads more bars etc in the opposite direction on 15th.

Communication with the host was first class."
76035	722537	9.0	10.0	19072442	Cameron was a pleasure to deal with and was always easy to get a hold of. His listing is just like the pictures, it is clean and the beds are comfortable. The house is located in a beautiful neighbourhood, and it is easy to get around. Would recommend Cameron and his listing, and would definitely stay again.  
76036	722537	9.0	10.0	21698264	"This was our second stay in Cameron's Garden Suite.  It was fantastic.  The home was well-stocked; and Cameron made special trips to install part for dishwasher, bring us ""low-suds"" laundry detergent, and help us open washer door.  He is the perfect host.  I was very pleased with the new kitchen additions of coffee maker and cookie sheets.:)  We're hoping to book the Garden Suite again sometime next Spring.  Thank you again, Cameron, for all your kindness.  Sincerely, Elaine and Michael Newton"
76037	722537	9.0	10.0	23209950	The flat was well stocked with towels, sheets, and other things that made it very easy to live there.  Location is great, and the backyard was a perfect place to send the kids outside.
76038	722537	9.0	10.0	23369919	We had a very good experience. We especially liked the roominess, the kitchen was well furnished with utensils and dish ware, the living room was comfortable. The place is quiet and we don't hear the other tenant. We love the location.  We walked to the coffee shop everyday. We had a car, and parking was mostly a non-issue. Over the 4.5 days of our stay, only once we couldn't find street parking right away.  
76039	722537	9.0	10.0	24971482	The Apartment was clean as advertised. Our stay was pleasant.
76040	722537	9.0	10.0	26243780	I booked the Garden Suite on behalf of an employee whose family our company was helping to relocate to Seattle from Costa Rica. Cameron provided a detailed document with information on the ins and outs of his listing and made himself available to answer all of my questions to make the process painless. My employee reported that the Garden Suite was perfect for his family of 5 and helped make the transition to permanent housing much less stressful.
76041	722537	9.0	10.0	28795893	We were stayed in Cameron's house for 42 nights, there is really nice house and location very well! Cameron and Roanne so kindly! If I have chance, I will stay more time here! Thank you so much! 
76042	722537	9.0	10.0	29829365	Everything was top notch.  Thanks, Cameron!
76043	722537	9.0	10.0	30441637	The Garden Suite was an excellent place to call home for a week. Everything was just as advertised. Simple but tasteful apartment with all the amenities. 
76044	722537	9.0	10.0	31651368	"Cameron's house is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood in Capitol Hill that was perfect for our group. Great parks nearby and the neighborhood itself was beautiful in May. The space was bright, clean and has all of the basic amenities. Furnishings are a little bit sparse, but all of the bases are covered. Great if you're planning on sightseeing during the day.

When we had an issue with the locks, Cameron responded right away to help us get it worked out and was very accommodating. Overall a very good experience and I would recommend this listing to friends."
76045	722537	9.0	10.0	32826312	"We had a WONDERFUL stay at this suite in Capitol Hill. The place was spotless when we arrived. The kitchen was well stocked, the layout was spacious and comfortable. We have a toddler and a baby, and Cameron was very kind, and provided us with a travel crib and a highchair upon our arrival.

The location is perfect - it's within easy walking distance to restaurants and Volunteer Park, and parking was never a problem.

We had a fabulous stay, and this will be among our first choices for our next trip to Seattle!"
76046	722537	9.0	10.0	34286173	"Great place!  We rented this apartment for my inlaws who were visiting from Spain for 2 weeks.  They loved it.  Kitchen looks out over back yard with huge windows.  
Cameron lives close and responded very quickly to a minor issue with the washer.  
Overall- this place is well worth the money and a great location!"
76047	722537	9.0	10.0	34832361	Quite and pretty neighborhood. Great launching pad for various parts of Seattle and environs. Apartment as advertised, perfect for our group of three. Many thanks!  
76048	722537	9.0	10.0	35201504	The listing was accurate. The host was responsive to our requests and questions.  This rental is an outstanding value.  Fantastic location in a quiet neighborhood but only a short walk to some nice restaurants, cafes and other shops.  The Garden Suite was very well furnished and clean.  Very nice to sit on the shady porch and have breakfast or whatever else.  I highly recommend this rental,  especially if you want to do a bit of your own cooking or are visiting Seattle with a family, it's much better and cheaper than staying at a hotel.
76049	722537	9.0	10.0	36527221	What a sweet place.  My kids and I were in town to visit my older daughter and loved having this little home to call ours for a week.  The beds were very, very comfortable.  Very.  I had inquired earlier as to whether or not the house had a blender and Cameron had offered to drop off his own if we found that we didn't have what we needed when we got there (it turned out to have a blender there!).  We would have liked the kitchen to be a little better appointed with things like baking dishes, aluminum foil, salt and pepper, etc.  But we made due just fine, and I'm sure if I'd asked, Cameron would have stopped by with anything we needed.  The bus system was easy and the location was perfect for us: an easy bus trip to anything we wanted to visit and only a 30 minute walk from my daughter's work at the NOAA facility by the canal.  She stayed with us for the weekend and made use of Cameron's extra futon and bedding.  The internet was a bit slow - not sure why.  My daughter ended up tethering with her phone to do her online homework.  But it wasn't a huge problem for the rest of us.  We'd definitely stay again.  Thanks, Cameron!
76050	722537	9.0	10.0	37301283	The place exceeded expectations! We were given a very thorough rundown of the neighborhood, how to get around, use the wifi, wash clothes, etc. Great experience! 
76051	722537	9.0	10.0	38106302	"We brought our family of 4 to Seattle for the first time and were very happy with our stay in the Garden Suite!  It had everything we needed - and more.  Looking at the forecast, we were a little afraid of traveling during a mini heat wave and staying without air conditioning.  Cameron dropped off a fan the day we arrived.  How's that for service!?  

Kitchen was great - outfitted with enough for us to have breakfast and then head out for our adventures.  Neighborhood was quiet and friendly, with a great park (Volunteer Park) a few blocks away, which has a great little playground for kids as well as a wading pool for the warmer days.

I would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a place in Seattle.  "
76052	722537	9.0	10.0	38814893	We had a great Time. The house was a bit smaller than expected, but well equiped and up to our needs. The neighboorhood is wonderful with some nice coffeeshops and Restaurants in walking distance. We would definitely stay there again
76053	722537	9.0	10.0	41730675	Thank you for a great stay at the house - we were made to feel very welcome. We felt at home immediately, especially with the well equipped kitchen, and absolutely loved the place - so much so that several people wished that they could stay longer! The home was exactly as described, and shown in the pictures. The neighbourhood was great with free on street parking and being close to several supermarkets and restaurants, as well as easy to get to downtown! Thank you for a a great stay!
76054	722537	9.0	10.0	42656172	"We had a wonderful stay in North Capitol! This a bright, clean and comfortable place in a beautiful (website hidden) in fridge was welcoming as was the comfortable beds, French press and other amenities throughout that truly made it home away from home with our three kids. Roanne and Cameron couldn't have been nicer, nor more accommodating. Public transit was easy from this location and coffee shops were cozy and kid-tolerant. I would definitely recommend this location for couples or families. (*If you bring small children look for the ""Treasure Tree"" up the street a couple of blocks on Prospect on your way to the wonderful park not far from the house."""
76055	722537	9.0	10.0	44026707	This is a great space. It is clean, spacious, really well stocked with all the comforts of home. We had a great time. And the location in Capitol Hill was awesome. A rental car is recommended but not necessary, depending on how far out of the neighborhood you'd want to go. 
76056	722537	9.0	10.0	56771501	We had a wonderful 3 month stay in the Garden Suite. The place was clean and nice, and Cameron was a great and helpful host during the entire period.
76913	442487	9.0	10.0	1383262	"Margot and Ivy's place is in a quiet and lush neighborhood that's still a convenient bus ride to downtown.  It's a small walk to some very nice cafes, bookstores, and restaurants (thumbs up for Elliott Bay Book Co., Oddfellows and Molly Noon!).  The beautiful and peaceful Arboretum isn't far off either.  

The studio itself is very spacious and comfortable.  The surrounding gardens are beautiful and the hens right outside the window added some unexpected charm to this urban oasis.  Margot and Ivy were lovely and considerate hostesses.  Would definitely recommend. "
76914	442487	9.0	10.0	1391873	"This was my first time using air BnB and it was a great experience (To be honest, I think I may have been permanently spoiled). 

The place is a beautiful, clean and spacious studio basement with plenty of light and views up to the permaculture garden above. Fresh eggs, coffee, tea, recommendations, wifi, an extra bed, and a private shower were all amenities I was very thankful for after having been driving for days on end. 

One great perk is that the space is separate from the main unit, which means you don't feel awkward coming and going (as I had to do at 3:45 AM to drive to seatac airport).

Margot and her daughter were VERY friendly, exceptionally thoughtful, and made the entire process fluid and fun.

Thanks guys!
"
76915	442487	9.0	10.0	1403148	I've stayed with Margot and Ivy a couple of times and always look to see if their place is open before booking another spot.  This light and bright studio is very welcoming and comfortable.  As other guests have stated, the linens are very nice, the location is stellar and the hosts very accommodating.  You don't often find yourself having a cup of tea for an hour while returning someone's key :-)  I felt instantly welcome here and enjoyed the sense of community, not to mention the urban farm feel with the lush gardens and curious chickens!  Fresh flowers, eggs or other goodies from your hostesses are a bonus, as is the full kitchen.  Hope to see you again soon!
76916	442487	9.0	10.0	1473567	This is a fantastic place (comfortable, cozy, private, quiet) in a great location in Capitol Hill.  Just minutes from grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants (check Safeway, Coastal Kitchen, Cafe Ladro, and Victrola Coffee Roasters on 15th Street). Just great! I really enjoyed staying at Margot and Ivy's Lovely Garden Studio - I highly recommend it. The garden and the fresh eggs were a plus. 
76917	442487	9.0	10.0	1497032	"Our stay at Margot and Ivy's studio was the perfect way to end our trip across the US and overall the best Airbnb experience we've had.
What else is there to say... we loved the place, the garden and the hens and we highly recommend you meet the lovely hosts Margot and Ivy."
76918	442487	9.0	10.0	1504683	The apartment was very clean and cozy.  We truly enjoyed the fresh- from-the-garden strawberries from Ivy.  Margot gave us many ideas for places to eat also, which we appreciated.  And loved watching the chickens in the morning.
76919	442487	9.0	10.0	1536904	The lovely garden studio is indeed lovely with charming bouquets, fresh strawberries and eggs from the chickens you can view out the windows. For a basement apartment it is especially light and has a pleasant feel. Margot and Ivy are very nice and are happy to make your stay a wonderful one. They are good communicators and check in and out is easy. The neighborhood is quiet but people live upstairs so earplugs might be handy for light sleepers. Great place and great value!
76920	442487	9.0	10.0	1546002	Staying with Margot and Ivy was great, the room was huge and quiet with great light, lovely and clean too. They were very communicative when it came to seeing if I needed anything and making sure I had the keys but did not disturb me atall. I would not hesitate to go back and stay for a longer amount of time, it really was lovely!
76921	442487	9.0	10.0	1556539	"Margot and Ivy provided the ultimate space for a quick getaway into the city.  The studio is minutes from everything.  It was close enough for me to get the middle of the city in just a few blocks but far enough from the urban core for me to feel like I'd stepped into the relaxation of small neighborhood comfort.

The interior was comfortable and well tended with wonderful attention to detail.  A welcoming packet provided plenty of information on the space, the neighborhood, and how to enjoy our stay.  It was warm and comfortable with the soft linens and soft carpet.  

The chickens were quiet enough to barely know they were there but cute as heck when peeking back at me through the kitchen window.  One evening we were greeted with a gift of fresh eggs delivered to our door!  I was able to use fresh rosemary from the front garden and whipped upa fantastic late-night breakfast.  It was delicious! 

I would recommend this space to anyone.  It is perfect for a business traveler, a student, a suburban escapee who needs a quick getaway (like me!) for  weekend, and plenty of other folks too."
76922	442487	9.0	10.0	1655086	We found many parallels between our lives and Margot and Ivy's. The location is fabulous, the hominess perfect, and the price better than right. We were very happy. Traveling with personal connections like we had with Margot and Ivy make the experience so much nicer! They are down home and real. Much thanks, you two!
76923	442487	9.0	10.0	1676130	"We loved Margot and Ivy's place!  It was super cute and clean and in the middle of a great neighborhood.  Being able to experience a neighborhood rather than just a tourist hotel is part of what made our trip to Seattle special.  They are great hosts and it is a great palce to stay!
"
76924	442487	9.0	10.0	1709870	"I had a great, but too short, stay at Margot & Ivy's truly lovely studio.  Even if this weren't a very nice place to stay with warm, welcoming hosts and features including a comfortable bed (not too soft, not too hard), lots of good pillows, soft sheets and duvet, big and fluffy towels, a shower with good water pressure, fresh eggs from the chickens out your window, a full kitchen, lots of natural light, beautiful flower gardens, safe and quiet neighborhood...even if all those things weren't true - which, of course, they are! - you should stay here because this location can't be beat if you plan to roam around the city on public transportation a fair bit.  

I know it's not obvious at first glance of the map, but hear me out. From the bus stops within 2 blocks, you can get almost anywhere on just one bus:  downtown/waterfront/Convention Center (route 11 or 43), Capital Hill (8), Seattle Center/Space Needle (8), UW (43 or 48), Ballard Locks (43), Golden Gardens Beach (48).  It took far less effort for me to get to where I needed or wanted to be from this studio than from a hotel near downtown on my last visit.  So if comfort alone doesn't sway you, the logistical aspect should.  

I can't say enough about the great hospitality and friendliness from Margot and Ivy.  I leave wishing I could have spent more time visiting with them.  I hope to return soon!"
76925	442487	9.0	10.0	1722399	We had a great time at Margot's and Ivy's place. The studio was clean and spacious for three people. It's also very conveniently located. Margot was very friendly and we enjoyed the fresh eggs and strawberries. 
76926	442487	9.0	10.0	1763111	"Margot & Ivy's place was perfect for our overnight in Seattle as a 3 person party! Lots of space and easy access to public transportation. They also live in a very trendy area of Seattle, so if you are a foodie/interested in nightlife, this is a great spot for you!

We love the chickens as well! And anywhere that let's you cut fresh flowers for your stay get's an A in our book! Thank you for a lovely stay!"
76927	442487	9.0	10.0	1776369	This was by far the best AirBnB place we have experienced.  Everything was just lovely and beautiful, plus wonderful hosts.  Had a lovely time and look forward to returning again,
76928	442487	9.0	10.0	1848447	We arrived a bit later than we had hoped but Ivy graciously greeted us and showed us around. It was even more lovely than the pictures. And having a fresh bag of coffee waiting in the fridge was very much appreciated. It felt like home-except the bed is much more comfortable than mine! They provided lots of info on the neighborhood and sightseeing so a great place for first time visitors, or someone who wants a place in town. Highly recommended!
76929	442487	9.0	10.0	1930430	"MArgot and her family are the nicest people we have met during the 6 weeks we passed in USA. They are helpfull and let you some privacy but are always there for you if you need something. The studio was perfect for us, and the chickens behind the kitchen's window was so fun! And so are  their fresh eggs!
If you try airbnb for the first time you will not be disappointed. We wish that we could come back here again in the futur!"
76930	442487	9.0	10.0	1948621	Fabulous basement  studio apartment in Capitol Hill area.  Parking was not a problem at all!  Clean, quiet and we loved the chickens outside the kitchen window.  We would definitely stay there again!
76931	442487	9.0	10.0	1967921	This lovely studio was perfect for my family that includes two young children.  It has the feel of staying with family and being spoiled with our own private space and freedom.  The studio is spacious and bright, completely comfortable and home-clean.  It was awesome having the chickens outside our kitchen window and garden flowers to enjoy!  We had our windows open all night and barely noticed the occasional cluck in the evening as we took in the fresh air.  The space is incredibly quiet considering how close this urban farm is to big city fun.  The neighborhood along the main drag has great eats, a Trader Joe's, Safeway and fun shops.  Margot was so generous with allowing my young daughter to collect the offering of eggs for our breakfast, help out rearranging the chicken coop, inviting us to picnic under the mimosa tree, roam her lovely urban farm freely and even gave us a tomato to complete our home cooked dinner so that we didn't have to go to the store.  This is a basement suite with very friendly and quiet people upstairs.  There is a small park for the kiddos to play on the corner, another park just 3 blocks up the hill that has fountains to splash in, and Madison Park with it's amazing amount of play equipment and the bay is only 1.5'ish miles away.  We even got to swim in the bay!  We couldn't have had a lovlier time.  We were in town for a family wedding that was going to require a hotel bill of $230+ a night.  We are so fortunate to have found Margot and Ivy's spot to save us a load of money AND the experience was priceless!  My kids had a blast and we look forward to another stay next summer :)
76932	442487	9.0	10.0	1999879	Margot and Ivy are wonderful hosts and their studio is a quintessential slice of what is great with Seattle! From their great communication and welcome materials to the urban chickens, from the exceptional walking location to the fresh flowers, their place is warm, fun and welcoming.
76933	442487	9.0	10.0	2009961	Although our stay at Margot and Ivy's studio apartment was less than 24 hours, it was very memorable! The apartment set up was comfortable and sweet with a urban-farm theme with a small chicken farm out the kitchen window! It was such a gem staying in a hip neighborhood at such an affordable cost! Ivy even wrote out a guide of neighborhood eats. I would definitely recommend and rent again at this lovely studio apartment!
76934	442487	9.0	10.0	2020459	"The modest basement apartment was a good fit for my 8 year old and I for the night.  Margot gave us a great recommendation for dinner in the neighborhood, a delicious french bistro as well as an ice cream shop a little further down the road.  It was very easy to use to the bus to take us to Seattle Center.  Thanks for a great stay.

76935	442487	9.0	10.0	2027659	I very much enjoyed meeting Margot, Ivy and  other family members too.  The place was great and very convenient too.  I appreciated the tips that were provided for me.  Thank you Margot and Ivy!
76936	442487	9.0	10.0	2053568	Although we arrived very late, the little flat was a safe haven after our rather tedious journey from Germany. It's comfy and light, and we all really enjoyed our stay here. The tips on what to do and the restaurant-suggestions were very useful (I, too, would recommend the Thai, we just loved it!) and alltogether, we had a pleasant two-day stay in Seattle. 
76937	442487	9.0	10.0	2092406	1 night stay with a friend. We found the place easily and were happy with our visit. The space is clean and well situated for the price. We walked into downtown and visited local neighborhood-y spots in 20-30 minutes. I would stay here again! No hassle, simple quick meet up with owners to get key. They are living right next door. Especially liked having chickens right out the window (no noise issues at all, just beautiful lively creatures ;-) 
76938	442487	9.0	10.0	2123512	We had a wonderful two day stay at the garden studio.  It was a spacious and clean environment plus convenient (by bus) to down town Seattle.  I would recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in Seattle. 
76939	442487	9.0	10.0	2227994	"They left us a bowl of fresh eggs, and invited us to nibble from their garden - do I really need to say more?

My husband and I were thrilled with Margot & Ivy's garden-level studio apartment. Very easy to find and access. Clean and tidy, lots of local info on-hand. Great quiet location, proximal to shops, restaurants, and mass transit. On-street parking much, much easier than anticipated. 

We are looking forward to staying here for all of our future Seattle trips.

"
76940	442487	9.0	10.0	2242389	This place is great. It's large, has a very comfy bed, full kitchen, and is in a great neighborhood. Margot and Ivy even left delicious fresh eggs from their chickens for us in the morning.
76941	442487	9.0	10.0	2287678	The studio is cozy, well lit and in walking distance from downtown. Everyone in the family was super welcoming and kind - I can fully recommend staying with Margo and Ivy to everyone!
76942	442487	9.0	10.0	2331558	"A short but wonderful stay with charming hosts.  We were entertained by the antics of the chickens outside the kitchen window every morning and rewarded with 4 fresh eggs for breakfast.  
The studio is within walking distance of some very nice restaurants, bars and coffee shops and is close to bus routes ... so no need to drive anywhere.  We loved Seattle ... especially Pike's Market Place ... but sadly didn't have time to visit the art galleries (closed on Monday) .... something for next time.  The ferry trip to Bainbridge gave us a glimpse of the wonderful coastline and islands around Seattle. 
Would definitely stay here again, thank you Margot and Ivy."
76943	442487	9.0	10.0	2378896	"While we didn't get to meet Margot or Ivy (we were all super-busy!), my sister and I enjoyed our stay in their Capitol Hill studio apartment.

We arrived on the early side of our expected ETA ... Ivy & Margot had not had a chance to get into the studio between our arrival and their last guests' departure.  A quick phone call, however, put things right. We were able find a super-cute restaurant for a delicious Basque dinner while Ivy took care of business.  In an hour, the apartment was cleaned and ready for us -- plus, they gave us gift cards for free coffees.  Yay!

They live in a great area and provide a folder full of really helpful info about the apartment, public transit and food recommendations.  Added bonus: be prepared to meet their adorable chickens in the side yard (I actually got to feed them by simply opening the kitchen window)!  "
76944	442487	9.0	10.0	2461961	Everything was as described. Margot and Ivy were very attentive hosts and made sure we had everything we needed. The location is great and much of Seattle is walkable or has easy public transit options. 
76945	442487	9.0	10.0	2536670	"I moved to Seattle and came here with just the things in my car. Margot & Ivy's Garden Studio is located in the neighborhood I had wanted to live in. And sure enough, it was a guest space, located at the basement of a house. Things were clean, and I was left to my devices.

I was able to sign a lease on my apartment ... and then instead of taking advantage of the free parking space at my apartment building, I decided to stay one more night on a ""real bed"".

I woke up the next morning to hop in my car to get some lunch ... and my car was gone. Turns out, it had been stolen, and the possessions I had left in there were gone. Most of my important things were already in the new apartment or still at the guest house. 

I drive an older Honda Accord. On Cap Hill, it is a very popular car for theft and car prowl. (Lesson Learned: if you are driving out here and have an older Honda Accord, make sure you get one of those club security devices and don't leave valuables in the car). Combined with my carelessly left-out GPS and stereo system, it's not surprising  someone broke in.

The reason this is a 5 star review is because of Margot's help afterwards. She didn't have to help me get my apartment setup -- she really didn'tt: blame is to the car thieves, even though the rest of us have to pick up the pieces -- but she help anyways. I never felt that she wanted to help because of AirBnB ratings. Margot and her family are much like a lot of people I've met on the West Coast: people who want to help you because they want to help.

This is the kind of neighbors I like. You should totally stay here when you visit Seattle-- the people are great. Besides, you know you want to say ""hi"" to the chickens."
76946	442487	9.0	10.0	2639067	This was my first stay at an Airbnb property and I am definately spoiled by this one!  Margot & Ivy were both extremely friendly and helpful.  The apartment is very cozy and warm.  I felt at home immediately.  The bed is very comfy...maybe too comfy!  And what a great way to start your morning by having chickens outside your kitchen window!  It always brought a smile to my face!  Nice to have herbs and flowers outside your window as well.  The property is very convenient to buses, restaurants and coffee shops (Ladro, a favorite of mine).  Parking was never a problem and the neighborhood felt very safe for a single woman coming home at night.  I would love to stay at this apartment again and would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Seattle.  The only drawback to giving it such a good review...I'm afraid it will now always be busy and I won't be able to get a reservation when I visit again!  Thank you Margot & Ivy for a delightful and comforting space.

76948	442487	9.0	10.0	5018838	Super friendly hosts, and were very accomodating to my difficult schedule.  Place was clean, well located and comfortable.  I regret never seeing the chickens, but perhaps next time.
76949	442487	9.0	10.0	5075900	We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was comfortable and quiet. It was in a perfect location within walking distance from our favorite Capital Hill destinations but without any of the parking headaches. We would love to stay again!
76950	442487	9.0	10.0	5375145	We really had a wonderful stay at Margot and Ivy's place.  The studio is clean and comfortable.  It has all the necessities of home as well as a few neat extras.  Among those are the resident chickens outside the kitchen window.  My son and daughter really enjoyed feeding them our scraps every morning and eating an occasional egg as well.  The place is also situated in the middle of a garden, and Margot was very gracious in letting us pick some raspberries and strawberries each morning for our breakfast.  As far as the location goes, you can't find a much better area in which to stay in my opinion.  The Capitol Hill area is beautiful with many cool cafes right around the corner.  We especially enjoyed some of the nearby restaurants and parks.  Even just strolling around the area was fun as the houses and landscaping are colorful and vibrant.   If you want to be downtown, it is a very pleasant 30 minute walk.  This place was definitely one of the reasons why we enjoyed our trip to Seattle so much.
76951	442487	9.0	10.0	5445792	We really enjoyed our stay and found the apartment to be affordable, comfortable, and roomy enough for three people.  We especially appreciated the lovely gardens, the posse of chickens that like to poke their heads in through the kitchen window, and the great neighborhood.  We highly recommend dinner at Cafe Flora just down the hill.  Oh my goodness, so delicious!  But we also really appreciated the ability to cook our own meals in the kitchen, which was well equipped with pots, pans, etc.  Margot and Ivy were very kind and responsive to our needs.  Communication was great! 
76952	442487	9.0	10.0	5554296	I booked a stay here in this studio for my parents when they visited Seattle from Delaware.  The studio is beautifully kept up, clean and light (impressive for a basement/garden-level studio) and Margot and Ivy were both extremely kind and helpful.  My parents also got seemingly endless entertainment from the chickens visible at the kitchen window.  I can attest that the studio lies in a quiet, yet central/walkable, neighborhood with a lot of character; I live less than 2 blocks away!  Overall, the experience was all that we expected and more.  Thanks!
76953	442487	9.0	10.0	5657138	I had a very comfortable 3-night stay in Margot and Ivy's apartment. Margot and Anthony were very welcoming and helpful as I arrived earlier than the checking-in time. I enjoyed having the chickens outside the kitchen window with the bonus that I had a fresh egg each day of my stay. Margot was even able to provide an egg-cup for me as this appears to be a particular English tradition! The location is ideal with easy access to buses and with stores and coffee shops close by. Margot was attentive to my comfort during my stay, keeping in touch by phone, text and email; I enjoyed being able to chat over some iced tea  would certainly stay here again if I return to Seattle.
76954	442487	9.0	10.0	5727853	"I had a very nice stay this past weekend. As everyone has mentioned, the chickens outside the window were very entertaining and sweet. Fresh eggs in the AM a bonus. Margot was welcoming and very nice considering I made a mistake with my reservation. 
I was also welcomed by a wonderful blooming garden. On the practical side - there was always street parking available, it's close to good food, convenient for transportation and very quiet."
76955	442487	9.0	10.0	5881359	We had a wonderful stay in the apartment. We did not meet Margot  or Ivy but we spoke on the phone and the logistics went without a hitch. The apartment is very comfortable and clean. It is on a quiet street, surrounded by flowers. The chickens outside the kitchen window at eye level are hypnotizing. Our daughter lives a 15 minute walk away so it was very convenient. The arboretum, Lake Washington, Madison Valley and Capitol Hill are all within walking distances. 
76956	442487	9.0	10.0	6169990	We stayed at the Lovely Garden Studio three times over three weeks.  It was a comfortable, convenient and informal situation that felt like home by the end.  It was a quiet street with easy parking close to what we needed on Capitol Hill.  It couldn't have been a better stay.  One thing though: you must be prepared for a few curious chickens looking in at you at the kitchen window.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat.
76957	442487	9.0	10.0	6270046	Margot and Ivy's Garden Studio apartment was fantastic. The space was very clean and had a ton of character. We were greeted with a fresh collection of chicken eggs taken from the coop outside the kitchen windows. The apartment was easily accessible and street parking was plentiful at all hours. Margot is very responsive in all communication. We hope to make it to Seattle again soon and will cross our fingers that this apartment is available.
76958	442487	9.0	10.0	6341705	A great stay at Seattle. A very cosy and clean apartment.The bathroom could be refurbished. We loved the hens and the hens loved our cornflakes. Quiet neigbourhood. We recommend this place to everyone.
76959	442487	9.0	10.0	6455556	We enjoyed staying in this studio apartment, it was close to everything we wanted to see and we never had problems navigating our way to or from the neighborhood.  The apartment was clean and comfortable, much larger than a hotel and had more of a homely feel.  I would definitely stay here again.
76960	442487	9.0	10.0	6504902	Lovely space!  Great area not too far from downtown.  It was away from the hustle and bustle of the city and we thought it was so charming!  Kitchen, bathroom, bed, and little dining area.  We didn't spend too much time in Seattle, so we only had two nights with Margot & Ivy but this space was perfect!  :)
76961	442487	9.0	10.0	6589858	As first time Airbnb users, my boyfriend & I loved this experience! Great location that was a short drive to all the Seattle sights. Enjoyed the charm of the homegrown fruits & veggies surrounding the home and the chickens outside. Plenty of street parking for our rental. Communication with Margot & Ivy was great and they were quick to solve a tiny issue we had with ants (some found their way inside because the warm weather). The studio was neat, clean, and had all that we needed. We would definitely recommend this studio or any place that Margot & Ivy might list!
76962	442487	9.0	10.0	6755457	Margot was a great host! Even provided bike helmets to us because we forgot ours. :) We had a beautiful time in Seattle.

76964	442487	9.0	10.0	6854117	Margot & Ivy had a great place for us to stay, we never ran into them, but the place was great. The chickens were fun to feed. The location was close to downtown and we were able to drive back and forth through out the day to relax in the room.
76965	442487	9.0	10.0	6958278	We had an absolutely lovely stay at Margot and Ivy's studio apartment. Leading up to our arrival, Margot was helpful and quick to respond to emails and texts. We arrived to beautiful fresh cut flowers from the garden, eggs from the hens, and a delicious bowl of trail mix. The location was perfect for walking to Cap Hill and provided easy access by car or public transportation to other nearby neighborhoods. 
76966	442487	9.0	10.0	7196978	"The apartment was clean, the bed comfy, and everything worked. It's also in a great location: a nice quiet neighborhood, yet close to everything we wanted to see. Loved the chickens. Margot and Ivy also gave us very detailed directions and information, and responded immediately when I had a question. Great experience!
"
76967	442487	9.0	10.0	7256497	After you stay in a number of airbnb homes, you realize that some people do it for the money, and others do it because they have the resources to rent out their space and they want others to experience the home that they love. Margot and Ivy's studio is made for visitors, and you can tell they really love to share their home with guests. They leave recommendations and maps, and you can really tell they love where they live. Margot went out of her way to show my husband and me around, but allowed us to keep to ourselves and explore Seattle on our own. Quiet location (with the occasional exception of the chickens) and conveniently located.
76968	442487	9.0	10.0	7733748	If you love home away from home you will appreciate this quiet garden level studio apartment nestled in one of Seattle's beautiful neighborhoods. Just a few blocks from parks, grocery stores and hip places to eat and shop at. The host was warm, helpful and the accommodations clean and cheerful. We hope to stay their again in the future.
76969	442487	9.0	10.0	13546590	 I didn't get the chance to meet Margot & Anthony during my stay, but communication before, during, and as we were checking out was quick and easy. They were very responsive to any questions we had. Their location is perfect: they are in a quiet neighborhood, but are within walking distance to a number of different neighborhoods with great restaurants, cafes and bars. I highly recommend Margot & Anthony's space. 
76970	442487	9.0	10.0	14508286	The apartment and the neighborhood were as promised.  I would recommend the apartment to anyone wishing to stay in Seattle.  The price was very reasonable and the kitchen helped to keep our expenses down.
76971	442487	9.0	10.0	14734136	Nice stay! Great neighbourhood. Enough space  in the  studio. We took the bus to the center, it was easy to travel . Margot makes you feel at home.
76972	442487	9.0	10.0	15135401	A very convenient location for all our activities while in Seattle. A quiet side street with very nice accommodations. We have no complaints and enjoyed meeting our hosts. We would rate this as a top spot to stay during future visits to Seattle.
76973	442487	9.0	10.0	15389228	I had a great time staying in Margot and Anthony's studio. The studio is in the renovated basement of the house next door to where they live, in a lovely quiet neighbourhood. Getting to and from downtown and the airport by public transit was very easy. There is a large Safeway close by, and the studio has a decent sized kitchen which makes cooking easy. Margot is a very friendly host, and the chickens were friendly too.
76974	442487	9.0	10.0	15816772	Margot is a lovely host. She cares very much about the comfort of her guests and will accommodate your needs as best she can. The unit is just as it is pictured. The location off of E Madison was very convenient as a central point between downtown and Madison Park. Seattle was experiencing record heat, so the basement apartment was a blessing. 
76975	442487	9.0	10.0	16059525	Margot and Anthony were great! They had a lovely studio. Upon entering, there was a beautiful vase full of freshly picked flowers from the garden. The neighborhood was cute and quiet, perfect for strolling around. The chickens in the backyard were great and very friendly! Thanks again!
76976	442487	9.0	10.0	18464329	The accommodations were great and one of the best parts was meeting and talking w Margo.
76977	442487	9.0	10.0	19021878	The neighborhood was delightfully accessible by foot (our preferred method of travel), conveniently close to everything we wanted to do and a pleasant neighborhood that was well lived in. Our Hosts offered us FRESH chicken eggs, were available for our needs but didn't dote on us, and everything was delivered as advertised.
76978	442487	9.0	10.0	19410376	"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a week, and it was the perfect spot for us. The neighborhood is beautiful and the apartment was clean and cute. We really appreciated the welcome packet that was provided to give information on the apartment and surrounding area. We're pretty private people and really appreciated that they were so helpful without being at all intrusive.

If you are coming from out of town and are planning on doing a lot of exploring around the city, we highly recommend pre-ordering an ORCA card and putting some money on it so you can easily get around (and it made it really easy to get from the airport to Margot & Anthony's). There are busses nearby that can take you pretty much anywhere you'd like to go.

If you're trying to stay in Seattle on a budget, this is definitely the place for you. We could not have asked for a nicer stay!"
76979	442487	9.0	10.0	19612643	"The studio was really really nice. A really quiet nice road with a 'suburbia' feel but still very close to central Seattle. There are some major bus routes close by but as the weather was so good we just walked. 

Studio is a great size and the bed was very comfortable. All the amenities we needed were included. We didn't get to meet Margot but Anthony was very helpful, helping us with and early check-in and an early morning taxi when we left. Would certainly stay again, highly recommended."
76980	442487	9.0	10.0	19938815	We had a great stay at Margo & Anthony's place. Pretty much anywhere we wanted to go was within five miles. There was plenty of street parking for our rental car. The place was nice and comfortable and private. It was fun to feed the chickens outside of the window. I never got to meet Margot face to face, but we talked on the phone and she was very nice and made sure we had a great stay. Thank you!
76981	442487	9.0	10.0	20249180	"Our stay was very comfortable. The apartment was fully equipped and the fresh cut-flowers on arrival were a nice touch.

We loved the neighbourhood; and the location is convenient for both the attractions in Downtown and those around the Space Needle, as long as you're comfortable availing yourselves of the many and frequent buses close by (journey times less than 25 mins).

Margot was very helpful with a swift response to any communications.

We were grateful for flexibility on the check out time.

We will certainly consider staying at Margot and Anthony's flat the next time we visit Seattle.

- I loved the chickens outside of the kitchen window!

76982	442487	9.0	10.0	20817120	My parents really enjoyed their stay. Quiet location, close to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods and lovely chickens!
76983	442487	9.0	10.0	21051558	We loved staying at this cute little apartment. It had kitchen and laundry supplies included, which was very convenient. It's located in a very walk-able part of Seattle, near a lot of great restaurants and bars. Highly recommended! 
76984	442487	9.0	10.0	21209836	Lovely quiet little street.  The location was ideal, walkable to everything in Capitol Hill and surrounding areas. Thank you Margot & Anthony.
76985	442487	9.0	10.0	21511474	Margot was very very helpful. The Place is exactly how they described it. Is very specious. The bed is super comfortable. We loved the chickens they are the most friendly ones i have ever seen. They are super cute. The neighborhood was conveniently located super close to downtown, we used uber and the fare was no more than 8 dolllars to downtown so pretty convenient. Also is walking distance from a lot of coffee shops and bars. If you want to get a taste of Seattle. Stay with Margot. We had good communication she responded very fast, we are very pleased with our experience!  
76986	442487	9.0	10.0	22022021	"There were so many little ways Margot and Anthony welcomed me to Seattle. It began with a lovely email message of confirmation of my reservation, followed by a personal greeting upon arrival, fresh flowers & eggs and a fabulous list of resources for my visit. The apartment was as pictured. It is very light, airy and comfortable for one or two persons. 
The local area is an eclectic array of homes with a lovely variety of landscaping, mature trees and abundant color. It was easy walking distance to where I was visiting with many local bus routes nearby. "
76987	442487	9.0	10.0	22307462	Margot was helpful in accommodating our late check in and unusual check out times. The space matches the pictures and the kitchen is fully stocked with pots, pans, and other cooking needs. We enjoyed the neighborhood and were able to explore much of Seattle on foot from the property.  The apartment is easily accessed using public transport from the airport. I would highly recommend the space for those looking for a quiet urban retreat! 
76988	442487	9.0	10.0	22477763	The space is just as photographed but there are several minor maintenance issues that need to be addressed and it feels a bit like they are more concerned with filling the bed every night than looking after this property.
76989	442487	9.0	10.0	22589938	It was a lovely stay, comfortable and well appointed apartment in a fun neighborhood. We enjoyed walking to Luc for desert, and it was easy to get downtown and to the University District. We had everything we needed to be quite comfortable. Thank you!
76990	442487	9.0	10.0	23045516	This was a great and quiet place to stay. Really enjoyed my time here and will try to stay againin thre future. Thanks for making me feel so welcome!
76991	442487	9.0	10.0	23728430	I rented this space for my folks when they came to visit and it was perfect. Margot was incredibly welcoming, helpful and available to answer questions. My folks got around easily, both on foot and taking the bus. The place is clean, cute and comfortable.
76992	442487	9.0	10.0	23968947	Margot & Anthony were wonderful hosts.  Communication back and forth was easy and speedy.  They made sure we understood everything we needed to know about the studio and were very clear and thorough.  Plenty of parking is available and the heater kept us nice and warm at night. Location was in a nice quiet neighborhood.  We would stay here again and recommend to friends.
76993	442487	9.0	10.0	24343787	The place is clear and welcoming. Very interesting nice hosts. Highly recommend. 
76994	442487	9.0	10.0	24554763	A relaxing, nice place. Accurate description. Beautiful neighborhood.

the location is quiet and a bit away from the noise of the city, and a relaxing atmosphere. "
76996	442487	9.0	10.0	36276536	Margot & Anthony are both incredibly welcoming and lovely hosts. We didn't get a chance to meet them in person, but communication with them was a breeze. The eggs they left for us were a delight, and the chickens were adorable. Even though it was really hot out for the few days that we were there, the studio remained at a very comfortable steady temperature all day and night. I would recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay at their garden studio.
76997	442487	9.0	10.0	36659975	"Although I have not met Margot or Anthony in person I felt they were really nice people the way email communication went. I arrived on an overnight flight so early in the morning and Margot made it easy for me to find the keys.
Me and my boyfriend felt very welcome as the studio is just so nice and cozy and clean.
The neighborhood is amazing. Lush green very quiet street and you can still walk downtown in half an hour or take one of the many frequent buses.
I would never want to stay downtown with this alternative. It was actually nice to come ""come"" to this quiet area after a full day downtown. 
Thank you!"
76998	442487	9.0	10.0	37557391	"The host met us upon our arrival and was friendly. The location was very good and the parking out front was great. The place had everything you needed to do your own cooking and make your stay comfortable. The place was clean and organized. 
You had to pay particular attention to keeping the kitchen counter tops exceptionally clean to avoid the visit from the local ant colony. This may have been a result of the exceptionally dry summer Seattle has experienced.
I am not sure why it was termed lovely ""garden"" studio as there wasn't really any garden. Again maybe a result of the dry summer.
When you are leaving make sure you sweep the floor, take out the garbage to the designated place and start a load of wash for the towels and bed sheets or the host will charge you an additional $30US.
Overall it was a convenient place to stay in central Seattle.

"
76999	442487	9.0	10.0	38692507	Margot è sempre stata gentile e disponibile. La casa è confortevole, ampia, silenziosa, in un quartiere molto gradevole ben servito dai mezzi pubblici
77000	442487	9.0	10.0	39372977	Great communication with the host, though we never actually met up due to us being so busy and their conflicting schedules. Margot made sure we had everything we needed, and was able to get an iron and ironing board upon our request. We met one of the residents who lived in the house, and he gave us some great advice on things to do. The best suggestion was Chuck's hop shop, a great place for beer lovers, and probably only a mile away. One thing that we were surprised about (in a good way) was our access to a washer and dryer. I might have missed it in the original description of the place, but it was nice to have so we could go on to Portland with clean clothes. It was pretty warm a couple days for our stay, but even in the lower nineties during the day, it got cool enough in the evening that with an open window and the thoughtful fan Margot left for us, we were comfortable at night. The place was clean when we arrived, though the sheets had an odor to them like they may have been left in the washer too long after a cycle. Not a big deal to wash them ourselves with the aforementioned washer and dryer. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Margot!
77001	442487	9.0	10.0	39906660	"This location was close to a large Safeway store and bus routes to different parts of Seattle. We used the light rail and bus from the airport following Margot's accurate instructions. We bought an Orca card at the Safeway and used the buses to get to the University area, downtown, Fremont and the Seattle center. It would be helpful to have the app for the buses on a phone as they don't follow the posted timetable and once we waited 40 minutes (a Sunday).
We loved the chickens and enjoyed the eggs Margot left us. Also the flowers."
77002	442487	9.0	10.0	40563444	We really enjoyed our stay at Margot and Anthony's apartment.  We had no problems accessing the key and when we arrived there were fresh flowers, some granola bars, and a fresh egg from the chickens out back.  We had everything we needed including kitchen utensils, toiletries and a hair dryer.  The location is in a quiet residential area, but it was easy to access everywhere we wanted to go via the buses and even walking.  We would definitely recommend Margot and Anthony's place!
77003	442487	9.0	10.0	41581399	Awesome place in a great part of town. Getting to and from Downtown was really easy and the convenient location is near a lot of great restaurants and grocery stores.

77004	442487	9.0	10.0	42113083	Margot and Anthony's studio was absolutely perfect for our stay.  We immediately felt at home.  The neighborhood was great.  It made us feel like locals.  It was very easy to get to, and it was convenient to travel to all of the local attractions.  We had everything and more that we needed for our stay (absolutely loved the coffee).  We really enjoyed the visits from the chickens every morning!  They were great about contacting us with updates about our stay.
77005	442487	9.0	10.0	43473712	This airbnb was perfect for our needs; in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  The location couldn't have been better.  Though we didn't need to use public transportation, it was very convenient.  Margot was very accommodating and though our schedules didn't enable us to meet, she was accessible and helpful.  There is a full kitchen with all necessary accoutrements for those wanting to take advantage of this.  The walk-in shower was great as were the shower accessories.  The fan was a welcome addition on the warm nights.  The fresh eggs, laid by their chickens, were a nice touch.
77006	442487	9.0	10.0	43963060	The studio was cozy, clean, and conveniently located near bars, cafes, markets, as well as public transportation.

I would recommend the studio to anyone staying in Seattle.
Due to conflicting timings we did not meet our host, however all interactions were timely and very helpful. "
77009	442487	9.0	10.0	46616467	The studio was great--clean, comfortable and had all the essentials, and was in a lovely neighborhood with a short walk to fun, eclectic Capitol Hill. The hosts checked in on us via texts a couple times and were always willing to provide anything we needed, yet were unobtrusive so we really had the place to ourselves.  
77010	442487	9.0	10.0	47035776	"Margot was extremely nice and helpful and able to quickly resolve any issue at all. 
Great quiet neighborhood & close by to all sorts of shopping and food needs. 
A very nice stay. "
77011	442487	9.0	10.0	47459875	"The listing was exactly as listed. We had minimal contact with the hosts, which was fine for us. She did send a message to check in the second day to make sure everything was ok, which I appreciated it. Everything was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was very pretty but very residential, not necessarily a lot of super close, walkable businesses nearby. We were charmed by the chickens. 

My only complaint- not a lot of privacy. Many of the windows did not have window treatments at all, so not only did the sun come in, but you could see directly in to the main space, including the bed area. It's a garden level apartment so anyone walking by at ground level can look right in. The only way to have total privacy is to go in to the bathroom and shut the door. The bed was completely visible by multiple windows. We also got a parking ticket on the street for parking within 10 feet of a driveway, which we had no way of knowing was a law. Kind of a bummer."
77012	442487	9.0	10.0	48380127	We had a phenomenal stay in Seattle. The apartment was clean and cozy and all the necessities were provided. Upon arriving, we were greeted with a hand written note from Margot and fresh eggs from their chickens. The location was perfect; in a quite neighborhood only steps from local eateries and buses that could whisk us off to every corner of the city. Margot was a great host, making sure we had everything we needed and providing lots of suggestions for quirky and unique Seattle sites. They love their city and it is infectious.

The studio is walking distance from tasty eateries and the shopping venues. We found the place to be clean and spacious and the WiFi works well.

We loved having a full kitchen with ample dishes and cookware, and it was wonderful to be in a place that welcomed our little pup. The neighborhood is quiet, residential and very pretty, though it is about a 20- to 25-minute hike to the Pike/Pine center of Capitol Hill. Overall a great experience.

The location was great for touring the city and it was the perfect size for my me, my husband and our three year old daughter. Very comfy and we'll equipped:) We especially enjoyed the chickens;) Highly recommended!!!

Many restaurants and even a nice pub just one block away. The place is cozy and has everything you may need on your stay. Great access to public transit, although the Seattle transit system could be better. Ended up taking lyft and uber everywhere. They were able to pick us up within 3-4 minutes every time as this is a very central location to everything. If you clean up after yourself you can save yourself a cleaning fee which is fantastic. We had all appliances available to us, although we did not use any as we visited Seattle to try out their great food and coffee! Overall I cannot recommend this place enough.
