15225	1549973	8.0	7.0	7026986	The apartment was clean, basic and sufficient.  Furniture is definitely cheap ikea stuff, except possibly the couch.  The queen bed seemed small for a queen bed, I think it was actually a double sized bed, since it was easy to make my feet go over the edge.  Pillows were similarly small and the sheets & blankets were similarly cheap. 
15226	1549973	8.0	7.0	15920668	A very helpful and nice host. The listing was everything it said it would be, and very close to the UW campus. Overall would recommend to anyone as a cheap alternative to a hotel.
15227	1549973	8.0	7.0	17891106	I live in Seattle, and rented this unit when I had friends in town. I'm familiar with the neighborhood so new what to expect. Everything was great and was exactly what we needed, mostly just a place to sleep, and spent our days enjoying the city.  The place was comfortable and clean, and there is a small selection of dishes, thought we ate out mostly. If you're planning on spending a lot of time cooking, I recommend bringing some cooking supplies, (and bottle opener/wine opener). Though everything served our purposes just fine. Melissa was very nice and I certainly have no complaints!
15228	1549973	8.0	7.0	18278830	We had no problems with our stay, check in was easy and smooth.  The apartment is very modest with limited amenities, but worked for us.
15229	1549973	8.0	7.0	18549317	"Upsides:
(i) great location (2 or 3 blocks away from UW. Approximately 5-min walk to University Way and 8-min walk to UW campus)
(ii) spacious (this is a big one-bed room with an over-sized living room)
(iii) blazing fast internet (I used it for a video-conference on WebEx and watching on-line streaming videos all the time) 
Downsides:
(i) loud noise (this is not a quiet building as advertised. Instead, the living room faces a main street where heavy traffic coming in from high way all day. Even worse, this unit is located less than 10 feet from the back of a hotel and the bedroom faces the laundry room and trash dumpsters of the hotel. As a result, the laundry machines send loud noise to the bedroom throughout day and night, and the garbage truck comes in around 7am every other day)  
(ii) parking fees (the host charges $8 for parking)
(iii) old complex (the wall is paper thin so you can hear someone talking or watching tv upstairs and next door)
The host seems to control many apartments in that neighborhood so you have many options. Avoid this property unless you can fall asleep no matter what.    
"
15230	1549973	8.0	7.0	18823835	"The good: Melissa is a wonderful person and was incredibly kind to us. We foolishly locked ourselves out the first day and Melissa was kind enough to let us back in without taking a ton of time. Also she brought us extra towels and made sure the place was set up for us. Really, I can't praise Melissa enough for being so nice.

Also the apartment was exceptionally clean, like just had cleaners do a deep clean type clean.

Also it's relatively inexpensive, close to bus lines into downtown and near some decent college restaurants. 

The less good: The pictures are not representative of this space. It really is a bare-bones College style apartment. Old building. Dingy common space. The bedroom was also really noisy from the nearby laundry room and back alley used by trucks. This was all fine with us because we were just sleeping there and the price is/was right."
15231	1549973	8.0	7.0	22559257	I arrived early and was able to leave my luggage in a different room, which I appreciated. Somewhat less nice was the difference between the space I ended up getting and the original I had rented. Ms Yao had unfortunately scheduled some renovations for the day of my arrival and I ended up with a different apartment which was less well furnished than the one advertised. However she was very accommodating and I was perfectly content with the apartment I ended up getting.
15317	6250399	6.0	4.0	44034411	The apartment itself was totally fine - about what we expected, based on the photos and description. The space was a great size for 2 people and it was nice to have the kitchenette as an option while visiting Seattle. Melissa was a very easy host to work with - she allowed us to check in early and was very responsive when we had questions throughout our stay. The one major issue with the apartment that we were not expecting was just outside - when we walked in on the first day, we peeked out the kitchen window into an alley (fine) that was apparently a hot spot for drug use (not fine). Throughout our entire stay, every time we looked out the window people were in the alley partaking in some very hardcore using. It was very unsettling to know that was so close to us and while no one ever bothered us in the neighborhood, it was a major concern. Again, the apartment itself was great and exactly what we were looking for, but my fiance and I agreed the alley view was something that needed to be mentioned.
15496	7071021	8.0	7.0	37719965	"The host was very welcoming and efficient. I got stuck in the city without a hotel room and she connected me quickly after I sent her the request for the room and even help me with getting my luggage to the room. I felt that she was responsive and attended my needs in a gentle, and pleasant manner. 
The apartment itself was nice, as seen in the picture,  and clean. Towels, soap and shampoo were provided. Kitchen was pretty big and seemed nice, however, I didn't get to use it. There was no AC, which is often a non-issue in Seattle, but that specific week was really hot. There is a very nice, big, standing fan. 
The apartment is at the back of the building, so the view isn't nice. The price was reasonable to Seattle. One additional thing that I didn't like is that it was not easy to open the building front door. One of the neighbors tried to teach me how, and we spend good 5 minutes trying to do so. I heard this should be fixed soon. 
Also, since the apartment it is located within the University district, I would recommend checking that the back gate is operating. "
15497	7071021	8.0	7.0	39809674	"L'host è stata in generale cortese. Il mio check in è avvenuto abbastanza tardi e, pur dopo qualche perplessità e un po' di attesa, è venuto ad aprirmi un ragazzo. Quindi non ho incontrato l'host al mio arrivo e non ho avuto alcuna descrizione delle peculiarità dell'appartamento. C'è stato qualche intoppo iniziale (tipo una doccia che funzionava male), ma l'host è sempre intervenuta in modo celere.  L'alloggio è in una grande posizione per chi deve raggiungere l'università, e la zona intorno è tranquilla, anche se non è da ""canone italiano"", nel senso che ci sono vari barboni fra le stradine dietro il palazzo e le strade adiacenti, ma, purtroppo, è una cosa molto comune lì; infatti, dalla finestre dell'appartamento, da cui si ha solo uno scorcio sul retro del palazzo pieno di bidoni dell'immondizia, ogni tanto si può vedere qualche povero senza-tetto che cerca rifugio la notte. Il vero neo dell'appartamento è il palazzo in cui è inserito, piuttosto vetusto e non proprio pulito. Non amo molto gli ""odori"", e forse per questo non mi sono trovato al meglio. Quando si arriva, non si ha una grande sensazione di ""sicurezza"", ma forse è solo un'impressione. In generale, è un posto ottimo per la posizione, molto vicino a fermate del bus e a negozi, ma l'appartamento è un po' vecchiotto, e la struttura in cui inserita non è certo bella o confortevole. "
15498	7071021	8.0	7.0	40511529	"This was a superb location one block from University Ave. The unit was clean and exactly as described. The building was extremely quiet given the location. The only downside was the restricted hours to use the garbage dumps, and that was mostly my issue as I was working late and easily remedied by using a garbage can on the street less than 200 ft away. 

All in all a nice little spot in a great location."
15499	7071021	8.0	7.0	40965672	"We were in town to find an apartment my daughter who is attending grad school in the fall.  The location is perfect if you're visiting UW.  Also very convenient for food, shops and transportation.  Photos accurately represent unit and it is quiet (other than the occasional parking lot disturbance, see below).  Building had a lot of work going on while we were there (painting, sanding on stairwell) but it didn't interfere with our plans.  Unit was reasonably clean but very spartan.  Things one would take for granted in a furnished space (clothes hangers, trash cans, pots and pans, can opener) were missing.  We didn't use the TV so can't comment on that but WiFi worked as described.  Bed was comfortable enough and shower had good pressure.

You should be aware, however, that this unit faces a kind of sketchy parking lot.  We heard vomiting every night and had to call 911 when we realized someone had OD'ed right outside our window.  

We never met the host, Melissa.  Keys were waiting for us and we left them when checked out.  Melissa wasn't super responsive to our text inquiries but we were looking for a room, not a tour guide so that was okay with us.

Overall, for the price, this place is a good option if you need nothing more than a safe, inexpensive place to sleep in the University District of Seattle."
15500	7071021	8.0	7.0	45091160	Great location for UW visitors. The unit was clean with all features as described in the post. Note that  the unit is at the back of the building, and view isn't very good. But overall concerning price to quality ratio I think it is very good. 
15515	3706719	9.0	7.0	17646574	.
15516	3706719	9.0	7.0	18155542	Accurate Listing, clean studio. Convenient location, close to shops and the UW.
15517	3706719	9.0	7.0	18595746	Accurate listing and cute studio! Great location. Melissa is extremely easy to work with. 
15518	3706719	9.0	7.0	18908808	A great neighborhood to stay in while in Seattle! 
15519	3706719	9.0	7.0	40094195	"The studio was very clean and just like the pictures. The bed is extremely comfortable. Be aware that it can get very hot in the summer as it has south-west exposure and the sun sets around 10 pm. I spent most evenings in a local cafe to stay cool during this year's 2+ week heatwave. This building in general was very hot during this time. There is a fan that helps just a little. 
Melissa was responsive although with a delay at times due to the busy summer season. She was very accomodating and helpful. "
15520	3706719	9.0	7.0	45041773	I really liked this apartment, very clean and comfortable with all the amenities and a great location (I'd recommend the portage cafe a few blocks away).  I appreciate Melissa being able to accommodate me on such short notice (ie I was sending my booking request just three or four hours before arriving).
21957	5792683	10.0	7.0	38526111	I stayed here for a few weeks prior to a relocation, and I had a great stay.  The place is the lower floor of a very modern, new house so everything looks good and is in great order. It was really nice to have such a large space, and my own bath room, storage closet, and washer+dryer for doing my laundry. Highly recommended!
21958	5792683	10.0	7.0	39209501	This was a nice modern studio in a converted basement of the owners home. The owner provides snacks and toiletries that were much appreciated. Comes with mini fridge, microwave and portable burners. The location was nice by a park and centrally located. The owner responded promptly to our messages and checked in to make sure we needed anything often. I would stay here again and recommend it to others. My wife and I used it as a crash pad as we were out 14 hrs a day during our trip. 
21959	5792683	10.0	7.0	44106876	I had a fabulous time here last time I was in Seattle. Hila and her husband were very helpful and welcoming. The apartment was very cozy with s nice big bed and has a separate entrance to the apartment. To get to the space needle area of Seattle it's either a 10min uber or an hour walk which really wasn't bad because the weather is so mild in Seattle in the summer. There's also a nice park nearby with a playground and plenty of space to jog or bike around. All in all it was a great stay and I would totally stay here again. :) 
21960	5792683	10.0	7.0	45788658	She was a great host! Checked in with me to make sure everything was in order and I was accomodated.
23813	5353512	7.0	7.0	55092224	Anna and her place were great! I booked this for my two good friends who had multiple flight delays, and she was awesome about being flexible to meet up with us. Place was nice and clean and very welcoming. 
23814	5353512	7.0	7.0	56358455	"Nicest things I can say:

1.Anna is a nice girl and friendly.
2.She was prompt to answer all emails and texts in the booking process.
3.The room and home basically looked like the photos.
4.Anna gave us a key so we could come and go
5.When Anna was unable to fulfill the first night, she responsibly took care of the refund from AirBNB.


Room for improvement: 
1.Anna is still new to the AirBNB hosting process and is in a learning curve as to having a system of how clean a rented room and bathroom should be. She’s not up to hotel standards yet.
2.Although the room “looked” as advertised, it was actually a tiny space carefully photographed to look the size of a normal bedroom.
3.The neighborhood: She’s directly across the street from a fenced elementary school playground which made navigating nearly impossible when school let out. Street parking could be unpredictable but we found a spot. 
4.Most of all, she should put on her description that she is in one small apartment in a four-plex and has no control of talking, banging and music from the upstairs neighbors at any hour of the night, directly above your bed.
"
23815	5353512	7.0	7.0	56468156	"I was waiting until the last minute to book a room, and Anna accepted my room request at 10:59 PM. Within  30 minutes she had tidy room, clean towels, and options for breakfast. The next day she suggested several places I should go see in the city and even offered to let me leave my bags there and go explore. I would highly recommend staying with Anna!

Her dog and cat were also very friendly!"
23816	5353512	7.0	7.0	56822225	Anna made us feel welcome! Her place is in a perfect spot for the buses that go around Seattle. Her dog and cat are very friendly, and the room is cozy! Her pastries are delicious btw :)
24058	8083242	5.0	7.0	46984179	This is my first time using Airbnb. i am a mother sending son to college  that is located 20-30mins by bus/driving to the college. but we still stayed in the property for a week hoping it won't quite be a problem as we wanted to enjoy the downtown seattle before moving to closer neighbourhood. The neighbourhood of Bryan's is not quite close to the downtown itself. it's  approx 10 blocks from the clubs, cafes and downtown area. But Bryan has been very helpful to us that we could directly spot some great restaurants in downtown. Overall Amazing stay but I just didn't expect that a cat lives in the house and i am very allergic to the lovely creature. Bryan also moved in when we expected that it's entire apartment with one empty second bedroom so we would have a little bit privacy. i tried to be tolerable with the cat although Bryan moved her to his girlfriend's house but because i am also a housemother so i can't tolerate furry and dust left behind by the cat. Last few days of our stays i feel a bit hard to breathe. Overall we had great First experience because we can cook just like at home
24059	8083242	5.0	7.0	47823143	This was my first time using Airbnb and I have to say, Bryan made it a great and worry free experience. Though we hardly interacted due to my schedule, he gave me the privacy I needed and made me feel welcome to used his apartment. The location was safe and minutes away from South Lake Union. 
24060	8083242	5.0	7.0	48922560	"Bryan was very nice eh en we arrived! Je give as advice an toked as to the gas station that was near by.
The apartment was big but dirty. He left ine of the two bedroom in total disorder, even with two empty bottles of beer and clothes!
Under the bed and the sofá it was full of dirt!
The apartment is walking distance to downtown."
24503	6959336	7.0	7.0	37512474	Check in was extremely easy and Nikki's home was very comfortable.  It was a little warm around mid day but cooled off nicely at night.  Temperatures were unusually high for Seattle so I don't think it would be a problem.  It was about 20 mins from the city.  Discovery Park was a great place to take walks in.  Thanks Nikki!
24504	6959336	7.0	7.0	38314432	Altough we didn't meet Nikki, she was very efficient and nice to us. Her house is very comfy and the local is VERY good!!! The park in front is a great for whom want to stay in the city and feel like in country side. Recommended.
24505	6959336	7.0	7.0	39051585	Nikki has a great little house about 12 minutes from downtown Seattle. Beds in both bedrooms were comfortable and the shower has excellent pressure and water coverage - a definite plus for me.  We stayed on a very hot weekend and the home is not air conditioned, so we toasted a bit, but Nikki has fans in every room and we were all so tired after all our activities every day, nobody seemed to have too much trouble sleeping. There is a very large park directly across the street, which we didn't explore much, but provides an absolutely sensational view at sunset. We also discovered Chinooks, a ridiculously good seafood restaurant on the water only a mile and a half away from the house.  Finally, Nikki was kind enough to let my son play one f her guitars when we were there, which we couldn't get at any hotel. We paid less than half what we would have staying downtown, got the space of a Presidential Suite, peaceful, quiet nights and easy access to everywhere.  Tip: we tried Uber for the first time. They pick you up in minutes, get you where you need to be and cost a third of the price of parking downtown for a couple hours.
24964	9183838	4.0	6.0	55880754	"Unfortunately my experience with the Belltown apartment in Seattle is very very disappointing :(  I hate to complain or write negative reviews, however I have to do it.
The first, this apartment we booked for 3 guests. There is a king size bed for 2 people and for a third person  a very small, tiny and narrow sofa, that is good enough to have a short nap!!!!  When I called to a property management and told that... The answer was : we can deliver a air bed for 50$ delivery fee ?!?!? Why ?!? We paid for a night 319$ US. 
The second one, there is NO internet ! We again, called to the property managemnet and asked if there is a wireless or wired Internet ! The man on the phone said,he would call to the owner and asked for a WIFI password and log in. Never called  us back :( 
The third, it was very cold in the appartment ! There is no an instruction or a guest info book or so... 
We at our own risk, opened the hitter's vents and eventually it was little bit warmer! 
One more thing... The building is very old so it is very smelly :( .. 
The next one, we also paid a cleaning fee 84$. But all hitters are dusty.
The last,  but also very stressful... The address of the building  is 304 Bell street , and there should be a lock with an apartment's key, but the lock was attached to the 308 Bell street building's door :( who knew it ?!? :( 
to figure out all these issues I had to call to the property management several times by using my cell with roaming rate and now I can imagine my Fido bill !   stay away from this place ! I am  a Airbnb member since 2011, I am not picky at all,  but this time it was to much :( "
31175	7965184	7.0	7.0	52654864	Great location!  charming place!  Thanks a lot!
31176	7965184	7.0	7.0	53316024	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
31177	7965184	7.0	7.0	53388298	"The host was MIA and I was left without a place to stay at 5:30 pm on the night I was trying to check in. Not sure what happened but I would definitely not recommend booking this location. Buyer beware. 
"
31178	7965184	7.0	7.0	54285138	This was a great place and in a great location. It was easy to walk to Pike Place Market, around downtown for shopping, and to belltown for dinner and night life. The furniture was new and the place was very clean. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again. The only advise for the next travelers, is to bring all of your toiletries as there is only hand soap in the bathroom.  Just something to think about since you are not staying in a hotel. 
31179	7965184	7.0	7.0	57988160	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
41108	6701018	9.0	7.0	35027434	This was a great apartment for my family. After staying in hotels, a relaxing place with a separate bedroom was exactly what we needed. It was located close to a nice park and the zoo, as well as the Phinny ave. farmers market on Friday which was great. And it was a quick drive down Aurora to get to the city center. Sonny was very accommodating with all of our needs. I'd definitely stay here again or recommend it to a friend. 
41109	6701018	9.0	7.0	36460673	Sonny was very welcoming and ensured he walked me through the entire apartment prior to leaving it in my hands.  
41110	6701018	9.0	7.0	36840248	Sonny was an awesome host! Very friendly and easy to communicate with. The place was perfect for a few days stay and is close enough to downtown and all the things you would need. I would definitely recommend Staying here. 
41111	6701018	9.0	7.0	37781729	Sonny communicated with us often prior to our arrival and he was very easy to contact and responsive to our needs. The apartment was comfortable and clean, well-stocked with cooking equipment, and we had access to laundry facilities. The location was very close to public transportation, including the express bus to downtown, which took about half an hour to get to Pike Place or the Space Needle. The neighborhood itself, Shoreline, was somewhat remote from good coffee, shopping, and restaurants. There is a great Asian market and a movie theater across the street, as well as a Starbucks and IHOP. The number 40 bus took us to Ballard, and the number 5 took us to Phinney Ridge, which are both great neighborhoods to visit. Sonny is a great host, and the apartment is a great deal for travelers who don't mind figuring out how to get around a city. 
41112	6701018	9.0	7.0	38183842	Sonny was very friendly and very helpful. The place was clean and spacious. We will stay there again.
41113	6701018	9.0	7.0	38913912	The apartment was very clean and well-stocked (even bananas!). Sonny was very accommodating. This location was perfect for our purposes; close to the events we were attending. 
41114	6701018	9.0	7.0	39233195	Sonny was an excellent host-- very responsive and helpful. The apt was great. It has a fully stocked kitchen and is very private and quiet. Great place close to Green Lake and Fremont.
41115	6701018	9.0	7.0	39453855	Sonny was a friendly and accommodating host. He lives on site which is always good and he gave us some recommendations on where to visit in the area. The property neighborhood leaves something to be desired, but the inside of the apt offered a comfortable recess. It's got good size for a 1 bedroom and is colorfully decorated. The kitchen looks out to the family area which is nice, and it made for a comfortable 2-night stay for us. All in all it was pleasant and suitable for our stay.
41116	6701018	9.0	7.0	41791248	"Sonny made me feel very welcome and I always felt comfortable asking him any questions or concerns with the apartment or area. The description he wrote for the place was spot on! The neighborhood made you feel like you were a Seattle local and helped forget that you were in a new city. 

I would highly recommend anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle to consider Sonny's apartment! I was very impressed with the sense of space in the rooms as well as how comfortable it was to sleep on the couch and blowup mattress. This is a great place for a great price that I would definitely use again if given the chance."
41117	6701018	9.0	7.0	42178294	"Sonny was very good at proactively communicating what needed to happen to get into the apartment. There was a little snafu that the previous guest didn't check out until almost 1 PM, which delayed my check in. However, even with that problem Sonny was all over it, and my husband and I got in by 5 PM. 

Do be warned that there isn't any Air Conditioning in the unit. This was fine for the most part, but it was rather warm while we were visiting. There were no ceiling fans and only 2 smaller stand fans. 

The apartment is conveniently located next to a bus stop that has the ""E"" express line downtown. It only took about 20 minutes to get to Pike Place Market. Additionally, it's only a $6 uber to get to downtown Greenwood with tons of restaurants and bars. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this rental. It' the right price and conveniently located to many of Seattle's perks. "
41118	6701018	9.0	7.0	42445925	Sonny was friendly from the beginning and very helpful with everything! Good communication and very nice! The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was a little bit dodgy for our taste, but it is definitely convenient to everywhere in Seattle. Sonny is a great host, thanks so much!
41119	6701018	9.0	7.0	43640034	We arrived late in the evening and our host was there to greet us with keys and a quick tour of the unit.  Apartment is a basement (referred to as a ground level) unit in an older apartment building.  Hallway outside the unit smelled very musty and had old appliances sitting in the hall (refrigerator & dishwasher). Interior was clean.  The neighborhood is not safe to walk around during the day or evening.   There is a strip club located at the end of the street.  Four prostitutes were seen within three blocks of the apartment building during the day.  We had booked for seven nights but only stayed for two.  
41120	6701018	9.0	7.0	44183115	"Sonny's apartment was super clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Even though our flight was 3 hours late, he couldn't have been nicer about staying up so he could show us in. The bus to downtown Seattle was just around the corner and we loved the shops and restaurants less than a mile away in the shopping district of Greenwood. We also enjoyed a short walk to a local park on a river for a morning trail run.

The apartment building is very close to a busy road, but when the windows are closed, it blocks out the noise entirely."
41121	6701018	9.0	7.0	44429859	Sonny was an excellent host with outstanding communication.  We really enjoyed the apt, found it quiet and cozy after all day traveling/touring the city.  Can't comment on the neighborhood much since we spent all of our time downtown but it was super easy to get down to the city center from the apt.  
41122	6701018	9.0	7.0	45472061	"Sonny was a most excellent host for our stay in Seattle. The apartment was just what we needed. I was there with my 2 year old grandson, my daughter and her husband. We all agreed that we were happy we chose Sonny's place! At first we thought it might be ""a little too far out,"" but we were able to catch a bus, call an Uber, and even had a place to park our rental car for a couple of the days. Sonny was always available for any needs we had (with a 2 year old, we went through trash bags pretty quickly!).  Everything you need is in the apartment to cook…plus, there are plenty of places within walking distance to pick up food and bring back. With the exception of being near a fire station and the alarms that would go off, the place is very quiet and feels very secure and safe. I highly recommend Sonny's place…we would definitely stay there again on our next trip to Seattle!"
41123	6701018	9.0	7.0	45834095	Sonny was a great host that was very attentive. The apartment was fantastic and had everything you needed. The apartment is a $20 dollar uber from downtown, and is located around the corner from the express bus stop. 
41124	6701018	9.0	7.0	46559810	Though the location leaves a lot to be desired, the apartment is every bit as described and more. All of the trimmings are... economical, but every little thing that a roving nomad could want in an apartment is there. Soap, shampoo, clean towels, spices, oil, pots, pans, knives, and even a Chromecast(it wasn't working, but it's a great thought!). I think it might be the most comprehensively supplied place that I've rented in my travels around Seattle.
41125	6701018	9.0	7.0	47822890	First of all Sonny is very friendly and handy man. The location is also very strategic, and the room is well equip. By the look of the room, I know he is modest. 
41126	6701018	9.0	7.0	52961825	The neighborhood is definitely not a safe environment for families.  We saw homeless and drug abuse almost every day. We now live in another area of Seattle and we can say with knowledge Seattle is a friendly and safe city, just not around this property. We actually left the place 3 weeks before expected.  I don't think there's anything Family or Pets friendly about this place, sorry!
41127	6701018	9.0	7.0	54463049	Sonny made us feel right at home the apartment was clean and cozy. Sonny was always available if we needed him, the apartment had everything. What I liked the most was that we were able to buy groceries and cook that was a big plus because we didn't have to go out a spend money on fast food everyday. 
41128	6701018	9.0	7.0	56192858	Due to a situation beyond his control, Sonny was unable to meet me however he made sure someone was able to check me in and give me an intro to the unit. The unit is spacious and well-equipped, clean and comfortable. Sonny was in contact during my stay and made sure I had everything I needed. Thanks Sonny!
41216	6215199	9.0	7.0	35384533	Ben and his family have a wonderful home in Seattle. It was perfect for our family vacation to celebrate our daughter's graduation from UW. We hosted two family dinners and the house was great for entertaining. Our grandson was delighted with the toys, books, and of course , the trampoline. We visit Seattle every year and the Katt family home is a delightful, comfortable, and convenient place to stay. Ben was always available to answer any of our questions. Definitely hoping to return.
41217	6215199	9.0	7.0	36401524	"Ben was a great host and even though he wasn't around physically, he was always available by text and even had a local friend contact us to see if we needed anything.

The listing was very accurate and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The place was very clean and had great amenities such as a piano and large tv =D I would definitely stay again! "
41218	6215199	9.0	7.0	37079909	Ben and house were awesome! Perfect size for our family of 6. Ben even helped accommodate with a pack n play for our baby. He was super responsive to questions and had a very comprehensive manual to make sure we were prepared. The house was bright, clean, updated and perfect for a family. Would absolutely do business with Ben again.
41219	6215199	9.0	7.0	41590945	The neighborhood is not nice and we can't recommend it. We didn't keep any windows open at night because there was a lot of nighttime activities on the street.  The house furnishings are passable.  The host was out of country but was responsive when the internet wasn't working. 
41220	6215199	9.0	7.0	42681317	We had a great time at the house! It had everything we needed for fun. The location was great, the backyard and grill were fun for a relaxing evening. Our little one even found a few toys to play with. I highly recommend this place!
41221	6215199	9.0	7.0	43965813	The house was clean and comfortable, and the House Manual was very helpful in helping us become acquainted with the house! All appliances worked well, and the beds were comfy. Ben contacted me directly about a wifi issue, which was nice. We loved staying here for the weekend! My friends and I felt instantly at home here and I'd definitely recommend Ben and his home to others!
41222	6215199	9.0	7.0	45956766	"This house was wonderful for my friends and me (a group of 6), and Ben couldn't have been any kinder! We all slept well; the neighborhood was silent, and the beds were very comfortable. 

I would book here again if I were to come back to Seattle!"
42364	23356	9.0	7.0	233344	It is a very nice house.  Very roomy.  It was clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood was a little scary.
42365	23356	9.0	7.0	7032800	Exactly as expected. The house was nice, and the neighborhood wasn't bad either. Probably one of the less seedy neighborhoods I saw while in Seattle.
42366	23356	9.0	7.0	15771710	"Tony has a place that can accommodate plenty of people and it is relatively close (15 minute walk) to the light rail either at the Columbia Station or Othello Station.  I always felt like he was available for any questions if I had them.  Super nice guy!

There is a great view of Mt. Rainier on a clear day.  The sunsets were beautiful.  It has everything you need to cook your own meals.  The two bathrooms were nice with the amount of people we had staying there.  The place was kept tidy, the sheets for all the beds were clean.  There were plenty of towels stocked in the closets.  

The neighborhood feels relatively safe.  We never had any problems.  I can see why some people may not feel comfortable...it's not suburbia, but sometimes you have to sacrifice that when in the city for convenience and closeness to all the activities you want to do.  It is on a main road but the noise is minimal because it sits up on a hill and has a wall of concrete steps that leads down to the road.

Overall it is a great place to stay if you and a bunch of friends want to get a taste of Seattle and don't want to have to rent a car to get around.  I'd definitely stay here again!  Thanks Tony!"
42367	23356	9.0	7.0	28828602	Great location. Safe neighborhood. Definitely a little bit on the lower income and not as gentrified as closer in, thank goodness! Love having the full amenities of the house. I would recommend Tony's listing to anyone with a small or large group. Very close to Safeway and my favorite Baskin-Robbins.
42368	23356	9.0	7.0	33260158	Great stay at Tony's place, this is the first time that I have rented a house to stay and I think it is the best deal that you can get. I didn't get to meet the host personally and now and I would have loved to so that I can thank him personally. The house was super roomy everything was clean and ready for us to use.  Centrally located, we could have use public transportation or drive definitely I would book myself again on my next trip to Seattle since I am so satisfied with the experience thank you Tony very much for making it so easy for us to stay at your place in Seattle
42369	23356	9.0	7.0	35656392	Meille oli annettu perustiedot sisäänpääsemisestä, mutta sen yksityiskohtaisempia ohjeita talon sisäpuolella ei ollut. Ainoa info koski jätteiden lajittelua. Naapurusto oli aika karu ja hoitamaton. Talo oli osittain viimeistelemätön, mutta toimiva. Lähikadun liikenne ei häirinnyt merkittävästi. Majoittujamäärään (6) nähden huoneita ja kylpytiloja oli riittävästi. Liikkuminen edellyttää pääsääntöisesti omaa autoa. Saimme puutteellista tietoa julkisesta liikenteestä läheisestä kaupasta, mutta oma-aloitteisuutemme pelasti meidät.
42960	613151	7.0	7.0	2032379	I rented the lowered floor apartment,  the day before arrival Keith told me I got the upper level apartment. It was much older, smellier, hotter, dirtier than the space below. I was very disappointed with the outcome. Although The owner was very nice and welcoming, he was always coming in and out of the place, which took away a lot of our privacy, especially late at night.  I would just recommend renting the lower apartment, unless you like dirty old grundgy rentals!
42961	613151	7.0	7.0	5697704	The place was exactly what we needed.  Plenty of places for us all to stay.  Getting in was very easy and the price was great.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  
42962	613151	7.0	7.0	6755667	Quite far from center but it's ok.
42963	613151	7.0	7.0	9075958	We enjoyed the wonderful house for three days. Thanks a lot to Prez & Cherie. We are so happy and will recommend this house to our friends. 
46132	1263470	8.0	7.0	42825542	"My boyfriend and I had the opportunity to stay at Jessica's place for three months. It was a perfect home away from home as were new to the region. She is friendly, accessible and it's easy to sense that Jessica really values bringing people together as a community. 

The apartment itself was newly renovated, spacious and comfortable. I couldn't get in enough time cooking in the awesome kitchen! The garden is beautiful and it was great to have the opportunity to get my hands dirty and participate in maintaining the space.

South Seattle is a special place and Jessica can point you in the right direction of places to eat, connect with others, exercise and adventure. 

Thanks for a great stay and we might be back!"
46133	1263470	8.0	7.0	43546124	Jessica was a sweetheart and a great host. She brought us eggs from her chickens and left us a bottle of wine which was very kind. The listing said there was a washer and dryer in the apartment (which there wasnt) and there was no TV which wasn't too big of a deal, but I would have brought a larger laptop had I been aware of that. 
46134	1263470	8.0	7.0	44442964	"Jessica's basement apartment is actually more like the ground floor in that the floor is level with the back yard.

It was comfortable, well furnished, roomy and clean. There was quite a bit of useful breakfast food in the fridge and the fresh, morning eggs from her chickens were an especially nice touch. 

The kitchen is well outfitted with dishes, pots and pans and utensils, excellent for cooking meals in. The bed was very comfortable; the newly redone bathroom was just fine.

Jessica was attentive and her hospitality extended to her deck and back yard next door, including the choice of fresh fruits and vegetables from her garden.

The wi-fi connection worked well and we didn't care, but some people may miss a TV set."
46135	1263470	8.0	7.0	45378312	We had a fantastic stay at Jessica's apartment while in Seattle for a convention. She made us feel very welcome, and ensured we had all that we needed. The photos represent the space well. It is a spacious, well-lit apartment, only 10-12 minutes walk from the light rail. The property itself is quite nice, if you are at all interested in urban homesteading, this is the place to visit! I was happy to help with the chickens when I could. Would gladly stay again.
46136	1263470	8.0	7.0	49206151	"I have used Airbnb many times prior and have had decent experiences but this will be the first exception.

I did not sleep well during my stay here. I was either woken up by chickens, the creaky floorboards from the upstairs unit, or the strong daylight that seeps in due to the translucent curtains. Even the washer and dryer would wake me up, the machine was very loud and it's right next to the bedroom. The laundry is shared with the unit upstairs. 

The heating doesn't work at the moment and is in the process of being fixed. 

There was a vast amount of spiders in the unit. Since this is a basement, there are crevices in which they can come in from. The spiders are mostly found in the kitchen and bedroom (shelf area) with the occasional appearances in the bathroom. There are also plenty by the door since there is a garden growing outside. Bug spray is highly recommended.

Wifi is very weak and doesn't work in the bedroom, as the router is located in the host's house next door. The host mentioned that she had purchased a repeater to fix it for future guests though. There's also barely any cellular service as well - I had only 1 bar. Stay in the kitchen if you need cellular or data service. I use T-Mobile, so your mileage may vary with different carriers.

The toilet is very weak and gets clogged almost daily. There is a plunger under the sink so get used to that being your new right hand. 

There is no privacy in the bedroom due to the aforementioned curtains. DO NOT change while you're in there because you can be seen from outside the window, especially at night with the lights on. 

Walls are very thin, so don't be surprised to hear the conversations of people living upstairs or the sound of their smartphone vibrating. The floorboards at the upstairs unit seem to be very creaky as I always heard it in the bedroom and kitchen.

The location of the house is in Rainier Valley, specifically the Dunlap neighborhood. It is a 0.6 mile walk to the Othello light rail station, or 0.7 mile walk to Rainier Beach station. The area nearby is a bit rundown and shady. I would recommend driving instead. The light rail is about a 30 minute ride to Westlake station, so it takes about 45 minutes to get there when you include walking. The vicinity is also poorly lit at night so I suggest getting home before dusk if you are traveling by foot.

Participating in housework is expected because it's a solo run urban farm, and there are chickens and a huge garden to attend to. The host calls, texts and touches base nearly everyday to discuss the delegation of chores. I understand that this might appeal to certain people, but if you are the type that values privacy and personal space, I do not recommend staying here at all. "
46137	1263470	8.0	7.0	55567496	We really enjoyed having such a big backyard for our toddler to explore. He really enjoyed greeting the chickens in the morning. They were not very loud as we had read in another post. Othello park isn't far which was nice, and the light rail is so convenient. We went to the tree lighting ceremony and walked home from the train. The neighborhood is very quiet. Boeing has a landing strip near by and our little guy loved seeing all the different planes in the sky. Depending who lives upstairs it can be a little loud but we had a sound machine for sleeping and it helped for the most part. It is so easy to get to west Seattle and downtown. I felt like it is a very convenient location. Columbia city was not a far drive and it had some cool shops and restaurants. We would for sure stay here again if we had the chance. 
46138	7415378	10.0	6.0	44321427	Shannon and were extremely cool and gracious hosts, would recommend.  
47395	190984	9.0	7.0	12934482	"Denise was a perfect host. She responded quickly on every question and really cared about us. And her friend offered us a guided tour though Seattle. 

We heard from people before our stay that Hillman City isn't the best place, but we didn't make thes experience. The bus station to downtown is directly in on the other side of the street, as well as a nice cafe. Next door is a nice bar, and a few blocks downtown you find some nice bars and restaurants. "
47396	190984	9.0	7.0	12958105	Denise is a friendly host and the room was nice and comfy.  Best of all, she provided a toothbrush along with the usual soap and shampoo - it so happens I'd forgotten mine.
47397	190984	9.0	7.0	13370620	"We had a good experience at Denise's place. The appartment is well renovated and well equiped. Denise is full of attention and gives good information, good tips to explore Seattle. She even gave us a lift to the airport on our way back at 5.00 in the morning which was so convenient for us and so much better than a taxi!
The area is not the best if you read or listen to others, but we didńt have any trouble. It is in development, and there is a good bar, a good coffee place, and the pizza just downstairs is good value too! If you go down the streets, about 10 min. walk to Columbia city, you will find plenty of places to eat, drink or shop. 
There's a bus just accross the street going directly to the city center-about 30min."
47398	190984	9.0	7.0	13627900	"From the moment I booked Denise's cozy flat she was nothing but responsive and helpful. She constantly checked in with me to make sure I was doing OK. I spent the entire week as her guest and it couldn't have been better. The flat was charming and cozy, the location was great for me as I needed to take meetings all over the city and access was great to everything from here. From the flat you are close to I-90 (10min) I-5 (8min), downtown Seattle (15min), the airport (18 min), Light Rail (Columbia City) and Lake Washington/Seward Park (8min). 

Columbia City/Hilmam City are cool up-incoming neighborhoods with eclectic new restaurants, bars, shops etc. Tim Umbrella Coffee is right across the street - great coffee, wonderful staff, the shop is cozy with plenty of places to sit and work, free wifi. Right underneath the loft there is bar/restaurant, pizza place and other little boutique shops. All the businesses on the block have a neighborhood vibe and thus it's pretty quite and welcoming. There is tons of free parking and Denise even provides a parking stall off the street in the back of the building which is great. 

I hope to be back as I travel to Seattle frequently for business. Thanks Denise!"
47399	190984	9.0	7.0	14434826	Denise gets an A+ rating as a host.  The studio apt. was immaculate and exactly as pictured.  We loved it.  What we did not love was the absence of wifi, the steep steps up to the apt (we are seniors!) and the difficult parking lot which became quite jammed up on Saturday night.  The Union Bar on the street below was great with a great youngish crowd - definitely an asset to have a beer or eat.  Besides the parking lot issue, the street the apartment is on is not the best and may make some people uncomfortable.  Despite all that we loved the host and the apt. and would highly recommend it to any younger people traveling.  Denise was a great host and made it to easy to get keys and to leave keys. 
47400	190984	9.0	7.0	14689223	The apartment was nice and clean. It was conveniently located near Columbia City. Denise was very thoughtful and checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Thanks for hosting!
47401	190984	9.0	7.0	15060794	"Apartment was very nice; exactly as it appears in the photo. And Denise & her son were very accommodating. 

Apartment is a bit out of the way, however, if your goal is to be centrally located in Seattle. It's about 1/2 mile walk into Columbia City, which has a number of interesting bars, restaurants & shops. But the light rail station is not in walking distance, so not sure how you'd get downtown if you didn't have a car (it's about 20 min by car, depending on traffic). Perhaps buses are easy. I didn't try that route. So location might be a consideration, depending on your situation.

On the negative side, however, the building in which the apartment is located feels very sketchy. You enter from a door on the street and climb a set of very steep stairs. (This is not a place for anyone with mobility issues!) The entry way is dingy and dirty; carpet on the steps is stained and torn.  At the top of the stairs, you enter through another door into a shabby hallway with an apartment and roof access on the left (no roof top terrace here, folks, just discarded junk). You then pass by several empty rooms on the right before coming to the door of the apartment. Access from the back parking lot via a narrow passage between two buildings is also a little sketchy. 

Once you enter the actual apartment, everything is clean and well taken care of. Bed was comfy, and room was quiet. Bathroom and kitchen were well stocked. The space is, in fact, quite charming. Despite the surroundings, I enjoyed my time in the apartment.

So what is the bottom line? Although some might view the surroundings as adding character, and it does in a way, I would not recommend this place for the faint of heart. I think the process of entering and exiting the apartment would just be too unnerving. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, however, then you will likely find the accommodations very pleasant.  "
47402	190984	9.0	7.0	15211781	"Beware of this apartment, it is in a transitional part of town quite far outside the city center and my boyfriend and I felt so unsafe upon arrival that we cancelled our stay and got a hotel closer to Seattle. It is dirty, dingy, and in a very run down area, also the apartment is very loud and there is at least 4-5 children living in the apartment next door as well as a loud trash pick up area outside the bathroom window. Do yourself a favor and stay in a better neighboring area, we couldn't even stay one night. The owner even told us when we asked if the area was safe to ""keep our wits about us and don't look like we don't know the area."" After that we left immediately. Do not stay here!  "

Thanks again Denise!"
47407	190984	9.0	7.0	16532977	"Denise met me about an hour before check-in so I could drop off my bags. This listing was everything promised - private entry, a comfortable bed and a super-convenient location for getting to downtown Seattle.

The space felt like a home, and I also enjoyed the way it was decorated - posters of beatlemania and Paul McCartney, and a frame by frame photo series of the demolition of the Kingdome.

If I were to return to Seattle, I'd happily return and stay here again."

47411	190984	9.0	7.0	17524757	I was not able to stay in this unit due to some flooding so I can't give it a review. I found out when I arrived, and Denise offered me a makeshift unit instead. It was not the best of circumstances but at that point there weren't a lot of options. Denise was very nice and helpful with anything I needed, as were the people in neighbouring units. The area was great and close to columbia city that also had some good food options. It was at least a 30 minute long bus ride to get to the downtown area but the bus was right across the street and not a problem for me.
47412	190984	9.0	7.0	20066617	The flat was as expected and described. We had a great time in Seattle and Denise was there on time to provide us with keys. It's not the most ideal location for exploring but the train station has good connections and is only 15mins away. 
47413	190984	9.0	7.0	21446710	The experience was great and Denise was an amazing host.
47414	190984	9.0	7.0	22349921	The apartment is just as it looks in the picture. This was the perfect place for our family while our home was being remodeled! It had everything we needed. Denise was very accommodating and we couldn't have asked for more!
47415	190984	9.0	7.0	24337708	The listing was exactly as the picture shows.  Great location for us because it was five minutes from my daughter's house.  The neighborhood was close to Columbia City where there are many nice restaurants and pubs. We met Denise upon arrival and left our bags there while she got the unit ready, we were early.  There is a supermarket close by and coffee shops.  Denise called to make sure everything was OK and took care of any problem we might have.
47416	190984	9.0	7.0	24948628	Despite the cold and rain outside, the apartment was spacious and warm.  The bed is very comfortable and Denise made our entire visit very easy and accommodating. 
47417	190984	9.0	7.0	25179470	My host was prompt in answering my questions through email and came out to greet me at the property even though I arrived close to 11 pm. The room and bath are large and spacious and well-cleaned. The apartment is a part of a larger complex with several other empty large rooms used for storage. Wi-fi is only available through nearby pizza restaurant or neighbor. So be sure to ask ahead of time, Good coffee across the street, but no grocery or drug store within walking distance. So bring all you need.
47418	190984	9.0	7.0	26346517	"There was some confusion with meeting Denise--phone/email tag and whatnot.  Once I arrived later in the evening, the bar beneath the apartment was in full swing which would have been fine if I wasn't planning on staying with my infant daughter.  The space, although very clean, also, smelled strongly of cigarette smoke.  These issues, along with the many steep stairs required to enter the space, precluded us from staying there.  When I let Denise know my issues, she did agree to refund part of the charge.
"
47419	190984	9.0	7.0	26937195	Denise is awesome! She was prompt at meeting me at the time that was convenient for me. Place is very spacious and loved how intimate is was.

47420	190984	9.0	7.0	29631336	Denise was very welcoming and attentive to our needs, available at a moment's notice with  just a phone call. Would highly recommend her clean and charming space for your stay. With a warm and personable host, what more could you ask for? Thanks, Denise! 
47421	190984	9.0	7.0	30224051	"My husband is the one who stayed at this property, but I booked it for him. So this is his review:
Denise Gloster’s apartment was perfect for my stay in Seattle. It’s a recently re-done, very fresh studio apartment located in a convenient spot in Hillman City. It has everything you need for a nice stay. There’s a fully equipped kitchen for those who want to eat in. It has its own parking in the back but there is also public transportation. The Hillman City area is nifty.

I used it as a base for visiting with my son who lives about 15 blocks north. I really couldn’t have asked for anything easier.

Denise is a great host. She lives very close and we were able to easily and quickly meet for her to give me the keys and a tour of the apartment’s features.

I plan to stay here again.

The place itself was perfect for my needs, as I only really stayed there to wind down and get to bed after days of exploring the city.  The bar underneath the apartment is also a great place to get some good food and drinks.  While first a little skeptical, what with this being my first time, the place really grew on me. Definitely a good spot if you ever head to Seattle.
47428	190984	9.0	7.0	36291425	Denise was very friendly! We had a very awesome time in her apartment! Everything was perfect! Thank you so much for such a nice time!!! 
47429	190984	9.0	7.0	36713162	Denise was a great host. Had a great time in Seattle and dealing with such an accommodating person made it possible. 
47430	190984	9.0	7.0	36957839	"This was the perfect location for visiting my friend in Columbia City. Denise met me at the apartment to exchange the keys and was very friendly. Check-in and check-out was a breeze. The apartment looks exactly like the photos: clean, neat, and I love the exposed brick walls! It looks like it has a well equipped kitchen but since I had a friend nearby I didn't use the kitchen for more than drinking glasses/wine glasses. There is a great coffee shop right across the street which I went to every morning and the Columbia City neighborhood just north of Hillman has great options for dining. 

Seattle was going through a crazy heat wave (high 80s to 90+!) when I was there so like all houses in Seattle, it was hot. Denise had a fan in the apartment and checked in on me to make sure I was surviving which was very nice. If you need air conditioning in Seattle, you'll likely only find it in a big hotel chain. Seattle just isn't designed for heat! "
47431	190984	9.0	7.0	37481877	Denise was very responsive to our questions and needs. The apartment was conveniently located and very quiet and private for being near a busy street.  It was great to have dedicated parking.  We were in town for a family event, so most of our time was spent with family, and we spent relatively little time in the apartment.
47432	190984	9.0	7.0	37951518	"My friend and I booked this apartment months in advance and were able to contact Denise many times to ask questions or just checkin. I live in WV and I wanted to make sure the experience was a good one. She was available and quick to respond.

We could not have been happier! The apartment was exactly as described. It is an obviously urban area, but at no time were we uncomfortable or feel unsafe. The bus stop is just across the street, as Denise informed us, and runs often. There are many options for dining and drinks, including the Union Bar downstairs, where we enjoyed a fantastic meal. 

Denise and her associate made sure there were many personal touches available,  and this was so greatly appreciated. We were able to relax and enjoy ourselves immensely. There were also some travel size toiletries that were appreciated, as I forgot my toothpaste! 

The neighborhood is pretty quiet. We were not disturbed by noises outside, even though we had the windows open the entire three-night stay (Thur p.m.-Sun a.m.)

The bed and chair are comfy, the exposed brick and prints on the wall make it feel funky and charming. The kitchen is well-stocked and we were able to cook for ourselves as well as order delivery. Denise provided a fan (there was a bit of heat in the first 2 days!) which we appreciated!

Thank you, Denise for such a great experience. This was a trip of a lifetime for me, and our stay here was exceptional!"
47433	190984	9.0	7.0	38611961	Great experience! Clean, comfortable, and cozy. Denise made sure we were definitely comfy during our stay! Loved it!
47434	190984	9.0	7.0	39185079	My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay in the studio apartment. It was very clean and roomy, very nice. Denise was easy to contact and quick to reply to my questions. She even checked in on us to make sure our stay was comfortable. It happened to be an exceptionally hot few days during our stay. Denise was so kind as to have a new portable air conditioner installed for us by Istvan. We were so thankful!! The apartment was within walking distance to good restaurants, bakeries, a small park, etc.  It wasn't far from all of the major tourist sites as well. It was definitely a good choice for us :-)
47435	190984	9.0	7.0	39631445	We didn't get the chance to meet Dennise personally and met one of her associates instead. The place was as pictured and very clean and well equipped with anything you would need. Wifi was not good - didn't work for us most of the time - I think it was the wifi from the pizza place below? The unit itself was up a very dark and a bit sketchy stairwell - I think the light was burnt out when we got there. The location makes it easy to get to and from downtown but I wouldn't say it's the best location - not the same vibe as you get being downtown or in a neighbourhood like Ballard. Columbia city is a great little area nearby though, and Seward Park is definitely worth checking out - very close! Denise was quick to respond to texts but we did have a hard time setting up a time and place to meet beforehand and unfortunately had to use long distance texts to make arrangements, but it worked out in the end! Overall we were happy with our stay and the price is hard to find anywhere else in Seattle!
47436	190984	9.0	7.0	39959271	Neighborhood and exterior of building is run down.  Very narrow staircase up to apt. was not mentioned in ad. Pictures of exterior and staircase would be meaning full to guests.
47437	190984	9.0	7.0	40227349	We arrived at the unit in the afternoon and were welcomed by Denise's associate who showed us up to the apartment. Once inside, we were excited to be staying in such a cool place. The apartment was exactly like the listing, and we loved the privacy and layout of the room. It was clean and comfortable. It was in a great location about 15 minutes outside of downtown. Easily accessible and had a nice area of restaurants in the same neighborhood. We would definitely recommend staying here! 
47438	190984	9.0	7.0	40654173	Really great place. Check-in was a breeze and everything was neat and tidy. Great coffee across the street! 
47439	190984	9.0	7.0	41083332	The apartment is exactly how it looks and is described on the website. Very nice and comfortable inside. The exterior and neighborhood are perhaps not the most tourist friendly, but we had no problems. It's a little far from everything if you are traveling without a car. The bar downstairs has great food and a cool vibe. We were able to walk about 10 minutes to the Colombia neighborhood and ate at an amazing Ethiopian restaurant. 
47440	190984	9.0	7.0	41398208	The host communicated well and someone was there to meet us. The large studio apartment itself was lovely, just like in the picture, very clean and well equipped. The neighborhood is not great, but there is a good coffee shop across the street and it is somewhat near some more interesting neighborhoods. There are a lot of stairs. Parking is good. 
47441	190984	9.0	7.0	41599739	Apartment is exactly as pictured, very clean and tidy. Denise responds quickly to any questions you may have. The drive to downtown was very quick and convenient for us which was fantastic and where we spent the majority of our time. Check in was easy and pleasant- Istvan and Alysha are awesome and friendly! The wifi connection was spotty on all of our devices but we were trying to cram a ton of sight-seeing into a tiny amount of time so it was a non-issue for us.
47442	190984	9.0	7.0	41976077	Very clean apartment. However get a car if you are staying here or take Übers... the neighborhood didn't fee very safe to walk around in if you are by yourself
47443	190984	9.0	7.0	42557612	I had a great stay in the studio: communication was very easy with Istvan, Denise's associate, and I would definitely stay here again.  Don't expect a stocked kitchen food-wise - there was only tea/coffee and some olive oil while I was there. The staircase/entry did leave a little to be desired but the actual apartment was very neat and clean. My one and only complaint was that there was no option provided for composting of food scraps, which should be available anywhere within Seattle city limits. 
47444	190984	9.0	7.0	44298303	"I'd recommend a couple to stay here and likely book it again if we stay in Seattle.
This was one of the best airbnb apartments we have stayed in. Really nicely laid out. Enough space in the room, kitchen and bathroom. Good internet connection etc...

The neighborhood felt like it was up and coming (but not totally great) with some nice places to eat. 
Distance wise it is not very close to downtown, but we had a rental car to help us get to places which I felt was necessary although we did see buses and trains not too far away. 
 "
47445	190984	9.0	7.0	45141710	The studio was nice! Clean and homely. It was a 15 minute walk to the lightrail and only ~$20 uber ride downtown. While I did not get the opportunity to meet Denise during my stay, her associate was very accommodating and helpful.
47664	4041868	7.0	6.0	26435469	The place was perfect for our group(5 guys) we go around and work everywhere and it's always nice to come back to comfortable beds. Also nice enough to deal with our ever changing schedules. Thanks again
47665	4041868	7.0	6.0	28093577	在方子出现问题时，凌晨两点房东还赶来解决问题，态度非常好。房子本身空调比较冷，晚上在客厅睡觉几乎不可能。电视没有特别多的电视台，壁炉也是装饰。房间挺不错的。
47666	4041868	7.0	6.0	28330813	"I will preface this review by saying the communications I had with Kim and Alan were pleasant.  They were quick in their communications and accomodating.  As hosts, I think they were very good to deal with, however, the condition of the property was not what we expected from the pictures.

The pictures make the property look sparkling, but it definitely requires some TLC, especially the outside, front porch/door, etc.  Indoors the unit appears to be partially renovated, and partially in need of renovation.  

Saying that, I want to be fair in my review.  It was definitely liveable and comfortable inside, however, because it was an older property we did have to deal with a couple of bugs, spiders, etc.  Not a huge deal, but these are things I consider when looking at reviews which is why I include them.

There is a lot of space, the beds were comfortable, and the living room was well put together.  The place is about 20 minutes out of downtown.  We would take an uber car into downtown and without traffic were paying less than $15.  With traffic it would be about $20, not bad at all.

The neighborhood is described as an ""up and coming"" neighborhood which means there is a range of nice and rundown houses.  We felt safe but it still has a ways to go before it becomes as trendy as it's predicted to be."
47667	4041868	7.0	6.0	29341565	My crew had a great experience at this property. Great communication from the host and everything was as described. I would stay in the future.
47668	4041868	7.0	6.0	32962605	The location was very good for us, within walking distance of family.  The neighborhood is run-down, but we felt safe.  I agree with the other reviewer that the house needs some attention inside and out.   Email communications with the host were prompt.  
47669	4041868	7.0	6.0	35947973	The place was perfect for our group, and it's always nice to come back to comfortable beds. The place was accessible to all of Seattle attractions. The owner is easy to talk to. Thanks Kim.
47670	4041868	7.0	6.0	45065638	"Kim was very responsive and answered my messages promptly. The entrance door was a pin lock, and we were given the access code the day before we arrived. We didn't have to arrange a time to meet with the owners, and could check-in anytime during the day, which was very convenient. 

The home was located at a small street in a older neighborhood that has seen better times. We arrived in the evening, and it was a little difficult navigating through dark streets. However, during our stay, we didn't experience any issues with the neighbors.

The entrance to the driveway is pretty narrow and steep, so vehicles with lower ground clearance should proceed with caution. There were 2 parking spaces inside the garage and a large drive way that can fit 2 or 3 more cars, which was great because we had 3 cars.

The house was clean and tidy. Two rooms up stairs with 3 beds, and 1 bedroom downstairs with 2 more beds. It was a tidy but old home, and the home really shows its age. There were many little things here and there that needs to be fixed up. Two out of the three room's window/bug screen were missing, and the screens in the dinning area + washroom had holes in it. The dishwasher was not functioning, and there was yellow water pooling at the bottom. It was fine when we closed it, but it smelled pretty bad when we first opened it.

It was great value for the distance from downtown Seattle considering the general cost of the area. There was nothing that happened during our stay where we needed to contact Kim. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay."
48879	4126284	9.0	7.0	19917736	Natalie was a welcoming and entertaining hostest with a cozy, colorful and clean home. She accommodated us on relatively short notice and helped with the booking. Her doggy was also a sweetheart. I would stay again! :)
48880	4126284	9.0	7.0	20310673	Natalie is a warm and welcoming host! We didn't see much of each other because we are on opposite schedules, but I got the feeling I could ask her for something if I had needed it. I was able to come and go as I pleased, which was really convenient. Her condo is very clean and spacious. Her dog is super sweet! I would stay with Natalie again in a heartbeat. 
48881	4126284	9.0	7.0	20535788	"Natalie was an excellent host. I highly recommend her. She was very welcoming, helpful and relaxed. The bedroom was clean and bright and the futon was comfortable. Her dog is very friendly and super cute. There is a train station only a short walk from her house which goes downtown.

We would stay here again and wish Natalie all the best."
48882	4126284	9.0	7.0	20791914	"The house was great and the host was kind. Everything was perfect.
It was a little bit of a walk to the train with a lot of luggage, but besides that it was in a nice location close to the city centre."
48883	4126284	9.0	7.0	22112155	"As someone who lived in the Seattle for a little over a year, I visited this area once in the summer before booking on Airbnb. It's an interesting area which is going through a period of  regeneration.

I stayed with Natalie and James for 3 weeks and spent most of my time at their place during the day and was out in the evenings when they entertained. Both enjoy cooking and entertaining and though their house is a good size, you'll know when others are home. The bedroom is located on the 3rd floor across the hall from the master bedroom. There is street parking which is readily available.

One thing to be aware of is that this location is 10-15 minutes to downtown Seattle and having a car is definitely a must if you want to get anywhere quickly. I would definitely recommend Natalie's place. Their dog loves attention and both Natalie and James are friendly hosts. "
48884	4126284	9.0	7.0	22247038	The unit of Natalie fits perfectly with what we expected when we arrived in Seattle. Her house is very well located, clean and spacious. Great place, we really recommend! 
48885	4126284	9.0	7.0	50403373	The house is lovely and good location. Shampoo and body wash are provided in the bathroom. Very clean room. The host is very busy, we didn't get to see her. She changed her plans of going back home at our last night without informing us. And no replies of message. The room we stayed is small but spacious(there r 2 airbnb rooms in floor 3) without curtain that covers the sunshine(just some pieces of gauze). 
53278	9157232	8.0	6.0	54285007	Tania and her father a veer accommodating. Tania father is very knowledgable about the area and gave me some great advice. The hostess quickly responded to my text. Very kind and honest host. Room is comfortable and the full kitchen is a nice addition.  I would recommend a stay with Tania anytime. 
59646	5637990	6.0	7.0	46003248	The house was great. We weren't able to meet April but that was because we arrived very late in the night. The house has a coded lock so no key was needed. The location of the house was perfect for our Labor Day weekend vacation. It was a quick drive to Seattle center and pikes place market. The only bothersome thing I can think of that might turn a person away from this great home was the long flight of stairs you need to walk up to get to the home. We didn't mind it much. But I can see how some might have some trouble. 
59647	5637990	6.0	7.0	54822076	"I stayed in April house with my daughter and her 2 friends are a trip to explore Universities in the Pacific Northwest.  The house was in the perfect location and the view was fantastic.  The girls loved having the entire downstairs and I enjoyed the guest bedroom.  The house was warm and cozy and felt like home to us for 2 days.  It was a little bit difficult to find the staircase originally, but it only took once.  Thank you for such a great stay and for getting back to us so quickly about where the closest store was and anything else that we inquired about.  We would absolutely stay there again. 
"
59648	5637990	6.0	7.0	55398072	"Minimum Hospitality standards were not met. There was no welcoming material or information other then a text stating that the sheets were changed and where we could find clean towels.
Neither the kitchen or bathroom trash had been emptied. The dishwasher had dirty dishes in it and used coffee grinds were left in the coffee maker. The kitchen counters and stove top were stained and dirty as were the counter tops in both bathrooms. Personal toilet articles (toothbrushes, make up, used soap, shampoo and conditioner) were left out on the bathroom counters and in the showers. The dining 
room table still had crumbs on it and we had to clean the living room sofa table with windex in order to even utilize the that room.

It appears that little or no effort was made to clean or otherwise make the residence hospitable for guests, especially paying guests. These conditions made for a most uncomfortable stay.  "
67085	4951079	6.0	6.0	36297789	"I enjoyed my stay at Siri's residence. Overall I had a great experience, and felt very welcomed. The family respected my privacy and allowed me to set the tone for how much I wanted to interact. The space itself is just like the pictures and well cared for. The kitchen, lounge area and bathroom are shared space with other potential renters. I don't think that was clear to me when I originally looked at the room. It's a good idea to ask if anyone else will be occupying the space while you are there. I had no problem with sharing the space, my roommates were friendly and respectful. The location is close to several bus routes as described, but it is a decent distance from downtown. You have to take a 30 min bus ride if you plan to travel to the U-district or downtown. I would recommend staying at Siri's airbnb and I would consider staying there again for future trips. However, I would advise you to speak with Siri first and discuss the schedule of her family and the other possible renters in advance. At times there can be a lot going on so you should be fully prepared for that ahead of time. 
"
67179	8061699	10.0	6.0	46648932	The room was pleasant and looks just like the picture.  There is a big closet with a place for clothes.  I like a chilly room, so the window fan was a plus.  Seattle weather is warm during the day and cool at night, so the fan was perfect.  Diana has a lovely home, and she is welcoming.  Street parking is no problem.  There is a Safeway a block away for groceries and coffee and a cute shopping area  10 short blocks away.  
69908	5104077	9.0	7.0	38843772	geraldine was not in town when we arrived, but her daughter who lives on the property, in a separate house, was and she was very accommodating.  she was always available by at least by text (and often by phone), and when we needed something she was apt to respond.  I didn't ask about A/C - which I probably should have (but didn't think about); fortunately the week we stayed was cool enough (and there were fans in every bedroom) that it ended up not mattering.  the neighborhood is a normal neighborhood, with a grocery store closeby, a few good restaurants within walking distance, and even a lovely thursday evening farmer's market that we were able to walk to.  if you're looking to get to downtown seattle (we went to the zoo, space needle, aquarium, pike place, ferries, etc) then understand that you are at the north end of town and will need to get on I-5, at some point, to get where you're going (and I-5 is usually full of traffic).  if you have time and don't mind the drive, then it's a nice quiet area.  the house next door is a but in shambles, but other than that sore spot it's a nice enough neighborhood. (and you can't see it once you're on the property/in the house). the house itself is quite appropriate - 3 bedrooms, 1 bathroom (w tub and shower), kitchen w all you need (even coffee and creamer!), washer/dryer, living room, kitchen table, and cute deck. the TV is only set up for DVDs, but really if you're in seattle on vacation, you're not going to sit and watch TV anyway (unless you have little kids that need a break).  it fit what we needed for our family trip. 
69909	5104077	9.0	7.0	39395613	We enjoyed our stay. Plenty of room for our family. Large yard for kids to room. Very clean home. 
69910	5104077	9.0	7.0	40098035	Despite being near the northern edge of the city of Seattle, this location served our needs well because our daughter lives only a short ten-minute drive away.  The house was delightful with a well-stocked kitchen (with tools one does not normally find in a rental).  The walls featured many works of original art which make the decor unique.    The house was also replete with interesting books.  The beds were very comfortable.  The shower was a bit quirky, and the water pressure was a bit low but adequate.  We admired the backyard but, due to Seattle's legendary rain, we were unable to enjoy it to its fullest.  Overall, it was a cozy locale for spending time with our adult children.
70669	1022135	9.0	7.0	5236371	"Sara is just a superb host with a beautiful house.  Located in North Seattle, with easy access to 5 to go north or  downtown and parts south, a few minutes from Green Lake, a quick ride to Ballard and Fremont, and easy access to Lake Washington, 520 and east. Parking is easy and abundant.  You feel like you are a 10 minute drive from anywhere. 

Sara, who is a charming and fascinating person, has a wonderful open planned house.  The main floor consists of a nice living and dining room and kitchen, elegantly furnished and very warm and inviting.  Everything is clean, thoughtfully arranged, and truly reflects Sara's personality.

The guest bedroom is upstairs and faces west. A wonderful 18 inch thick natural futon on a platform bed is perfect and comforting, with oriental carved night stands. There is overhead, standing and reading lights.  With 10 foot ceilings, and massive windows, you get beautiful natural lighting.  The bathroom is very modern, with a new and modern shower, bathroom and toilet.  The room has a wonderful walk in closet as well.

Sara leaves little keepsakes and positive messages.  Throughout the house are inspirational messages, books, and art.  This is a person who is very insightful and has a great deal to share.  The house is quiet - there is no pressure to socialize and yet you feel like spending time to talk and reflect.  

This is a very special place, owned by a very special person, and serves as a perfect point to venture into Seattle. "
70670	1022135	9.0	7.0	5816580	"Sara is really a good and friendly host. Her house is very quiet and clean, and also close to the downtown.

I enjoy the days I stayed in Seattle!"
70671	1022135	9.0	7.0	5935410	Sara was very accommodating - booking us the same day for the weekend. Bathrooms needed cleaning & carpets needed a vacuum. But can't complain due to short notice and special offer. Area is not kid friendly, but her place is :)
70672	1022135	9.0	7.0	7164673	"Sara was a wonderful host! She is very friendly, fun, and quick to respond to messages.The house was cozy, clean, and full of inspirational notes that brightened my day. I stayed for about a month while I interned in the area and by the end it felt like home. The kitchen was also well-equipped and I had a lot of fun cooking there and sharing stories. 

I was able to get around without a car (there are two buses that stop close to the house that go to Fremont/Downtown Seattle) but I recommend driving at night since it can be a bit of a trip depending on where you're going. 

Thanks Sara! I recommend.

The bus to downtown is round the corner from the property, and it takes about 20 mins. We had no trouble getting around from here. Uber is a great app, and not too expensive to use for transport if you don't want to take the bus. 

We found a good breakfast place nearby called Youngs. It does pancakes and all the good breakfast stuff, and is also a Chinese restaurant. Friendly staff and great food. (website hidden)

74514	6019762	9.0	7.0	38020732	Jimmy's house was charming and eclectic.  It has the amenities we wanted. It is a 15 minute drive to downtown as he mentioned online.  If your goal is to relax and veg on your vacation, and you don't mind the drive to restaurants and shops, then, I recommend Jimmy's place.  While we didn't get a chance to meet Jimmy when we arrived as he was out of town, he was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to emails. He also prepared a thorough list of his House Manual which made everything easy. Thank you, Jimmy! :)
