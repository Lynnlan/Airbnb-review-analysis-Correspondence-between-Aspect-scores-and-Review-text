      "The kitchen was dirty—not only the dishes and pots, but also the insides of the drawers, fridge and freezer.\\r\\n\n",
      "Simply put, it was filthy.\n",
      "The tub needed a good scrubbing, the rubber mat was mildewed, and dusty soap scum covered everything.\n",

      "Others are aesthetic: consolidate single toiletry bottles (or buy a new $3 bottle of Suave every guest stay or two), toss the dead plants on the fire escape, use white/clear bulbs, paint over ceiling stains instead of smearing a dirty cloth over them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\n",
      "But, the unit itself was very dirty and didn't feel like it had been cleaned in a while.\n",
