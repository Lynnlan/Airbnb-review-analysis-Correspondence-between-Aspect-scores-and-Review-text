# Airbnb-review-analysis-Correspondence-between-Aspect-scores-and-Review-text

This is the coding part of my master paper.

My paper proposes a methodology for finding the correspondence between aspect scores of Airbnb homes and the sentiments of their reviews. 
I set the sentiment analysis at the sentence level and proposed a sentence-to-aspect relevance detection approach for subjectivity classification step. 
The distributions of the sentiment polarities found in aspect-relevant for both the cleanliness and the location aspect show an apparent correspondence between review text and the aspect score.
